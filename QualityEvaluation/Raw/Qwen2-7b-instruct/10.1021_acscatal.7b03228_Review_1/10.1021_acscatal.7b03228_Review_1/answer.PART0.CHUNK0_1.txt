[1] "Such changes in adsorbate configuration can have profound effects on what reactions may occur."
[2] "First, as shown in Figure 2, by a change in the electronic structure, the binding energy of propene to the surface is weakened, resulting in desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur."
[3] "Second, the activation barrier for CC bond cleavage is higher due to the lack of the appropriate 3-fold hollow sites on the PdZn surface."
[4] "It is interesting to ponder what the critical ensemble size would be for a given adsorption or reaction event."
[5] "In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface."
[6] "This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
[7] "First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild."
[8] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
[9] "For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide."
[10] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy."
[11] "In many cases, the presence of the modifier can change the adsorption configuration of the reactant."
[12] "The modifiers must be thermally stable well above the reaction temperature of interest and preferably stable in the presence of air/water so that they are sufficiently robust."

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering both the electronic structure and the geometric site available for reactions. By weakening the binding energy of the adsorbate, desorption occurs before further dehydrogenation can happen. Additionally, the lack of appropriate 3-fold hollow sites on the PdZn surface increases the activation barrier for carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage. The critical ensemble size for a given adsorption or reaction event is yet to be determined. In selective hydrogenation, Pd atoms embedded in a Cu surface can reduce the barrier for hydrogen dissociation, breaking Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi scaling rules, and thus allowing for departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Successful SAA catalysts must meet three main criteria: mild reaction temperatures, avoiding reactive environments that can lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. Modifiers, such as sulfur, chlorine, and alkali metals, can locally modify the electronic structure and block certain potential adsorption sites, potentially changing the adsorption configuration of the reactant.

单原子合金，尤其是嵌入在铜表面的钯原子，通过改变电子结构和可用的反应位点来增强选择性氢化反应的催化性能。通过减弱吸附剂的结合能，可以在进一步脱氢之前实现脱附。此外，在PdZn表面上缺乏合适的3个空位导致碳-碳（CC）键断裂的活化势垒增加。对于给定的吸附或反应事件的关键团簇大小尚未确定。在选择性氢化中，嵌入在铜表面的钯原子可以降低氢解离的壁垒，打破Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi缩放规则，并允许从纯电子结构描述催化作用的偏移。成功的SAA催化剂必须满足三个主要标准：温和的反应温度、避免可能导致金属分离的活性环境、以及选择能够利用单原子合金创建的几何位点的反应。修改器，如硫、氯和碱金属，可以通过局部修改电子结构并阻断某些潜在吸附位点来调整电子结构，可能改变反应物的吸附配置。
