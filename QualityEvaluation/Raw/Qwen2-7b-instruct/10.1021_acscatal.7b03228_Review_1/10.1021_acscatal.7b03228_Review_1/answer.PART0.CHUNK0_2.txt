[1] "One interesting aspect of intermetallic compounds is that, by altering the composition slightly, different types of ensembles can be created."
[2] "For example, Feng et al. have shown that moving from PdIn to Pd3In results in a change in the Pd ensemble size from single isolated Pd atoms to Pd trimers."
[3] "This structural change results in a loss of selectivity from 92% to 21% C2H4 in acetylene semihydrogenation."
[4] "In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface."
[5] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111))."
[6] "Breaking these scaling rules through a geometric effect (changing the active site) allows departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis."
[7] "In agreement with this prediction, the desorption temperature (manifested as the barrier to associationthe reverse of the dissociation process) dropped dramatically from 310 K on Cu(111) to about 220 K on 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) (and even lower to 180 K on 0.1 ML Pd/Cu(111))."
[8] "More recently, Boucher et al. extended this approach to nanoparticles by galvanic replacement of Cu with Pd, demonstrating selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene at a Cu:Pd ratio of 80:1."
[9] "Similar work presented by Louis and co-workers which examined the selective hydrogenation of butadiene over AuPd catalysts (31) and by Aich et al. which examined the selective hydrogenation of acrolein to allyl alcohol over PdAu catalysts (32) also invoked the idea of single Pd atoms allowing for a much greater selectivity to the desired products, whereas contiguous Pd atoms led to unselective hydrogenation."
[10] "First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild."
[11] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
[12] "For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide."
[13] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy."
[14] "In many cases, the presence of the modifier can change the adsorption configuration of the reactant."
[15] "The role of the modifier can even be an active one whereby the reactant interacts favorably with the modifier such that it adopts a more favorable adsorption geometry."
[16] "The modifiers must be thermally stable well above the reaction temperature of interest and preferably stable in the presence of air/water so that they are sufficiently robust."
[17] "In addition, the modifier coverage must be appropriately tuned such that the surface is adequately accessible to potential adsorbates."

Answer: Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by breaking Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi scaling rules through geometric effects. These alloys allow for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis, leading to improved selectivity. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:
1. Mild reaction temperatures to prevent significant metal-metal diffusion and aggregation.
2. Avoidance of reactive environments that can result in metal segregation.
3. Selection of reactions that can benefit from the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy.
4. Modifiers that are thermally stable and stable in the presence of air/water, with appropriate tuning of coverage to maintain accessibility to potential adsorbates.

答案：单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，在选择性氢化反应中通过几何效应打破Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi缩放规则，从而增强催化性能。这些合金允许从纯电子结构描述催化作用的偏离，导致提高选择性。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括：
1. 温和的反应温度以防止显著的金属-金属扩散和聚集。
2. 避免可能导致金属分离的反应环境。
3. 选择能够利用单原子合金创建的几何位置的反应。
4. 热稳定且在空气/水中稳定的修饰剂，覆盖范围适当调整以保持潜在吸附剂的可接近性。
