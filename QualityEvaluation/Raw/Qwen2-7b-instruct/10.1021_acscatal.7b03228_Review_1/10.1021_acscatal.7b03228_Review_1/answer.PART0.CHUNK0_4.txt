[1] "One interesting aspect of intermetallic compounds is that, by altering the composition slightly, different types of ensembles can be created."
[2] "For example, Feng et al. have shown that moving from PdIn to Pd3In results in a change in the Pd ensemble size from single isolated Pd atoms to Pd trimers."
[3] "In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface."
[4] "This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
[5] "It should be mentioned that another pathway toward steering both geometry and electronic structure has emerged through coadsorbates that act as structural modifiers."
[6] "In many cases, the presence of the modifier can change the adsorption configuration of the reactant."

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier, breaking from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules, and providing a geometric effect that allows departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include mild reaction temperatures, avoiding reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal, and ensuring the reaction can take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This typically implies that structure-sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful. Additionally, thermally stable modifiers that are appropriately tuned can further improve selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

单原子合金，特别是嵌入在Cu表面的Pd原子，在选择性氢化反应中通过改变反应焓和反应势垒、打破BrnstedEvansPolanyi缩放规则以及提供几何效应，使催化性能得到增强。这允许从纯电子结构描述催化作用中偏离。设计成功SAA催化剂的关键标准包括温和的反应温度、避免可能导致金属分离的活性环境，并确保所选反应能够利用由单原子合金提供的几何位点。这通常意味着结构敏感的反应更有可能成功。此外，需要热稳定性高、适当调谐的修饰剂来进一步提高功能化烃类氢化反应的选择性。
