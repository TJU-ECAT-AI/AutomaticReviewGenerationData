1. Elemental Pd catalysts have high activity but a low selectivity for ethylene due to the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst. The active-site-isolation concept was developed to spatially separate adsorption centers, favoring the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond. Gallium (Ga) forms intermetallic compounds with Pd, offering a unique structure that contrasts with traditional transition metal promoters. Knowledge of the reaction kinetics is crucial for understanding selective hydrogenation on the GaPd2 catalyst. GaPd2 exhibits a positive reaction order with respect to acetylene at 2008C, making it a highly selective and stable catalyst for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.

1. 元素钯催化剂的活性较高，但乙炔选择性仅为20%，这由催化剂的电子和几何结构决定。开发了活性位点隔离概念，旨在将吸附中心空间分离，以有利于乙炔在p键上的吸附。镓（Ga）与钯形成具有明确晶体结构的互金属化合物，与常用的过渡金属促进剂形成的取代合金形成鲜明对比。了解反应动力学对于理解此催化材料上的选择性氢化至关重要。GaPd2显示了在2008C时对乙炔的正反应顺序，使其成为半氢化乙炔的高选择性和稳定的催化剂。
