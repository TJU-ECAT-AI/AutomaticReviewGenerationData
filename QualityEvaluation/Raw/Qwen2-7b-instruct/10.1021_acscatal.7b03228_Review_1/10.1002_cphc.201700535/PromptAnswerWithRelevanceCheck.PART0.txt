1. Elemental Pd catalysts have high activity but a low selectivity for ethylene due to the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst. The active-site-isolation concept was developed to spatially separate adsorption centers, favoring the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond. Gallium (Ga) forms intermetallic compounds with Pd, offering a unique structure that contrasts with traditional transition metal promoters. Knowledge of the reaction kinetics is crucial for understanding selective hydrogenation on the GaPd2 catalyst. GaPd2 exhibits a positive reaction order with respect to acetylene at 2008C, making it a highly selective and stable catalyst for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.

The document highlights that single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through the active-site-isolation concept. This concept requires spatial separation of adsorption centers to favorably adsorb acetylene at a p bond, which is unfavorable when the distance between centers is too small. This approach leads to a catalyst, GaPd2, that is highly selective and stable for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. The essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include ensuring the spatial separation of active sites, which improves selectivity, and employing metals that form well-defined crystal structures rather than substitutional alloys. Compared to traditional catalysts, SAAs often break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems.

The key factors influencing the extent of acetylene conversion, specific activity, and selectivity to ethylene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons are temperature and pressure. These factors are crucial in optimizing the operation for achieving high ethylene yields. The reaction kinetics on GaPd2 show a positive reaction order (0.89) with respect to acetylene at 200°C, which is different from experimental results obtained for GaPd, indicating unique reactivity patterns in these binary catalyst materials.

文档指出，单原子合金，尤其是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，在选择性氢化反应中提高了催化性能，通过活性位点隔离概念。这一概念要求活性位点的空间分离，以有利于在p键上吸附乙炔，这在中心之间的距离过小时是不利的。这种方法导致了一种催化剂GaPd2，它对于乙炔的半氢化具有高度的选择性和稳定性。设计成功的单原子合金(SAA)催化剂的关键标准包括确保活性位点的空间分离，从而提高选择性，并采用形成明确晶体结构的金属而不是替代合金。与传统催化剂相比，SAAs通常打破了缩放规则并改善了各种催化剂系统的选择性。

影响乙炔转化程度、特定活性和乙烯、乙烷和更高级烃选择性的关键因素是温度和压力。这些因素在优化操作以实现高乙烯产率方面至关重要。在GaPd2上的反应动力学显示了对乙炔的正反应顺序（0.89）在200°C，这与从GaPd获得的实验结果不同，表明这两种二元催化剂材料的反应动力学模式存在差异。

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing spatially separated active sites that favor the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include ensuring that the adsorption centers are spatially separated to favor acetylene adsorption at a p bond. Traditional catalysts may lack this feature, leading to unwanted side reactions. The use of Ga as a promoter in intermetallic compounds with Pd creates a highly selective and stable catalyst for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. The binary compound GaPd2 shows a positive reaction order with respect to acetylene, indicating improved selectivity compared to other catalysts.

2. The ability of single-atom alloys to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems lies in their unique structure, which allows for spatially separated active sites. These sites enable more efficient and selective adsorption of reactants, leading to higher yields of desired products. The key advantages over traditional catalysts include enhanced selectivity, stability, and efficiency, often achieved through the precise control of surface chemistry and geometry provided by single-atom alloys.

1. Single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing active sites that are spatially separated, allowing acetylene to be adsorbed at a p bond rather than undergoing full hydrogenation to ethane or forming higher hydrocarbons. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include understanding the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst, ensuring the active sites are isolated, and selecting appropriate support materials. Pd alloys often struggle with achieving high selectivity for ethylene due to the geometric arrangement of Pd atoms, which can favor full hydrogenation. In contrast, GaPd2 offers a unique solution by forming well-defined crystal structures that spatially separate Pd atoms, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability.

2. The reaction order of H2 and C2H2 on GaPd2 versus GaPd differs, indicating that the interaction dynamics between these reactants and the catalyst surface are distinct for the two compounds. This difference in reaction kinetics suggests that the nature of the intermetallic compound affects the rates at which hydrogen and acetylene interact with the catalyst surface, potentially offering insights into optimizing the catalytic process for maximum efficiency and selectivity.

1. 单原子合金，尤其是Pd原子嵌入Cu表面，通过提供空间分离的活性位点，在选择性氢化反应中增强了催化性能，允许乙炔吸附在p键上，而不是完全氢化为乙烷或形成更高碳氢化合物。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括理解催化剂的电子和几何结构、确保活性位点分离以及选择合适的支撑材料。Pd合金在实现乙烯高选择性方面往往面临挑战，因为Pd原子的几何排列可能有利于完全氢化。相比之下，GaPd2通过形成具有明确晶体结构的化合物提供了独特解决方案，空间分离Pd原子，从而提高了选择性和稳定性。

2. GaPd2与GaPd对H2和C2H2的反应顺序不同，表明这两种化合物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用动力学存在差异。这种差异的反应动力学提示，不同性质的二元化合物影响氢和乙炔与催化剂表面的相互作用速率，可能为优化催化过程以实现最大效率和选择性提供洞察。
