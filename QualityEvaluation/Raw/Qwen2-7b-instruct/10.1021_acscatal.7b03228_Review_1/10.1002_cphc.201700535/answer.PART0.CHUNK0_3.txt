[1] "Classical catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene consist of finely dispersed Pd on Al2O3 or alloys of Pd with Ag or Au on the same support material."
[2] "As this reaction is also of high interest for basic research, other support materials such as carbon or different oxides such as SiO2 and TiO2 have been investigated."
[3] "In such elemental Pd or Pd alloy catalysts, each atom is surrounded by 12 other (Pd) atoms in the first coordination shell."
[4] "For selective hydrogenation of acetylene it is necessary that acetylene is adsorbed at a p bond on the surface, which is un-favorable if the distance between potential adsorption centers is too small."
[5] "This finding led to the development of the active-site-isolation concept, according to which the adsorption centers have to be spatially separated so that the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond is energetically favored."
[6] "GaPd2 is shown to be the first binary catalyst material, which shows a positive reaction order (0.89) with respect to acetylene at 200°C."
[7] "A comparison of the reaction kinetics on GaPd2 with experimental results obtained for GaPd reveals different orders of reaction of H2 and C2H2 on the two compounds."

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing spatially separated active sites that favor the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include ensuring that the adsorption centers are spatially separated to favor acetylene adsorption at a p bond. Traditional catalysts may lack this feature, leading to unwanted side reactions. The use of Ga as a promoter in intermetallic compounds with Pd creates a highly selective and stable catalyst for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. The binary compound GaPd2 shows a positive reaction order with respect to acetylene, indicating improved selectivity compared to other catalysts.

2. The ability of single-atom alloys to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems lies in their unique structure, which allows for spatially separated active sites. These sites enable more efficient and selective adsorption of reactants, leading to higher yields of desired products. The key advantages over traditional catalysts include enhanced selectivity, stability, and efficiency, often achieved through the precise control of surface chemistry and geometry provided by single-atom alloys.

1. 单原子合金，尤其是嵌入到Cu表面的Pd原子，在选择性氢化反应中通过提供空间上分离的活性位点来增强催化性能，这些位点有利于乙炔在p键上的吸附。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括确保吸附中心的空间分离，以利于乙炔在p键上的吸附。传统催化剂可能缺乏这一特性，导致发生不希望的副反应。将Ga用作Pd的促进剂，在二元化合物GaPd2中形成具有高度选择性和稳定性的催化剂，用于乙炔的半氢化反应。二元化合物GaPd2显示出对乙炔的正反应顺序，表明与其它催化剂相比，其具有更高的选择性。

2. 单原子合金能够打破缩放规则并提高各种催化剂系统的选择性的能力，基于它们独特的结构，允许空间上分离的活性位点。这些位点能够更有效地和选择性地吸附反应物，从而实现所需产品的更高产率。与传统催化剂相比，单原子合金的关键优势包括增强的选择性、稳定性和效率，通常通过精确控制表面化学和几何形状来实现。
