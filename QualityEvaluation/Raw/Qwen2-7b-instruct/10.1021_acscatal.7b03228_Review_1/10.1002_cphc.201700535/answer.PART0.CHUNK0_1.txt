<p>Classical catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene consist of finely dispersed Pd on Al2O3 or alloys of Pd with Ag or Au on the same support material.</p>
<p>As this reaction is also of high interest for basic research, other support materials such as carbon or different oxides such as SiO2 and TiO2 have been investigated.</p>
<p>The activity of elemental Pd catalysts is somewhat high but the selectivity for ethylene is limited to 20% at 2008C, which is determined by the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst.</p>
<p>For selective hydrogenation of acetylene it is necessary that acetylene is adsorbed at a p bond on the surface, which is un-favorable if the distance between potential adsorption centers is too small.</p>
<p>This finding led to the development of the active-site-isolation concept, according to which the adsorption centers have to be spatially separated so that the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond is energetically favored.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ga is not used as classical promoter.</p>
<p>Ga forms intermetallic compounds with Pd that possess well-defined crystal structures, which is contrary to the widespread formation of substitutional alloys using transition metal promoters.</p>
<p>Thus, the spatial separation of Pd atoms and the Intermetallic GaPd2 is a highly selective and stable catalyst for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the underlying reaction kinetics is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the selective hydrogenation on this catalytic material.</p>
<p>To date, there has been no experimental kinetic data published for this reaction on a well-defined intermetallic catalyst possessing isolated active sites.</p>

The document highlights that single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through the active-site-isolation concept. This concept requires spatial separation of adsorption centers to favorably adsorb acetylene at a p bond, which is unfavorable when the distance between centers is too small. This approach leads to a catalyst, GaPd2, that is highly selective and stable for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. The essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include ensuring the spatial separation of active sites, which improves selectivity, and employing metals that form well-defined crystal structures rather than substitutional alloys. Compared to traditional catalysts, SAAs often break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems.

The key factors influencing the extent of acetylene conversion, specific activity, and selectivity to ethylene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons are temperature and pressure. These factors are crucial in optimizing the operation for achieving high ethylene yields. The reaction kinetics on GaPd2 show a positive reaction order (0.89) with respect to acetylene at 200°C, which is different from experimental results obtained for GaPd, indicating unique reactivity patterns in these binary catalyst materials.

文档指出，单原子合金，尤其是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，在选择性氢化反应中提高了催化性能，通过活性位点隔离概念。这一概念要求活性位点的空间分离，以有利于在p键上吸附乙炔，这在中心之间的距离过小时是不利的。这种方法导致了一种催化剂GaPd2，它对于乙炔的半氢化具有高度的选择性和稳定性。设计成功的单原子合金(SAA)催化剂的关键标准包括确保活性位点的空间分离，从而提高选择性，并采用形成明确晶体结构的金属而不是替代合金。与传统催化剂相比，SAAs通常打破了缩放规则并改善了各种催化剂系统的选择性。

影响乙炔转化程度、特定活性和乙烯、乙烷和更高级烃选择性的关键因素是温度和压力。这些因素在优化操作以实现高乙烯产率方面至关重要。在GaPd2上的反应动力学显示了对乙炔的正反应顺序（0.89）在200°C，这与从GaPd获得的实验结果不同，表明这两种二元催化剂材料的反应动力学模式存在差异。
