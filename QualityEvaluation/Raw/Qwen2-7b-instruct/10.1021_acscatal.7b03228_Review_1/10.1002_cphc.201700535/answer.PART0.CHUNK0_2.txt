Answer: The kinetic parameters for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene on GaPd2 and GaPd were studied. The activation energy was found to be 29(2) kJ/mol when kinetic measurements were conducted at temperatures ranging from 140 to 200°C. GaPd2 demonstrated a positive reaction order of 0.89 with respect to acetylene at 200°C. The extent of acetylene conversion, specific activity, and selectivity towards ethylene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons were determined through a 24-factorial experiment following a design of experiments approach. Among these factors, temperature and pressure had the most significant influence. The outcomes enabled the optimization of operation for achieving high yields of ethylene. Moreover, it was observed that the reaction kinetics on GaPd2 differed from those on GaPd concerning the orders of reaction of hydrogen and acetylene.

答案：对镓钯2和镓钯上选择性氢化乙炔的热力学参数进行了研究。当在140至200°C的温度范围内进行动力学测量时，发现激活能为29(2) kJ/mol。镓钯2对于乙炔表现出0.89的正反应级数，在200°C下。通过遵循设计实验方法的24因子实验确定了乙炔转化程度、特定活性和乙炔、乙烷以及更高碳氢化合物的选择性的影响因素。其中，温度和压力的影响最大。结果允许实现高乙炔产率的最佳操作。此外，观察到镓钯2上的反应动力学与镓钯上的反应动力学在氢和乙炔的反应级数方面存在差异。
