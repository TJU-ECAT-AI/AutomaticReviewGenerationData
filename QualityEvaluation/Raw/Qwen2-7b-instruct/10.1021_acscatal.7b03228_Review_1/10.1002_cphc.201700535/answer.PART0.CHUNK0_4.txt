<p>Classical catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene consist of finely dispersed Pd on Al2O3 or alloys of Pd with Ag or Au on the same support material.</p>
<p>As this reaction is also of high interest for basic research, other support materials such as carbon or different oxides such as SiO2 and TiO2 have been investigated.</p>
<p>The activity of elemental Pd catalysts is somewhat high but the selectivity for ethylene is limited to 20% at 2008C, which is determined by the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst.</p>
<p>This finding led to the development of the active-site-isolation concept, according to which the adsorption centers have to be spatially separated so that the adsorption of acetylene at a p bond is energetically favored.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ga is not used as classical promoter.</p>
<p>GaPd2 is shown to be the first binary catalyst material, which shows a positive reaction order (0.89) with respect to acetylene at 2008C.</p>
<p>A comparison of the reaction kinetics on GaPd2 with experimental results obtained for GaPd reveals different orders of reaction of H2 and C2H2 on the two compounds.</p>

1. Single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing active sites that are spatially separated, allowing acetylene to be adsorbed at a p bond rather than undergoing full hydrogenation to ethane or forming higher hydrocarbons. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include understanding the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst, ensuring the active sites are isolated, and selecting appropriate support materials. Pd alloys often struggle with achieving high selectivity for ethylene due to the geometric arrangement of Pd atoms, which can favor full hydrogenation. In contrast, GaPd2 offers a unique solution by forming well-defined crystal structures that spatially separate Pd atoms, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability.

2. The reaction order of H2 and C2H2 on GaPd2 versus GaPd differs, indicating that the interaction dynamics between these reactants and the catalyst surface are distinct for the two compounds. This difference in reaction kinetics suggests that the nature of the intermetallic compound affects the rates at which hydrogen and acetylene interact with the catalyst surface, potentially offering insights into optimizing the catalytic process for maximum efficiency and selectivity.

1. 单原子合金，尤其是Pd原子嵌入Cu表面，通过提供空间分离的活性位点，在选择性氢化反应中增强了催化性能，允许乙炔吸附在p键上，而不是完全氢化为乙烷或形成更高碳氢化合物。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括理解催化剂的电子和几何结构、确保活性位点分离以及选择合适的支撑材料。Pd合金在实现乙烯高选择性方面往往面临挑战，因为Pd原子的几何排列可能有利于完全氢化。相比之下，GaPd2通过形成具有明确晶体结构的化合物提供了独特解决方案，空间分离Pd原子，从而提高了选择性和稳定性。

2. GaPd2与GaPd对H2和C2H2的反应顺序不同，表明这两种化合物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用动力学存在差异。这种差异的反应动力学提示，不同性质的二元化合物影响氢和乙炔与催化剂表面的相互作用速率，可能为优化催化过程以实现最大效率和选择性提供洞察。
