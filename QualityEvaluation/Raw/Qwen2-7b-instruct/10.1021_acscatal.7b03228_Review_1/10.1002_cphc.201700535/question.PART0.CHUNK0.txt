Kinetic Parameters for the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene on GaPd2 and GaPd Ren R. Zimmermann,[a] Tobias Hahn,[b] Wladimir Reschetilowski,[c] and Marc Armbrster*[a]
1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene is a widely used in- dustrial process for the purification of ethylene-rich streams that are obtained from hydrocracking of the naphtha fraction during the processing of crude oil.[1] Ethylene is mainly used for its polymerization to polyethylene or partial oxidation to ethylene oxide.[2] For these catalytic processes, the purity of the reactant stream must be high.[3] Therefore, the aim of a pu- rification step is the complete and selective hydrogenation of acetylene to the desired ethylene [Eq. (1)], whereas the subse- quent full hydrogenation to ethane [Eq. (2)] has to be avoided for economic reasons. Additionally, the unwanted side reac- tions [Eqs. (3) and (4)] can occur, leading to higher hydrocar- bons and lowering the ethylene yield: C2H2  H2 ! C2H4 DRH  174 kJ mol1 1 C2H4  H2 ! C2H6 DRH  136 kJ mol1 2 2 C2H2  x H2 ! C4H42x 3 C4H42x  n C2H2  y H2 ! carbonaceous deposits 4 Classical catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene consist of finely dispersed Pd on Al2O3 or alloys of Pd with Ag or Au on the same support material.[4] As this reaction is also of high interest for basic research, other support materials such as carbon or different oxides such as SiO2 and TiO2 have been investigated.[58] The activity of elemental Pd catalysts is somewhat high but the selectivity for ethylene is limited to 20% at 2008C, which is determined by the electronic and geo- metric structure of the catalyst.[9] In such elemental Pd or Pd alloy catalysts, each atom is surrounded by 12 other (Pd) atoms in the first coordination shell. Based on the resulting geometric arrangement of Pd atoms on the surface, it was shown that some geometries are clearly energetically favored for the adsorption of acetylene, resulting in the unwanted full hydrogenation to ethane and the formation of higher hydro- carbon species.[10] For selective hydrogenation of acetylene it is necessary that acetylene is adsorbed at a p bond on the surface, which is un- favorable if the distance between potential adsorption centers is too small.[11] This finding led to the development of the active-site-isolation concept, according to which the adsorp- tion centers have to be spatially separated so that the adsorp- tion of acetylene at a p bond is energetically favored.[11] The addition of promoters such as Ag, Au, Cu or Sn results in in- creased selectivity and greater long-term stability of the cata- lysts.[4,8,12,13] In contrast, Ga is not used as classical promot- er.[1319] Ga forms intermetallic compounds with Pd that possess well-defined crystal structures, which is contrary to the wide- spread formation of substitutional alloys using transition metal promoters. Thus, the spatial separation of Pd atoms and the Intermetallic GaPd2 is a highly selective and stable catalyst for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. Knowledge of the under- lying reaction kinetics is essential to gain a deeper understand- ing of the selective hydrogenation on this catalytic material. To date, there has been no experimental kinetic data published for this reaction on a well-defined intermetallic catalyst pos- sessing isolated active sites. Kinetic measurements are per- formed at 1402008C, revealing an apparent activation energy of 29(2) kJmol1. GaPd2 is shown to be the first binary catalyst material, which shows a positive reaction order (0.89) with re- spect to acetylene at 2008C. The influences on the extent of acetylene conversion, specific activity and selectivity to ethyl- ene, ethane, and higher hydrocarbons are determined by a 24 factorial experiment following a design of experiments ap- proach. Temperature and pressure have the strongest impact on these values. The results allow optimal operation for achiev- ing high ethylene yields. A comparison of the reaction kinetics on GaPd2 with experimental results obtained for GaPd reveals different orders of reaction of H2 and C2H2 on the two com- pounds.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
