<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously by Hammer and Nrskov that the binding of various adsorbates on metals (pure metals as well as alloys) can be explained with the d-band model of bonding.</p>
<p>For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals).</p>
<p>The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center.</p>
<p>For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center.</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>Since we arrived to identical conclusions for both families of alloys (Pt and Ni alloys), we discuss herein in detail the results for the Pt alloys.</p>
<p>When using the term alloy we refer to a partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element.</p>
<p>The adsorption energies for various adsorbates on the different model systems were calculated with respect to the corresponding gas phase energies (CO, O2 and H2) using first principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation.</p>
<p>The impact of the adsorption-induced dipole moment was minimized by applying a dipole correction.</p>
<p>The adsorbates and top two layers were allowed to relax until the total force on the atoms was less than 0.05 eV/Å.</p>
<p>The d-band density of states was determined by projection of the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals, with the cutoff radius at infinity.</p>
<p>The d-band center was calculated as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level, and the mean squared d-band width was calculated as the second moment.</p>
<p>To address which mechanism dominates the position of the d-band center in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of the local alloy sites, we measured the electronic structure in the neighborhood of the Fermi level for multiple Pt alloys (Pt/Cu, Pt/Ru, and Pt/Sn).</p>
<p>The measured Pt L3 EXAFS spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b.</p>
<p>The formation of the alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys.</p>
<p>There is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>The consequence of the above observations is that there exists a universal relationship between the width of the localized d-band and the local d-band center and therefore the local chemical reactivity.</p>
<p>Since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that the impact of the local geometry on the width of the d-band, localized on an atom in an alloy, can also be evaluated easily based on the tight bonding approximation.</p>
