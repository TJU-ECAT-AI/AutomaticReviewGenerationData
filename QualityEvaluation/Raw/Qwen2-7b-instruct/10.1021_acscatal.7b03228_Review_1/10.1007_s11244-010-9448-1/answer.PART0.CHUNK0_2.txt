<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site.</p>
<p>For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals).</p>
<p>The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center. For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center.</p>
<p>For example, for metals in a column in the periodic table of elements, the d-band filling is identical (same number of d electrons), while the spatial extent of d-orbitals increases from top to bottom of the column. The increased extent of d-orbitals yields a broader d-band which results in lower energy of the d-band center with respect to Fermi level and lower chemical reactivity for the metals at the bottom of the column.</p>
<p>Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band.</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>When using the term alloy we refer to a partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element.</p>
<p>The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below.</p>
<p>When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5.</p>
<p>Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons.</p>
<p>It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band.</p>

The study discusses the relationship between the geometric structure and chemical reactivity of alloy catalysts, particularly focusing on Pt alloys. It highlights that the chemical reactivity of sites in alloys can be predicted based on the width of the local density of d-states, which is influenced by the hybridization of d-orbitals and the absence of significant charge transfer between alloy elements. The model developed through the study of various Pt alloys suggests that the position of the d-band center, and thus the chemical reactivity, is determined by the width of the d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms forming the alloy. The study also mentions that the partitioning of the calculated ground state electron density shows shifts in s/p electron density, but these shifts have a lesser impact on chemical reactivity compared to changes in the d-band center. The findings imply that understanding the local electronic structure of alloy catalysts can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts, especially in selective hydrogenation reactions, by predicting and optimizing the chemical reactivity of specific sites within the alloy.

该研究探讨了合金催化剂的几何结构与化学活性之间的关系，特别是重点介绍了铂合金。它强调，合金中特定位点的化学活性可以通过局部d能级密度宽度来预测，这一宽度受到d轨道杂化和合金元素之间显著电荷转移的共同影响。研究中开发的模型通过分析各种铂合金表明，d带中心的位置及其化学活性是由d带宽度决定的，而这个宽度是合金几何形状和形成合金的金属原子的d轨道空间范围的独特函数。研究还提到，计算出的基态电子密度的分区显示s/p电子密度的变化，但这些变化对化学活性的影响远小于d带中心的变化。研究结果表明，理解合金催化剂的局部电子结构可以导致更高效的催化剂的发展，特别是在选择性氢化反应中，通过预测并优化合金中特定位点的化学活性。
