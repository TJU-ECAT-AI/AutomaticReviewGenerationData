<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site.</p>
<p>For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center. The consequence of this is that the strength of the interaction between the adsorbates and the metal sites, characterized by an energetically higher d-band center, is stronger than the interaction between the adsorbates and the sites characterized by a lower d-band center.</p>
<p>Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models [1619]. Below we describe our experimental procedure, including the description of the synthetic routes used to synthesize the Pt alloys, experimental measurements, and theoretical calculations. This is followed by the discussion of our results.</p>
<p>The formation of the alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys.</p>
<p>Since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted.</p>

Establishing Relationships Between the Geometric Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Alloy Catalysts Based on Their Measured Electronic Structure:

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering the electronic structure of the surface atoms. This is achieved through the modification of the local density of states (DOS) and the width of the d-band, which affects the binding energy of adsorbates on the surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. **Metal Properties**: The selection of the right metal that can undergo alloying to achieve desired electronic structure modifications is crucial. The properties of the metal, such as its d-band center and the extent of its d-orbitals, play a significant role in determining the catalytic performance.

2. **Reaction Conditions**: Optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and concentration of reactants ensures that the catalyst operates efficiently. The conditions should allow for the effective adsorption of reactants and desorption of products.

3. **Specific Advantages**: SAA catalysts offer several advantages over traditional catalysts, including enhanced selectivity, stability, and activity. They can break scaling rules by achieving high activity at lower temperatures or pressures, reducing energy consumption.

4. **Breakthroughs in Selectivity**: By controlling the electronic structure of the catalyst surface through alloying, SAA catalysts can selectively favor certain reaction pathways, improving product purity and yield.

5. **Ease of Estimation**: The width of the d-band, which is a function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, can be easily estimated. This allows for the prediction of the chemical reactivity of sites in the alloy, facilitating the design of catalysts with optimized performance.

Designing SAA catalysts requires a deep understanding of the interplay between the geometric structure of the alloy and its chemical reactivity. By carefully selecting the metal composition and optimizing reaction conditions, researchers can create catalysts that outperform traditional catalysts in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability.

4. **选择性的突破**：通过控制催化剂表面的电子结构，SAA催化剂可以优先选择某些反应路径，提高产品纯度和产率。

5. **估计的简便性**：d带宽度是合金几何结构和d轨道延伸程度的函数，可以很容易地进行估算。这使得对合金中特定位置的化学活性进行预测成为可能，从而促进具有优化性能的催化剂的设计。

设计SAA催化剂需要深入了解合金结构与化学活性之间的相互作用。通过仔细选择金属组成并优化反应条件，研究人员可以创建性能优于传统催化剂的催化剂，在效率、选择性和可持续性方面表现出色。
