<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center. The consequence of this is that the strength of the interaction between the adsorbates and the metal sites, characterized by an energetically higher d-band center, is stronger than the interaction between the adsorbates and the sites characterized by a lower d-band center.</p>
<p>The width of the d-band projected on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site.</p>
<p>When using the term alloy we refer to a partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element.</p>
<p>The formation of the alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys.</p>
<p>There is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>The consequence of (i) and (ii) is that there exist a universal relationship between the width of the localized d-band and the local d-band center and therefore the local chemical reactivity.</p>
<p>Since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted.</p>

The enhanced catalytic performance of single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, in selective hydrogenation reactions is attributed to the unique electronic structure and reactivity of the Pd atoms. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve optimizing the metal properties to achieve high selectivity, ensuring that the metal atoms are dispersed efficiently on the support surface, and controlling the reaction conditions to maximize the desired product yield. The ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems is achieved by leveraging the precise control over the electronic structure of the active metal species. The key to success lies in understanding the relationship between the alloy geometry, the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, and the chemical reactivity of the metal sites. By predicting the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure, it becomes possible to design catalysts that exhibit enhanced performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The absence of significant charge transfer within the alloy ensures that the reactivity of the metal sites remains a function of the d-band width, which can be easily calculated based on the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals.
