<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site.</p>
<p>For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center. The consequence of this is that the strength of the interaction between the adsorbates and the metal sites, characterized by an energetically higher d-band center, is stronger than the interaction between the adsorbates and the sites characterized by a lower d-band center.</p>
<p>Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models [1619].

Establishing Relationships Between the Geometric Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Alloy Catalysts Based on Their Measured Electronic Structure:

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering the electronic structure of the surface atoms. This is achieved through the modification of the local density of states (DOS) and the width of the d-band, which affects the binding energy of adsorbates on the surface. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. **Metal Properties**: The selection of the right metal that can undergo alloying to achieve desired electronic structure modifications is crucial. The properties of the metal, such as its d-band center and the extent of its d-orbitals, play a significant role in determining the catalytic performance.

2. **Reaction Conditions**: Optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and concentration of reactants ensures that the catalyst operates efficiently. The conditions should allow for the effective adsorption of reactants and desorption of products.

3. **Specific Advantages**: SAA catalysts offer several advantages over traditional catalysts, including enhanced selectivity, stability, and activity. They can break scaling rules by achieving high activity at lower temperatures or pressures, reducing energy consumption.

4. **Breakthroughs in Selectivity**: By controlling the electronic structure of the catalyst surface through alloying, SAA catalysts can selectively favor certain reaction pathways, improving product purity and yield.

5. **Ease of Estimation**: The width of the d-band, which is a function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, can be easily estimated. This allows for the prediction of the chemical reactivity of sites in the alloy, facilitating the design of catalysts with optimized performance.

Designing SAA catalysts requires a deep understanding of the interplay between the geometric structure of the alloy and its chemical reactivity. By carefully selecting the metal composition and optimizing reaction conditions, researchers can create catalysts that outperform traditional catalysts in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability.

<p>It has been shown previously by Hammer and Nrskov that the binding of various adsorbates on metals (pure metals as well as alloys) can be explained with the d-band model of bonding [913]. This model relates the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal, more specifically the center of the d-band of the site (i.e., the average energy of d-states), to the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>Metals with a higher d-band center, with respect to the Fermi level, bind most adsorbates more strongly than metals with a lower d-band center.</p>
<p>The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center. For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center.</p>
<p>For any pure metal the number of occupied d-states and the overlap between the d-states are known, and therefore the relative position of the d-band center and the relative chemical activity of the metal can be easily estimated.</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models [1619].</p>
<p>The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy.</p>
<p>The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts in terms of reaction conditions, metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems, involve understanding the d-band structure and its influence on the chemical reactivity of metal sites. The design should aim to control the d-band width and position through alloy composition to optimize catalytic performance.</p>

The document discusses how single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve controlling the d-band width and position through alloy composition to optimize catalytic performance. This approach helps break scaling rules and improves selectivity across various catalyst systems.

The document explains that the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal, specifically the center of the d-band, influences the chemical reactivity of the site. Metals with a higher d-band center bind adsorbates more strongly than those with a lower d-band center. The position of the d-band center is influenced by factors such as the overlap between d-orbitals and potential charge transfer in alloys. For successful SAA catalyst design, it is crucial to understand these dynamics and tailor alloy compositions accordingly to achieve desired catalytic outcomes.

<p>For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals).</p>
<p>The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center.

<p>For example, for metals in a column in the periodic table of elements, the d-band filling is identical (same number of d electrons), while the spatial extent of d-orbitals increases from top to bottom of the column. The increased extent of d-orbitals yields a broader d-band which results in lower energy of the d-band center with respect to Fermi level and lower chemical reactivity for the metals at the bottom of the column.</p>
<p>Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band.</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>When using the term alloy we refer to a partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element.</p>
<p>The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below.</p>
<p>When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5.</p>
<p>Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons.</p>
<p>It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band.</p>

The study discusses the relationship between the geometric structure and chemical reactivity of alloy catalysts, particularly focusing on Pt alloys. It highlights that the chemical reactivity of sites in alloys can be predicted based on the width of the local density of d-states, which is influenced by the hybridization of d-orbitals and the absence of significant charge transfer between alloy elements. The model developed through the study of various Pt alloys suggests that the position of the d-band center, and thus the chemical reactivity, is determined by the width of the d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms forming the alloy. The study also mentions that the partitioning of the calculated ground state electron density shows shifts in s/p electron density, but these shifts have a lesser impact on chemical reactivity compared to changes in the d-band center. The findings imply that understanding the local electronic structure of alloy catalysts can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts, especially in selective hydrogenation reactions, by predicting and optimizing the chemical reactivity of specific sites within the alloy.

The enhanced catalytic performance of single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, in selective hydrogenation reactions is attributed to the unique electronic structure and reactivity of the Pd atoms. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve optimizing the metal properties to achieve high selectivity, ensuring that the metal atoms are dispersed efficiently on the support surface, and controlling the reaction conditions to maximize the desired product yield. The ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems is achieved by leveraging the precise control over the electronic structure of the active metal species. The key to success lies in understanding the relationship between the alloy geometry, the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, and the chemical reactivity of the metal sites. By predicting the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure, it becomes possible to design catalysts that exhibit enhanced performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The absence of significant charge transfer within the alloy ensures that the reactivity of the metal sites remains a function of the d-band width, which can be easily calculated based on the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals.
