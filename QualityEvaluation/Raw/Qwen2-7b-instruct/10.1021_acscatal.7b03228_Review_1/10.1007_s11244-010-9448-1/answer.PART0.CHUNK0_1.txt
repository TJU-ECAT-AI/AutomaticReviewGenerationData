<p>It has been shown previously by Hammer and Nrskov that the binding of various adsorbates on metals (pure metals as well as alloys) can be explained with the d-band model of bonding [913]. This model relates the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal, more specifically the center of the d-band of the site (i.e., the average energy of d-states), to the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>Metals with a higher d-band center, with respect to the Fermi level, bind most adsorbates more strongly than metals with a lower d-band center.</p>
<p>The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center. For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center.</p>
<p>For any pure metal the number of occupied d-states and the overlap between the d-states are known, and therefore the relative position of the d-band center and the relative chemical activity of the metal can be easily estimated.</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models [1619].</p>
<p>The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy.</p>
<p>The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts in terms of reaction conditions, metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems, involve understanding the d-band structure and its influence on the chemical reactivity of metal sites. The design should aim to control the d-band width and position through alloy composition to optimize catalytic performance.</p>

The document discusses how single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve controlling the d-band width and position through alloy composition to optimize catalytic performance. This approach helps break scaling rules and improves selectivity across various catalyst systems.

The document explains that the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal, specifically the center of the d-band, influences the chemical reactivity of the site. Metals with a higher d-band center bind adsorbates more strongly than those with a lower d-band center. The position of the d-band center is influenced by factors such as the overlap between d-orbitals and potential charge transfer in alloys. For successful SAA catalyst design, it is crucial to understand these dynamics and tailor alloy compositions accordingly to achieve desired catalytic outcomes.
