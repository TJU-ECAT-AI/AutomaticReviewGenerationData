1. The properties of metals can be fine-tuned through alloying, particularly with bimetallic nanoalloys which are of great interest in colloidal and heterogeneous catalysis. Wet-chemical synthesis offers a way to create such nanoalloys bottom-up.

2. The study reports on the synthesis of various nanocrystalline Ni/Ga intermetallic materials through an organometallic, non-aqueous wet-chemical process. NiGa is utilized for selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes.

3. There is constant interest in replacing noble-metal catalysts with low-cost alternatives.

4. The use of ionic liquid [BMIm][BF4] as a solvent has proven advantageous in controlling the reaction and stabilizing nanoparticles, leading to stable colloids of NiGa and Ni3Ga.

5. Phase-selective synthesis of Ni/Ga colloids in conventional solvents or with surfactants like hexadecylamine (HDA) was not feasible due to the reactivity of HDA with GaCp*.

6. The materials' characteristics are assessed through various analytical techniques including TEM, EDX, IR, PXRD, and AAS.

7. The single-source precursor [Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] with a fixed Ni : Ga ratio of 1 : 1 was used as well.

8. The co-hydrogenolytic dual precursor source approach was less practical due to inefficient nickel incorporation caused by the formation of stable [Ni(PMe3)4].

9. NiGa is shown to be an effective catalyst for the semihydrogenation of alkynes.

10. The objective is to obtain Fe/Al nanoalloys either from separate Fe and Al precursors or from FeAl mixed-metal clusters.

1. 金属的性能可以通过合金化进行调整，特别是通过双金属纳米合金，在胶体和异质催化中特别有趣。湿化学合成提供了从下向构建此类纳米合金的方式。

2. 研究报告了通过非水溶剂的有机金属湿化学法合成各种Ni/Ga纳米晶间金属材料。使用NiGa选择性氢化炔烃为烯烃。

3. 替换贵金属催化剂以低成本替代物一直是持续的兴趣。

4. 使用离子液体[BMIm][BF4]作为反应控制和纳米粒子稳定性的介质特别有利，最终获得了稳定的NiGa和Ni3Ga纳米合金胶体。

5. 在常规溶剂中或使用十六烷基胺（HDA）等表面活性剂进行Ni/Ga胶体合成是不可行的，因为HDA与GaCp*的反应性导致了不充分的镓整合。

6. 材料特性通过透射电子显微镜（TEM），能谱X射线光谱（EDX），红外（IR），粉末X射线衍射（PXRD）和原子吸收光谱（AAS）进行了评估。

7. 单源前体[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3]具有固定Ni：Ga比1：1也被使用。

8. 双源前体共氢解法相比，由于稳定[Ni(PMe3)4]的副产导致了镍整合效率低下，因此不太实际。

9. NiGa被证明是氢化炔烃为烯烃的有效催化剂。

10. 目标是从单独的Fe和Al前体或FeAl混合金属簇（如[Fe(AlCp*)5]）获得Fe/Al纳米合金。
