<p>Compared to these established catalysts it seems that the Hume-Rothery type intermetallic compounds of type B metals (i.e. groups 2, 12 and 13) with low-cost transition metals are very promising novel materials in place of expensive noble-metal catalysts.</p>
<p>Our investigations of the related group-13 organometallic precursor chemistry showed that the low-valent [(AlCp*)4] and the related GaCp* are valuable sources to obtain the interme- tallic Hume-Rothery type nanoalloys of Co/Al, Ni/Al and Cu/Al by co-hydrogenolysis of the corresponding transition metal precursors.</p>
<p>The goal would be to obtain Fe/Al nanoalloys either from separate Fe and Al precursors or from FeAl mixed-metal clusters, such as [Fe(AlCp*)5].</p>
<p>Ni-NPs (median diameter 18  6 nm, see Scheme S1, Fig. S19, S20 and Table S3 in the ESI) showed high conversion rates for the total hydrogenation of the triple bond and selec- tivity to octane (97%) or diphenylethane (78%).</p>
<p>NiGa-NPs from NP1-IL yielded primarily 1-octene or diphenylethylene with 94% or up to 87% selectivity,respectively.</p>
