The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is more to the nature of active sites than just the ratio of these elements. This complexity suggests that the true optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how these elements interact within the zeolite structure, beyond simple stoichiometric ratios.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，Ga物种的结构和分布的内部差异，受Ga负载和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为它影响催化过程的效率和选择性。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系意味着活性位点的本质比这些元素的比例要复杂得多。这种复杂性表明，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地理解这些元素在沸石结构中的相互作用，而不仅仅是简单的化学计量比。
