The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because these factors affect how the active sites are distributed within the zeolite framework. This means that the efficiency of the catalyst in dehydrogenating and cracking propane is not consistent across the entire surface, leading to a non-uniform performance. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that there is an optimal ratio where the catalytic activity peaks before declining. This suggests that the active sites responsible for PDH reactions are not uniformly distributed or active, which complicates the understanding of their role in the catalytic process. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how these factors influence the location and activity of the active sites.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，Ga物种的结构和分布的内部差异，受Ga负载和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这些因素影响着活性位点在整个骨架中的分布。这意味着催化剂在脱氢和裂解丙烷时的效率并不一致，导致整个表面性能不均一。Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，在催化活性达到峰值之前和之后，存在一个最佳的比例。这表明负责PDH反应的活性位点并非均匀分布或活跃，这使理解它们在催化过程中的作用变得复杂。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地了解这些因素如何影响活性位点的位置和活性。
