The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it suggests that the active sites within these catalysts may not be uniformly distributed or structured. This implies that the true nature of the active sites might be more complex than previously thought, as their effectiveness could depend on their specific location, structure, and interaction with other components in the zeolite framework. This complexity makes it difficult to predict or optimize the performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts solely based on the Ga/Al ratio, necessitating a more detailed understanding of how these parameters influence the active sites' functionality.

H-ZSM-5沸石中孤立Ga3+离子的结构和分布的变异性，受到Ga负载和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这表明这些催化剂中的活性位点可能并非均匀分布或结构化。这意味着真正的活性位点可能比以前认为的要复杂得多，因为它们的有效性可能会依赖于它们的具体位置、结构及其与框架中其他成分的相互作用。这种复杂性使得仅根据Ga/Al比例预测或优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的性能变得困难，需要更详细地理解这些参数如何影响活性位点的功能。
