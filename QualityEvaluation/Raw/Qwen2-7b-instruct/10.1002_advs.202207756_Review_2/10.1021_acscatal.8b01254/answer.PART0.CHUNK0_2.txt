The variability in intraporous gallium (Ga) species structure and distribution within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors including Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, complicates the notion of uniform performance across the entire material. This suggests that different Ga configurations may exhibit distinct catalytic activities, rather than a single, consistent behavior. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalyst's performance indicates that the presence and distribution of Ga atoms do not follow a straightforward pattern that could predictably enhance or diminish catalytic efficiency. This complexity implies that the actual active sites within Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are more nuanced than previously assumed, potentially involving multiple, interconnected Ga-based functionalities rather than a single dominant active center. To optimize the performance of these catalysts, researchers must consider the multifaceted impact of Ga loading and its spatial arrangement on the catalytic sites, leading to a more detailed understanding of the catalyst's active mechanisms and more precise control over their synthesis conditions.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，内孔中镓（Ga）物种结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这表明不同Ga配置可能表现出不同的催化活性，而不是单一、一致的行为。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化剂性能之间的非单调关系意味着Ga原子的存在及其分布并不遵循可以预测地增强或减弱催化效率的简单模式。这种复杂性暗示，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的实际活性位点比先前假设的更为复杂，可能涉及多种相互关联的Ga基功能，而不仅仅是单一主导活性中心。为了优化这些催化剂的性能，研究人员必须考虑Ga负载量及其空间排列对催化位点的多方面影响，从而获得更详细的催化剂活性机制理解，并更精确地控制合成条件。
