[1] "Understanding the correlation between Ga speciation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts remains a significant challenge due to the variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution."
[2] "Intriguingly, the observed non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has led to a reevaluation of the traditional view on the nature of active sites in these catalysts."

The variability in intraporous gallium (Ga) species structure and distribution within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and the silicon-to-aluminum (Si/Al) ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity across the catalyst. This is because the non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance suggests that the active sites responsible for PDH activity are not solely determined by the ratio of these elements. Instead, the complex interplay between the Ga species' structure and distribution affects the catalyst's efficiency, indicating that the true nature of active sites might be more nuanced than previously thought. This finding implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how these factors influence the formation and distribution of active sites, potentially leading to enhanced PDH activity.

在H-ZSM-5沸石催化剂中，介孔镓（Ga）物种结构和分布的可变性，受Ga负载量和硅-铝（Si/Al）比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性的假设。观察到Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系导致了对这些催化剂中活性位点本质的传统观点的重新评估。这意味着，影响催化剂效率的活性位点可能不仅仅是元素比例的决定因素。相反，Ga物种的结构和分布的复杂相互作用影响了催化剂的效率，表明真正的活性位点可能比以往认为的更为复杂。这一发现暗示，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地理解这些因素如何影响活性位点的形成和分布，从而有可能提高PDH活性。
