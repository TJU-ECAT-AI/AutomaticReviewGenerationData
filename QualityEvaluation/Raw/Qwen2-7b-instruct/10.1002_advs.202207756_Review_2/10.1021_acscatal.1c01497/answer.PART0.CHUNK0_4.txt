[1] "Understanding the correlation between Ga speciation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is crucial for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts."
[2] "The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity."
[3] "The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has significant implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, impacts the assumption of uniform PDH activity. This variability leads to a non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance, suggesting that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Optimizing these catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how the distribution and structure of Ga species affect their activity in PDH reactions.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，Ga物种结构和分布的内部变化性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系对理解活性位点的真实性质以及优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。优化这些催化剂需要更深入地了解Ga物种分布和结构如何影响其在PDH反应中的活性。
