The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that the distribution of active sites is more complex and nuanced than previously understood. This complexity arises from the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance, indicating that the true nature of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is not straightforwardly determined by these ratios alone.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，Ga物种在孔内的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这是因为它揭示了活性位点的分布比以往认为的更为复杂和微妙。这种复杂性来源于Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系，表明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上真正的活性位点性质并不是仅由这些比率直接决定的那么简单。
