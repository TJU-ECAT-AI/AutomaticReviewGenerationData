The variability in the intraporous gallium (Ga) species structure and distribution within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors including Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, complicates the notion of uniform propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity. This variability challenges the assumption of homogeneity in catalytic performance across different Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Moreover, the discovered non-linear connection between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic efficiency of these catalysts has profound consequences for elucidating the characteristics of the active sites and for the strategic optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，介孔中镓（Ga）物种结构和分布的变化性，受到诸如Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性的均匀性假设变得复杂。这种变化性挑战了不同Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂之间催化性能的一致性概念。此外，发现的Ga/Al比例与这些催化剂催化效率之间的非线性关系对理解活性位点的真实性质以及优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有深远的意义。
