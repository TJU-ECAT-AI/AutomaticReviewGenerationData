Understanding the correlation between gallium (Ga) speciation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts reveals that the variability in the structure and distribution of intraporous Ga species, which is influenced by factors such as Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, significantly impacts PDH activity. This variability challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity across the catalyst. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is more to the nature of active sites than previously thought, as a direct proportionality does not always predict the optimal performance. These findings suggest that the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how different Ga species contribute to the catalytic process and how their distribution affects the overall efficiency.

理解镓（Ga）物种在H-ZSM-5沸石中的结构和分布的多样性及其对丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性的影响，揭示了这种多样性挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响的这种多样性显著影响了PDH活性。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系意味着对活性位点真实性质的理解需要进一步深入，因为直接的比例关系并不总是预测最佳性能的指标。这些发现表明，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地了解不同Ga物种如何贡献于催化过程以及它们的分布如何影响整体效率。
