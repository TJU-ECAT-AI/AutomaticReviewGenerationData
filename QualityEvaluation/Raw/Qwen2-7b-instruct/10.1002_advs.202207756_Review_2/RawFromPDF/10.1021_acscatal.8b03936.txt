Abstract 
Aluminosilicate zeolites are widely used as acid catalysts, and different types of acid sites 
on these materials have been identified and characterized thoroughly. However, distinct acid sites 
on zeolites generated during reaction, such as the Brønsted acid sites on NaY upon exposure to 
organic acids and esters shown in our recent works (referred to as extrinsic sites), remain largely 
unexplored. In this work, we determine the density of extrinsic Brønsted acid sites generated on 
NaY by acetic acid and methyl acetate by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. Kinetic investigations 
using isopropanol dehydration as a model reaction show that the catalytic characteristics of the 
extrinsic Brønsted acid sites on NaY are not only different from intrinsic Brønsted acid sites on 
proton-exchanged faujasites, but also dependent on the precursor molecule, e.g., acetic acid and 
methyl acetate. The rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY is found to scale linearly with the 
square root of the partial pressure of co-fed acetic acid, rather than the quantity of spectroscopically 
measured Brønsted acid sites. We propose that the self-dissociation of acetic acid in the highly 
ionic zeolite pore network generates protons that are active for the dehydration reaction, and only 
fraction of these protons, i.e., those that are associated with the zeolite framework, can be identified 
spectroscopically. When co-feeding methyl acetate, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY 
increases linearly with the quantity of spectroscopically measured Brønsted acid sites, which is 
attributed to the fact that the self-dissociation of methyl acetate does not generate active protons 
within the zeolite pore.

1. Introduction 
 
Zeolites are crystalline, microporous materials with well-defined and tunable acid sites, 
and are used extensively as catalysts for a broad range of chemical transformations, especially in 
the petrochemical industry.1-3 The isomorphic substitution of Al for Si within the zeolite topology 
generates a negative framework charge, which must be balanced by a cation in the zeolite pore. 
The acid-base properties of zeolites can be tuned by changing the identity of this balancing cation. 
Proton-exchanged zeolites are Brønsted acidic, while metal cation-exchanged zeolites exhibit 
Lewis acidic or even basic characteristics.4-8 Due to their industrial significance, acid sites on 
several common zeolite frameworks have been thoroughly characterized by numerous research 
techniques, including various spectroscopies, computational models, temperature-programmed 
desorption of probe molecules, and model reactions.3-13 Experimental techniques generally aim to 
characterize intrinsic zeolitic acid sites, i.e., those present on the material regardless of the reaction 
system, because these sites are generally assumed to be exclusively responsible for the catalytic 
properties of the zeolite. However, our recent works demonstrate that Brønsted acid sites (BAS) 
can be generated on a solely Lewis acidic zeolite, NaY, upon the dissociative adsorption of organic 
acids (Scheme 1). The acidic hydrogen of the organic species exchanges with surface Na+ cations, 
generating an adsorbed sodium salt and a BAS on the zeolite framework. The BAS generated via

this ion exchange process, referred to as extrinsic BAS in this study, produce an infrared band at 
3645 cm-1 on the NaY sample, indistinguishable from the (AlO–H) mode of intrinsic BAS on 
faujasites.14 Like carboxylic acids, methyl esters can also undergo ion exchange with Na+-
exchanged faujasite, generating adsorbed sodium salts and surface methoxy groups.15 When the 
latter interact with water, extrinsic BAS are generated, confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy with 
pyridine as the probe molecule. We have shown that the extrinsic BAS on NaY are catalytically 
active in the decarbonylation of methyl lactate to acetaldehyde.16,17 However, catalytic properties 
of the extrinsic BAS are entirely unknown because these sites are not observed by standard ex situ 
characterization techniques, i.e., in the absence of an organic acid or ester which serves to generate 
new sites in situ.  
 
In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to 
demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally 
different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic 
acid or ester precursor. Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to 
generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using 
quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The ion exchange is governed by a Langmuir-type adsorption 
equilibrium, where framework negative charges act as immobile adsorption sites. Employing 
isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and TOF over both 
extrinsic and intrinsic BAS are measured, demonstrating the two types of sites have different 
catalytic properties. The IPA dehydration rate exhibits a linear dependence on the square root of 
the partial pressure of co-fed AA, leading us to propose a novel model to describe how the 
dissociative adsorption of AA on NaY generates the extrinsic BAS. The self-dissociation of AA 
within the highly ionic and confined zeolite pore generates two types of extrinsic BAS with

equivalent catalytic activity in IPA dehydration. However, only protons which “associate” with 
the zeolite framework generate distinct spectroscopic modes, causing the quantitative FTIR to give 
inaccurate values for total site concentration. We show that this model is also consistent with the 
observed activity of the extrinsic BAS generated by MA on NaY.  
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Materials Preparation 
 
NaY (nominal Si/Al = 2.5) was purchased from Zeolyst International (CBV-100). 
Materials characterization measurements of this commercial sample have been previously 
reported.18 The Si/Al ratio measured by 29Si solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (SS-MAS-NMR) is 2.2; X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements show good agreement 
with the SS-MAS-NMR results. 27Al SS-MAS-NMR shows no detectable level of signal 
corresponding to octahedrally coordinated extra-framework alumina species. The powder X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern is consistent with that of faujasite zeolite crystals, and XRF 
measurements indicate the Na+/Al ratio is ~1; no additional Na+ exchange treatments were 
performed prior to activity testing. The partially proton-exchanged materials were synthesized ex 
situ using an aqueous solution of NH4NO3 with a predetermined total ion ratio NH4+/Na+ < 1. The 
resulting samples are denoted as NaHY–X, where X is the number of protons (in µmol) per gram 
measured via quantitative pyridine adsorption FTIR (described below). The silicalite-1 sample was 
synthesized using the following procedure: 1.85 g of Cabosil M-5 was mixed with 6.89 g of 
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and 23.6 g of H2O under stirring for 1 h, and then HF 
(0.65 g) was added to the mixture. The final gel composition of 50 H2O /0.44 TPAOH/1 SiO2/0.5

HF was placed in Teflon-lined autoclave at 175 °C for 5 days. All zeolite samples were calcined 
at 500 °C (1 °C/min temperature ramp) for 6 h before use.  
Double deionized water was produced in-house by a Thermo Barnstead Mega Pure-1 Still 
deionizer. Isopropanol was obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific, while acetic acid, methyl 
acetate, pyridine, di-isopropyl ether, and sodium acetate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; all 
chemicals were used without further purification. Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity gaseous propylene for 
gas chromatograph calibration, Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity gaseous N2 for balancing carrier gas 
during activity testing, and Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity helium and hydrogen for product analysis 
and quantification were all obtained from Keen Gas. 
 
2.2 Materials Characterization 
 
XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Discover powder diffractometer with a Cu 
K source ( = 1.5418 Å) over the range 2 = 5 – 50 with a step size of 0.025 at 2 s per step. 
Textural characterization of the samples was performed using N2 adsorption at 77 K after 
degassing at 623 K for 6 h under vacuum. Isotherms were collected on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 
instrument, and micropore volumes were calculated using the t-plot method. X-ray fluorescence 
measurements were performed on a Rigaku WD-XRF instrument utilizing provided spectral 
analysis software. Solid-state 29Si (99.83 MHz, 10 kHz rotational speed, 512 scans) and 27Al 
(130.29 MHz, 10 kHz rotational speed, 512 scans) magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (SS-MAS-NMR) were performed on a Bruker AVIII500 NMR spectrometer with a 44 
mm HZ MAS probe for all measurements. We employed the standard method for calculating the 
Si/Al ratio from 29Si-MAS-NMR described by Engelhardt, et al., using the relative area of each Si 
peak (corresponding to particular Si(nAl) coordination).19

2.3 Transmission FTIR Spectroscopy 
 
In-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a ThermoFisher 
Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR Spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector and a custom in situ 
transmission cell, collecting 128 scans per spectrum at a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. Temperature 
control in the transmission cell is achieved through the use of heating tapes and insulation 
connected to a tuned PID controller. Vacuum levels of <0.1 mTorr are achieved through 
connection to a vacuum manifold containing both a mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. For 
experimental tests, a self-standing zeolite wafer is loaded into a custom-made sample holder for 
vertical alignment in the infrared beam. The samples were annealed at 450 °C under vacuum to 
completely remove surface adsorbates before cooling to the desired temperature. The appropriate 
species or mixture was then introduced to the transmission cell via the vacuum manifold. The 
amount of species in each dose, measured via the total system pressure, is controlled via a vacuum 
manifold. 
 
Integrated molar extinction coefficients (IMEC) for protonated pyridine (pyridinium) was 
measured using the following procedure. The density of Brønsted acid sites on a proton-exchanged 
faujasite sample was measured via an isopropylamine decomposition quantification procedure as 
described in a previous publication.20 This sample was then loaded into the transmission FTIR cell, 
annealed, and cooled to 225 °C; a background spectrum was taken at this temperature. Pyridine 
was then introduced into the transmission cell for several minutes prior to evacuation, and this 
dosing procedure was repeated until the adsorbed pyridinium band increased by less than 1% 
between doses, after which the final spectrum was collected (Figure S1). The 1545 – 1540 cm-1 
spectral band associated with pyridinium was integrated using OMNIC software, and the IMEC 
(Py) was calculated using the following equation:

where Sp is the catalyst wafer’s cross-sectional surface area in cm2, mp is the dry mass of the 
catalyst wafer in grams, and [H+] is the density of Brønsted acid sites in µmol/gcatalyst. To calculate 
the dry mass of the catalyst, the mass loss between room temperature and 450 °C was measured 
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air. The water mass percentage of samples in this work 
varied between 10–16%. After the extinction coefficient was measured (10%), the same 
procedure and equation were applied to measure the Brønsted acid site density of other zeolite 
samples. The measured value of Py at 225 °C is 1.0  0.1 cm/µmol. 
 
To determine the IMEC of sodium acetate (Acet), an incipient wetness impregnation 
procedure was used to distribute a known quantity of sodium acetate salt (50 – 200 µmol/gcatalyst) 
within the pore network of the commercial NaY sample. The peak area of the 1585 cm-1 vibrational 
band was measured at 275 °C using OMNIC software over multiple trials at various loadings. The 
Acet was then calculated using Equation 2.2:

Where  (in cm/µmol) is the slope of a linear fit between the band area (in cm-1) and the total molar 
loading (dry mass multiplied by loading per gram) over surface area of the pellet (units = 
µmol/cm2). The calibration curve is presented in Figure S2. No sodium acetate was lost during the 
heating procedure. The same procedure was then applied to determine the sodium acetate 
concentration after adsorption of AA and MA to NaY.

Catalytic activities were evaluated using an up-flow fixed bed reactor consisting of a quartz 
tube with an inner diameter of 4 mm at atmospheric pressure inside a ThermoFisher Lindberg Blue 
M furnace with a PID temperature control via a custom LabVIEW program. An inert thermocouple 
(no detectable catalytic activity at the temperatures employed) was placed directly above the 
catalyst bed, and temperature fluctuations in the catalyst bed were restricted less than  0.5 C. All 
catalysts were pressed and sieved (20-40 mesh) prior to loading into the reactor. When the required 
loading of active material was < 10 mg, the catalyst was diluted with inert quartz powder prior to 
the press/sieve procedure. Catalysts were pretreated at 500 °C for 0.5 –1 h under 50 mL/min dry 
air flow to remove water and other adsorbates. The liquid-phase feed was introduced to the reactor 
via a syringe pump, and the partial pressures of reactants were controlled via the composition and 
flow rate of the solutions. The N2 carrier gas flow rate was constant at 50 mL/min, and total reactor 
pressure was 1 bar. All reactor lines were heat-traced to > 125 °C to prevent condensation of 
reactants, co-feeds, or products (all lines show no detectable catalytic activity). An on-line gas 
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Agilent 7890B GC and 5973 MS) equipped with a DB-FFAP 
capillary column and a flame ionization detector was used for product identification and 
quantification. Conversion, product yields, and turnover frequencies (TOF) were calculated as

where nR is the number of moles of reactant detected, ni is the number of moles of species i, ci is 
the carbon number of species i, n is the number of moles of active sites in the catalyst bed, and FR 
is the flow rate of reactant in moles per unit time.  
 
For activity measurements, the catalyst bed temperature was allowed to settle at 275 °C for 
at least 30 min to minimize temperature gradients. The reactant solution was then introduced, and 
initial rates were measured at 10 min time on stream. Activation energy measurements were 
conducted at 255 – 295 °C with data points in 10 °C increments, varying T randomly while keeping 
propylene yield to < 10% to remain within the differential conversion regime. At TOS > 1 h, the 
temperature was returned to 275 °C to check for catalyst deactivation. Deactivation was < 5% 
(referenced to the initial yield value) for all experiments except when the additive partial pressure 
was  5 kPa. For AA at 5 kPa, the activation barrier was measured by averaging multiple trials of 
randomized temperature sequences, similar to a previously reported procedure for methyl lactate 
on NaY.18  Activation barriers are not reported for the other high-partial pressure conditions due 
to the fast catalyst deactivation.  
 
3. Results & Discussion 
3.1 Catalyst Characterization 
 
Properties of the parent NaY material have been previously reported, and multiple methods 
have failed to detect any intrinsic Brønsted acid sites.15,16 The NaHY–X samples are prepared via

3.2 Transmission FTIR of Acetic Acid on NaY 
 
Adsorption of AA on NaY generates new spectroscopic bands characteristic of sodium 
acetate and BAS on faujasites. After annealing at 450 ºC under vacuum, the only significant 
spectroscopic band on NaY is the external silanol mode at 3740 cm-1 (Figure S3).1 This spectrum 
is used as the background for subsequent spectra for clarity. All spectra are recorded in the 
presence of gas-phase AA at the reported partial pressure of AA (PAA). Upon introducing 3.3 Pa 
AA at 275 ºC, three vibrational bands appear at 3644 cm-1, 1585 cm-1, and 1430 cm-1 (Figure 1a). 
We have previously shown that the former two bands are characteristic of a gas-solid ion exchange 
between acidic hydrogen in organic acids and Na+ balancing cations on the zeolite framework.14 
Specifically, we attribute the 3644 cm-1 band to the (AlO–H) mode of BAS on the FAU 
framework, and the 1585 cm-1 band to the ([O–C–O]–) mode of the corresponding adsorbed 
sodium acetate salt.14,21 The band centered at 1430 cm-1 corresponds to the asymmetric bending

mode of the methyl group (asym(CH3)), which is present in both molecular AA and sodium 
acetate.21,22 The corresponding symmetric mode, typically located near 1385 cm-1, is absent at low 
PAA. This mode is also not observed when neat sodium acetate is dispersed on NaY, suggesting 
the acetate salt does not possess this vibrational mode (Figure S2).23  
At low PAA, exchanged sodium acetate is the dominant surface species while molecularly 
adsorbed AA is minor (Figure 1a). Although the FTIR spectrum is recorded in the presence of gas-
phase AA with a partial pressure of 3.3 Pa, the intensity of the 1724 cm-1 band attributed to the 
(C=O) mode (the strongest vibrational mode in AA) is below the detection limit.23 The ([O–C–
O]–) band is clearly visible, however, suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of AA on NaY to

form sodium acetate is more thermodynamically favorable than molecularly adsorbed AA. This is 
consistent with the behavior of  methyl lactate upon exposure to NaY (forming sodium lactate).18   
 
As PAA is increased, evidence of molecular AA appears and the concentrations of both 
sodium acetate and BAS rise. At a PAA of 6.7 Pa, vibrational bands attributed to the (C=O) and 
sym(CH3) modes of AA appear at 1724 cm-1 and 1385 cm-1, respectively, indicating the presence 
of gas-phase or adsorbed AA. As PAA is subsequently increased stepwise to 130 Pa, the molecular 
AA, sodium acetate, and BAS bands all increase in intensity, suggesting that ion exchange is 
promoted by higher PAA. At the highest applied PAA (2.1 kPa), the significant increase in gas-phase 
AA leads to signal saturation in the (C=O) region, obscuring other spectral changes (Figure S4). 
New bands at 3595 cm-1, 3581 cm-1, and 3565 cm-1, attributed to the (O–H) modes of AA, 
overwhelm the relatively weak 3644 cm-1 band. The 1585 cm-1 acetate mode is still clearly visible, 
but grows only marginally from a PAA of 130 Pa to 2.1 kPa, suggesting that the concentration of 
sodium acetate becomes relatively insensitive to PAA above ~100 Pa. 
To determine the concentration of sodium acetate formed via the dissociative adsorption 
of AA, the integrated molar extinction coefficient (IMEC) of the ([O–C–O]–) mode of sodium 
acetate on NaY is determined to quantitatively measure the amount of sodium acetate formed via 
the reaction between AA and NaY with FTIR (Figure S2). The ([O–C–O]–) mode is chosen 
because it is stronger and more sensitive to differential changes in concentration than the 3644 cm-
1 band (see scale bars on Figure 1). The IMEC of sodium acetate (acet) is determined to be 13.1  
0.5 cm/µmol, based on a strong linear correlation (r2 > 0.99) between the 1585 cm-1 band area and 
the sodium acetate loading and dimensions of the catalyst wafer (Figure S2).5,24 
 
The concentration of sodium acetate on NaY increases rapidly at PAA < 27 Pa, and becomes 
relatively insensitive to PAA above this threshold, which is reminiscent of a Langmuir adsorption

isotherm (Figure 2). As PAA increases from 
3.3 Pa to 27 Pa at 275 ºC, the sodium acetate 
concentration ([NaAcet]) doubles from 27 
µmol/gcat to 54 µmol/gcat (Figure 2a). At 
higher PAA, [NaAcet] increases more slowly, to 61 µmol/gcat at 130 Pa and 71 µmol/gcat at 2.1 kPa. 
This trend is similar to an adsorption isotherm and suggests that the framework ion exchange sites 
on NaY become nearly saturated with sodium acetate at relatively low partial pressures. The NaY 
sample (Si/Al ratio = 2.2) contains ~4700 µmol/gcat of framework Al and surface Na+ (assuming 
the Na+/Al ratio to be unity), and thus < 2% of all Na+ undergoes ion exchange with the acidic 
proton in AA under the maximum PAA (2.1 kPa) conditions employed in this study. The band 
corresponding to the Brønsted acid sites generated via ion exchange (3644 cm-1) is less sensitive 
to small changes in concentration than the acetate band, and therefore the IMEC is not determined. 
The integrated area of the band is consistent with the trend of the sodium acetate species in the

PAA range of 0 – 130 Pa (Figure 2b). [NaAcet] and [H+] should be identical based on the 
stoichiometry of the ion-exchange between AA and NaY, and thus, the measured [NaAcet] values 
are used to obtain turnover frequencies (TOF) normalized by the amount in situ generated BAS, 
referred to as the extrinsic BAS, in the following sections. 
 
Assuming the dissociative adsorption of AA and MA on NaY follows the Langmuir model, 
the adsorption energies for sodium acetate formed by AA and MA are estimated to be -101 kJ/mol 
and -88 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure 3). The Langmuir adsorption isotherm for dissociative 
adsorption is described by Equation 3.1:27

Where  is the site coverage (using maximum site values of 80 µmol/gcat and 60 µmol/gcat for AA 
and MA, respectively), Keq is the equilibrium constant between gas-phase and adsorbed species, 
and Cadd is the gas-phase concentration of the adsorbate in mol/L, calculated using the ideal gas 
law. The Keq values for both AA and MA are on the order of 104, suggesting equilibrium is shifted 
toward dissociative adsorption at low concentrations (Table 1). The ∆Gads values calculated based 
on the equilibrium constants are -101 kJ/mol for AA and -88 kJ/mol for MA. These relatively high 
adsorption energies suggest that the sodium acetate species are highly stable within the zeolite 
pore, which is qualitatively supported by previous temperature-programmed desorption FTIR 
experiments where the sodium salt species are still identifiable at T > 400 C.14 Notably, the 
estimated adsorption energy represents the difference between the gas-phase species and the

3.3 Catalytic properties of intrinsic Brønsted and 
Lewis acid sites on FAU  
 
To further investigate the properties of the extrinsic BAS in comparison to Brønsted and 
Lewis acid sites intrinsic to faujasites, we employ the dehydration of isopropanol (IPA) as a model 
reaction. Although extrinsic BAS produced via the dissociative adsorption of organic acids on 
NaY are spectroscopically indistinguishable from intrinsic BAS, i.e., those on proton-exchanged 
faujasites, it is unclear whether the two types of sites have the same catalytic properties.14 We have 
previously shown that extrinsic BAS can be catalytically active (e.g., in the decarbonylation of 
methyl lactate to acetaldehyde), however, quantitative comparative studies with intrinsic sites are 
lacking.15-17 Although IPA can dehydrate to both propylene and di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), 
propylene is favored at higher temperatures.28 Yields of DIPE are negligible at T > 250 ºC over all 
catalysts employed in this study. We first determine the TOF and the apparent activation barrier 
(Ea) of intrinsic BAS on a series of partially exchanged NaHY-X samples with the same Si/Al ratio 
but varying densities of BAS (Table S1) to establish a baseline, against which the activity of the

extrinsic BAS will be compared. The BAS density in the partially exchanged NaHY–X samples is 
determined by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine as the probe molecule, where X is 
the measured BAS density (Figure S1).5,24  
 
Both TOF and Ea in IPA dehydration are independent of the density of intrinsic BAS sites on 
NaHY, suggesting that all of these sites are equally active for IPA dehydration. The IPA 
dehydration rate on NaY at 275 ºC is 2.4  10-6 mol/gcats (Figure 4a). As the density of BAS 
increases on the NaHY catalysts, the dehydration rate increases linearly to a maximum of 2.2  
10-3 mol/gcats on NaHY–430. The dehydration TOF normalized by the density of BAS is 4.5  0.5 
s-1 on all NaHY–X catalysts, suggesting that the activity of each site is independent of total BAS 
density (Figure 4b). The TOF for IPA dehydration on NaY (normalized by the amount of 
accessible Na+) is 1.1  10-3 s-1, indicating that BAS in FAU are more active than the Lewis acid 
sites (LAS) for IPA dehydration by a factor of > 2000 under the conditions employed in this study. 
The measured TOF and Ea show good agreement with previous studies.29-33 Thus, it is reasonable

to ignore LAS catalyzed dehydration if a material contains any appreciable density of BAS. The 
Ea on all NaHY–X is 126  4 kJ/mol, also in good agreement with literature values for proton-
exchanged FAU samples (Figure 4c).31 The Ea on NaY is determined to be 130 kJ/mol, which is 
within experimental error of the NaHY–X value, however, the pre-exponential factor is 3 orders 
of magnitude smaller (Table 2).34 The measured rate and Ea remain unchanged after the NaY 
sample is pretreated with a dilute NaOH solution (pH = 11),  confirming that to no residual BAS 
affects the measured kinetic parameters and all dehydration activity on NaY can be attributed 
exclusively to LAS.  
 
3.4 Activity of Extrinsic BAS Generated by Dissociative Adsorption of AA on NaY 
 
 The rate of propylene formation at 275 ºC over NaY is highly dependent on the amount of 
AA co-fed to the catalyst with IPA (Figure 5a). AA is co-fed with IPA at partial pressures between 
3.3 Pa and 10 kPa to probe the activity of the extrinsic BAS. The dehydration activity of NaY is 
measured at all relevant temperatures and subtracted from the total measured rate to isolate the 
activity of the extrinsic BAS; the activation barrier over NaY is constant at 130 kJ/mol in this 
temperature range (Table S2). This correction is negligible at PAA > 10 Pa. The initial propylene 
production rate at 3.3 Pa AA is 1.2  10-5 mol/(gcats), a factor of 5 higher than NaY, suggesting

that like the intrinsic BAS, the extrinsic BAS are also more active than the LAS (Figure 5a). This 
minimum PAA used in the reactivity study is equal to the lowest value used in the FTIR experiments 
to allow direct comparison between the spectroscopic and kinetic data. The maximum propylene 
rate, 4.2  10-4 mol/(gcats) is observed at 5 kPa AA. Under these conditions, the catalyst is as active 
on a mass basis as an NaHY catalyst containing ~100 µmol/gcat of BAS. However, as we will show 
below, the catalytic activities of the extrinsic and intrinsic BAS for IPA dehydration are different, 
and therefore the density of the extrinsic sites cannot be estimated based on the TOF of the intrinsic 
sites. Catalyst deactivation is relatively minor at PAA < 5 kPa, but above this threshold deactivation

is rapid, causing a decrease in the initial rate to 3.4  10-4 and 2.7  10-4 mol/(gcats) at 7.5 and 10 
kPa AA, respectively (see Section 2.4). Thus, accurate TOFs cannot be determined at 7.5 and 10 
kPa of AA, and these data will not be included in the following discussion. 
 
The Ea for IPA dehydration over the extrinsic BAS is independent of PAA, suggesting that 
the extent of ion exchange does not impact the activity of the active sites (Figure 5b). PAA is varied 
over 3 orders of magnitude, from 3.3 Pa to 5 kPa, and the measured Ea remains largely constant at 
115  3 kJ/mol. The constant Ea suggests that the amount of sodium acetate in the pores, and by 
extension the extrinsic BAS, does not affect the activity of each individual extrinsic site. The 
extrinsic sites have a lower Ea for IPA dehydration than intrinsic BAS by ~10 kJ/mol (Figure 4c). 
This difference may reflect both the properties of the extrinsic BAS and the impact of the co-
generated sodium acetate species on the IPA dehydration kinetics.   
When the initial dehydration rates are normalized by the density of the extrinsic BAS, the 
TOF increases with PAA (Figure 5c), suggesting that the spectroscopically measured site densities 
may not reflect the density of all active sites in the dehydration reaction. Assuming a 1:1 
stoichiometry between [NaAcet] and the extrinsic BAS, the density of the extrinsic sites could be 
determined via quantitative FTIR spectroscopy based on the ([O-C-O]–) mode of the sodium 
acetate (Figure 2). TOF calculated by normalizing the initial propylene production rates with the 
density of extrinsic BAS increases from 0.45 to 6.2 s-1 within the PAA range of 3.3 – 5 kPa (Figure 
5c). At PAA > 2.3 kPa, the [NaAcet] values were estimated using the Langmuir adsorption curve 
fit in Figure 3 due to the signal saturation of the ([O-C-O]–) band in the FTIR spectra at high PAA. 
We propose two possible causes for the increasing TOF. The first possibility is that each extrinsic 
BAS becomes more active as PAA increases. We consider this unlikely because the Ea remains 
constant across the entire PAA range investigated, which indicates the sites are equally active at all

levels of ion exchange. Further, we estimate that only up to 5% of accessible Na+ is exchanged 
with H+, indicating that the extrinsic BAS are relatively isolated (only ~0.2 per FAU supercage) 
and are thus multi-site interactions that might change catalytic activity are unlikely. This 
conclusion is supported by the constant TOF for the NaHY-samples (Figure 4b). The second 
possibility is that the spectroscopically observed extrinsic BAS are not the only active sites for 
IPA dehydration. As PAA increases, the concentration of physisorbed AA in the zeolite pores also 
increases. If these species provide active sites in addition to the extrinsic BAS, an increasing TOF 
per [NaAcet] would be expected. Re-analyzing the data reveals that the propylene production rate 
(per gcat) scales linearly with with ඥP
୅୅ (Figure 5d). In the following section, we construct a model 
that is compatible with all experimental observations.     
 
3.5 Model for the Extrinsic BAS on NaY  
 
The square root dependence of the initial IPA dehydration rate on PAA indicates that the 
active site for IPA dehydration, referred to as H+active, is produced via the dissociation equilibrium 
of AA:

Stoichiometry of this equilibrium dictates that [H+active] and [CH3COO–] are equal, which leads to:

It is important to note that Eq. 3.1 is distinct from the dissociative chemisorption of AA on NaY; 
the latter generates the spectroscopic bands identified by the FTIR spectroscopy in Section 3.2. 
The (AlO–H) mode (3644 cm-1) observed in FTIR spectroscopy corresponds to protons 
associated with the zeolite framework via a covalent bond, albeit one with substantial ionic 
character. By contrast, the H+active species in Equation 3.2 corresponds to a proton dissociated

enough from the acetate moiety to be active for IPA dehydration to propylene, regardless of any 
association with framework negative charges. Similarly, the ([O–C–O]–) mode observed at 1585 
cm-1 by FTIR spectroscopy specifically corresponds to an acetate species associated with an Na+ 
ion. A fast equilibrium in Eq. 3.2 may prevent a distinct acetate band from appearing upon 
ionization. At low PAA, the FTIR spectra show that most adsorbed AA undergoes ion-exchange 
with NaY, leading to bands at 3644 cm-1 and 1585 cm-1, with little molecularly adsorbed AA 
present (Figure 1a). At high PAA, the bands corresponding to molecular AA dominate. Based on 
the consistent linear dependence of the dehydration rate on ඥP
୅୅ , as well as the constant activation 
energy across the PAA range investigated in this work, we propose that both “free” H+active (referred 
to as H+free) and “associated” H+active (referred to as H+asso), i.e., AlO–H species on the zeolite 
framework, are active sites for IPA dehydration with indistinguishable catalytic properties.

AA physisorbs on NaY (equilibrium constant K1) to form physisorbed AA (AAad), which 
further produces H+free and Acet-ad via a fast association/dissociation equilibrium (with an 
equilibrium constant K2). A fraction of the H+free can bind to the zeolite framework to produce 
H+asso (with an equilibrium constant K3) resulting in the (AlO–H) mode observed in the FTIR 
spectra. Stoichiometrically, the association of the acetate and sodium into sodium acetate must be 
governed by the same equilibrium constant. The presence of NaAcetad is confirmed by the 
characteristic ([O–C–O]–) mode. The first step in the proposed model is AA physisorption on the 
zeolite catalyst. Physisorption is not site-dependent or -limited, and zeolite pores have been shown

to stabilize physisorption interactions.35,36 Because physisorption can occur throughout the 
micropore volume (0.344 cm3/g) of the zeolite, a large amount of AAad can accumulate at high 
PAA. The relatively weak surface-adsorbate interactions likely make physisorbed AA 
indistinguishable from gas-phase AA spectroscopically.  
 
The highly ionic environment of NaY pores facilitates the self-dissociation of AA into 
H+free and Acet–ad by increasing K2 (Scheme 2). Zeolites have frequently been referred to as “solid 
solvents” owing to their ability to effectively interact with adsorbates.37 Based on the measured 
Si/Al ratio, each supercage of the NaY sample contains ~4 Na+ and the same number of balancing 
framework negative charges, which could be viewed as an ionic or polar solvent.38 The key role 
of the ionic environment is verified when NaY is replaced with a siliceous silicalite-1 (MFI 
topology) as the catalyst for IPA 
dehydration while co-feeding 1 kPa AA 
at 275 C. No detectable level of IPA 
dehydration is observed, suggesting that 
having zeolitic micropores is not 
sufficient 
to 
promote 
the 
self-
dissociation of AA to produce active 
protons. At 275 C, there is no detectable 
level of AA dissociation (i.e., acetate salt 
formation) observed spectroscopically 
(Figure S5). In contrast, dissociative

the supercage facilitates this unique ionization behavior, 
and both H+active and AlO–H species can catalyze 
isopropanol dehydration.

environment. When AA is introduced at 3.3 Pa at 275 C, strong spectroscopic signals for 
associated NaAcetad (1585 cm-1) and H+asso–Z– are observed (3644 cm-1) are observed. There is no 
evidence of molecularly adsorbed AA at this condition, indicative of complete dissociative 
chemisorption at immobile sites on the zeolite framework. In the proposed model, adsorbed AA 
must first pass through the ionized (equilibrium K2) state prior to reaching the dissociative 
chemisorbed state (equilibrium K3, Equation 3.4). At this PAA, 27 µmol/gcat of NaAcetad are 
measured, corresponding to roughly one unit of the salt species per 20 FAU supercages. AA has a 
molecular diameter of ~4 Å, while the FAU supercage has a diameter of >11 Å.38,39 The low 
concentration of acetate and relatively spacious FAU supercage suggests there is not enough 
acetate to form a liquid organic phase, as proposed in other (higher pressure) systems.40,41 Rather, 
we propose that the combination of the confinement of the micropore and the ionic environment 
promotes the self-ionization of AA. At PAA above 3.3 Pa, the band at 1724 cm-1 associated with 
molecular AA appears, suggesting the presence of AAad.  
 
We propose that the association of H+free with the zeolite framework and Acet–ad with Na+ 
(governed by equilibrium constant K3), rather than the self-dissociation of AA, produce the 
spectroscopically distinct species. The band at 3644 cm-1 is characteristic of the (AlO–H) mode 
in faujasites, and thus the proton produced in the self-dissociation of AA (H+free) must be associated 
with the faujasite framework to produce this band. To preserve charge balance, the corresponding 
Acetad- must be balanced by another cation (Na+ in this system), leading to the ([O–C–O]–) mode 
at 1585 cm-1 representing NaAcetad. The association of the free proton with the zeolite framework 
and Acetad- with Na+ effectively constitute an ion exchange at the solid-gas interface. In contrast, 
the self-dissociation of AA without the further ion exchange with the zeolite will not produce the 
(AlO–H) and the ([O–C–O]–) modes, as the rapid and dynamic equilibrium between AAad and

H+free/Acet–ad would prevent distinct spectroscopic feature from emerging. This is consistent with 
the trends observed for both the (AlO–H) and the ([O–C–O]–) modes as a function of PAA 
(Figure 2).   
Although the H+asso species corresponds to the (AlO–H) mode while H+free does not, the 
kinetic data suggest they have identical catalytic properties in mediating the dehydration of IPA. 
The fact that the rate of IPA dehydration scales linearly with the square root of PAA indicates that 
both H+asso and H+free species are catalytically active. This is because as PAA increases, the sum of 
[H+asso] and [H+free], i.e., density of total extrinsic protons (denoted as [H+ex]), is expected to rise 
linearly with the square root of PAA, and the dehydration rate will be a linear function of [H+ex] 
under two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the ratio between [H+asso] and [H+free] remains 
constant as PAA, and in turn [Hex+], increases. This is inconsistent with the spectroscopic 
observation that as PAA increases, the molecularly adsorbed AA, and in turn [H+free] through the 
equilibrium, increases faster than [H+asso] (Figure 1). The second scenario is that the catalytic 
activities of both H+asso and H+free towards IPA dehydration are identical. We speculate that there 
could be rapid interconversion between H+asso and H+free, rendering them indistinguishable in 
kinetic experiments. The identical catalytic activity of both H+asso and H+free is also supported by 
the constant activation energy across the PAA range investigated, because the ratio of the two 
species changes but the kinetic parameters do not.  
 
 Assuming identical catalytic properties for H+asso and H+free towards IPA dehydration, 
[H+free] and [H+ex] can be estimated based on a combination of the spectroscopic and kinetic data. 
Because there is an absence of AAad at the lowest PAA (3.3 Pa), the total [H+ex] can be accurately 
determined by the quantitative FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 1). The TOF under this condition, 0.45 
s-1, can be subsequently used to calculate [H+ex] values at higher PAA. [H+free] is then the difference

between [H+ex] (estimated assuming a constant TOF) and [H+asso] (measured by the quantitative 
FTIR spectroscopy, Table 3). At PAA values below 0.1 kPa, H+asso represents the majority of 
extrinsic protons, while at higher PAA, [H+free] becomes much higher than [H+asso]. At 5 kPa PAA, 
the calculated total site density is 960 µmol/gcat, suggesting that each supercage contains on 
average between 2 and 3 active sites, but only 74 µmol/gcat is spectroscopically observed (Scheme 
2). Notably, the TOF over the extrinsic BAS is a factor of 10 lower than that over the intrinsic 
BAS on NaHY–X, indicating that for IPA dehydration, the extrinsic BAS have intermediate 
activity between intrinsic BAS and LAS. This lower activity is observed despite the lower Ea 
measured on extrinsic BAS (115 kJ/mol) than on intrinsic BAS in NaHY–X (126 kJ/mol), 
suggesting that the pre-exponential factor of the extrinsic sites is at least 2 orders of magnitude 
lower than the corresponding parameter for the intrinsic sites. The difference between the intrinsic 
and extrinsic BAS could reflect the impact of the presence of AAad and/or Acet–ad on the 
environment of in the zeolite pore.

Like AA, MA can undergo a similar ion exchange reaction with Na+ balancing cations to 
generate adsorbed sodium acetate species, and the extent of exchange is a  function of the partial 
pressure of MA, referred to as PMA. When 3.3 Pa MA is introduced to a clean NaY surface at 275 
ºC, we observe the characteristic sodium acetate FTIR band at 1585 cm-1, as well as weak bands 
at 1724 cm-1 and 1709 cm-1 attributed to the (C=O) mode of MA (Figure 6a).42 The 3644 cm-1 
BAS mode is not present, because the ester species donates a methyl group to the surface rather 
than a proton, generating a surface O–CH3 species.15 As PMA is increased to 130 Pa, the intensities 
of both the molecular MA and sodium acetate bands increase, and two new bands appear at 1444

and 
symmetric

modes 
of 
the 
C2–methyl 
group, 
respectively (Figure 6b-f).42 Under 23 
kPa MA (the vapor pressure at 20 ºC), the 
signal again saturates in the region of the 
(C=O) mode, the 1585 cm-1 band grows 
compared to 130 Pa and no features 
appear near 3645 cm-1 (Figure S6).  
 
 MA generates less adsorbed sodium 
acetate than AA at the same partial pressure of the corresponding gas phase species, indicating the 
acidity of the adsorbate affects the degree of ion exchange (Figure 2a). The amount of sodium 
acetate generated by MA is quantified based on the integrated area of the ([O–C–O]–) mode at 
1585 cm-1 following the same methodology discussed above for AA. [NaAcet] generated by MA 
increases from a minimum of 7.5 µmol/gcat at 3.3 Pa of MA to a maximum of 53 µmol/gcat under 
23 kPa of MA (Figure 2). Although the increase in [NaAcet] is not as steep at low pressures, the 
overall curve appears to follow a Langmuir chemisorption isotherm, similar to AA. Fitting the data 
to a dissociative Langmuir adsorption isotherm with [NaAcet]max = 60 µmol/gcat, we calculate the 
∆Gads275C = – 88 kJ/mol.  
When water is introduced to an MA-saturated NaY sample at 275 ºC, the FTIR spectrum 
between 3700 – 3500 cm-1 is very similar to when water is introduced to clean NaY, suggesting 
that the extrinsic BAS generated by MA and water cannot be directly observed via the FTIR 
spectroscopy (Figure 7). Introducing water to a NaY sample that has been saturated by MA

generates two new, broad absorption bands at 3635 cm-1 and 3550 cm-1 (Figure 7a). We have 
previously attributed these bands to extrinsic BAS generated by water hydrolyzing surface the O–
CH3 modes.15 However, further investigation reveals that this assignment is incorrect. First, there 
is a ~10 cm-1 shift from the standard 3645 cm-1 location for the framework (AlO–H) mode of 
FAU, which is directly observed when AA is adsorbed (Figure 1). Additionally, when pure water 
is adsorbed to clean NaY at 275 ºC, the same vibrational bands appear at 3635 cm-1 and 3550 cm-
1, with similar intensities (Figure 7b). These findings indicate these bands should be attributed to 
(O–H) modes of H2O that are particular to adsorption on NaY, i.e., water interacting with surface 
Na+ or hydrogen-bonding with framework oxygens as previously suggested.43,44 The 3635 cm-1 
band cannot be attributed to extrinsic BAS because the behavior when co-feeding MA with IPA is 
the opposite of the behavior when co-feeding just H2O. We have previously shown that the IPA 
dehydration rate on NaY decreases as the partial pressure of co-fed water increases.18 By contrast, 
the total activity for IPA dehydration increases significantly when co-feeding MA (Figure 8). This 
suggests that the spectroscopic modes observed after introducing water cannot be directly 
correlated to extrinsic BAS on the framework, in contrast to our previous conclusions.15,16 It is 
possible that the intensity of the 3635 cm-1 mode masks any possible BAS-attributable band at 
3645 cm-1. Thus, no distinct spectroscopic feature corresponding to the BAS generated by the 
interaction between methyl acetate and NaY in the presence of water is observed.  
 
Spectroscopic and kinetic experiments indicate that despite the absence of the 3645 cm-1 
spectroscopic band, MA (with H2O) does generate extrinsic BAS on the NaY framework that are 
active for IPA dehydration. When co-feeding MA, the increased IPA dehydration rate compared 
to the background NaY suggests the formation of new BAS on the surface. Introducing pyridine 
to a NaY surface saturated with MA and H2O at 275 C generates the characteristic vibrational

band of protonated pyridinium at 1542 cm-1 (Figure S7). Pyridine protonation corroborates the 
assertion that the combination of MA and H2O generates extrinsic BAS on NaY, although the 3645 
cm-1 mode is not directly observed. A previous study of partially proton-exchanged Na/H-ZSM-5 
zeolites have shown that when the material has high Na+ content, it contains BAS that can 
protonate pyridine despite the absence of the characteristic (AlO–H) band at ~3610 cm-1, similar 
to the extrinsic BAS generated by MA and H2O.45 The overall IPA dehydration rates measured 
when co-feeding MA are an order of magnitude lower than those measured at the same pressure 
of co-fed AA, suggesting either that fewer extrinsic BAS are generated or that the MA-generated 
BAS are not as active (Figure 8a). At a PMA of 3.3 Pa, the initial propylene formation rate (with 
the background NaY activity removed) is 2.9  10-6 mol/(gcats), which is a factor of 4 lower than 
the rate at equivalent PAA. As PMA is increased to 5 kPa, the initial rate increases by a factor of 5 
to 1.5  10-5 mol/(gcats), compared to a factor of 30 over the same range of PAA. As a note, no H2O 
is co-fed with MA and IPA, although a small amount of H2O is evolved during dehydration. At 
0.1 kPa of MA, co-feeding 0.1 kPa H2O did not affect the propylene rate (8.9  10-6 mol/(gcats) 
without H2O versus 9.0  10-6 mol/(gcats) with H2O), indicating that the small amount of water

evolved by dehydration is sufficient to hydrolyze the surface methoxy groups and the availability 
of H2O does not restrict the rate.  
Unlike AA, with MA as the cofeed the TOF per sodium acetate is constant at 0.26  0.02 
s-1 at all PMA (Figure 8b). As with AA, the initial propylene rate at each PMA is normalized by the 
appropriate [NaAcet] (measured via the quantitative FTIR spectroscopy). The constant TOF across 
all tested PMA suggests that there is a 1:1 correlation between [NaAcet] and extrinsic BAS formed 
by MA, as we initially assumed would be the case under AA. The TOF over MA-generated BAS 
is ~40% lower than over AA-generated BAS. Further, the Ea over MA-generated BAS is constant 
at 150  6 kJ/mol throughout the rate of PMA investigated (Figure 8c). This is 35 kJ/mol higher 
than the barrier over AA-generated sites, suggesting that the catalytic properties of H+ex are 
dependent on the precursor used to generate the extrinsic protons. The MA-promoted system has 
a constant pre-exponential factor (as expected given the constant TOF and activation energy), 
suggesting that the AA-promoted system also has a constant A value (Table S3). This validates 
the assumptions adopted when determining [H+ex] and [H+free], i.e., that all extrinsic sites generated 
by a particular adsorbate are equivalent (Table 3).  
 
The data suggest that MA adsorption follows the same model as AA adsorption, but when 
co-feeding MA the extrinsic BAS can only be generated via the interaction of a protic species with 
the surface AlO-CH3 group (Equation 3.4). If MA is ionized within the zeolite pore, the CH3+ 
species generated by ionization is unlikely to be catalytically active, because it cannot protonate 
other species. Therefore, unlike the organic acid which generates [H+free] sites in the pore network, 
extrinsic BAS generated by ester species must be associated with the zeolite surface. Water does 
not appear to be able to turn the CH3+ species generated by self-dissociation of MA into an active 
proton, and thus only framework-bound species can react. At high co-feed partial pressure, this

small change leads to substantial differences in catalytic activity. Further, the conversion of MA 
at the steady state is negligible, which suggests that extrinsic sites are rapidly formed at short TOS, 
and the subsequent conversion of MA required to maintain the constant site density is below the 
detection limit. Overall, the behavior of the organic acid and ester species in the zeolite-adsorbed 
phase appear to be similar, as both self-dissociate and form surface-associated extrinsic acid sites 
following the model described in Equation 3.4. The key difference between AA and MA is that 
the proton produced in the self-dissociation is active for IPA dehydration while the methyl group 
in the latter is not. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Through a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic experiments, we have elucidated the 
catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS generated on NaY by the dissociative adsorption of AA 
and MA. We demonstrate that the generation of sodium acetate species on NaY via ion exchange 
is governed by a Langmuir-type chemisorption equilibrium, where framework negative charges 
act as immobile adsorption sites. The generated sodium acetate salt species are shown to be 
strongly adsorbed within the zeolite pore (∆Gads = -101 kJ/mol and -88 kJ/mol for AA and MA, 
respectively). The activation energy and turnover frequency for IPA dehydration are determined 
in a broad range of partial pressures of co-fed AA or MA, and the results show that the catalytic 
properties of the extrinsic BAS depend on the identity of the precursor species. While AA-
promoted sites exhibit a lower activation barrier and faster rate for IPA dehydration than MA-
promoted sites, both extrinsic BAS are one order of magnitude less active than the intrinsic BAS 
on partially proton-exchanged NaHY. The linear correlation of the dehydration rate with the square 
root of AA partial pressure leads to a model for the generation of the extrinsic sites. Within the

highly ionic and confined area of the zeolite pore, AA can self-ionize, generating “free” protons 
which are active for IPA dehydration. Only protons which “associate” with the zeolite framework 
can be directly observed spectroscopically, causing the quantitative FTIR measurements to 
underestimate the total site concentration. Experiments co-feeding MA suggest that this model 
applies to the ester species as well, but the “free” CH3+ species are not catalytically active, i.e., 
only “associated” sites on the zeolite framework are active.
