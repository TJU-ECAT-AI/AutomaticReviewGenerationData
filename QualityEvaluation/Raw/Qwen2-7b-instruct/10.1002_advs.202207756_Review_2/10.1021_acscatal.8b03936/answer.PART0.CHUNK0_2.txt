[1] "In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic acid or ester precursor."
[2] "Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy."
[3] "The ion exchange is governed by a Langmuir-type adsorption equilibrium, where framework negative charges act as immobile adsorption sites."
[4] "Employing isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and TOF over both extrinsic and intrinsic BAS are measured, demonstrating the two types of sites have different catalytic properties."
[5] "The IPA dehydration rate exhibits a linear dependence on the square root of the partial pressure of co-fed AA, leading us to propose a novel model to describe how the dissociative adsorption of AA on NaY generates the extrinsic BAS."

In the study, a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic methods was utilized to showcase that the catalytic characteristics of extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY differ fundamentally from those on faujasites. These differences are also influenced by the type of organic acid or ester precursor used. Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) were employed as precursors to create extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY, and the density of these sites was determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The ion exchange process occurs according to a Langmuir-type adsorption equilibrium, with framework negative charges acting as immobile adsorption sites. Using isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and turnover frequencies (TOF) for both extrinsic and intrinsic Brnsted acid sites were measured, indicating that the two types of sites have distinct catalytic properties. The rate of IPA dehydration on NaY is directly proportional to the square root of the partial pressure of co-fed AA, suggesting a novel mechanism for how AA dissociative adsorption on NaY generates extrinsic Brnsted acid sites.

在这项研究中，结合光谱学和动力学方法展示了NaY上的外源性Brnsted酸位点的催化特性不仅与faujasites上的内在Brnsted酸位点存在根本差异，而且这些差异还取决于有机酸或酯类前体的类型。乙酸（AA）和甲基乙酸（MA）被用作产生NaY上外源性Brnsted酸位点的前体，并通过定量傅里叶变换红外光谱法确定了这些位点的密度。离子交换过程遵循Langmuir型吸附平衡，框架负电荷作为不可移动吸附位点。以异丙醇（IPA）脱水为模型反应，测量了两种类型的位点（外源性和内在性Brnsted酸位点）的活化能和周转频率（TOF），表明这两种位点具有不同的催化性质。IPA在NaY上的脱水速率与其共注入的AA的分压的平方根成正比，这提出了AA在NaY上的解离吸附如何生成外源性Brnsted酸位点的新机制。
