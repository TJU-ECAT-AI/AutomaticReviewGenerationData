This study demonstrates that Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be generated on a solely Lewis acidic zeolite, NaY, through the dissociative adsorption of organic acids. The acidic hydrogen of the organic species exchanges with surface Na+ cations, producing an adsorbed sodium salt and a BAS on the zeolite framework. These extrinsic BAS are confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine as a probe molecule and are found to be catalytically active in the decarbonylation of methyl lactate to acetaldehyde. The density of the extrinsic BAS is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The ion exchange process is governed by a Langmuir-type adsorption equilibrium, where framework negative charges serve as immobile adsorption sites. When employing isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and turnover frequencies (TOF) over both extrinsic and intrinsic BAS are measured, revealing differences in catalytic properties between the two types of sites. The rate of IPA dehydration is observed to have a linear dependence on the square root of the partial pressure of co-fed acetic acid, suggesting a novel mechanism for how acetic acid's dissociative adsorption on NaY generates the extrinsic BAS.

这项研究证明，可以通过有机酸的离解吸附在只有酸性位点的沸石NaY上生成Brnsted酸性位点（BAS）。有机酸中的酸性氢与表面Na+离子交换，产生吸附的钠盐和BAS在沸石骨架上。通过吡啶作为探针分子的傅立叶变换红外光谱法确认了这些外源BAS，并且它们被发现可以催化甲基乳酸脱羰化为乙醛。外源BAS的密度使用定量傅立叶变换红外光谱法确定。离子交换过程受Langmuir型吸附平衡的控制，框架负电荷充当不可移动吸附位点。当使用异丙醇（IPA）脱水作为模型反应时，对外源和内在BAS的活化能和周转频率（TOF）进行测量，揭示了两种类型位点之间的不同催化性质。IPA脱水速率观察到与共注入的乙酸部分压力的平方根成线性关系，这表明了一种新的机制来描述乙酸在NaY上的离解吸附如何生成外源BAS。
