[1] "In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic acid or ester precursor."
[2] "Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy."
[3] "When co-feeding methyl acetate, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY increases linearly with the quantity of spectroscopically measured Brnsted acid sites, which is attributed to the fact that the self-dissociation of methyl acetate does not generate active protons within the zeolite pore."

In the study, a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic methods was utilized to showcase that the catalytic characteristics of the extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY are distinct from those of intrinsic Brnsted acid sites on faujasites. Moreover, these extrinsic sites' performance is contingent upon the specific organic acid or ester precursor used. Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) served as precursors to create extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY, with the density of these sites determined through quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. When MA is co-fed, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY rises linearly with the measured quantity of Brnsted acid sites, indicating that the self-dissociation of MA does not produce active protons within the zeolite pore.

在这项研究中，使用了一种结合光谱学和动力学的方法来展示NaY上的外源性Brnsted酸位点的催化特性与方石英上的内源性Brnsted酸位点根本不同。此外，这些外源性位点的性能取决于所使用的特定有机酸或酯前体。乙酸（AA）和甲酸乙酯（MA）被用作在NaY上产生外源性Brnsted酸位点的前体，并通过定量傅里叶变换红外光谱法确定了这些位点的密度。当使用MA共喂养时，NaY上的异丙醇脱水速率随着通过光谱测量得到的Brnsted酸位点数量线性增加，这表明MA的自我解离不会在沸石孔内产生活性质子。
