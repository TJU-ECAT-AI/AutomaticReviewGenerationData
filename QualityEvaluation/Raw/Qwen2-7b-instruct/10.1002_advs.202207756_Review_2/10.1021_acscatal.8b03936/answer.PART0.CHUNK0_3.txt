[1] "In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic acid or ester precursor."
[2] "Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy."
[3] "We show that this model is also consistent with the observed activity of the extrinsic BAS generated by MA on NaY."

This study demonstrates that the catalytic properties of extrinsic Brnsted acid sites (BAS) on NaY, generated by acetic acid and methyl acetate, differ fundamentally from intrinsic BAS on faujasites. The properties depend on the type of organic acid or ester used as a precursor. Quantitative Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is utilized to determine the density of the extrinsic BAS generated by these precursors. The model proposed for the generation of extrinsic BAS is consistent with the observed catalytic activity of BAS generated by methyl acetate on NaY.

本研究显示，由乙酸和甲酸乙酯产生的NaY上的外源性Brnsted酸中心（BAS）的催化性质与faujasite上的内源性BAS有根本差异。这些性质依赖于用于生成BAS的有机酸或酯的类型。利用定量傅立叶变换红外光谱法确定了由这些前体产生的外源性BAS的密度。提出的模型与由甲酸乙酯在NaY上产生的BAS的观察到的催化活性一致。
