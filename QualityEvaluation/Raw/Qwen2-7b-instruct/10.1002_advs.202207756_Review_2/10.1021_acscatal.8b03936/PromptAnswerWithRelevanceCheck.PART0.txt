[1] "In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic acid or ester precursor."
[2] "Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy."
[3] "When co-feeding methyl acetate, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY increases linearly with the quantity of spectroscopically measured Brnsted acid sites, which is attributed to the fact that the self-dissociation of methyl acetate does not generate active protons within the zeolite pore."

In the study, a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic methods was utilized to showcase that the catalytic characteristics of the extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY are distinct from those of intrinsic Brnsted acid sites on faujasites. Moreover, these extrinsic sites' performance is contingent upon the specific organic acid or ester precursor used. Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) served as precursors to create extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY, with the density of these sites determined through quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. When MA is co-fed, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY rises linearly with the measured quantity of Brnsted acid sites, indicating that the self-dissociation of MA does not produce active protons within the zeolite pore.

在这项研究中，使用了一种结合光谱学和动力学的方法来展示NaY上的外源性Brnsted酸位点的催化特性与方石英上的内源性Brnsted酸位点根本不同。此外，这些外源性位点的性能取决于所使用的特定有机酸或酯前体。乙酸（AA）和甲酸乙酯（MA）被用作在NaY上产生外源性Brnsted酸位点的前体，并通过定量傅里叶变换红外光谱法确定了这些位点的密度。当使用MA共喂养时，NaY上的异丙醇脱水速率随着通过光谱测量得到的Brnsted酸位点数量线性增加，这表明MA的自我解离不会在沸石孔内产生活性质子。

This study demonstrates that Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be generated on a solely Lewis acidic zeolite, NaY, through the dissociative adsorption of organic acids. The acidic hydrogen of the organic species exchanges with surface Na+ cations, producing an adsorbed sodium salt and a BAS on the zeolite framework. These extrinsic BAS are confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine as a probe molecule and are found to be catalytically active in the decarbonylation of methyl lactate to acetaldehyde. The density of the extrinsic BAS is determined using quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The ion exchange process is governed by a Langmuir-type adsorption equilibrium, where framework negative charges serve as immobile adsorption sites. When employing isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and turnover frequencies (TOF) over both extrinsic and intrinsic BAS are measured, revealing differences in catalytic properties between the two types of sites. The rate of IPA dehydration is observed to have a linear dependence on the square root of the partial pressure of co-fed acetic acid, suggesting a novel mechanism for how acetic acid's dissociative adsorption on NaY generates the extrinsic BAS.

这项研究证明，可以通过有机酸的离解吸附在只有酸性位点的沸石NaY上生成Brnsted酸性位点（BAS）。有机酸中的酸性氢与表面Na+离子交换，产生吸附的钠盐和BAS在沸石骨架上。通过吡啶作为探针分子的傅立叶变换红外光谱法确认了这些外源BAS，并且它们被发现可以催化甲基乳酸脱羰化为乙醛。外源BAS的密度使用定量傅立叶变换红外光谱法确定。离子交换过程受Langmuir型吸附平衡的控制，框架负电荷充当不可移动吸附位点。当使用异丙醇（IPA）脱水作为模型反应时，对外源和内在BAS的活化能和周转频率（TOF）进行测量，揭示了两种类型位点之间的不同催化性质。IPA脱水速率观察到与共注入的乙酸部分压力的平方根成线性关系，这表明了一种新的机制来描述乙酸在NaY上的离解吸附如何生成外源BAS。

在这项研究中，结合光谱学和动力学方法展示了NaY上的外源性Brnsted酸位点的催化特性不仅与faujasites上的内在Brnsted酸位点存在根本差异，而且这些差异还取决于有机酸或酯类前体的类型。乙酸（AA）和甲基乙酸（MA）被用作产生NaY上外源性Brnsted酸位点的前体，并通过定量傅里叶变换红外光谱法确定了这些位点的密度。离子交换过程遵循Langmuir型吸附平衡，框架负电荷作为不可移动吸附位点。以异丙醇（IPA）脱水为模型反应，测量了两种类型的位点（外源性和内在性Brnsted酸位点）的活化能和周转频率（TOF），表明这两种位点具有不同的催化性质。IPA在NaY上的脱水速率与其共注入的AA的分压的平方根成正比，这提出了AA在NaY上的解离吸附如何生成外源性Brnsted酸位点的新机制。

This study demonstrates that the catalytic properties of extrinsic Brnsted acid sites (BAS) on NaY, generated by acetic acid and methyl acetate, differ fundamentally from intrinsic BAS on faujasites. The properties depend on the type of organic acid or ester used as a precursor. Quantitative Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is utilized to determine the density of the extrinsic BAS generated by these precursors.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by parameters like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, questions the notion of uniform performance across the entire catalyst. This variability suggests that the actual functionality of the active sites is not uniformly distributed throughout the material, contrary to the assumption of homogeneity. The non-linear correlation between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic efficiency introduces complexity in predicting and optimizing the catalyst's performance based on these parameters alone.

This finding implies that the true nature of the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more nuanced than previously thought. It necessitates a deeper investigation into how the spatial arrangement and chemical state of Ga influence its catalytic activity. Understanding these intricacies is crucial for optimizing the catalyst design and operation conditions to achieve maximum efficiency and selectivity in the desired chemical reactions. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms governing the formation and reactivity of Ga species within the zeolite framework, aiming to tailor the catalyst's properties for enhanced performance in specific applications.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，介孔Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受到如Ga负载和Si/Al比等参数的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这种变异性表明，实际的活性位点功能并非整个催化剂均匀分布，与之前的同质性假设相矛盾。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系引入了复杂性，这使得仅根据这些参数预测和优化催化剂性能变得困难。

这一发现意味着Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真实活性位点性质比以前认为的更为复杂。它要求对Ga物种在沸石框架内的形成和反应机制进行更深入的研究，以调整催化剂的特性以实现最佳效率和选择性。未来的研究应集中于阐明特定机制如何控制Ga物种在沸石框架中的形成及其活性，以期为特定应用优化催化剂设计和操作条件。
