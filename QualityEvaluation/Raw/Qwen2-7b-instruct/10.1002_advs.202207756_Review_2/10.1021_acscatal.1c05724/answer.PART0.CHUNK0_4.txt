The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. This is because the non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Understanding these nuances can lead to the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for better performance in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation.
