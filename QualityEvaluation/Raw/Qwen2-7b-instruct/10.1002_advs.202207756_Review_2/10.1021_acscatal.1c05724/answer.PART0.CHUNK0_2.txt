The variability in the structure and distribution of intraporous gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by parameters like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, complicates the notion of uniform performance in partial dehydrogenation reactions (PDH). This indicates that the actual functioning of active sites within these catalysts is more complex than previously thought, and the observed non-linear correlation between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic efficiency suggests that achieving optimal Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst performance requires a nuanced understanding beyond simple stoichiometric relationships.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，内部孔隙中的镓（Ga）物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等参数的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这表明这些催化剂的实际活性位点功能比以往认为的更为复杂。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非线性关系暗示，实现Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的最佳性能需要超越简单化学计量关系的深入理解。
