          [1] "The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity."

          The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, affected by factors like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, challenges the notion of uniform propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity because it suggests that the actual performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may not be consistent across the entire material due to differences in the local environment of gallium atoms.

          在H-ZSM-5沸石中，封装Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受如Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的整体性能可能不一致，因为不同局部环境下的镓原子结构存在差异。

          [2] "What implications does the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance have for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts?"

          The observed non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has significant implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and optimizing their use. It indicates that there might be an optimal range of Ga/Al ratios where the catalytic activity peaks, which could be different from what is predicted based on simpler models.

          观察到的Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系对理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的真实活性位点及其优化具有重要意义。它表明可能存在一个镓/铝比的最佳范围，在此范围内催化活性达到峰值，这可能与基于更简单模型的预测不同。
