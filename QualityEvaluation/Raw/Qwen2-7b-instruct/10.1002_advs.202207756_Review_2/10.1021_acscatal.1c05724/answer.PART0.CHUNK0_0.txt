The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, challenges the notion of uniform propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity across the material. This suggests that the activity of the catalyst might not be evenly distributed, potentially leading to localized hotspots of reactivity. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that there isn't a straightforward correlation between these parameters and the efficiency of the catalyst. Instead, there might be an optimal ratio where the catalytic activity peaks before declining again. This complexity has significant implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and optimizing their performance. It implies that achieving the best catalytic results requires a nuanced approach to balancing the Ga/Al ratio, rather than assuming a simple linear relationship.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，封装Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受如Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这表明催化剂的活性可能并非均匀分布，可能存在活性热点区域。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系对理解活性位点的真实性质以及优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。这暗示了在最佳的Ga/Al比率下，催化活性达到峰值，之后可能开始下降。这种复杂性对理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真正活性位点以及优化其性能有重要影响。这意味着要实现最佳催化结果，需要精确平衡Ga/Al比率，而不是简单地假设线性关系。
