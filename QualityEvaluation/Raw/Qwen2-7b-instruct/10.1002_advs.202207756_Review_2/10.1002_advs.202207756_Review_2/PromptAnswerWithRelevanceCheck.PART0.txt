How does the variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity, and what implications does the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance have for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts?

Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.
Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]
At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).
The authors proposed the presence of two types of Ga sites associated with paired framework Al atoms: i) [GaOH]2+ exchanged with two protons that were next-nearest neighbors (NNN), and ii) [Ga(OH)2]+ exchanged with a proton with another proton as the next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN), as in Figure 6e.
The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods, however, cannot be ruled out, although it has not been substantiated by experimental evidence.

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance suggests that the true nature of active sites is more complex than initially thought. The presence of different types of Ga species, including Lewis acidic GaxOy species and two types of Ga sites associated with paired framework Al atoms, indicates that the distribution of framework Al atoms plays a crucial role in determining the activity of Ga species. This complexity implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a detailed understanding of how the structure of Ga species is affected by the Si/Al ratio and Ga loading. The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods adds another layer of complexity, necessitating careful consideration of preparation methods to achieve the desired activity.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔Ga物种结构和分布的可变性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质远比最初设想的要复杂。不同类型的Ga物种的存在，包括Lewis酸性GaxOy物种以及与框架Al原子配对的两种Ga位点，表明框架Al原子的分布对Ga物种的活性起着关键作用。这种复杂性意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga物种结构如何受到Si/Al比和Ga负载的影响。不同合成方法可能优先定位阳离子Ga物种的可能性进一步增加了复杂性，需要仔细考虑准备方法以实现所需的活性。

2.1.2 Impact of Al Distribution in H-ZSM-5 on the Ga Speciation
A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH. 

Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. 

However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.

Impact of the Ga/Al Ratio on the Ga Speciation
Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga (Figure 5a).

The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely.

Quantitative determination of Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings revealed a 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]

At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).

Deng and co-workers also confirmed the synergy between BAS and Ga cations species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites in the methanol-to-aromatics reaction.[123]

Solid state NMR spectroscopy has been employed to provide evidence for the migration of Ga species into zeolites pores, and importantly, to estimate the distances of BAS pairs and Ga-H pairs through 1H1H SQ-DQ and 1H71Ga S-RESPDOR, respectively.[123-125]

Bell and co-workers recognized the importance of the framework Al distribution in PDH more explicitly.[76, 100]

Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (under oxidizing conditions at 450 C) showed that the intensity of the BAS OH group (3593 cm1) decreased monotonically as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, a result of the replacement of BAS by Ga3+ species (Figure 6a).

Subsequent reduction of [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ led to the formation of [HGaOH]+H+, and then [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+H+, respectively (Figure 6e).

Thermodynamic phase analysis (Figure 6f,g) showed that the Ga3+ structure was dependent on both H2 pressure and temperature: the Ga-OH group in both [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ sites are stable at either lower temperature or low H2 pressure.

High H2 pressure and high-temperature lead to the formation of corresponding GaHx species, which were regarded as stable species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts at high temperatures.

The increase in PDH rate with Ga/Al ratios (Figure 6h) showed that PDH rates increase as Ga/Al ratios rise to 0.1 and level off with the further increase in Ga/Al ratios.

Ga normalized PDH rates showed a decreasing catalytic rate with the increase of Ga loading (Figure 6i), indicating the highly active Ga species were introduced at low Ga loading, and a higher Ga loading led to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species.

The [GaH]2+ (estimated via NH3-TPD) normalized reaction rate was independent of the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 6j), based on which [GaH]2+ was assigned as the active center in PDH.

Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al.[76, 77] both pointed out the importance of framework Al pairs in the formation of active species for PDH, however, they proposed different active site structures and reaction mechanisms.

Impact of Ga/Al and Si/Al Ratios on Ga Speciation
To gain a more thorough picture of Ga speciation, it is important to systematically investigate Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings.

Yuan et al. investigated Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support, that is, 15, 28, and 39, and each in a wide range of Ga loadings.[54, 55, 110]

As mentioned above, a 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio was observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios at sufficiently low Ga/Al ratio (Figure 7a).

The Ga/BAS exchange ratio started to deviate from unity at Ga/BAS ratios of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.4 on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), respectively, suggesting that not all Ga existed as cationic species.

BAS cannot be completely exchanged by Ga at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7.

This is an indication that the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores is more favored as BAS becomes scarce,[100] and that a fraction of BAS could be located at crystallographic positions inaccessible to Ga species.

1. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity by demonstrating that different Ga species may exhibit varying structures, activities, and interactions within the zeolite framework. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously assumed. The non-uniformity in Ga speciation across different Ga/Al ratios suggests that the active sites are influenced by the specific arrangement of Ga and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) within the zeolite structure.

2. The implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are significant. The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance highlights the importance of considering the distribution of framework Al pairs and the balance between Ga and BAS in determining the activity of Ga species. This complexity challenges the traditional view that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity. The discovery of different active site structures proposed by Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al. underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of how the arrangement of Ga and BAS influences the formation of active sites.

3. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a systematic investigation of Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings. This approach allows researchers to gain a more comprehensive picture of Ga speciation, which is crucial for identifying the specific conditions under which different active sites emerge. By understanding how the Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, scientists can tailor the composition of the zeolite support to enhance the activity of Ga species. This knowledge is essential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts that exploit the unique properties of Ga/H-ZSM-5 for various applications, including chemical transformations involving propane cracking and methanol-to-aromatics reactions.

1. H-ZSM-5中不同镓物种的结构和分布的变异性挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，表明不同的镓物种可能表现出不同的结构、活性和与沸石框架的相互作用。催化性能随镓/铝比非单调变化所观察到的复杂性表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点的真正本质比先前假设的要复杂得多。不同镓/铝比例下镓物种的非均匀性表明，活性位点受到沸石结构内镓和Brnsted酸位点（BAS）排列的影响。

2. 对于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中真实活性位点的性质，这些影响是重要的。催化性能随镓/铝比例非单调变化的事实强调了考虑框架Al对和镓与BAS之间的平衡对于确定镓物种活性的重要性。这种复杂性挑战了传统观点，即所有内含镓物种具有相似的结构和PDH活性。Schreiber等和Phadke等提出的不同活性位点结构揭示了在确定活性位点时需要更细致的理解，即镓和BAS的排列如何影响活性位点的形成。

3. 优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要系统研究具有不同框架Al对密度和镓负载的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品。这种方法允许研究人员获得关于镓物种的全面图景，这对于识别在不同条件下出现的不同活性位点至关重要。通过了解Si/Al比率如何影响框架Al对的密度，科学家可以调整支撑物的组成，以增强镓物种的活性。这种知识对于开发利用Ga/H-ZSM-5的独特性质进行各种应用（包括涉及丙烷裂解和甲醇至芳烃反应的化学转换）的更高效和选择性催化剂至关重要。

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. This is because the structure and distribution of Ga species can significantly affect their activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites is more complex than previously thought. The non-uniformity in Ga species suggests that different types of active sites may exist within the same catalyst, with varying activities depending on the specific Ga species and their distribution. This complexity necessitates a more detailed understanding of how Ga species are formed and distributed within the zeolite structure. The implications for optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involve developing strategies to control the formation of specific active Ga species, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance. By systematically investigating Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings, researchers can gain insights into the relationship between the structure of Ga species and their catalytic activity, leading to the development of more efficient catalysts.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，镓物种的结构和分布的可变性，受镓负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这是因为镓物种的结构和分布可以显著影响它们的活性。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质比之前想象的要复杂得多。这种不一致性表明，在同一催化剂中可能存在不同类型的活性位点，其活性取决于特定的镓物种及其分布。这种复杂性要求对镓物种在沸石结构中的形成和分布有更深入的理解。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的含义涉及开发控制特定活性镓物种形成策略的方法，从而增强整体催化性能。通过系统地研究具有不同框架Al对密度和镓负载的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品，研究人员可以获得关于镓物种结构与其催化活性之间关系的洞察，进而发展出更高效的催化剂。

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites is complex. At lower Ga/Al ratios, the exchange ratio between Ga and Brönsted acidic sites (BAS) is 1:1, suggesting that most Ga exists as cationic species. However, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, Lewis acidic species start to appear, indicating a change in the structure of intraporous Ga species. This leads to an increase in PDH rates up to a certain Ga/Al ratio, beyond which the rates level off. Additionally, the normalized PDH rates decrease with higher Ga loading, suggesting that not all Ga species are equally active. These findings imply that the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires careful consideration of the interplay between Ga loading, Si/Al ratio, and the structure of intraporous Ga species to achieve maximum catalytic performance.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内含镓物种结构和分布的变化，受到镓负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质是复杂的。在较低的Ga/Al比下，Ga和Brönsted酸性位点（BAS）之间的交换比为1:1，表明大多数Ga以阳离子形式存在。然而，随着Ga/Al比的增加，出现Lewis酸性物种，表明内含镓物种的结构发生变化。这导致PDH速率在某个Ga/Al比下增加，超过这个比率后速率趋于稳定。此外，随着Ga负载的增加，归一化PDH速率降低，表明并非所有镓物种具有相同的活性。这些发现意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要仔细考虑Ga负载、Si/Al比以及内含镓物种结构之间的相互作用，以实现最佳催化性能。

For Ga/Al ratios below 0.3, each Ga3+ replaces approximately two Brnsted acid OH groups, consistent with the formation of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations.
For Ga/Al ratios higher than 0.3, the BAS was not exchanged further, a result assigned to the formation of GaOx oligomers that do not occupy cation-exchanged sites.
The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods, however, cannot be ruled out, although it has not been substantiated by experimental evidence.
Assuming Al is distributed randomly in the zeolite framework, Al-rich zeolites would have higher densities of paired framework Al sites, which could have a sizable impact on Ga speciation.
