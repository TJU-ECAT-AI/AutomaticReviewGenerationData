Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.

Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]

At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).

The increase in PDH rate with Ga/Al ratios (Figure 6h) showed that PDH rates increase as Ga/Al ratios rise to 0.1 and level off with the further increase in Ga/Al ratios.

Ga normalized PDH rates showed a decreasing catalytic rate with the increase of Ga loading (Figure 6i), indicating the highly active Ga species were introduced at low Ga loading, and a higher Ga loading led to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species.

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites is complex. At lower Ga/Al ratios, the exchange ratio between Ga and Brönsted acidic sites (BAS) is 1:1, suggesting that most Ga exists as cationic species. However, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, Lewis acidic species start to appear, indicating a change in the structure of intraporous Ga species. This leads to an increase in PDH rates up to a certain Ga/Al ratio, beyond which the rates level off. Additionally, the normalized PDH rates decrease with higher Ga loading, suggesting that not all Ga species are equally active. These findings imply that the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires careful consideration of the interplay between Ga loading, Si/Al ratio, and the structure of intraporous Ga species to achieve maximum catalytic performance.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内含镓物种结构和分布的变化，受到镓负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质是复杂的。在较低的Ga/Al比下，Ga和Brönsted酸性位点（BAS）之间的交换比为1:1，表明大多数Ga以阳离子形式存在。然而，随着Ga/Al比的增加，出现Lewis酸性物种，表明内含镓物种的结构发生变化。这导致PDH速率在某个Ga/Al比下增加，超过这个比率后速率趋于稳定。此外，随着Ga负载的增加，归一化PDH速率降低，表明并非所有镓物种具有相同的活性。这些发现意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要仔细考虑Ga负载、Si/Al比以及内含镓物种结构之间的相互作用，以实现最佳催化性能。
