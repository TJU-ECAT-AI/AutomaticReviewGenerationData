2.1.2 Impact of Al Distribution in H-ZSM-5 on the Ga Speciation
A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH.
Impact of the Ga/Al Ratio on the Ga Speciation Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga.
The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely.
Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]
At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).
Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (under oxidizing conditions at 450 C) showed that the intensity of the BAS OH group (3593 cm1) decreased monotonically as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, a result of the replacement of BAS by Ga3+ species (Figure 6a).
For Ga/Al ratios below 0.3, each Ga3+ replaces approximately two Brnsted acid OH groups, consistent with the formation of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations.
For Ga/Al ratios higher than 0.3, the BAS was not exchanged further, a result assigned to the formation of GaOx oligomers that do not occupy cation-exchanged sites.
The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods, however, cannot be ruled out, although it has not been substantiated by experimental evidence.
Assuming Al is distributed randomly in the zeolite framework, Al-rich zeolites would have higher densities of paired framework Al sites, which could have a sizable impact on Ga speciation.
Yuan et al. investigated Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support, that is, 15, 28, and 39, and each in a wide range of Ga loadings.[54, 55, 110]
As mentioned above, a 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio was observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios at sufficiently low Ga/Al ratio (Figure 7a).
The Ga/BAS exchange ratio started to deviate from unity at Ga/BAS ratios of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.4 on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), respectively, suggesting that not all Ga existed as cationic species.
BAS cannot be completely exchanged by Ga at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7.
This is an indication that the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores is more favored as BAS becomes scarce,[100]
and that a fraction of BAS could be located at crystallographic positions inaccessible to Ga species.

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. This is evidenced by the non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance, indicating that the true nature of active sites is not uniform across the spectrum of Ga loading and Si/Al ratio. The observed deviations from a 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio and the formation of Ga oligomers suggest that the distribution of active Ga species is complex and depends on the specific conditions of the zeolite sample. These findings imply that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a nuanced understanding of how the structure of the zeolite framework influences the speciation and activity of intraporous Ga species.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔Ga物种结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这种关系的非单调性表明，不同Ga负载和Si/Al比下的催化性能存在差异，真正的活性位点并非完全一致。观察到的Ga/BAS交换比例偏离1:1和Ga聚集体的形成表明，内孔Ga物种的活性取决于特定的沸石样品条件。这些发现暗示，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要对框架结构如何影响内孔Ga物种的分布和活性有深入理解。这些发现对于理解活性位点的真实性质以及优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。
