Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.
Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]
At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).
The authors proposed the presence of two types of Ga sites associated with paired framework Al atoms: i) [GaOH]2+ exchanged with two protons that were next-nearest neighbors (NNN), and ii) [Ga(OH)2]+ exchanged with a proton with another proton as the next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN), as in Figure 6e.
The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods, however, cannot be ruled out, although it has not been substantiated by experimental evidence.

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance suggests that the true nature of active sites is more complex than initially thought. The presence of different types of Ga species, including Lewis acidic GaxOy species and two types of Ga sites associated with paired framework Al atoms, indicates that the distribution of framework Al atoms plays a crucial role in determining the activity of Ga species. This complexity implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a detailed understanding of how the structure of Ga species is affected by the Si/Al ratio and Ga loading. The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods adds another layer of complexity, necessitating careful consideration of preparation methods to achieve the desired activity.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔Ga物种结构和分布的可变性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质远比最初设想的要复杂。不同类型的Ga物种的存在，包括Lewis酸性GaxOy物种以及与框架Al原子配对的两种Ga位点，表明框架Al原子的分布对Ga物种的活性起着关键作用。这种复杂性意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga物种结构如何受到Si/Al比和Ga负载的影响。不同合成方法可能优先定位阳离子Ga物种的可能性进一步增加了复杂性，需要仔细考虑准备方法以实现所需的活性。
