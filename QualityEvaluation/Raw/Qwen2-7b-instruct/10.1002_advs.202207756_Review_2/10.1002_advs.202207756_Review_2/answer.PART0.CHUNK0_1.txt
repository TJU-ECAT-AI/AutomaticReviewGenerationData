2.1.2 Impact of Al Distribution in H-ZSM-5 on the Ga Speciation
A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH. 

Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. 

However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.

Impact of the Ga/Al Ratio on the Ga Speciation
Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga (Figure 5a).

The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely.

Quantitative determination of Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings revealed a 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]

At Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b).

Deng and co-workers also confirmed the synergy between BAS and Ga cations species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites in the methanol-to-aromatics reaction.[123]

Solid state NMR spectroscopy has been employed to provide evidence for the migration of Ga species into zeolites pores, and importantly, to estimate the distances of BAS pairs and Ga-H pairs through 1H1H SQ-DQ and 1H71Ga S-RESPDOR, respectively.[123-125]

Bell and co-workers recognized the importance of the framework Al distribution in PDH more explicitly.[76, 100]

Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (under oxidizing conditions at 450 C) showed that the intensity of the BAS OH group (3593 cm1) decreased monotonically as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, a result of the replacement of BAS by Ga3+ species (Figure 6a).

Subsequent reduction of [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ led to the formation of [HGaOH]+H+, and then [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+H+, respectively (Figure 6e).

Thermodynamic phase analysis (Figure 6f,g) showed that the Ga3+ structure was dependent on both H2 pressure and temperature: the Ga-OH group in both [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ sites are stable at either lower temperature or low H2 pressure.

High H2 pressure and high-temperature lead to the formation of corresponding GaHx species, which were regarded as stable species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts at high temperatures.

The increase in PDH rate with Ga/Al ratios (Figure 6h) showed that PDH rates increase as Ga/Al ratios rise to 0.1 and level off with the further increase in Ga/Al ratios.

Ga normalized PDH rates showed a decreasing catalytic rate with the increase of Ga loading (Figure 6i), indicating the highly active Ga species were introduced at low Ga loading, and a higher Ga loading led to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species.

The [GaH]2+ (estimated via NH3-TPD) normalized reaction rate was independent of the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 6j), based on which [GaH]2+ was assigned as the active center in PDH.

Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al.[76, 77] both pointed out the importance of framework Al pairs in the formation of active species for PDH, however, they proposed different active site structures and reaction mechanisms.

Impact of Ga/Al and Si/Al Ratios on Ga Speciation
To gain a more thorough picture of Ga speciation, it is important to systematically investigate Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings.

Yuan et al. investigated Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support, that is, 15, 28, and 39, and each in a wide range of Ga loadings.[54, 55, 110]

As mentioned above, a 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio was observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios at sufficiently low Ga/Al ratio (Figure 7a).

The Ga/BAS exchange ratio started to deviate from unity at Ga/BAS ratios of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.4 on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), respectively, suggesting that not all Ga existed as cationic species.

BAS cannot be completely exchanged by Ga at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7.

This is an indication that the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores is more favored as BAS becomes scarce,[100] and that a fraction of BAS could be located at crystallographic positions inaccessible to Ga species.

1. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity by demonstrating that different Ga species may exhibit varying structures, activities, and interactions within the zeolite framework. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously assumed. The non-uniformity in Ga speciation across different Ga/Al ratios suggests that the active sites are influenced by the specific arrangement of Ga and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) within the zeolite structure.

2. The implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are significant. The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance highlights the importance of considering the distribution of framework Al pairs and the balance between Ga and BAS in determining the activity of Ga species. This complexity challenges the traditional view that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity. The discovery of different active site structures proposed by Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al. underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of how the arrangement of Ga and BAS influences the formation of active sites.

3. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a systematic investigation of Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings. This approach allows researchers to gain a more comprehensive picture of Ga speciation, which is crucial for identifying the specific conditions under which different active sites emerge. By understanding how the Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, scientists can tailor the composition of the zeolite support to enhance the activity of Ga species. This knowledge is essential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts that exploit the unique properties of Ga/H-ZSM-5 for various applications, including chemical transformations involving propane cracking and methanol-to-aromatics reactions.
