The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Specifically, the preference of Ga+ to exchange with paired BAS sites over isolated ones, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites at low Si/Al ratios, and the inability of isolated Ga+ sites to react with water at 150°C to form GaOOH, suggest that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 might exhibit distinct properties. This heterogeneity in Ga speciation could explain the observed differences in catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing Ga loading and Si/Al ratio could lead to more effective catalysts for PDH reactions.\"", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

This variation indicates that the active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are not uniformly distributed or structured, leading to complex interactions that may not follow a simple linear relationship. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic performance suggests that there might be an optimal ratio where the catalyst's efficiency peaks before declining.
