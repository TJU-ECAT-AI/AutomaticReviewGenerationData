            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/jacs.7b12901], [10.1021/acscatal.1c05724], [10.1021/acscatal.7b03211], [10.1021/acscatal.0c04906], and others. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Specifically, the preference of Ga+ to exchange with paired BAS sites over isolated ones, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites at low Si/Al ratios, and the inability of isolated Ga+ sites to react with water at 150°C to form GaOOH, suggest that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 might exhibit distinct properties. This heterogeneity in Ga speciation could explain the observed differences in catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing Ga loading and Si/Al ratio could lead to more effective catalysts for PDH reactions.

            根据参考文献[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004]的深入分析，从参考文献[10.1021/jacs.7b12901]、[10.1021/acscatal.1c05724]、[10.1021/acscatal.7b03211]、[10.1021/acscatal.0c04906]等文献中综合理解。H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种在孔内的分布结构和分布受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性位点的真实性质比之前认为的更为复杂。具体来说，Ga+倾向于与成对的BAS位点交换而非孤立的BAS位点，在低Si/Al比率的样品中形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立的Ga+位点无法在150°C下与水反应形成GaOOH，这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5中的活性位点可能表现出不同的特性。这种Ga物种异质性可以解释催化性能的观察差异，表明优化Ga负载量和Si/Al比可以导致更有效的PDH反应催化剂。
