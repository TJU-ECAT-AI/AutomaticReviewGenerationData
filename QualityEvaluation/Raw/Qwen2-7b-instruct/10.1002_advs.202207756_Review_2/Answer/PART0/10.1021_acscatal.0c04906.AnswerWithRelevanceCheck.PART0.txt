          The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because these variables affect the uniformity of the active sites. This leads to a non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance. The implication is that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought, and optimizing these catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how different parameters influence their performance.

          在H-ZSM-5沸石中，孤立镓物种的孔内结构和分布受到诸如镓负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，这挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这些变量影响活性位点的均匀性。这导致了Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系。这意味着Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真实活性位点比以前认为的要复杂得多，优化这些催化剂需要更深入地理解不同参数如何影响其性能。
