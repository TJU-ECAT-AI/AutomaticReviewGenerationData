The non-monotonic relationship observed between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic performance has implications for understanding the true nature of the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and for optimizing these catalysts.

The observed non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has significant implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and optimizing their use. It indicates that there might be an optimal range of Ga/Al ratios where the catalytic activity peaks, which could be different from what is predicted based on simpler models.
