          "[1] 'Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+.'  
          '[2] 'Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios.'
          '[3] 'Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio.'
          '[4] 'A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS.'
          '[5] 'Up to 80% of BAS are consumed at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7, suggesting complete removal of BAS cannot be achieved with excess Ga.'
          '[6] 'Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites.'
          '[7] 'This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water.'"

          "The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Specifically, the preference of Ga+ to exchange with paired BAS sites over isolated ones, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites at low Si/Al ratios, and the inability of isolated Ga+ sites to react with water at 150°C to form GaOOH, suggest that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 might exhibit distinct properties. This heterogeneity in Ga speciation could explain the observed differences in catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing Ga loading and Si/Al ratio could lead to more effective catalysts for PDH reactions."

          "H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔中镓物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真实活性位点比以前认为的更为复杂。具体来说，在低Si/Al比率下，Ga+倾向于与配对BAS位点交换而不是孤立的BAS位点，导致形成Ga+H+对位点，这可能解释了为什么PDH活性表现出不同的特性。此外，孤立的Ga+位点不能在150°C时与水反应形成GaOOH，这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5中的活性位点可能存在不同的性质。这种Ga物种异质性可以解释观察到的催化性能差异，表明优化Ga负载和Si/Al比率可能导致更有效的PDH反应催化剂。"
