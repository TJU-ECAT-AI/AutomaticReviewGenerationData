The variability in the structure and distribution of intraporous gallium (Ga) species within hydrogen-modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, challenges the notion of uniform promiscuous dehydrogenation (PDH) activity. This variation indicates that the active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are not uniformly distributed or structured, leading to complex interactions that may not follow a simple linear relationship. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic performance suggests that there might be an optimal ratio where the catalyst's efficiency peaks before declining. This finding implies that the true nature of the active sites on these catalysts is multifaceted and requires further investigation to optimize the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts effectively.

氢改性的ZSM-5沸石中内孔Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响，挑战了均匀普鲁士酸活性的假设。这种变异性表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上的活性位点分布不均且结构复杂，导致其相互作用可能不符合简单的线性关系。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示，可能存在一个最优的比例，使得催化剂的效率达到峰值，随后下降。这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上的真实活性位点性质是多面的，需要进一步研究以优化这些催化剂。
