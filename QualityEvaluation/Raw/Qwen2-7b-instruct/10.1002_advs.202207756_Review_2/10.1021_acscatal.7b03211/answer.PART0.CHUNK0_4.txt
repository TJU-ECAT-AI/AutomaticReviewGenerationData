The variability in the structure and distribution of intraporous gallium (Ga) species within hydrogen-form ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, challenges the notion of uniform performance in propene dehydrogenation (PDH). This variability impacts the understanding of the actual active sites and the optimization of gallium/hydrogen ZSM-5 catalysts due to the discovered non-linear correlation between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic efficiency.
