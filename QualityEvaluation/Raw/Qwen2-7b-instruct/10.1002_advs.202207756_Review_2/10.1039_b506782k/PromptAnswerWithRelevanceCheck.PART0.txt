[1] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
[2] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[3] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K."
[4] "In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."
[5] "Comparison of infrared spectra of ethane adsorbed on zinc- and gallium-modified ZSM-5 indicates that hydrocarbon activation over the charge-compensating reduced cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not straightforwardly related to the simple ratio of elements. Instead, the complex interplay between the specific arrangement of Ga species and the zeolite framework determines the efficiency of ethane activation. This complexity suggests that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a nuanced understanding beyond just the stoichiometry of Ga/Al, potentially involving detailed knowledge of the local environment and structure of the Ga species within the zeolite.

The implications of this non-monotonic relationship are significant for catalyst design. It indicates that achieving high activity might necessitate a fine-tuned balance between Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, as well as the precise spatial distribution of Ga species. This balance affects not only the strength of interaction between the catalyst and ethane but also the pathways of activation, including whether the process involves strong polarizability, heterolytic dissociation, or oxidative addition. Understanding these relationships allows for the development of catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for specific hydrocarbon conversions, potentially leading to more efficient processes for aromatization and dehydrogenation.

H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种结构和分布的多样性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性中心的本质远非简单元素比例所能反映。相反，Ga物种在沸石骨架中的复杂排列决定了乙烷活化的效率。这种复杂性暗示，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入理解，而不仅仅是Ga/Al的比例，可能涉及对Ga物种在沸石结构内部的详细知识。

这种非单调关系的含义对于催化剂设计具有重要意义。它表明，为了实现高活性，可能需要精确平衡Ga负载和Si/Al比，以及Ga物种的空间分布。这种平衡不仅影响催化剂与乙烷的相互作用强度，也影响激活过程的途径，包括是否涉及强极化、异裂吸附或氧化加成。理解这些关系允许开发具有优化活性和选择性的催化剂，以特定的烃转化，可能导致更高效的芳香化和脱氢过程。

[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."

[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance suggests that the true nature of active sites is not solely determined by the amount of Ga loaded. Instead, the spatial arrangement and interaction of Ga species within the zeolite framework play crucial roles. This implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a nuanced understanding of how Ga is dispersed and interacts with the zeolite structure, beyond just increasing the Ga/Al ratio. The non-linear relationship indicates that there might be an optimal range of Ga/Al ratio where the catalyst exhibits the best activity and stability, which is critical for achieving desired hydrocarbon conversion efficiencies.

公司X在2021年的收入挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。通过因素如Ga负载和Si/Al比对H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种结构和分布的影响，观察到Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系。这表明活性位点的真实性质不仅仅取决于加载的Ga量。相反，Ga物种在沸石框架内的空间排列和相互作用起着关键作用。这意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga如何在结构中分散并与其相互作用，而不仅仅是增加Ga/Al比率。非线性关系表明，可能存在一个最佳的Ga/Al比率范围，在此范围内催化剂表现出最佳的活性和稳定性，这对于实现所需烃类转化效率至关重要。

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it reveals that the actual performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is not solely determined by the concentration of Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is a threshold or optimal range for the Ga/Al ratio where the catalyst exhibits the best activity and selectivity. This suggests that the active sites for PDH are not uniformly distributed across the entire catalyst surface but rather localized in specific regions. Understanding this relationship helps in optimizing the synthesis process to achieve a more homogeneous distribution of active sites, thereby improving the efficiency and stability of the catalyst. The implications of this non-monotonic relationship are significant for the development of more effective Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts tailored for specific applications, such as the production of aromatic compounds or the reduction of coke formation.

H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受到诸如Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为它揭示了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的实际性能并非仅仅取决于Ga物种的浓度。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，最佳活性和选择性出现在特定的Ga/Al比率范围内。这表明活性位点不是在整个催化剂表面均匀分布的，而是在特定区域集中。理解这种关系对于优化合成过程以实现活性位点更均一的分布至关重要，从而提高催化剂的效率和稳定性。这种非单调关系对开发更适合特定应用（如芳烃生产或焦炭形成减少）的更有效Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。

[5] "Reactivity The difference in the mechanism in alkane activation should have direct consequences for the product mixture observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion."
[6] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."
[7] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."
[8] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene."
[9] "The concomitant formation of aromatic products should be explained by the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites via heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane according to reaction (1)."
[10] "Also, the carbon balance is not closed for Zn/ZSM-5 (Table 1) due to the deposition of carbonaceous residue in the catalyst bed."

Ethane activation on Zn/ZSM-5 involves strong polarizability and heterolytic dissociation at moderate temperatures, resulting in the formation of zinc ethyl fragments and protons. In contrast, ethane activation on Ga/ZSM-5 occurs via oxidative addition at high temperatures, leading to ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. These distinct mechanisms affect the product mixtures during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with Zn/ZSM-5 showing higher ethane conversion and formation of aromatic products, whereas Ga/ZSM-5 selectively converts ethane to ethylene with stable activity and minimal coke formation. The differences in alkane activation mechanisms are due to the distinct properties of zinc and gallium cations within the zeolite structure.

乙烷在Zn/ZSM-5上的活化涉及强烈的极化和在温和温度下的异裂，产生锌乙基片段和质子。相比之下，乙烷在Ga/ZSM-5上的活化通过在高温下的氧化添加发生，导致乙基和氢化物片段协调到Ga31物种。这些不同的机制影响催化烃转化过程中的产物分布，Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的乙烷转化率和芳香族产品的形成，而Ga/ZSM-5则选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，并保持稳定的活性和少量焦炭生成。不同烷基活化机制的原因在于锌和镓离子在沸石结构内的独特性质。

Ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts proceeds via two distinct mechanisms. Over Zn/ZSM-5, ethane is strongly polarized at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption upon heating. In contrast, ethane is weakly adsorbed on Ga/ZSM-5, resulting in oxidative addition to Ga1 ions at high temperatures. The resulting ethyl and hydride fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The lack of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 enables stable ethane conversion to ethylene, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to Brnsted acidity.

在锌和镓改性的HZSM-5催化剂上，乙烷激活通过两种不同的机制进行。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷在室温下强烈极化，导致加热时的异裂吸附。相比之下，在Ga/ZSM-5上，乙烷吸附较弱，在高温下发生氧化添加到Ga1离子。由此产生的乙基和氢化物碎片分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。Ga/ZSM-5中缺乏Brnsted酸性质子使乙烷稳定地转化为乙烯，而Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的初始活性，但由于Brnsted酸性导致结焦失活和次级芳构化反应而受到影响。
