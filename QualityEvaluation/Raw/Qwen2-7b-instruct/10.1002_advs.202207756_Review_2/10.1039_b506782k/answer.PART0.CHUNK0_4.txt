[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[5] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

Ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts proceeds via two distinct mechanisms. Over Zn/ZSM-5, ethane is strongly polarized at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption upon heating. In contrast, ethane is weakly adsorbed on Ga/ZSM-5, resulting in oxidative addition to Ga1 ions at high temperatures. The resulting ethyl and hydride fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The lack of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 enables stable ethane conversion to ethylene, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to Brnsted acidity.

在锌和镓改性的HZSM-5催化剂上，乙烷激活通过两种不同的机制进行。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷在室温下强烈极化，导致加热时的异裂吸附。相比之下，在Ga/ZSM-5上，乙烷吸附较弱，在高温下发生氧化添加到Ga1离子。由此产生的乙基和氢化物碎片分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。Ga/ZSM-5中缺乏Brnsted酸性质子使乙烷稳定地转化为乙烯，而Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的初始活性，但由于Brnsted酸性导致结焦失活和次级芳构化反应而受到影响。
