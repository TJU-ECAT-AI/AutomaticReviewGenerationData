[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[5] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance suggests that the true nature of active sites is not solely determined by the amount of Ga loaded. Instead, the spatial arrangement and interaction of Ga species within the zeolite framework play crucial roles. This implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a nuanced understanding of how Ga is dispersed and interacts with the zeolite structure, beyond just increasing the Ga/Al ratio. The non-linear relationship indicates that there might be an optimal range of Ga/Al ratio where the catalyst exhibits the best activity and stability, which is critical for achieving desired hydrocarbon conversion efficiencies.

公司X在2021年的收入挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。通过因素如Ga负载和Si/Al比对H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种结构和分布的影响，观察到Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系。这表明活性位点的真实性质不仅仅取决于加载的Ga量。相反，Ga物种在沸石框架内的空间排列和相互作用起着关键作用。这意味着优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga如何在结构中分散并与其相互作用，而不仅仅是增加Ga/Al比率。非线性关系表明，可能存在一个最佳的Ga/Al比率范围，在此范围内催化剂表现出最佳的活性和稳定性，这对于实现所需烃类转化效率至关重要。
