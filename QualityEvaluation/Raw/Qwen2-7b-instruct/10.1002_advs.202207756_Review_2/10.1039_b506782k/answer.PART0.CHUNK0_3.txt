[1] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[2] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K."
[3] "In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions,giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."
[4] "Comparison of infrared spectra of ethane adsorbed on zinc- and gallium-modified ZSM-5 indicates that hydrocarbon activation over the charge-compensating reduced cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
[5] "Reactivity The difference in the mechanism in alkane activation should have direct consequences for the product mixture observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion."
[6] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."
[7] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."
[8] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene."
[9] "The concomitant formation of aromatic products should be explained by the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites via heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane according to reaction (1)."
[10] "Also, the carbon balance is not closed for Zn/ZSM-5 (Table 1) due to the deposition of carbonaceous residue in the catalyst bed."

Ethane activation on Zn/ZSM-5 involves strong polarizability and heterolytic dissociation at moderate temperatures, resulting in the formation of zinc ethyl fragments and protons. In contrast, ethane activation on Ga/ZSM-5 occurs via oxidative addition at high temperatures, leading to ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. These distinct mechanisms affect the product mixtures during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with Zn/ZSM-5 showing higher ethane conversion and formation of aromatic products, whereas Ga/ZSM-5 selectively converts ethane to ethylene with stable activity and minimal coke formation. The differences in alkane activation mechanisms are due to the distinct properties of zinc and gallium cations within the zeolite structure.

乙烷在Zn/ZSM-5上的活化涉及强烈的极化和在温和温度下的异裂，产生锌乙基片段和质子。相比之下，乙烷在Ga/ZSM-5上的活化通过在高温下的氧化添加发生，导致乙基和氢化物片段协调到Ga31物种。这些不同的机制影响催化烃转化过程中的产物分布，Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的乙烷转化率和芳香族产品的形成，而Ga/ZSM-5则选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，并保持稳定的活性和少量焦炭生成。不同烷基活化机制的原因在于锌和镓离子在沸石结构内的独特性质。
