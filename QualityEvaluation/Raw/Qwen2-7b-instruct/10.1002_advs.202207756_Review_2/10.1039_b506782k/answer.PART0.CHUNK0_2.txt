[1] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[2] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K."
[3] "In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."
[4] "Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."
[5] "The only product observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene."
[6] "Extensive studies in the past have suggested that Brnsted acid protons are required for the aromatization of the oligomeric intermediates."
[7] "This may be primarily attributed to the deactivation of Brnsted acid sites that play an important role in the formation of aromatics and coke."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it reveals that the actual performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is not solely determined by the concentration of Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is a threshold or optimal range for the Ga/Al ratio where the catalyst exhibits the best activity and selectivity. This suggests that the active sites for PDH are not uniformly distributed across the entire catalyst surface but rather localized in specific regions. Understanding this relationship helps in optimizing the synthesis process to achieve a more homogeneous distribution of active sites, thereby improving the efficiency and stability of the catalyst. The implications of this non-monotonic relationship are significant for the development of more effective Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts tailored for specific applications, such as the production of aromatic compounds or the reduction of coke formation.

H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受到诸如Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为它揭示了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的实际性能并非仅仅取决于Ga物种的浓度。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，最佳活性和选择性出现在特定的Ga/Al比率范围内。这表明活性位点不是在整个催化剂表面均匀分布的，而是在特定区域集中。理解这种关系对于优化合成过程以实现活性位点更均一的分布至关重要，从而提高催化剂的效率和稳定性。这种非单调关系对开发更适合特定应用（如芳烃生产或焦炭形成减少）的更有效Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。
