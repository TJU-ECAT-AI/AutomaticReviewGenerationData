The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity because the structure and distribution of Ga species within the zeolite pores are not uniform. This non-uniformity can lead to variations in the accessibility and reactivity of Ga sites, affecting the overall catalytic performance. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is an optimal range of Ga/Al ratio for achieving maximum activity. This optimal ratio might not be directly proportional to the amount of Ga added, as other factors such as the specific arrangement of Ga within the zeolite framework also play crucial roles. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deep understanding of the relationship between the structure of Ga species, the Si/Al ratio, and the resulting catalytic activity, guiding the selection of appropriate conditions for Ga loading and the preparation of the zeolite to achieve the best performance.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，内部镓物种结构和分布的变异性，受到如镓负载量和硅/铝比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这是因为沸石孔内的镓物种结构分布并不均匀。这种非均匀性可能导致镓位点的可接近性和反应性的变化，从而影响整体催化性能。观察到的镓/铝比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，存在一个最佳的镓/铝比例，以实现最大活性。这个最佳比例可能不是直接与添加的镓量成正比的，因为其他因素，如沸石框架内镓的具体排列，也起着关键作用。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要对镓物种结构、硅/铝比例以及由此产生的催化活性之间的关系有深入的理解，以此指导选择合适的镓负载条件和制备沸石，以达到最佳性能。
