The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by the Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, contradicts the assumption of uniform performance across the entire catalyst. This indicates that the actual active sites within the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may not behave uniformly. The non-linear relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic performance suggests that there is more complexity in determining the optimal catalyst performance than previously thought. This complexity likely stems from the varied roles that different Ga species play within the zeolite structure, and the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may require a more nuanced understanding of how these species are distributed and structured within the zeolite matrix.

H-ZSM-5沸石中镓（Ga）物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的实际活性位点可能并不均匀。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系意味着确定最佳催化剂性能的复杂性超出了以往的认识。这种复杂性很可能源于zeolite结构中不同Ga物种的复杂作用，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂可能需要对这些物种在zeolite矩阵中的分布和结构有更深入的理解。
