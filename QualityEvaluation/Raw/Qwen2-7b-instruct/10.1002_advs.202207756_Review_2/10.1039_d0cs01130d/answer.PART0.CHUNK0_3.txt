[1] "The success of a catalytic process depends on the discovery of efficient catalysts bearing specific properties and function, which enables the conversion of reactants at a high rate and in a selective way."
[2] "For instance, the acid sites including Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in zeolites are heterogeneously distributed in zeolite channels or cavities, which correlate with the silica to alumina ratio of a framework."
[3] "The incorporation of Al atoms into the framework of purely silica zeolites generates Brnsted and Lewis acidity by the AlOHSi bridging acidic groups and framework tricoordinated (SiO)3Al sites, respectively, leading to well-recognized solid acid catalysts."
[4] "The local structures of framework tricoordinated Al sites in dehydrated FER zeolites and their precursors, perturbed (SiO)3AlOH in hydrated samples, were revealed by 27Al{1H} REDOR (3Q) MAS NMR spectroscopy in combination with DFT/MM calculations."
[5] "The combination of 2D J-coupling (through-bond) and 2D dipoledipole-coupling (through-space) DQ 29Si NMR measurements, XRD and quantum chemical modelling has significantly reinforced the capability of the NMR crystallography method in the study of molecularly ordered inorganic frameworks, grafted materials and intermediate phases during zeolite crystallization."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity because the specific structure and distribution of Ga species can significantly impact the catalytic performance. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is no straightforward correlation between the amount of Ga present and the efficiency of the catalyst. This suggests that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts might be more complex than previously thought. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts would require a detailed understanding of how the Ga species interact with the zeolite framework and how their distribution affects the catalytic activity. This understanding can be achieved through comprehensive characterization methods such as solid-state NMR, which can provide insights into the local structure and distribution of Ga species within the zeolite pores.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为Ga物种的具体结构和分布可以显著影响催化剂的性能。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，Ga在催化剂中的含量与其效率之间并没有简单的对应关系。这暗示了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的真正活性位点可能比之前认为的要复杂得多。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga物种如何与沸石骨架相互作用以及它们在孔内的分布如何影响催化活性。这种理解可以通过全面的表征方法来实现，例如固态核磁共振，它可以提供关于Ga物种在沸石孔内的局部结构和分布的见解。
