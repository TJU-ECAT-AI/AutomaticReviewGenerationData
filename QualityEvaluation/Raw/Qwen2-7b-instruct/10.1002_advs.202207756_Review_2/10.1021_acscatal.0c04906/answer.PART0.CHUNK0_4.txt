1. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity due to the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance. This implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought, and optimizing these catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how the structure of Ga species affects their activity and selectivity.

1. 在H-ZSM-5沸石中，Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。由于观察到Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系，这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真实活性位点比以前认为的更为复杂。优化这些催化剂需要更深入地理解Ga物种的结构如何影响其活性和选择性。
