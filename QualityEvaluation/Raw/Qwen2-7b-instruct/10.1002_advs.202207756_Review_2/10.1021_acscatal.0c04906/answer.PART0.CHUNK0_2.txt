The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because these factors lead to a non-uniform distribution of active sites within the catalyst. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that there is more to the nature of active sites than just the simple ratio of gallium to aluminum. This suggests that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how the structure and distribution of Ga species affect the catalytic process.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，内孔中镓物种的结构和分布的可变性，受到诸如镓负载量和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这些因素导致催化剂内的活性位点分布不均一。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示，活性位点的本质远不止是镓与铝的比例简单关系。这表明优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地理解镓物种的结构和分布如何影响催化过程。
