[1] "The activation of methane CH bond leads to the formation of different hydroxyl groups."
[2] "The observation of different Ga-CH3 suggests four pathways (a-d) dependent on the local environments of the active Ga species."
[3] "Highly dispersed GaOx and GaO+ species are formed on the samples prepared by impregnation methods."
[4] "The simultaneous generation of Ga-OH groups demonstrates the heterolytic cleavage of CH bond of methane."
[5] "Direct cleavage of CH on GaO+ species would lead to Ga-CH3 and Ga-OH groups."
[6] "Two pathways could occur on highly dispersed GaOx for the formation of Ga-CH3 groups with the concomitant formation of Ga-OH group or the recovery of BAS of zeolite."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that the true nature of active sites is not solely determined by the ratio. Instead, the structure and distribution of Ga species within the zeolite framework, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, play significant roles in determining the activity. This implies that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a nuanced understanding of how these variables affect the positioning and structure of active sites, rather than relying on a simple linear relationship between Ga content and performance.

H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，真正的活性位点性质不仅仅由比率决定。相反，这些因素如Ga负载量和Si/Al比对活性位点位置和结构的影响，对确定活性具有重要意义。这暗示优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解这些变量如何影响活性位点的定位和结构，而不仅仅是依赖于Ga含量和性能之间简单的线性关系。
