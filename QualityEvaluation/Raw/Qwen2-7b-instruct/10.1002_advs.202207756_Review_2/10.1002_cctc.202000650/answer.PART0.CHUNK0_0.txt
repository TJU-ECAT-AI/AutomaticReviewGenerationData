The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it leads to the formation of two distinct types of Ga species: highly dispersed oxides and cationic Ga species. These differences in structure and distribution affect the local environments and thus the catalytic performance of the Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is more complex than previously thought. It suggests that the optimal Ga loading and Si/Al ratio might not be linearly related to performance, and that there could be an optimal configuration that maximizes the catalytic efficiency. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts would require a deeper understanding of how these factors influence the formation and distribution of active sites, potentially through systematic experimentation and modeling to identify the most effective configurations.

H-ZSM-5沸石中内孔中Ga物种结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这导致形成两种不同的Ga物种：高度分散的氧化物和阳离子Ga物种。这些差异在结构和分布上影响局部环境，从而影响Ga物种的催化性能。观察到Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示了真正活性位点的本质比之前认为的要复杂。它表明最优的Ga负载量和Si/Al比可能不是线性相关于性能的，可能存在一个最优配置可以最大化催化效率。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入理解这些因素如何影响活性位点的形成和分布，可能通过系统实验和建模来识别最有效的配置。
