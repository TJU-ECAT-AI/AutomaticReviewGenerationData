[1] "Our previous work demonstrated on Zn-modified zeolite that heterolytic dissociation of CH bond of methane could occur on Zn2+ ions with the formation of Zn-methyl species, while homolytic cleavage of CH bond of methane on ZnOZn clusters could lead to the preferential formation of surface methoxy species."
[2] "The formation of proximate BAS and Ga species has been observed on Ga-modified ZSM-5."
[3] "The structures of surface species attached to different metal species make it highly challenging to have an in-depth understanding of the dissociative adsorption of alkanes."
[4] "Direct evidence for multiple methane activation routes on Ga-modified ZSM-5 zeolites (denoted as Ga/ZSM-5) by solid-state NMR spectroscopy."
[5] "The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."
