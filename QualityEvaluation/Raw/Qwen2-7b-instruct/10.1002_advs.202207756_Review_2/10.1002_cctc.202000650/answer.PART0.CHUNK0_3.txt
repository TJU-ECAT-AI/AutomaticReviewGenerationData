The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because the study revealed that the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies the presence of distinct active sites. This indicates that the active sites are not uniformly distributed throughout the zeolite matrix, and their effectiveness depends on the specific configuration of the Ga species within the zeolite channels. This complexity suggests that optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how the structure and distribution of Ga species affect their reactivity and spatial proximity to other reactive sites, such as Brnsted acid sites and hydroxyl groups. By elucidating the specific pathways and mechanisms through which these active sites facilitate methane activation, researchers can develop strategies to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

在H-ZSM-5沸石分子筛中，Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受到如Ga负载量和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。因为研究发现，Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明存在不同的活性位点。这说明活性位点并非均匀分布在沸石晶格中，其有效性取决于Zeolite通道内Ga物种的具体配置。这种复杂性暗示优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解Ga物种结构和分布如何影响其反应性和与其他活性位点（如Brnsted酸位点和羟基）的空间接近度。通过阐明这些活性位点促进甲烷活化的具体途径和机制，研究人员可以开发策略以提高Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的效率和选择性。
