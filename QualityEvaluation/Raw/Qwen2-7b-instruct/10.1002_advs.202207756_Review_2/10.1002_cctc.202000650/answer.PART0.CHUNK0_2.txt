[1] "Ga- or Zn-modified zeolites are currently the most effective catalysts for aromatization of light alkanes."
[2] "Two types of reaction routes have been proposed on Ga/ZSM-5. It was argued that alkane is activated on Brnsted acid site (BAS) via carbonium ion, while Lewis acid site (Ga species) facilitates the recombination desorption of H2."
[3] "Our previous work demonstrated on Zn-modified zeolite that heterolytic dissociation of CH bond of methane could occur on Zn2+ ions with the formation of Zn-methyl species, while homolytic cleavage of CH bond of methane on ZnOZn clusters could lead to the preferential formation of surface methoxy species."
[4] "The formation of proximate BAS and Ga species has been observed on Ga-modified ZSM-5.8"
[5] "The highly dispersed GaOx species as observed by 71Ga NMR are also considered for methane activation (pathway c and d)."
[6] "Direct cleavage of CH on GaO+ species would lead to Ga-CH3 and Ga-OH groups."
[7] "While the proximate BAS on zeolite could be involved in the initial CH bond reaction, leading to a different route for the formation of Ga-CH3 group on GaO+ species."
[8] "DFT calculations supports the formation of the observed Ga-CH3 species and proposed CH bond activation pathways."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity because these factors can lead to a non-uniform distribution of active sites within the zeolite. This results in a complex chemistry of methane activation on Ga-modified zeolites, where different pathways for heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond in methane can occur depending on the local environment of the active Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is multifaceted and not solely determined by the simple ratio of metals to zeolite components. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deep understanding of how these factors affect the structure and distribution of active sites, which can significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种结构和分布的可变性，受到如Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，因为这些因素可能导致分子筛内部活性点的非均匀分布。这导致了在Ga改性沸石上复杂化的甲烷活化化学，其中根据活性Ga物种的局部环境，甲烷中的CH键可能以不同的途径发生异裂。观察到的Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质是多维的，并不单纯由金属与沸石成分的比例决定。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要深入了解这些因素如何影响活性位点的结构和分布，这对于提高催化过程的效率和选择性具有重要意义。
