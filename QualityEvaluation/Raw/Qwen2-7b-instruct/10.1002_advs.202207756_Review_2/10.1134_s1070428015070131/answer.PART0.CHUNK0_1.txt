Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of
0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile.

The synthesis of acids 3a3f involved dissolving 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 30-40 mL of anhydrous toluene at temperatures between 20-25°C until the reactants were completely dissolved. The solution was then cooled to 0-5°C, and a precipitate was filtered off before being recrystallized from acetonitrile.
