Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025°C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05°C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile.

The synthesis of acids 3a3f involved dissolving 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 30-40 mL of anhydrous toluene at temperatures between 20-25°C. Once the reactants were completely dissolved, the solution was cooled to 0-5°C, and the precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from acetonitrile.

Acids 3a3f were isolated as yellow crystalline substances. They showed in the IR spectra absorption bands in the regions 31243290 (NH), 17031723 (C=O, acid), 16621678 (AdC=O), and 1583 1638 cm1 C4=O, C=C, C=N). The reduced carbonyl stretching vibration frequencies suggest formation of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the Z isomers of 3a3f.

The proposed synthetic route to furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f is of preparative significance, and it ensures high yield of the products. The direct reaction of 5-arylfuran-2,3-diones with triphenylphosphazenes derived from diazo ketones is accompanied by anoma- lous diaza-Wittig reaction involving the lactone carbonyl group with formation of 2-hydrazinylidene derivatives despite the presence of a ketone carbonyl group in the initial heterocycle [2729].

The suggested synthetic pathway to furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f holds significant preparative value and ensures a high product yield. Directly reacting 5-arylfuran-2,3-diones with triphenylphosphazenes sourced from diazo ketones results in an unusual diaza-Wittig reaction. Despite the initial heterocycle containing a ketone carbonyl group, this process leads to the formation of 2-hydrazinylidene derivatives.
