Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025°C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05°C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile.

The synthesis of acids 3a3f involved dissolving 0.01 moles of compound 1a1e and 0.01 moles of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 30-40 mL of anhydrous toluene at temperatures between 20-25°C until the reactants fully dissolved. The solution was then cooled to 0-5°C, followed by filtration and recrystallization from acetonitrile.
