The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by parameters like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, impacts the assumption of uniform performance in partial dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This variability suggests that the active sites within these catalysts may not be uniformly distributed or behave identically under different conditions. The non-monotonic relationship between the Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance indicates that there might be an optimal range for this ratio where the catalyst's efficiency peaks. This finding challenges the straightforward interpretation of the Ga/Al ratio's influence on performance and necessitates a more nuanced understanding of how these elements interact to create active sites. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts thus requires a detailed analysis of how various parameters affect the formation and distribution of active sites, potentially leading to more efficient and predictable catalyst performance.

结构和分布的差异性在H-ZSM-5沸石中，影响着Ga物种，在Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响下，挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设。这种差异性表明，这些催化剂中的活性位点可能并不均匀分布或在不同条件下表现出相同的行为。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示，可能存在一个最佳的Ga/Al比例范围，在此范围内催化剂的效率达到峰值。这一发现挑战了对Ga/Al比例影响性能的简单解释，并需要对这些元素如何相互作用以形成活性位点有更深入的理解。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要详细分析各种参数如何影响活性位点的形成和分布，从而有可能实现更高效和可预测的催化剂性能。
