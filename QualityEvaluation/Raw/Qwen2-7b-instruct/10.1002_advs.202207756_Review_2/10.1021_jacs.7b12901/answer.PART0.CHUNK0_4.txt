The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by parameters like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, questions the idea that these catalysts exhibit consistent performance across their entire operating range. This inconsistency arises because the actual sites responsible for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (PDH) might not be uniformly active. The non-linear correlation between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic effectiveness of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 system complicates the straightforward attribution of activity to specific Ga species or locations within the zeolite framework. This phenomenon suggests that the active sites are more complex than initially thought and might not directly correlate with the Ga/Al ratio alone. As a result, optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of how different factors interplay to influence the PDH process, potentially necessitating adjustments beyond just tweaking the Ga loading or the Si/Al ratio.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，内孔中镓（Ga）物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。这种不一致性是由于实际参与轻烷烃脱氢（PDH）过程的位点可能并不均匀活跃。观察到的Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系对于理解活性位点的真实性质以及优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。这一现象表明，活性位点比最初设想的要复杂，可能并不直接与Ga/Al比例相关。结果，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地了解不同因素如何相互作用以影响PDH过程，可能需要超越仅仅调整Ga负载或Si/Al比的调整。因此，优化这些催化剂需要对PDH过程中的复杂相互作用有更深刻的理解，并可能需要采取更为精细的方法来优化其性能。
