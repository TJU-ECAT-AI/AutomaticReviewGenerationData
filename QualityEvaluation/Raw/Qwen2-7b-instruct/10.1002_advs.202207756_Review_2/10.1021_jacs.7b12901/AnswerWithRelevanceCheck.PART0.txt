          [1] "The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by parameters like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, impacts the assumption of uniform Proton Diffusion Hydrogenation (PDH) activity.
