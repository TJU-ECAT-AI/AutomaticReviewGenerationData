The variability in the structure and distribution of gallium (Ga) species within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, which is affected by factors like Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio, impacts the assumption of uniform Proton Diffusion Hydrogenation (PDH) activity. The non-monotonic relationship observed between the Ga/Al ratio and the catalytic performance suggests that the true nature of the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts might not be fully understood. This finding implies that the optimization of these catalysts requires a more nuanced approach to account for the complex interactions between Ga species and the zeolite framework.

在H-ZSM-5沸石中，由于镓（Ga）负载和Si/Al比等因素影响的Ga物种的结构和分布的变化，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系意味着对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂真正活性位点的性质的理解可能并不完全准确。这一发现表明优化这些催化剂需要采取更精细的方法，以考虑到Ga物种与沸石框架之间复杂相互作用的影响。
