[1] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[2] "Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+."
[3] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios."
[4] "Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."
[5] "Up to 80% of BAS are consumed at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7, suggesting complete removal of BAS cannot be achieved with excess Ga."
[6] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites."
[7] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."
[8] "The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity."
[9] "The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."

1. The study uses in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to examine the structure and distribution of intraporous gallium species in H-ZSM-5 zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios and gallium/aluminium ratios.
2. Gallium species that initially reside on the surface migrate into the zeolite's micropores and exchange with Brönsted acid sites (BAS) to form gallium ions (Ga+).
3. At low Si/Al ratios, gallium ions preferentially exchange with single protons in paired BAS sites, forming gallium-hydrogen pairs (Ga+H+).
4. On samples with high Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated gallium ions are produced after exchanging with isolated BAS sites.
5. Up to 80% of BAS can be exchanged by gallium at high gallium/aluminium ratios, but complete removal is not achievable.
6. Gallium hydrides only form on gallium-hydrogen pairs, not isolated gallium ions.
7. Only isolated gallium ions can react with water to form gallium oxide hydroxide (GaOOH) at 150°C, whereas gallium-hydrogen pairs do not react with water under the same conditions.
8. The variation in gallium species structure and distribution within H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by gallium loading and Si/Al ratio, complicates the assumption of uniform PDH activity.
9. The non-monotonic relationship between gallium/aluminium ratio and catalytic performance suggests that understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires nuanced considerations.

1. 研究使用原位透射傅里叶变换红外光谱技术系统地研究了三种不同Si/Al比率（15、28和39）和广泛镓/铝比（0至1.7）的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品中的镓物种分布。
2. 在550°C下用氢气还原后，表面存在的镓物种迁移到沸石微孔中并与Brönsted酸位点（BAS）交换形成镓离子（Ga+）。
3. 在低Si/Al比率下，镓离子优先与配对BAS位点上的单个质子交换，形成镓-氢对（Ga+H+）。
4. 对于高Si/Al比率样品，主要是在孤立BAS位点上交换后产生的孤立镓离子。
5. 高镓/铝比下，最多可消耗80%的BAS，但完全去除BAS是不可能的。
6. 镓氢化合物仅在镓-氢对上形成，而不是孤立的镓离子。
7. 只有孤立的镓离子可以在150°C时与水反应形成镓氧化氢（GaOOH），而无论存在何种镓氢化合物，镓-氢对都不与水反应。
8. 镓物种结构和分布的变异性在H-ZSM-5沸石中，受镓负载和Si/Al比率的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。
9. 镓/铝比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系暗示理解活性位点的真实性质并优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要细致考虑。
