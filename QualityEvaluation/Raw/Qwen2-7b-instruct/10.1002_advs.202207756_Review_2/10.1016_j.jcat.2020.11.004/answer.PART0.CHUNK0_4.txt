[1] "Detailed in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopic investigations of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7) show that Ga speciation depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."
[2] "Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+."
[3] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios."
[4] "Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."
[5] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[6] "Up to 80% of BAS are consumed at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7, suggesting complete removal of BAS cannot be achieved with excess Ga."
[7] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites."
[8] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."
[9] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is more complex than previously thought. Specifically, the preference of Ga+ to exchange with paired BAS sites over isolated ones, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites at low Si/Al ratios, and the inability of isolated Ga+ sites to react with water at 150°C to form GaOOH, suggest that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 might exhibit distinct properties. This heterogeneity in Ga speciation could explain the observed differences in catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing Ga loading and Si/Al ratio could lead to more effective catalysts for PDH reactions.

The implications of these findings are significant for the field of catalysis. They suggest that the detailed understanding of Ga speciation and its impact on catalyst performance is crucial for the design and optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The heterogeneity in the active sites could be leveraged to tailor the catalysts for specific PDH applications, potentially enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. Moreover, the identification of two distinct types of Ga species—Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites—provides a new perspective on the role of Ga in the PDH mechanism. Future studies should focus on elucidating the exact roles of these species in the PDH reaction, potentially leading to the development of more effective and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

在H-ZSM-5沸石催化剂中，Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比率等因素的影响，挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设。观察到的Ga/Al比率与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的真实活性位点比以前认为的更为复杂。具体来说，在低Si/Al比率下，Ga+倾向于与配对BAS位点交换而不是孤立的BAS位点，导致形成Ga+H+对位点，这可能解释了为什么PDH活性表现出不同的特性。此外，孤立的Ga+位点不能在150°C时与水反应形成GaOOH，而Ga+H+对位点无论是否存在GaHx物种，都不与水反应，这表明Ga/H-ZSM-5中的活性位点可能存在不同的性质。

这些发现对催化领域有重要意义。它们表明，深入理解Ga物种及其对催化剂性能的影响对于设计和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂至关重要。这种位点的异质性可以被利用来定制催化剂以适应特定的PDH应用，可能提高反应的效率和选择性。此外，识别两种不同类型的Ga物种——Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+位点——为理解PDH机制中Ga的作用提供了新的视角。未来的研究应该集中在阐明这些物种在PDH反应中的确切作用上，这可能会导致更有效、选择性更强的催化剂的发展用于丙烷脱氢。
