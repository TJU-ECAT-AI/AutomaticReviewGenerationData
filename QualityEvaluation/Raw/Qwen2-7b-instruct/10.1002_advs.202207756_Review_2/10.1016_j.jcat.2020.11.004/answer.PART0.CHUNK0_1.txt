[2] "One Ga atom roughly replaces one Brnsted acid site (BAS) at Ga/BAS ratio up to 0.7, however,only up to 80% of the BAS on the H-ZSM-5 can be exchanged even with excess amounts of Ga."
[3] "At a low Si/Al ratio of 15, the intensity of GaHx bands on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 550 C increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings (Ga/Al < 0.13), and then levels off."
[4] "In contrast, no detectable GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio of 39, with Ga/Al ratios up to 1.3."
[5] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[6] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is complex. The presence of two distinct types of Ga species—isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites—contributes to this complexity. These findings suggest that the PDH activity might not solely depend on the total Ga content but also on the specific distribution and interaction of Ga species with Brnsted acid sites. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts could involve fine-tuning the Si/Al ratio and Ga loading to maximize the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, which exhibit distinct properties from isolated Ga+ sites, potentially leading to enhanced PDH performance.

H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的差异性，受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素的影响，挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设。观察到Ga/Al比例与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的真正活性位点性质复杂。存在两种不同类型的Ga物种——孤立的Ga+和Ga+H+配对位点——导致了这种复杂性。这些发现表明，PDH活性可能不仅取决于总的Ga含量，还取决于Ga物种与Brnsted酸位点的特定分布和相互作用。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂可能需要精细调整Si/Al比和Ga负载，以最大化Ga+H+配对位点的形成，这些位点与孤立的Ga+位点具有不同的性质，这可能有助于提高PDH性能。
