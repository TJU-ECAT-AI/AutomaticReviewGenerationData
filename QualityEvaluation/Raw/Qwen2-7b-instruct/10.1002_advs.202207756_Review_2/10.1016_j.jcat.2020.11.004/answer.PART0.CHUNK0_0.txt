[1] "Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+."
[2] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios."
[3] "Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."
[4] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[5] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites."
[6] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."

1. Upon reduction, Ga species move into zeolite micropores and exchange with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+.
2. At low Si/Al ratios, Ga+ forms Ga+H+ pairs by preferentially exchanging with single protons in paired BAS sites.
3. At high Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ is produced by exchanging with isolated BAS sites.
4. At low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, the amount of BAS consumed matches the Ga loading, but this becomes more challenging at higher Ga loadings due to the limited BAS availability.
5. At 550 C, Ga hydrides only form on Ga+H+ pairs, not on isolated Ga+ sites.
6. Only isolated Ga+ sites react with water at 150 C, while Ga+H+ pairs do not react, indicating different properties and potential catalytic roles.

1. 在还原后，Ga物种移动到沸石微孔中并与Brnsted酸位（BAS）交换形成Ga+。
2. 在低Si/Al比下，Ga+通过优先与配对BAS位上的单个质子交换形成Ga+H+对。
3. 在高Si/Al比下，主要产生孤立的Ga+通过与孤立的BAS位交换。
4. 在低Si/Al和Ga/Al比下，消耗的BAS量与Ga负载成正比，但在高Ga负载下变得更具挑战性，因为可用的BAS有限。
5. 在550°C时，仅在Ga+H+对上形成Ga氢化物，而不是孤立的Ga+位点。
6. 只有孤立的Ga+位点在150°C时与水反应，而Ga+H+对不反应，表明不同的性质和潜在的催化作用。
