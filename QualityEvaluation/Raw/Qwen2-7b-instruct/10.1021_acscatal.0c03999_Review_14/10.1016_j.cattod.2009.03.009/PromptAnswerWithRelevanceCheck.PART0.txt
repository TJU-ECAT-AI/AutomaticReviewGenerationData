The literature discusses the recent advancements in the production of syngas from methane through the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane (CRPOM) over Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared using nickel citrate precursor. The use of nickel nitrate precursor results in larger nickel particle sizes, leading to poor catalytic activity, especially for low Ni-loadings. In contrast, the nickel citrate precursor leads to superior catalytic activity and stability. The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 forms nickel silicate-like species, which is the primary reason for the high dispersion of Ni and prevents particle sintering at high temperatures. High dispersion of Ni over the catalyst surface is crucial for its excellent catalytic activity.

The literature discusses the recent advancements in producing syngas from methane through the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane (CRPOM) processes. This method is considered environmentally friendly due to its energy coupling capability, adjustable hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio, and a safer operational environment. Nickel-based catalysts, particularly those prepared using nickel citrate, exhibit superior performance and stability compared to catalysts made with nickel nitrate. The nickel citrate precursor facilitates the formation of nickel silicate-like species, which are responsible for high dispersion of nickel and prevent particle sintering at high temperatures, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

The document highlights that nickel nitrate results in larger particle sizes and poorer catalytic performance, especially in catalysts with lower nickel loadings. In contrast, nickel citrate leads to catalysts with superior activity and stability, indicating its potential for optimizing CRPOM processes.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the process and managing inherent reaction properties. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize the CRPOM processes.
