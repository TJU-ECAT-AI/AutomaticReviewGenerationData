[1] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process, and (3) a safer operating environment."
[2] "In recent years, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts."
[3] "The nickel citrate precursor strengthened interaction between NiO and support to form nickel silicate like species which could be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures."
[4] "The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 formed nickel silicate like species over the NiSC, which was the main reason for high nickel dispersion and effectively prevention nickel particle from sintering at high reaction temperatures."

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, particularly those incorporating transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts demonstrate improved selectivity and conversion rates in comparison to traditional methods. However, persistent challenges remain, including the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reactions themselves. Future research and development efforts should focus on several key areas to enhance the ODHP processes. These include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing more efficient catalysts capable of selectively activating C-H bonds in propane without undergoing unwanted side reactions.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Designing catalysts that maintain their activity and selectivity over multiple reaction cycles, reducing the need for frequent regeneration.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Refining the reaction conditions and system designs to achieve higher yields and efficiency, while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation.

近期，利用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究进展主要涉及不同催化剂体系的应用，特别是过渡金属/氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面显示出与传统方法相比的改进。然而，仍存在一些持续的挑战，包括反应环境的腐蚀性和反应本身的固有属性。未来的研究和发展应集中在几个关键领域以优化ODHP过程：

1. 提高C-H键活化：开发能够选择性地激活丙烷中的C-H键而不会发生不希望的副反应的更高效的催化剂。

2. 增强催化剂再生能力：设计能够保持其活性和选择性多次反应循环的催化剂，减少频繁再生的需求。

3. 优化反应系统：精炼反应条件和系统设计，以实现更高的产率和效率，同时最小化能量消耗和废物生成。
