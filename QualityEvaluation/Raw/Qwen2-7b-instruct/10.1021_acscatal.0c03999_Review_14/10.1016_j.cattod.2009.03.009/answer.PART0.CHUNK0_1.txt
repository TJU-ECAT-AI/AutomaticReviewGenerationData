The literature discusses the recent advancements in producing syngas from methane through the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane (CRPOM) processes. This method is considered environmentally friendly due to its energy coupling capability, adjustable hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio, and a safer operational environment. Nickel-based catalysts, particularly those prepared using nickel citrate, exhibit superior performance and stability compared to catalysts made with nickel nitrate. The nickel citrate precursor facilitates the formation of nickel silicate-like species, which are responsible for high dispersion of nickel and prevent particle sintering at high temperatures, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

The document highlights that nickel nitrate results in larger particle sizes and poorer catalytic performance, especially in catalysts with lower nickel loadings. In contrast, nickel citrate leads to catalysts with superior activity and stability, indicating its potential for optimizing CRPOM processes.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the process and managing inherent reaction properties. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize the CRPOM processes.

文献讨论了从甲烷制备合成气的组合二氧化碳重整和部分甲烷氧化（CRPOM）过程的最新进展。这种方法被认为是一种环保的方法，因为它具有能量耦合能力、可调整的氢与碳单质的比例，并且具有更安全的操作环境。镍基催化剂，尤其是那些使用镍柠檬酸盐准备的催化剂，在活性和稳定性方面优于使用镍硝酸盐的催化剂。镍柠檬酸盐前体促进了镍硅酸盐样物种的形成，这些物种负责高分散的镍和防止高温下的颗粒聚集，从而提高了催化活性。

文档指出，镍硝酸盐导致较大的颗粒大小和较差的催化性能，尤其是在低镍负载的催化剂中。相比之下，镍柠檬酸盐导致活性和稳定性的催化剂，表明其在优化CRPOM过程方面的潜力。

该领域面临的挑战包括过程的腐蚀性和管理固有反应性质。未来的研究方向集中在改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化CRPOM过程。
