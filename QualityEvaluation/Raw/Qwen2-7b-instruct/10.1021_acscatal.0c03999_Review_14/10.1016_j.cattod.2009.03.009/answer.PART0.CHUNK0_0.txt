The literature discusses the recent advancements in the production of syngas from methane through the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane (CRPOM) over Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared using nickel citrate precursor. The use of nickel nitrate precursor results in larger nickel particle sizes, leading to poor catalytic activity, especially for low Ni-loadings. In contrast, the nickel citrate precursor leads to superior catalytic activity and stability. The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 forms nickel silicate-like species, which is the primary reason for the high dispersion of Ni and prevents particle sintering at high temperatures. High dispersion of Ni over the catalyst surface is crucial for its excellent catalytic activity.

文献讨论了从甲烷生产合成气的最新进展，通过二氧化碳重整和部分甲烷氧化（CRPOM）结合方式在以柠檬酸镍为前驱体制备的Ni/SiO2催化剂上进行。使用镍硝酸盐前驱体导致较大的镍颗粒尺寸，从而产生较差的催化活性，尤其是对于低Ni负载。相反，使用柠檬酸镍前驱体可获得优越的催化活性和稳定性。NiO与SiO2之间的强烈相互作用形成了镍硅酸盐类似物，这是Ni高分散和防止高温下颗粒烧结的主要原因。催化剂表面Ni的高分散是其优异催化活性的关键因素。
