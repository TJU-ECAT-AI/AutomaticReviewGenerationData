[1] "The production of syngas from methane is one of the most promising utilization approaches of natural gas, which is now recognized to be one of the potential substitute resources for petroleum due to its abundant storage in the world."
[2] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process, and (3) a safer operating environment."
[3] "In recent years, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts."
[4] "The Ni/SiO2 prepared with the nickel citrate precursor exhibited good catalytic performances for its highly dispersed metallic nickel derived from the nickel silicate species."
[5] "The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of 3NiSC was investigated (shown in Fig. 2)."
[6] "However, as the nickel citrate precursor was used, the superior catalytic activity and stability were obtained over Ni/SiO2 catalysts."

The document discusses the use of Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared with nickel citrate and nickel nitrate in the production of syngas through the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane. The nickel citrate precursor strengthens the interaction between NiO and the support to form nickel silicate-like species, which can be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures. This leads to superior catalytic activity and stability compared to catalysts prepared with nickel nitrate. The document also notes that the nickel citrate precursor enables the formation of nickel silicate-like species that can be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel, which is crucial for the high activity of the Ni/SiO2 catalysts.

文献讨论了使用镍柠檬酸盐和硝酸盐前体制备的Ni/SiO2催化剂在通过二氧化碳重整和甲烷部分氧化合成合成气中的应用。镍柠檬酸盐前体增强了NiO与支撑物之间的相互作用，形成了镍硅酸盐类似物，这些物质可以在高温下被还原为金属镍的小晶粒。这导致了与硝酸盐前体制备的催化剂相比，具有更好的催化活性和稳定性。文献还指出，镍柠檬酸盐前体使镍硅酸盐类似物的形成成为可能，这种类似物可以在高温下被还原为金属镍的小晶粒，这是Ni/SiO2催化剂高活性的关键。
