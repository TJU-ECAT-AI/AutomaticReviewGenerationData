[1] "The production of syngas from methane is one of the most promising utilization approaches of natural gas, which is now recognized to be one of the potential substitute resources for petroleum due to its abundant storage in the world."
[2] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process,and (3) a safer operating environment."
[3] "In recent years, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts."
[4] "The nickel citrate precursor strengthened interaction between NiO and support to form nickel silicate like species which could be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures."
[5] "The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 formed nickel silicate like species over the NiSC, which was the main reason for high nickel dispersion and effectively prevention nickel particle from sintering at high reaction temperatures."

1. The production of syngas from methane is considered a promising method for utilizing natural gas, as it serves as a potential substitute for petroleum due to its abundant storage worldwide. 

2. CRPOM (combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane) is a more environmentally friendly and advantageous process compared to POM (partial oxidation of methane) and CDR (carbon dioxide reforming), as it offers energy coupling, controllable product ratio of H2/CO based on post-process needs, and a safer operational setting.

3. Nickel-based catalysts have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and higher activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts.

4. The nickel citrate precursor enhanced the interaction between NiO and the support material, leading to the formation of nickel silicate-like species. These species could be reduced at high temperatures to yield small crystallites of metallic nickel.

5. The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 resulted in the formation of nickel silicate-like species over the NiSC (catalyst prepared with nickel citrate). This mechanism was responsible for the high dispersion of nickel and prevented particle sintering at high reaction temperatures.

1. 从甲烷制备合成气是利用天然气的一种有前景的方法，因其全球丰富的存储量而被认为是石油的潜在替代资源。

2.CRPO（二氧化碳重整和部分甲烷氧化的组合）是一种与POM（部分甲烷氧化）和CDR（二氧化碳重整）相比更为环保且优势明显的工艺过程，它提供了能量耦合、根据后处理需求控制H2/CO产物比例以及更安全的操作环境。

3. 镍基催化剂由于其成本效益高和与贵金属基催化剂相比的更高活性而引起了广泛关注。

4. 镍柠檬酸盐前体增强了NiO与支持材料之间的相互作用，导致镍硅酸盐类物种的形成。这些物种可以在高温下被还原为小晶粒的金属镍。

5. NiO与SiO2之间的强相互作用导致了NiSC（使用柠檬酸盐前体制备的催化剂）上镍硅酸盐类物种的形成。这种机制是高镍分散和防止颗粒在高温反应条件下烧结的主要原因。
