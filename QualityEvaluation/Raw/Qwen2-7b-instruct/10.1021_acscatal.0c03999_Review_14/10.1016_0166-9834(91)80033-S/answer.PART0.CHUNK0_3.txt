<p>The objective of this work has been the study of an alternative route for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane.</p>
<p>Typically, solid catalysts like vanadium/magnesia catalysts give ca. 20% conversion with 60% selectivity [1].</p>
<p>Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations indicate that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities.</p>

<p>Dehydrogenation was performed in 2.8 wt.-% LiOH.H,O/LiI at 666C with propane : air mixtures varying from 1: 1 to 1: 4.</p>
<p>Increasing the air/propane ratio is to produce more CO2.</p>
<p>We see that the main effect of increasing the air/propane ratio is to produce more CO2.</p>

1. The aim of this research is to explore an alternative method for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane.
2. Traditionally, catalysts such as vanadium/magnesia yield around 20% conversion with a selectivity of 60%.
3. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses suggest that using lower temperatures leads to higher propene selectivity.
4. Experimental outcomes corroborate this theory. The predominant factor affecting propene selectivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals.
5. Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen for propene or benzene production is practical.
6. Dehydrogenation occurred in a 2.8 wt.-% LiOH.H,O/LiI salt melt at 666C with varying propane : air ratios from 1:1 to 1:4.
7. Increasing the air/propane ratio leads to the production of more CO2.
8. The primary impact of enhancing the air/propane ratio is the increase in CO2 production.
9. Comparisons can be made to previous studies on butane at 823 K [4].
10. Assuming 823 K, [C4H10] equals 0.4 atm, [I] equals approximately 3.5 mm Hg=4.6 x 10e3 atm,

1. 本研究的目标是探索烷烃脱氢的替代途径，尤其是丙烷。
2. 通常，如钒/镁催化剂的转化率约为20%，选择性为60%。
3. 热力学和动力学分析表明，使用较低温度可以提高丙烯选择性。
4. 实验结果证实了这一点。决定丙烯选择性的主要因素是正丙基/异丙基自由基的比例。
5. 优化碘化氢催化氧化脱氢过程，用于丙烯或苯生产是可行的。
6. 在2.8 wt.-% LiOH.H,O/LiI熔盐中，以不同比例的丙烷：空气（1:1至1:4）进行脱氢。
7. 增加空气/丙烷比导致更多CO2的产生。
8. 提高空气/丙烷比的主要影响是增加CO2的产量。
9. 可以将这些结果与在823 K时的丁烷研究进行比较[4]。
10. 假设823 K下，[C4H10]等于0.4 atm，[I]大约等于3.5 mm Hg=4.6 x 10e3 atm，
