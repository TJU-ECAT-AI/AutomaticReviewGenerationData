Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the theoretical evaluation of propane reactions with iodine within a temperature range of 700-900 K. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses suggest that employing lower temperatures enhances propene selectivity in the ODHP process. Furthermore, the document states that optimizing the system for either propene or benzene production is feasible.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the intrinsic properties of the reaction itself. The key areas for future research and development focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining the reaction system to optimize the ODHP processes.

Recent studies have focused on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane using soft oxidants, aiming to achieve higher yields at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation processes. The utilization of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts has been investigated for their selectivity and conversion efficiency. Challenges persist in this field, including corrosion resistance and managing reaction properties. Future research aims to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to better control product distribution and yield, specifically targeting propene and benzene production. Comparisons with previous findings on butane at 823 K have provided insights into the reaction dynamics and selectivity under similar conditions.
