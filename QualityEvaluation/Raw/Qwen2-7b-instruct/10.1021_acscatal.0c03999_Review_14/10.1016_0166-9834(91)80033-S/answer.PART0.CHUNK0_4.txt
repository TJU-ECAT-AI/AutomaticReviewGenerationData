Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants have been focused on enhancing catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been studied for their selectivity and conversion efficiency. Challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and managing inherent reaction properties. Key areas for future research and development aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. At 823 K, the equilibrium pressure of iodine radical from reaction (10) is 3 mm Hg, indicating its potential role in ODHP under certain conditions.
