Recent studies have focused on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane using soft oxidants, aiming to achieve higher yields at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation processes. The utilization of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts has been investigated for their selectivity and conversion efficiency. Challenges persist in this field, including corrosion resistance and managing reaction properties. Future research aims to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to better control product distribution and yield, specifically targeting propene and benzene production. Comparisons with previous findings on butane at 823 K have provided insights into the reaction dynamics and selectivity under similar conditions.
