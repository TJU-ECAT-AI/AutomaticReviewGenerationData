Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the theoretical evaluation of propane reactions with iodine within a temperature range of 700-900 K. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses suggest that employing lower temperatures enhances propene selectivity in the ODHP process. Furthermore, the document states that optimizing the system for either propene or benzene production is feasible.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the intrinsic properties of the reaction itself. The key areas for future research and development focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining the reaction system to optimize the ODHP processes.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，文献在700-900 K的温度范围内评估了丙烷与碘的反应。热力学和动力学考虑表明，采用较低温度可以提高丙烯选择性。此外，文献指出优化系统以生产丙烯或苯是可行的。

该领域面临的挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性和反应本身的固有性质。未来研究与开发的关键领域集中在增强C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统，以优化ODHP过程。
