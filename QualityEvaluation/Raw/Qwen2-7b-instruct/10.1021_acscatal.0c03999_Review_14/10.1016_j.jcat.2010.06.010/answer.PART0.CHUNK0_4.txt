[1] "Several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."

1. The recent study applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions to identify the oxygen species formed from N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to examine their reactivity towards propane, propene, and CO oxidation. This was done because some previously proposed oxygen species were paramagnetic.

2. No paramagnetic oxygen species were observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. 

3. EPR spectroscopy was employed under controlled atmosphere conditions to experimentally determine the oxygen species formed from N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41, and to investigate their reactivity towards C3H8, C3H6, and CO oxidation.

4. The enhanced activity but reduced propene selectivity observed with O2 might be attributed to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O species.

5. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O species.

6. The reaction mechanism involving N2O might proceed through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions.

1. 最近的研究在控制气氛条件下应用了电子自旋共振（EPR）光谱学，以识别VOx/MCM-41上从N2O和O2形成的氧物种，并探索这些物种对丙烷、丙烯和CO氧化的反应性。这是因为之前提出的一些氧物种是顺磁性的。

2. 使用N2O重新氧化还原的VOx物种时，并未观察到顺磁性氧物种。

3. 在控制气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱学来实验确定从N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种，并研究它们对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。

4. 与O2相比，其活性较高但丙烯选择性较低的原因可能是由于形成了OxV5+  O2 ，OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O物种。

5. 与O2相比，其活性较高但丙烯选择性较低的原因可能是由于形成了OxV5+  O2 ，OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O物种。

6. N2O参与反应的机制可能通过参与核碱氧离子进行。
