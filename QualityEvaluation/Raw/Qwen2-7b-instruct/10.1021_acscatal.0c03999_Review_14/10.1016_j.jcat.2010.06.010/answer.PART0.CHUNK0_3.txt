[6] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."

1. Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been utilized. Notably, maximum propene yields up to 25% have been achieved.

2. The use of nitrous oxide as an oxidizing agent has significantly enhanced propene selectivity in ODHP processes, surpassing that of molecular oxygen, steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

3. Challenges in this field include the low olefin yields, making these reactions not yet fully suitable for industrial applications.

4. In the study, EPR spectroscopy was applied under controlled atmosphere conditions to identify the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with O2 and N2O. 

5. The presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species formed from O2 contributes to higher activity but lower propene selectivity in ODHP processes.

6. In contrast, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected upon reoxidation of the same catalyst with N2O, suggesting a different nature of oxygen species formed from this oxidant.

7. The facile deposition of oxygen from N2O on the surface of partially reduced oxides, likely including VOx/MCM, explains the absence of detectable oxygen species through EPR.

8. The lack of observable oxygen species indicates that the transfer of a second electron occurs very rapidly, leading to the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion incorporated into the catalyst structure.

9. Future research aims to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to further refine ODHP processes.

1. 近年来，通过软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究重点在于提高催化剂的选择性和转化率。各种催化剂体系，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，被广泛使用。值得注意的是，最高丙烯产率可达25%。

2. 硝酸盐作为氧化剂在ODHP过程中的应用显著提高了丙烯选择性，超过了分子氧、蒸汽活化的铁基沸石、纯钒氧化物以及含钒载体材料。

3. 这一领域的挑战包括低烯烃产率，使得这些反应尚未完全适用于工业应用。

4. 在研究中，通过在受控气氛条件下使用X波段和Q波段的电子顺磁共振光谱法，确定了还原VOx/MCM-41催化剂在接触O2和N2O后形成的氧物种的性质和反应活性。

5. 从O2形成的高度反应性的亲电氧物种的存在导致了更高的活动性但更低的丙烯选择性。

6. 相比之下，在N2O氧化还原过程中未检测到任何可用电磁共振活性的氧物种，这表明形成的不同类型的氧物种。

7. N2O易于在其表面沉积氧气，释放氮气，这可能发生在还原VOx/MCM上，解释了通过电磁共振无法检测到氧物种的原因。

8. 缺乏可观测的氧物种表明第二个电子的转移非常迅速，导致形成了一个被整合到催化剂结构中的二价氧2氧化离子。

9. 将来研究旨在改进C-H键活化，提高催化剂再生能力，并优化反应系统以进一步完善ODHP过程。
