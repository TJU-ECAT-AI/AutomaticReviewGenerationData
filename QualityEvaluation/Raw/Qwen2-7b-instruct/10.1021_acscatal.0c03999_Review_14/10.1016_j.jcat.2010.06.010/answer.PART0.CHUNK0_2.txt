[1] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. This might be due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[3] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."
[4] "From the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure."

1. The reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O does not produce EPR-active oxygen radical species, possibly due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions.
2. The presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species upon reoxidation with O2 contributes to higher activity but lower propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
3. N2O likely deposits its oxygen on the surface of VOx/MCM through the release of nitrogen gas, similar to its behavior on partially reduced oxides.
4. The absence of observable oxygen species by EPR suggests that a second electron is transferred very quickly, resulting in the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion integrated into the catalyst structure.

1. 使用N2O重新氧化还原态VOx物种时，未观察到具有活性的氧自由基物种，这可能是由于快速形成了亲核的O2氧化物离子。
2. 在使用O2重新氧化时，出现高度反应性的电荷吸引氧物种导致丙烷氧化脱氢的高活性但选择性较低。
3. N2O可能通过释放氮气在VOx/MCM表面沉积其氧原子，与在部分还原氧化物上的行为类似。
4. EPR无法检测到氧物种的事实表明，第二个电子被快速转移，从而形成一个整合到催化剂结构中的二磁性O2氧化物离子。
