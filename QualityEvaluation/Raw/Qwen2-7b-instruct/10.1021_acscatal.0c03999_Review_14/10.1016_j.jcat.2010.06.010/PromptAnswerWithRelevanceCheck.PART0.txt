[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[2] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[3] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
[4] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remained below monolayer coverage."
[5] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[6] "This, however, appears immediately, when 3 mbar of O2 are supplied in addition to the 6 mbar N2O."
[7] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

1. The structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance are influenced by the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide.
2. Materials with high surface area have achieved maximum propene yields of up to 25%.
3. The activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation tends to increase with higher agglomerization degree.
4. Propene selectivities do not vary significantly as long as the vanadium surface concentration stays below monolayer coverage.
5. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with oxygen (O2) might be due to the formation of certain oxygen species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O2 2, and Vn+  O.
6. The lack of detection of EPR-active oxygen radical species upon reoxidation by N2O suggests that the reaction pathways differ significantly from those observed with O2.
7. The higher activity of O2 and lower selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attributed to the formation of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species, which preferentially react with propene, compared to nucleophilic oxygen species present with N2O.

1. 氧化物支撑和沉积的五氧化二钒之间的相互作用决定了VOx物种的结构及其催化性能。
2. 表面面积高的材料已经实现了高达25%的丙烯产率。
3. 随着团聚度的增加，VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性会增加。
4. 只要五氧化二钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下，丙烯选择性不会有很大差异。
5. 氧气（O2）导致的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可能归因于形成了某些氧物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O。
6. 未检测到由N2O重新氧化产生的EPR活性氧物种表明，反应途径与使用O2时观察到的不同。
7. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，氧气（O2）导致的更高活性和较低选择性归因于形成高度反应性的亲电氧物种，这些物种优先与丙烯反应，而N2O作为反应物时存在的亲核氧物种则活性较低但选择性较高。

[1] "Several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."
[2] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."

1. The study aimed to identify the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts by applying EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions. These species were explored for their reactions with propane, propene, and carbon monoxide.
2. Upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O, no paramagnetic oxygen radical species were detected, unlike with O2.
3. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with O2 could be attributed to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O species. These species were found to be highly reactive.
4. With N2O, no highly reactive oxygen species were observed. Instead, nucleophilic oxide ions were likely involved in the reaction process.
5. Further research is needed to understand the differences in oxygen species formation from O2 and N2O and their implications on the catalytic performance in ODHP.

[1] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. This might be due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[3] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."
[4] "From the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure."

1. The reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O does not produce EPR-active oxygen radical species, possibly due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions.
2. The presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species upon reoxidation with O2 contributes to higher activity but lower propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
3. N2O likely deposits its oxygen on the surface of VOx/MCM through the release of nitrogen gas, similar to its behavior on partially reduced oxides.
4. The absence of observable oxygen species by EPR suggests that a second electron is transferred very quickly, resulting in the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion integrated into the catalyst structure.

1. Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been utilized. Notably, maximum propene yields up to 25% have been achieved.

2. The use of nitrous oxide as an oxidizing agent has significantly enhanced propene selectivity in ODHP processes, surpassing that of molecular oxygen, steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

3. Challenges in this field include the low olefin yields, making these reactions not yet fully suitable for industrial applications.

4. In the study, EPR spectroscopy was applied under controlled atmosphere conditions to identify the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with O2 and N2O. 

5. The presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species formed from O2 contributes to higher activity but lower propene selectivity in ODHP processes.

6. In contrast, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected upon reoxidation of the same catalyst with N2O, suggesting a different nature of oxygen species formed from this oxidant.

7. The facile deposition of oxygen from N2O on the surface of partially reduced oxides, likely including VOx/MCM, explains the absence of detectable oxygen species through EPR.

8. The lack of observable oxygen species indicates that the transfer of a second electron occurs very rapidly, leading to the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion incorporated into the catalyst structure.

9. Future research aims to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to further refine ODHP processes.
