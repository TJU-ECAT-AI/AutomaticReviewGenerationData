[1] "Several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."
[2] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[3] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[4] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."
[5] "Further research is certainly needed to clarify this issue."

1. The study aimed to identify the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts by applying EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions. These species were explored for their reactions with propane, propene, and carbon monoxide.
2. Upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O, no paramagnetic oxygen radical species were detected, unlike with O2.
3. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with O2 could be attributed to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O species. These species were found to be highly reactive.
4. With N2O, no highly reactive oxygen species were observed. Instead, nucleophilic oxide ions were likely involved in the reaction process.
5. Further research is needed to understand the differences in oxygen species formation from O2 and N2O and their implications on the catalytic performance in ODHP.

1. 研究旨在通过在受控气氛条件下使用EPR光谱学，确定氧分子从O2和N2O在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上的形成氧气物种，并探索这些物种对丙烷、丙烯和CO的反应性。
2. 在N2O重新氧化还原的VOx物种时，没有检测到任何顺磁性氧物种，而在O2的情况下则有。
3. 在用O2进行氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中活性更高但选择性较低的原因可能是由于形成了OxV5+  O2 ，OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O物种。这些物种被发现高度反应性。
4. 与N2O相比，在N2O中未观察到高度反应性的氧物种。相反，推测参与了核碱性的氧离子的反应过程。
5. 需要进一步的研究来理解氧物种从O2和N2O形成的差异及其在ODHP催化性能上的影响。
