[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[2] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[3] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
[4] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remained below monolayer coverage."
[5] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[6] "This, however, appears immediately, when 3 mbar of O2 are supplied in addition to the 6 mbar N2O."
[7] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

1. The structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance are influenced by the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide.
2. Materials with high surface area have achieved maximum propene yields of up to 25%.
3. The activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation tends to increase with higher agglomerization degree.
4. Propene selectivities do not vary significantly as long as the vanadium surface concentration stays below monolayer coverage.
5. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with oxygen (O2) might be due to the formation of certain oxygen species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O2 2, and Vn+  O.
6. The lack of detection of EPR-active oxygen radical species upon reoxidation by N2O suggests that the reaction pathways differ significantly from those observed with O2.
7. The higher activity of O2 and lower selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attributed to the formation of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species, which preferentially react with propene, compared to nucleophilic oxygen species present with N2O.

1. 氧化物支撑和沉积的五氧化二钒之间的相互作用决定了VOx物种的结构及其催化性能。
2. 表面面积高的材料已经实现了高达25%的丙烯产率。
3. 随着团聚度的增加，VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性会增加。
4. 只要五氧化二钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下，丙烯选择性不会有很大差异。
5. 氧气（O2）导致的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可能归因于形成了某些氧物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O。
6. 未检测到由N2O重新氧化产生的EPR活性氧物种表明，反应途径与使用O2时观察到的不同。
7. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，氧气（O2）导致的更高活性和较低选择性归因于形成高度反应性的亲电氧物种，这些物种优先与丙烯反应，而N2O作为反应物时存在的亲核氧物种则活性较低但选择性较高。
