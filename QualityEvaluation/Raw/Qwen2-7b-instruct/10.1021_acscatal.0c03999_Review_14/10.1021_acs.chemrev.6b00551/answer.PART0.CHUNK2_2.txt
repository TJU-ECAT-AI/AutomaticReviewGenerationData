[1] "The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates has been systematically studied based on a set of comparative experiments. (61) Investigation of the gas-phase methane bromination and catalyzed oxybromination at similar reaction conditions revealed a similar onset temperature (675 K) and the trends in methane conversion and product distribution of brominated products."
[2] "The robustness of vanadium phosphate was demonstrated in a 100 h on stream test at 753 K, showing stable catalyst performance (X(CH4) = 25%, S(CH3Br) = 64%, Figure 39a)."
[3] "Compared to the earlier literature, the operational window of all the active catalysts examined including CeO2 and FePO4 was advantageously shifted to lower temperatures at least by 100 K."
[4] "The performance of vanadium phosphate was optimized toward high CH3Br yield by variation of reaction conditions (Figure 39c)."
[5] "The advantages of ethane oxybromination over the oxychlorination route can be summarized as follows: (i) bromoethanes by themselves can be used as end products without further upgrading (e.g., ethyl bromide is widely used as a solvent or an anesthetic in medicine) and as an ethylating agent in the production of pharmaceuticals in organic synthesis industry (315) and (ii) the easy separation of bromoethanes from ethylene, due to the large differences in boiling points."
[6] "Among the viable reactions, including substitution, addition, cracking, and polymerization, it is of interest to promote only the addition of two chlorine atoms leading to a mixture of dichlorobutenes."
[7] "The conversion of HBr and bromine yield were quantified as a function of temperature. Increasing productivity of the bromomethanes was observed to be accompanied by decreasing HBr conversion and bromine yield, with a rise of reaction temperature."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides, such as vanadium phosphates, have demonstrated high selectivity and conversion in the reaction. These catalysts have an advantageous operational window shifted to lower temperatures compared to earlier catalysts. They exhibit stable performance over extended periods, as seen in a 100 h on-stream test at 753 K, where a conversion of 25% CH4 and 64% S(CH3Br) was achieved. 

The use of vanadium phosphates in ODHP is particularly advantageous because of the high selectivity towards bromoethanes, which can be directly used as end products without further processing. Moreover, the separation of bromoethanes from ethylene is easier due to the significant difference in boiling points. The optimization of conditions towards high CH3Br yield further enhances the efficiency of the process. 

Regarding challenges, the inherent reaction properties of ODHP, such as corrosiveness and the need for high temperatures, continue to pose difficulties. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are critical areas for future research and development. This includes exploring new catalyst materials, improving reaction conditions, and developing more efficient and durable catalysts that can operate under lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity and conversion.

最近，在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，针对各种催化剂体系的最新进展显示出了良好的结果。过渡金属/金属氧化物，如钒磷化物，已经在反应中展示了高选择性和转化率。这些催化剂的运行窗口相较于早期催化剂被优势性地转移到更低的温度。在753 K下的100小时连续测试中，实现了25%的CH4转化和64%的S(CH3Br)转化，证明了其稳定性能。

在ODHP过程中使用钒磷化物尤其具有优势，因为它们能够高效地将高选择性转化为溴乙烷，这种产物可以直接作为最终产品使用，无需进一步加工。此外，由于沸点差异显著，从乙烯中分离出溴乙烷也更为容易。通过优化条件以提高CH3Br的产率，进一步提高了过程的效率。

面对挑战，ODHP固有的反应性质，如腐蚀性和需要的高温，继续构成了困难。改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的关键领域是未来研究与开发的核心。这包括探索新的催化剂材料、改善反应条件以及开发能够在较低温度下运行但仍保持高选择性和转化率的更有效且耐用的催化剂。
