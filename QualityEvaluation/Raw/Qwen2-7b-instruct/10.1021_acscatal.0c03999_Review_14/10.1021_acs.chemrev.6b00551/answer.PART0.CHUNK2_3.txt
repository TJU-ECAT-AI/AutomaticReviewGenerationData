The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants include the discovery of vanadium phosphates as catalysts that exhibit unprecedented selectivity towards CH3Br compared to previous catalysts. Studies have shown that the onset temperature for both gas-phase methane bromination and catalyzed oxybromination is around 675 K. Optimization of the vanadium phosphate catalyst performance allows for a high yield of CH3Br, even under varying conditions such as total pressure, with only minor impacts on selectivity. As the total pressure increases from 1.4 to 1.8 bar, there is an increase in methane conversion while maintaining a selectivity greater than 86% for CH3Br.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最近进展中，发现钒磷化物作为催化剂，其对CH3Br的选择性远超以往的催化剂。研究表明，气相甲烷溴化和催化氧溴化反应的起始温度约为675 K。通过优化钒磷化物催化剂性能，可以实现高产率的CH3Br，即使在压力、总压力等条件变化时，选择性也仅略有下降。当总压力从1.4 bar增加到1.8 bar时，甲烷转化率有所提高，而CH3Br的选择性仍保持在86%以上。
