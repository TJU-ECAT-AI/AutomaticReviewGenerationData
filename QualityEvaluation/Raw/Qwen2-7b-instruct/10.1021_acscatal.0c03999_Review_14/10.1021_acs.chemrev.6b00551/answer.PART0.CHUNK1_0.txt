[1] "Dow Process More recently, the Dow Chemicals Company envisioned a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures (T < 700 K), enabled by the discovery of novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3 (Figure 18b)."
[2] "However, chlorine can be directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, thus the chlorination step is omitted."
[3] "It was reported that a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 can be achieved under conditions that simulated a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant."
[4] "However, both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts."
[5] "The process based on the catalysts is quite similar to the EVC route, as both employed the fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for chlorinated byproduct recycling."
[6] "BASF Process Another process has been conceived by BASF, using ethane as a raw material for the production of EDC, followed by EDC cracking to VCM (Figure 18c)."
[7] "It essentially merges ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, whether by means of thermal cracking or catalytic dehydrogenation, with ethylene oxychlorination to produce EDC by the known copper chloride-based catalysts."
[8] "Despite the high toxicity, it has been widely used in the production of fine chemicals since the beginning of the chemical industry due to the remarkable chemical properties."
[9] "Phosgene chemistry, albeit somewhat arbitrary in classification, encompasses phosgenation reactions of two main categories: those that introduce the building block carbonyl as a structural unit, and those involving phosgene and its derivatives as reagents."
[10] "The reaction is selectively catalyzed by pristine high surface area activated carbon materials, with the only byproduct of carbon tetrachloride within 1000 ppm levels."
[11] "On the basis of similar characteristics of the ample presence of bent carbon layers, semispheres, and carbon cages in activated carbon and fullerene (C60), Lercher et al. conducted a combined experimental and theoretical study on the reaction mechanism over C60 as a model system."
[12] "They suggest that the reaction may follow a two-step E-R mechanism (Figure 20)."
[13] "The reaction is found to be initiated by Cl2 activation over the triplet excited potential energy surface of C60, forming the surface bound [Cl2···C60] species."
[14] "It seems that the utilization of carbon materials promotes the adsorption of both reactants on the catalyst surface and thus enhances the performance."
[15] "It is claimed that this process can be implemented by modification of existing processes for the preparation of EDC/VCM from ethylene."
[16] "Disadvantageously, all these synthesis routes exclusively produced stoichiometric HCl (2 mol per mol COCl2) as a byproduct."
[17] "Therefore, technologies enabling the valorization of the HCl surplus into Cl2 are highly requisite."
[18] "Catalytic HCl oxidation was originally conceived and implemented by Henry Deacon and Ferdinand Hurter in 1870 over CuCl2/pumice catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor at 693723 K to curb HCl emissions from the Leblanc process."
[19] "Over the years, significant efforts regarding both catalyst formulation and reactor configuration were made to improve the original Deacon-Hurter process."
[20] "The catalyst formulation was modified through additives, such as didymium and/or potassium chlorides, which form molten salts and improve the catalyst stability."
[21] "Besides, owing to the exothermic nature of the process, fluidized-bed reactor technology was conceived, which allowed isothermal operation at reduced temperature."
[22] "Extensive research efforts have culminated in the identification of RuO2-based materials, exhibiting outstanding activity and stability and thus fulfilling the expectations for an industrial catalyst."
[23] "A recent review by Prez-Ramrez et al. summarized the chlorine recycling via HCl oxidation, with particular focus on RuO2-based catalysts from fundamental understanding to implementation."
[24] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."
[25] "Different carriers like silica gel, Al2O3, and pumice were used to disperse the ruthenium-containing phase."
[26] "Recently, RuO2 supported on TiO2 rutile is commercialized by Sumitomo, (208) and that on SnO2 cassiterite developed by BMS, (220, 221) is ready for large-scale application."
[27] "Still, the limited selling option and high cost for neutralizing HCl triggered the industrial and academic research in the past decade to hunt for novel catalysts capable of overcoming the above issues, particularly in relation to chlorine recycling in PU and PC manufactures."
[28] "Despite the strong active phase-support interaction in RuO2/rutile or RuO2/cassiterite systems, RuO2 is prone to sintering in a long-term use."
[29] "Sumitomo used silica, (208) whereas, Bayer opted for alumina which also served as a binding agent for the shaping of millimeter-sized bodies."
[30] "Surface RuO2xClx(110) was shown to catalyze the oxidation of HCl to Cl2 and H2O via a LH scheme along the rows of Rucus (coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium)."
[31] "Recycling of HCl is of paramount importance in the manufacturing of polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PC)."
[32] "However, demand for other plastics manufactured via chlorine chemistry, particularly PU and PC, grows at a higher pace than that of PVC, leading to a growing excess of HCl byproduct in the chemical industry."
[33] "Moreover, the emerging natural gas upgrading through halogen chemistry will also lead to the generation of HX in the functionalization and elimination steps (section 3, Figure 27, vide infra)."
[34] "Therefore, technologies enabling the valorization of the HCl surplus into Cl2 are highly requisite."
[35] "A recent review by Prez-Ramrez et al. summarized the chlorine recycling via HCl oxidation, with particular focus on RuO2-based catalysts from fundamental understanding to implementation."
[36] "Thus, a brief overview, with important findings reported afterward, is provided herein."
[37] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."
[38] "In contrast, archetypical copper-based catalysts need at least 100 K higher temperature to reach a reasonable activity level compared to RuO2 and undergo deactivation due to structural transformation forming fugitive copper chloride phases (Figure 21, panels a and c)."
[39] "Ruthenium-based catalysts for HCl oxidation to Cl2, first patented by Shell, have been known since the 1970s."
[40] "The key reason for the success of the latter formulations was shown to be the structural matching between the active phase and support, and thus both the rutile and cassiterite carriers enable the epitaxial growth of RuO2 on the surface."
[41] "This improves the metal dispersion as well as the activity and stability."
[42] "The above review also sheds light on the mechanistic aspects gathered in the literature through advanced in situ and operando methods, such as temporal analysis of products (TAP-2), prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA), ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies, and DFT calculations."
[43] "Besides, process and reactor design aspects were also described."
[44] "For the latter, two main reactor technologies have been developed for the implementation of RuO2-based catalyst, namely: (i) multitubular fixed-bed reactors by Sumitomo, where the heat of reaction was continuously removed using a heat transfer salt and (ii) adiabatic reactor cascade by BMS, where the intermediate heat exchangers and dosing of HCl were introduced to efficiently use the heat of reaction."
