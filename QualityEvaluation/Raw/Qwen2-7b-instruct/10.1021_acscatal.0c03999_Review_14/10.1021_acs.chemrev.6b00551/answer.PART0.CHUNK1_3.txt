[1] "The Dow Chemicals Company envisioned a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures (T < 700 K), enabled by the discovery of novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3 (Figure 18b)."
[2] "The process based on the catalysts is quite similar to the EVC route, as both employed the fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for chlorinated byproduct recycling."
[3] "However, chlorine can be directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, thus the chlorination step is omitted."
[4] "Furthermore, this process is suitable for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene that can be recycled with HCl."
[5] "It was reported that a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 can be achieved under conditions that simulated a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant."
[6] "However, both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts."
[7] "Fluidization engineering, with regard to the reactor design and catalyst preparation, still presents a big technical hurdle to the commercial scale implementation of this process."
[8] "Another process has been conceived by BASF, using ethane as a raw material for the production of EDC, followed by EDC cracking to VCM (Figure 18c)."
[9] "It essentially merges ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, whether by means of thermal cracking or catalytic dehydrogenation, with ethylene oxychlorination to produce EDC by the known copper chloride-based catalysts."
[10] "HCl produced in the pyrolysis of EDC is separated and recycled to the oxychlorination reactor."
[11] "However, one-step VCM formation from ethane should be more straightforward and thus advantageous over this indirect route."

The Dow Chemicals Company has developed a fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures using the novel catalytically active materials LaOCl/LaCl3. This process employs a fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for the recycling of chlorinated byproducts. Chlorine is directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor, eliminating the chlorination step. The process is suitable for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene, which can be recycled with HCl. Under conditions simulating a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant, the process achieves a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1. However, both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts, presenting a significant technical hurdle for commercial scale implementation. 

BASF has also developed a process using ethane as a raw material for the production of EDC, followed by EDC cracking to VCM. This process combines ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, either through thermal cracking or catalytic dehydrogenation, with ethylene oxychlorination to produce EDC using copper chloride-based catalysts. HCl produced in the pyrolysis of EDC is separated and recycled to the oxychlorination reactor. One-step VCM formation from ethane is considered more straightforward and advantageous compared to the indirect route.

杜邦化学公司已经开发了一种流化床反应器技术，用于在较低温度下（T < 700 K）直接将乙烷转化为VCM，利用新型催化活性材料LaOCl/LaCl3。此过程使用流化床反应器进行氧氯化段，并且还有额外的氢化步骤来回收氯化副产品。氯可以直接引入氧氯化反应器中，因此可以省去氯化步骤。该过程适合乙烷和乙烯的共喂料，这些可以与HCl一起循环。在模拟试点工厂中完全回收反应副产品的条件下，过程可达到7981%的VCM产率和0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1的生产力。但是，在试点工厂反应器系统中的冷流和热流测试均显示某些催化剂存在严重的气固接触不良问题，这是商业规模实施过程中面临的主要技术障碍。

巴斯夫也开发了一种以乙烷为原料生产EDC，然后裂解EDC生成VCM的过程。此过程结合了乙烷脱氢生成乙烯，无论是通过热裂解还是催化脱氢，以及乙二醇氧氯化生成EDC，使用的是铜氯化物基催化剂。在EDC裂解过程中产生的HCl被分离并回收到氧氯化反应器中。从乙烷一步合成VCM被认为比间接路线更加简单和有利。
