The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been focused on developing catalyst systems that enhance selectivity and conversion. Transition metal/metal oxides, such as those containing iron, copper, and cobalt, and main group element metal oxides, like those containing tin and antimony, have been investigated for their ability to activate C-H bonds and facilitate dehydrogenation. Transition metal catalysts, especially those containing iron and copper, have shown high activity and selectivity towards the production of propylene. Main group element metal oxides have also proven effective, with tin and antimony catalysts demonstrating comparable or even superior performance in some cases. Challenges in this field include managing corrosiveness and ensuring the stability of catalysts over multiple reaction cycles. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation involve designing catalysts with specific surface properties and electronic structures that can effectively interact with propane molecules. Enhancing catalyst regenerability is crucial for practical industrial applications, and this can be achieved through the development of catalyst supports with enhanced thermal stability and the incorporation of self-renewable components. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes involves integrating advanced reactor designs, such as fluidized-bed reactors, to improve heat and mass transfer, and exploring the use of soft oxidants to reduce the risk of unwanted reactions. Future research directions aim to refine catalyst formulations, improve reaction conditions, and develop more efficient and environmentally friendly methods for dehydrogenation.
