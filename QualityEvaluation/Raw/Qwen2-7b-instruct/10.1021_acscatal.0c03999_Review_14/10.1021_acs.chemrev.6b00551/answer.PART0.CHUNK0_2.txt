[1] "Interest in the single-stage halogenation and oxyhalogenation continued owing to the simplicity of operation."
[2] "These processes have been only briefly alluded to in previous reviews focusing on methane activation."
[3] "A commercial facility for methane chlorination was first started by Farbwerke Hoechst in 1923."
[4] "However, the contemporary development of high-pressure methanol synthesis from syngas diverted the focus of methane activation from gas-phase chlorination."
[5] "Although the process was claimed to be very effective for selective halogenation of hydrocarbons, the commercialization was not reached."
[6] "Interest in the single-stage halogenation and oxyhalogenation continued owing to the simplicity of operation."
[7] "It should be emphasized that the implementation of a halogen-mediated process relies on a number of factors, such as the availability and efficiency of utilization of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, management of corrosion issues, etc."
