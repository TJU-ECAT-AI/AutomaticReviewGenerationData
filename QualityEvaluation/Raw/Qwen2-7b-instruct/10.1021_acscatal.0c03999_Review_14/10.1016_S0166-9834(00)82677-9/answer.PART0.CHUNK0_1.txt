[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C. The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi [ll]."
[4] "Over the whole tempera- ture range the amount of pentanes formed over both catalysts was low."
[5] "The fact that C4 is the main higher product seems at first strange since it has but one carbon atom more than propane."
[6] "We obtain mainly n-butane as higher product."
[7] "Indirectly the obtained results suggest that, most likely due to steric constraints,at higher temperatures propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products."

The literature discusses the use of a bifunctional catalyst, combining platinum and H-ZSM-5 zeolite, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The key findings are:

1. H-ZSM-5, with its strong acidic properties and shape-selective pore structure, facilitates the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons, including butane and pentanes, at moderate temperatures.
2. Incorporating platinum into the zeolite pores improves the conversion efficiency and reduces deactivation compared to physical mixtures of platinum and zeolite.
3. The conversion process involves two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene over the platinum surface, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite.
4. At temperatures below 350°C, butane is the predominant higher hydrocarbon product formed.
5. The literature suggests that, due to steric constraints, at higher temperatures propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products, explaining the predominance of butane as the higher hydrocarbon product.

文献讨论了铂与H-ZSM-5沸石结合的双功能催化剂在温和温度下对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的应用。主要发现如下：

1. H-ZSM-5凭借其强大的酸性特性和孔结构选择性，能够促进丙烷转化为包括丁烷和戊烷在内的更高碳数的烃类，在温和温度下。
2. 将铂负载到沸石孔中比物理混合铂和沸石能提高转化效率，并减少催化剂失活。
3. 转化过程分为两步：首先在铂表面将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合。
4. 在低于350°C的温度下，丁烷是主要的更高碳数产物。
5. 文献推测，由于空间约束，在较高温度下，丙烯会聚合成线性或单侧分支产物，解释了丁烷作为主要更高碳数产物的原因。
