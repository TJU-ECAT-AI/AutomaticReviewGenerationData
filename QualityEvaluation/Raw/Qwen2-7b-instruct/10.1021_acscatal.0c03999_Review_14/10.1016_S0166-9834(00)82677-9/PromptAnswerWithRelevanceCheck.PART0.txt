[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on."
[4] "The high nC /iC, ratio suggests that at reaction temperatures the propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite."
[5] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[6] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[7] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[8] "Firstly the conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[9] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[10] "The conversion started at about 200C and increased with temperature to about 18% for the 4 wt% and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts exhibit different performances in terms of selectivity and conversion rates. Zeolite H-ZSM-5, for instance, demonstrates strong acidic properties suitable for hydrocarbon reactions through carbeniumion intermediates, enabling the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, predominantly in the gasoline boiling range. The reaction sequence initiates with the formation of a carbeniumion through the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite, followed by reactions with subsequent alkene molecules to form dimers and so forth. The high nC/iC ratio at reaction temperatures suggests that propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of H-ZSM-5. Furthermore, studies by Chu et al. show that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum-loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600°C, indicating the coupling of aromatic formation with the production of smaller products such as CI and C2. The Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples demonstrate catalytic differences, with good reproducibility and higher activity in the temperature range of 200-350°C, showing enhanced conversion starting from about 200°C and reaching 18% and 12% for the 4 wt% and 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330°C, respectively.

最近，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展涉及各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面表现出不同的性能。例如，具有强酸性质的沸石H-ZSM-5非常适合通过碳正离子中间体进行烃类反应，能够将高度活性的小烯烃转化为烷烃和芳香烃混合物，主要分布在汽油沸程范围内。反应序列从吸附在沸石酸性基团上的单烯烃形成碳正离子开始，随后与后续的烯烃分子反应形成二聚体等。高nC/iC比在反应温度下表明丙烯聚合受沸石H-ZSM-5的形状选择性控制。此外，Chu等人研究发现，大约在600°C时，铂负载的H-ZSM-5可以将乙烷转化为BTX芳烃，这表明芳香族形成与较小产物如CI和C2的形成耦合。铂/H-ZSM-5样品显示出催化差异，在200-350°C的温度范围内表现出良好的可重复性和更高的活性，显示增强的转化率，从约200°C开始，分别在330°C达到18%和12%的4 wt%和0.4 wt%铂沸石。

The literature discusses the use of a bifunctional catalyst, combining platinum and H-ZSM-5 zeolite, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The key findings are:

1. H-ZSM-5, with its strong acidic properties and shape-selective pore structure, facilitates the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons, including butane and pentanes, at moderate temperatures.
2. Incorporating platinum into the zeolite pores improves the conversion efficiency and reduces deactivation compared to physical mixtures of platinum and zeolite.
3. The conversion process involves two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene over the platinum surface, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite.
4. At temperatures below 350°C, butane is the predominant higher hydrocarbon product formed.
5. The literature suggests that, due to steric constraints, at higher temperatures propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products, explaining the predominance of butane as the higher hydrocarbon product.

文献讨论了铂与H-ZSM-5沸石结合的双功能催化剂在温和温度下对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的应用。主要发现如下：

1. H-ZSM-5凭借其强大的酸性特性和孔结构选择性，能够促进丙烷转化为包括丁烷和戊烷在内的更高碳数的烃类，在温和温度下。
2. 将铂负载到沸石孔中比物理混合铂和沸石能提高转化效率，并减少催化剂失活。
3. 转化过程分为两步：首先在铂表面将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合。
4. 在低于350°C的温度下，丁烷是主要的更高碳数产物。
5. 文献推测，由于空间约束，在较高温度下，丙烯会聚合成线性或单侧分支产物，解释了丁烷作为主要更高碳数产物的原因。

[9] "The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5 zeolite can effectively activate propane, leading to its conversion into higher hydrocarbons. The introduction of platinum into the zeolite pores enhances the conversion rate and reduces deactivation, compared to physical mixtures of platinum and zeolite. This improvement is attributed to the confinement of active platinum particles within the zeolite's selective pore structure, which prevents coke deposition. The conversion process involves two main stages: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by platinum, followed by the oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite. Notably, platinum not only catalyzes the breaking of C-H bonds but also facilitates the formation of net.+ C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the production of lower hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. However, the selectivity to more valuable products remains a challenge. Future research directions could focus on improving catalyst regenerability, developing strategies for enhanced C-H bond activation, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the yield of higher hydrocarbons.

最近的研究表明，通过将铂与H-ZSM-5沸石结合使用，可以有效地激活丙烷，并将其转化为更高级的碳氢化合物。将铂引入沸石孔内能提高转化率并减少失活，与纯物理混合的铂和沸石相比有显著提升。这种改善归因于活性铂颗粒被限制在沸石的选择性孔结构中，从而防止了焦炭沉积。转化过程涉及两个主要阶段：由铂催化丙烷脱氢形成丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石酸性位点上的多聚化。值得注意的是，铂不仅催化C-H键的断裂，还能通过氢化和氢解作用形成净.+ C-H键，从而产生如甲烷、乙烷等低级碳氢化合物。然而，对于更优质产品的选择性仍然存在挑战。未来的研究方向可能包括提高催化剂再生能力、开发增强C-H键活化的策略以及优化反应系统以最大化更高碳氢化合物的产出。
