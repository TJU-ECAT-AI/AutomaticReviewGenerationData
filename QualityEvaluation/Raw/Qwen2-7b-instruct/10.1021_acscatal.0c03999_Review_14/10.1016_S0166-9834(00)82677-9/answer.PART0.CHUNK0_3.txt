[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "The conversion experiments however, were badly reproducable. At 300C the initial conversion to higher products fluctuates around 7 C%."
[4] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[5] "The product distributions obtained with the Pt loaded catalysts showed a number of interesting features (see Figure 2)."
[6] "It appears that both catalysts can convert propane to higher hydrocarbons."
[7] "The deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5."
[8] "This may be due to the fact that the active Pt is situated inside the pores where the shape selective properties of the zeolite prevent coke deposition."
[9] "The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite."
[10] "It appears that during propane conversion platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5 zeolite can effectively activate propane, leading to its conversion into higher hydrocarbons. The introduction of platinum into the zeolite pores enhances the conversion rate and reduces deactivation, compared to physical mixtures of platinum and zeolite. This improvement is attributed to the confinement of active platinum particles within the zeolite's selective pore structure, which prevents coke deposition. The conversion process involves two main stages: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by platinum, followed by the oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite. Notably, platinum not only catalyzes the breaking of C-H bonds but also facilitates the formation of net.+ C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the production of lower hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. However, the selectivity to more valuable products remains a challenge. Future research directions could focus on improving catalyst regenerability, developing strategies for enhanced C-H bond activation, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the yield of higher hydrocarbons.

最近的研究表明，通过将铂与H-ZSM-5沸石结合使用，可以有效地激活丙烷，并将其转化为更高级的碳氢化合物。将铂引入沸石孔内能提高转化率并减少失活，与纯物理混合的铂和沸石相比有显著提升。这种改善归因于活性铂颗粒被限制在沸石的选择性孔结构中，从而防止了焦炭沉积。转化过程涉及两个主要阶段：由铂催化丙烷脱氢形成丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石酸性位点上的多聚化。值得注意的是，铂不仅催化C-H键的断裂，还能通过氢化和氢解作用形成净.+ C-H键，从而产生如甲烷、乙烷等低级碳氢化合物。然而，对于更优质产品的选择性仍然存在挑战。未来的研究方向可能包括提高催化剂再生能力、开发增强C-H键活化的策略以及优化反应系统以最大化更高碳氢化合物的产出。
