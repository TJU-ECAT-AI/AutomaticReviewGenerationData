[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on."
[4] "The high nC /iC, ratio suggests that at reaction temperatures the propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite."
[5] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[6] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[7] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[8] "Firstly the conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[9] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[10] "The conversion started at about 200C and increased with temperature to about 18% for the 4 wt% and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts exhibit different performances in terms of selectivity and conversion rates. Zeolite H-ZSM-5, for instance, demonstrates strong acidic properties suitable for hydrocarbon reactions through carbeniumion intermediates, enabling the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, predominantly in the gasoline boiling range. The reaction sequence initiates with the formation of a carbeniumion through the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite, followed by reactions with subsequent alkene molecules to form dimers and so forth. The high nC/iC ratio at reaction temperatures suggests that propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of H-ZSM-5. Furthermore, studies by Chu et al. show that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum-loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600°C, indicating the coupling of aromatic formation with the production of smaller products such as CI and C2. The Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples demonstrate catalytic differences, with good reproducibility and higher activity in the temperature range of 200-350°C, showing enhanced conversion starting from about 200°C and reaching 18% and 12% for the 4 wt% and 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330°C, respectively.

最近，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展涉及各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面表现出不同的性能。例如，具有强酸性质的沸石H-ZSM-5非常适合通过碳正离子中间体进行烃类反应，能够将高度活性的小烯烃转化为烷烃和芳香烃混合物，主要分布在汽油沸程范围内。反应序列从吸附在沸石酸性基团上的单烯烃形成碳正离子开始，随后与后续的烯烃分子反应形成二聚体等。高nC/iC比在反应温度下表明丙烯聚合受沸石H-ZSM-5的形状选择性控制。此外，Chu等人研究发现，大约在600°C时，铂负载的H-ZSM-5可以将乙烷转化为BTX芳烃，这表明芳香族形成与较小产物如CI和C2的形成耦合。铂/H-ZSM-5样品显示出催化差异，在200-350°C的温度范围内表现出良好的可重复性和更高的活性，显示增强的转化率，从约200°C开始，分别在330°C达到18%和12%的4 wt%和0.4 wt%铂沸石。
