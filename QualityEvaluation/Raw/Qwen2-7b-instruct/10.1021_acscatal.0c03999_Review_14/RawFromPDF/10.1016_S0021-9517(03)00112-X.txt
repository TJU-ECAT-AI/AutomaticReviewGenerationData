Abstract
Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene produc-
tion. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of oleﬁn (propene and ethene).
The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species
to the reaction mixture. The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst
generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase. Alkane activation is rate determining. Oxygen has two
functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen inﬂuences the radical gas-phase chemistry signiﬁcantly because
the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased. At higher oxygen partial pressures the radical chemistry is only
slightly inﬂuenced by the increasing oxygen concentration. The second function of oxygen is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen from the
surface OH−species that are formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst. Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the
reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.

1. Introduction
An increased oleﬁn demand (especially C2–C4 oleﬁns)
is predicted for the coming years [1,2]; consequently in-
dustry is seeking alternative routes for the production of
lower oleﬁns, as the present production capacity will not
meet the needs. In Western Europe propene demand is pre-
dicted to grow faster than that for ethene (3.7 vs. 2.4%) in
the coming years [3]. The major source of propene currently
is steam cracking, which maximizes ethene yield, and con-
sequently, propene production from this source will barely
match the consumption. FCC and catalytic dehydrogena-
tion can be industrial alternatives to meet the shortfall of
propene production. In the FCC plant propene is produced
as a by-product; thus, FCC cannot be used as a dedicated
propene production process. The difﬁculties in carrying out
dehydrogenation of alkanes are diverse and are discussed in
great detail elsewhere [4]. The main problems in the classi-

cal dehydrogenation process are the low conversion caused
by thermodynamic constraints and coking. Oxidative dehy-
drogenation (ODH) can be a viable route for the production
of oleﬁns as the presence of oxygen counteracts the ther-
modynamic limitation and prevents coking. While this has
been recognized for a long time, an industrially applicable
process has not been developed, because secondary oxida-
tion of oleﬁns to carbon oxides is very signiﬁcant on most
materials [5–7]. Thus, the yields of oleﬁns remained under
30%, unsatisfactory for commercial application [8]. Among
many other catalysts, vanadia on magnesia support was the
most studied because of its high activity [6].
Recently, oxidative conversion of LPG has been reported
over Li–Dy–Cl–MgO catalysts: yields of oleﬁns (mixture
of butenes, propene, and ethene) as high as 50% were ob-
tained [9,10]. While ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and
methane oxidative coupling have been studied extensively
over alkali-promoted magnesia [11–14], studies of propane
oxidative dehydrogenation over these materials are limited
[15,16]. In our recent study [17] oxidative conversion of
propane and n-butane gave yields of oleﬁns in the range

of 50%. Propene and ethene were the major oleﬁn prod-
ucts when propane was used as feed. The ratio of propene
to ethene was higher compared to steam cracking at similar
conversions, implying a strategic advantage for meeting fu-
ture increased propene demand. From the catalysts reported
by Landau et al. (e.g., Li–Cl–Dy–Mg–O) we have shown
that lithium was the only essential ingredient for a well-
performing catalyst, thus providing a Cl-free oxidation cat-
alyst [17]. Cl−addition gave only marginal improvements
in oleﬁn yields, but induced stability problems. A simpliﬁed
catalyst system Li/Dy/MgO works equally efﬁciently. The
role of each component in this catalyst has also been dis-
cussed in detail earlier [17].
In this paper (part I) we report a detailed study on the
reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation in the
presence of oxygen over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts and the re-
action mechanism of propene oxidative conversion will be
proposed based mainly on the kinetic measurements. In the
subsequent paper (part II) we aim to characterize the active
sites of Li-promoted magnesia where the propane activation
takes place; and we will discuss the role of Li in the active
site.
2. Experimental
The catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation using an
aqueous solution of LiNO3 and a mixture of MgO (obtained
by calcining Mg(OH)2 at 700 ◦C for 3 h) and Dy2O3 powder
with the following target composition of the catalyst: 85 wt%
MgO, 7.7 wt% Li2O, and 7.3 wt% Dy2O3. The impregna-
tion step was followed by drying and calcination in air at
750 ◦C. Catalyst preparation, characterization, and catalytic
performance measurements are described elsewhere in more
detail [17].
Reaction rates were determined under differential condi-
tions at 600 ◦C in a kinetic setup employing a quartz mi-
croreactor (internal diameter: 4 mm) with a Varian 3800 GC
on-line. A catalyst bed of 200 mg catalyst was placed in the
microreactor taking up a volume of 250 µl. Two quartz bars
with 3 mm diameter were inserted upstream and downstream
of the catalyst bed to take up most of the free volume. Ther-
mocouples in quartz sleeves were placed above and below
the catalyst bed to measure temperature. The feed for typi-
cal measurements consisted of 28% propane, 14% oxygen,
2% carbon dioxide, and balance helium. When the kinetics
of propene conversion was measured the typical feed con-
sisted of 28% propene, 7% oxygen, and 1% carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide has been introduced to the feed in order to
achieve a constant CO2 concentration over the whole cat-
alyst bed, as CO2 has a strong inhibiting effect upon the
reaction (for further details see Section 3). The total ﬂow rate
was 100 ml/min unless stated otherwise. Propane conver-
sion was less than 10% and oxygen conversions were lower
than 15% in all cases unless otherwise noted. Maximum adi-
abatic temperature increase was calculated to be 5 K. During
experiments T measured across the across the catalyst bed
was about 3 K. The carbon balance was within ±3% in all
experiments where propane conversion was lower than 10%.
Reaction rates were calculated as mole product formed
per second per gram of catalyst (mol s−1 g−1). When mea-
surements were done in the absence of a catalyst, rates were
calculated in terms of mole product formed per second per
milliliter reactor volume (mol s−1 ml−1). All rates were ex-
pressed in terms of reactor volume (mol s−1 ml−1) when
rates obtained with catalyst were compared to rates mea-
sured in the absence of catalyst, under identical temperature,
partial pressure, and ﬂow rate conditions.
Mass transfer and heat transfer limitations were evaluated
by calculation. The criteria suggested by Mears indicated the
absence of mass- and heat-transfer limitations [18,19].
3. Results
3.1. Inﬂuence of temperature on catalytic activity and
selectivity
The inﬂuence of temperature on the catalytic perfor-
mance of the Li/MgO catalyst was studied in order to ﬁnd
the optimum temperature interval for the propane conversion
reaction. Fig. 1 shows how the selectivities and propane con-
version evolve with temperature over 7 wt% Li2O-promoted
magnesia catalyst under constant space velocity. Propene
was the main product over the whole temperature range
except at 700 ◦C. The selectivity to ethene continuously in-
creased and above 650 ◦C it became larger than selectivity to
propene. Both the selectivities to CO and CO2 decreased be-
tween 500 and 600 ◦C, while between 600 and 700 ◦C they
remained fairly constant. Methane selectivity increased con-
tinuously.
The above selectivity data were obtained at differing con-
version levels. Fig. 2 shows the variation in selectivity of the
various products with the level of conversion, measured at
600 ◦C. It is obvious that selectivities vary only marginally

with the level of conversion, which is characteristic for all
Li-promoted magnesia catalysts. A temperature of 600 ◦C
was chosen for detailed measurement of the kinetics for the
Li/Dy/MgO catalyst.
3.2. Propane partial pressure variation
Rates of formation of products varied linearly with
propane partial pressure in the range of 0–0.3 bar (Fig. 3).
This indicates a ﬁrst-order reaction, where propane partici-
pates in the rate-determining step. Above 0.3 bar the rate of
formation of propene, ethene, and methane showed an ex-
ponential increase, while the rate of formation of CO and
hydrogen continued to vary linearly.
3.3. Oxygen partial pressure variation
The rates of formation of products appear to follow a
complex pattern with respect to the oxygen partial pres-
sure (Fig. 4). The rates of formation of propene, ethene, and
methane increased steeply at very low oxygen partial pres-
sures, i.e., when increasing oxygen partial pressure from 0 to
5 mbar. It is interesting to note that in the absence of oxygen
the molar rates of formation of propene, ethene, and methane
are nearly equal. Increasing oxygen in the feed from 0 to
5 mbar maintains this 1:1:1 ratio. Further increase of oxygen
content in the feed inﬂuenced differently the rates of forma-
tion of the different products. Propene continued to increase
linearly with oxygen partial pressure while ethene remained
constant. Rate of methane formation declined with oxygen
partial pressure, while at the same time the formation rate of
CO increased. By power-law ﬁt of these data it was calcu-
lated that the formation rate of CO has an apparent order of
0.5 in oxygen partial pressure.
It is important to note that the sum of production rates of
CH4 and CO equals the formation rate of ethene independent
of the partial pressures of both propane and oxygen. This
fact seems to indicate that a common C1 intermediate leads
to formation of CH4 and CO.

3.4. Gas-phase reactions
The reaction kinetics of propane conversion was also
evaluated in an empty reactor in order to assess the extent to
which gas-phase homogeneous reactions inﬂuence the con-
version of propane. Propane and oxygen partial pressures
have been varied in a manner similar to experiments with
catalyst present in the reactor. Care has been taken to avoid
any Li contamination of the quartz reactor.
When the propane partial pressure was varied during re-
action in the empty reactor, the formation rates for all prod-
ucts increased exponentially (Fig. 5). The apparent reaction
order increases with propane partial pressure. Formation of
CO and H2 was not detectable below 0.2 bar of propane. Re-
action rates varied in a similar fashion with oxygen partial
pressure as in the presence of catalyst (Fig. 6). In both cases

a sharp increase at low oxygen pressures was observed. Hy-
drogen was also formed with a comparable rate. However,
the rate of formation of CO was four times lower than that
in the presence of catalyst. In the case of the empty reactor
the sum of the CO and CH4 formation rates is not equal to
the ethene formation rate (Fig. 6).
The conversion increased linearly with residence time
when catalyst was present. In the empty reactor conversion
increased exponentially and followed a sigmoidal curve at
high residence time due to the exhaustion of oxygen (Fig. 7).
At residence times lower than 0.5 s conversion with the cata-
lyst bed was higher, while at higher residence times (> 0.5 s)
conversion in the empty reactor was higher than that over
the catalyst bed. It must be noted, however, that this exper-
iment was not attempted to be conﬁned to differential con-
ditions and CO2 was not added to the reaction feed, unlike
in all other measurements reported in this paper. The typi-

out 200 mg catalyst.
cal residence time for standard conditions of 28% propane,
14% oxygen, 2% CO2, and balance helium with 100 ml/min
total ﬂow rate at 600 ◦C was 0.15 s in the empty reactor and
0.06 s when the catalyst was present.
The postcatalytic void downstream of the catalyst bed
was increased by the same volume as the volume of the cata-
lyst bed (e.g., 250 µl) by pulling the inserted quartz bar away
from the catalyst bed. This change caused a 25% increase
in propane conversion under the typical conditions of 28%
propane, 14% oxygen, 2% CO2, and balance helium with
100 ml/min total ﬂow rate at 600 ◦C.
3.5. Effect of reaction products on the reaction rates
The reaction pathways were investigated by measuring
the inﬂuence of product species added to the feed on the
reaction rates. Product species were added to the reaction
mixture, keeping all the conditions including temperature,
partial pressures, and ﬂow rates constant, except for the par-
tial pressure of He to balance the addition. Fig. 8 shows the
relation between the amount of CO2 in the feed and the rates
of formation of all products. For the sake of clarity, only the
rate of propene formation was plotted on the graph; the rates
for the other products can be evaluated via the selectivities.
The rates decreased with a negative order in the CO2 par-
tial pressure as observed in the methane oxidative coupling
also [20], while selectivity to propene and ethene was not
signiﬁcantly affected (Fig. 8). The strong inhibition caused
by the carbon dioxide appears to be reversible, as the activ-
ity was restored to its original value, when CO2 was removed
from the feed.
The inﬂuence of the CO2 concentration on the activity is
the most signiﬁcant effect, whereas all other product species
showed only minor effects, as will be shown later. Differ-
ential measurements result in correct data only when the

lectivity of the main products. Conditions: P (C3H8), 280 mbar; P (O2),
140 mbar; T , 600 ◦C; total ﬂow, 100 ml/min; 200 mg catalyst.
concentrations of all species that inﬂuence the reaction rates
are approximately constant. Therefore, it was necessary to
add excess CO2 to the feed in all differential measurements
reported here. Addition of CO2 to the reaction feed did not
have any signiﬁcant inﬂuence upon the reaction rates in the
absence of catalyst.
Adding 5% hydrogen to the reaction mixture inﬂuenced
the reaction rates only to a marginal extent at 600 ◦C; i.e., the
selectivity to CO increased from 9 to 10% and the selectivity
to CO2 decreased from 12 to 11%. Signiﬁcant conversion of
hydrogen was not observed. Addition of water also had no
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the reactions.
The presence CO reduced the reaction rates; however, this
inhibiting effect is far smaller than that of CO2. Adding 5%
CO to the reaction stream (which is 10 times more than what
is produced in the reaction under the tested conditions) de-
creased the conversion at 600 ◦C from 7 to 5% and at 650 ◦C
from 27.5 to 24%. It was observed that part of the CO was
converted to CO2. Selectivities for the major products were
not affected signiﬁcantly.
3.6. Reactions of propene
The rates of formation of products from the primary prod-
uct propene were measured as a function of the partial pres-
sures of propene, oxygen, and CO2 in order to assess the
reaction kinetics of the secondary reactions. The conditions
used were similar to those of propane reaction.
The main products from propene were carbon oxides and
hydrogen. The carbon oxides accounted for 70–80% of the
products made. Other products included methane, ethene, C4
(mainly 1-butene), and small amounts of unidentiﬁed higher
hydrocarbons. The rate of formation of all the measured
products varied linearly with the partial pressure of propene
(Fig. 9). The rates of formation of methane, ethene, and C4
were similar over the whole pressure range. The inﬂuence of
oxygen partial pressure on the propene reaction was clearly

different from its effect on the propane conversion. The rates
of formation of the main products noted above increased lin-
early with oxygen partial pressure (Fig. 10). Also in this case
the rates of formation of methane, ethene, and butene varied
similarly.
Carbon dioxide had a comparable inhibiting effect on
the conversion of propene as on the conversion of propane.
Rates of formation of all products decreased with increasing
CO2 partial pressure without markedly changing the product
spectrum (Fig. 11). It can be calculated from these data that
the reactions to H2, CO, CO2, methane, and ethene are order
−1 in the CO2 partial pressure.
Reacting a mixture of propene and hydrogen with oxygen
over the catalyst at 600 ◦C, we did not observe preferen-
tial combustion of hydrogen. Adding up to 5 vol% hydrogen

did not inﬂuence the propene conversion signiﬁcantly. Upon
increasing the hydrogen concentration to 20 vol%, the con-
version rate of propene increased by a factor of 2, and the
CO formation rate by a factor 2.4. Under these conditions
hydrogenation of propene to propane was not observed.
The propene conversion rate was three times lower than
the conversion rate of propane over the catalyst under the
same experimental conditions (28% hydrocarbon, 7% oxy-
gen, 2% CO2 at 600 ◦C). Propene appears to be stable in the
gas phase even in the presence of oxygen. The conversion
rate of propene was about 40 times lower than the conversion
rate of propane under the same conditions (28% hydrocar-
bon, 7% oxygen at 600 ◦C).
Addition of 2 vol% propene to the reaction mixture
(8 vol% propane and 10 vol% oxygen in He) decreased
the conversion of propane by 25–30% over the catalyst at
600 ◦C. The rate of formation of COx from that mixture is
equal to the sum of the rates of COx formation in the individ-
ual reaction of propane and propene. Signiﬁcant differences
in the propene conversion rate were not detected, when it
was cofed with propane, compared to oxidation of propene
alone.
3.7. Inﬂuence of the reactant on the product distribution
In Fig. 12 the selectivities to the main products are shown
while using n-butane, propane, or ethane as feed under sim-
ilar conditions. While the conversion level decreased with
decreasing carbon chain length of the hydrocarbon, selectiv-
ity to total oleﬁns was in the same range in all cases, i.e.,
between 60 and 70%. Distribution of oleﬁns was rather sim-
ilar when n-butane or propane was the feed; i.e., ethene and
propene were produced with similar selectivities, the excep-
tion being the small selectivity of butenes from n-butane. In
the case of ethane the only oleﬁn observed was ethene, as

expected. Carbon oxide selectivities were in the same range
for all the hydrocarbons.
4. Discussion
4.1. Catalytic vs homogeneous activation of propane
Under certain conditions the conversion in the empty re-
actor is higher than the conversion in the reactor containing
catalyst (see Fig. 13). Therefore we will discuss ﬁrst the
question which of the two routes, homogeneous activation
or catalytic activation of propane, prevails in the presence of
the catalyst.
Activation of propane takes place predominantly on the
catalyst as long as the propane partial pressure is below typ-
ically 0.3 bar. This is concluded from the strong inhibiting
effect of CO2 on the catalyst activity at 0.28 bars propane
(Fig. 8), while no effect of CO2 was observed during mea-
surements with the empty reactor. Moreover,a reaction order

302

of one in propane as shown in Fig. 3 clearly differs from the
exponential relation observed in the empty reactor (Fig. 5),
where the reaction order is continuously increasing with
propane partial pressure. Furthermore, Fig. 7 shows a linear
relationship between contact time and conversion for the cat-
alyst, whereas the empty reactor shows a sigmoidal relation-
ship. Thus, the activation mechanisms are clearly different
in the two cases. The empty reactor shows typical behavior
of a radical gas-phase process, during which a pool of rad-
icals needs to be formed to autocatalytically accelerate the
reactions [21,22]. In contrast to this, experiments with the
catalyst show behavior typical for a catalytic reaction with
propane taking part in the rate-determining step. The rates of
propane conversion expressed in terms of moles per reactor
volume per second with the catalyst and in the empty reactor
are compared in Fig. 13. In the same plot, the rate over the
catalyst corrected to the same residence time as in the empty
reactor, with the dense volume of the catalyst bed, is also
shown. In the correction procedure it was assumed that all
reactions take place in the volume of the reactor where the
catalyst bed is located, and small contributions to the resi-
dence time from the entry and exit zones were neglected.
It follows from these observations that the contribution
of alkane activation in the gas phase is much smaller when
the catalyst is present than in the empty reactor. In Fig. 14
the rates over the catalyst bed (from Fig. 3) are separated
into contributions from catalytic activation and homoge-
neous gas-phase activation. Extrapolating the linear increase
at low partial pressures to the high partial pressures, the
contribution of the catalyst is tentatively obtained (contin-
uous line in Fig. 14). The second contribution is obtained
by subtracting the extrapolated line from the measured data
(dashed line in Fig. 14). The resulting curve strongly resem-
bles the dependence of the conversion rate upon propane
partial pressure in the empty reactor. Therefore, this con-
tribution is attributed to homogeneous gas-phase reactions.
The rate of the homogeneous gas-phase reaction estimated
Fig. 14. Decomposition of the rate of propene formation into catalytic and
homogeneous contributions. Data from Fig. 3.
in this way is one order of magnitude lower than the rates
observed in the empty reactor. The decrease in contact time
caused by the volume occupied by the catalyst cannot ac-
count for this decrease. Apparently, quenching of gas-phase
radicals takes place similarly to the process observed during
methane oxidative coupling [23–26], limiting the formation
of a pool of radicals to accelerate the reaction.
In conclusion, it appears that the rate-determining step in
the reaction pathways to propene, ethene, and methane in-
volves activation of propane on the catalyst surface, provided
that the propane concentration is below typically 0.3 bar,
despite the fact that catalyst activity in this study is signif-
icantly suppressed by addition of CO2. Under the typical
reaction condition of 28% propane, 14% oxygen, and 2%
CO2, total ﬂow rate of 100 ml/min with the catalyst present,
the homogeneous activation is insigniﬁcant according to the
estimation shown in Fig. 14. However, at the highest propane
partial pressure employed (0.5 bar) the contributions of ho-
mogeneous gas-phase reactions and catalyzed reactions are
approximately equal in the presence of catalyst.
The rate of formation of hydrogen and CO remain lin-
ear up to very high propane partial pressures, indicating that
these products are mainly formed through catalysis on the
solid surface. The comparatively low formation rates of H2
and CO in the homogeneous reaction support this conclu-
sion.
4.2. The role of oxygen and the reaction mechanism
The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The
presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown
by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product
formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from
0 to 5 mbar (Fig. 4). This very signiﬁcant increase is not
due to shifting the chemical equilibrium, as the gas com-
position at the reactor exit is far from the equilibrium even
in the absence of oxygen. A stepwise increase of the rates
in the empty reactor is also noted (Fig. 6) pointing out the
role of gas-phase oxygen in the reaction pathways to the
products. However, oxygen does not participate in the rate-
determining step at pressures above 5 mbar, as the apparent
reaction order in oxygen observed is below 0.2 for propene,
ethene, and methane. Oxygen possibly reacts fast with an ac-
tivated intermediate and this reaction step is rate determining
at extremely low oxygen partial pressures only.
The mechanism proposed to be operative under our con-
ditions here is based on homogeneous radical chain propa-
gation reactions, similar to thermal pyrolysis. Thus, we need
to introduce the terminology for radical chain reactions. The
term “activation” used so far should be understood as “initi-
ation” in the terminology of radical chemistry. We propose
that the initiation takes place mainly on the catalyst at low
propane partial pressures, while at the highest partial pres-
sures both on the catalysts and in the gas phase. The catalyst
inﬂuences the radical concentration in two ways, as it not
only generates radicals but also quenches them. The place

303
of initiation is speculated to be a Li+O−site [14,17]. Let us
examine ﬁrst the situation without oxygen.
4.3. Mechanism in the absence of gas-phase oxygen
When propane is activated on the catalyst a propyl radical
is formed by a hydrogen abstraction. Hydrogen is transferred
to the O−and forms OH−. In situ DSC studies of methane
activation over Li/MgO catalysts at 650 ◦C showed heat
evolution due to surface OH−formation on the Li+O−ac-
tive site [27]. In situ DRIFTS studies of Li/MgO catalysts
under methane oxidative coupling conditions (at 690 ◦C)
showed the presence of strongly bound OH−[28]. In anal-
ogy, we propose that in the presence of catalyst propane will
form a propyl radical and surface OH−. In part II of this
publication further evidence will be presented.
Two different propyl radicals can be formed depending
on whether primary or secondary hydrogen is abstracted.
Based on bond energies we tempt to conclude that predom-
inantly isopropyl radicals are formed on the catalyst (i.e.,
C–H bond energy on a secondary carbon atom is 3 kcal/mol
lower than on the primary one); however, there is no ex-
perimental evidence to conﬁrm this. The two radicals have
different decomposition routes: i-propyl can only undergo
β-scission of C–H bonds and decomposes into propene and
a hydrogen atom, while n-propyl preferentially follows a
C–C cleavage in the β position, forming a methyl radical
and ethene [29,30]. The methyl radical reacts then with a
second propane molecule forming methane and regenerating
the propyl radical. The hydrogen atom also reacts with an-
other propane molecule generating a propyl radical, and H2.
The four described reactions are presented below:
(1)
i-C3H7· →C3H6 + H·,
(2)
n-C3H7·→C2H4 + CH3·,
(3)
CH3·+ C3H8 →CH4 + C3H7·,
(4)
H·+ C3H8 →H2 + C3H7·.
From the kinetic models of the radical chemistry in the
oxidative pyrolysis and combustion literature it appears that
in the propagation steps, i-propyl and n-propyl radicals are
produced with comparable rates [31–33]. Consequently rates
of reactions (1) and (2) should be similar, and the same fol-
lows for rates of reactions (3) and (4). Thus, formally the
probability of C–C and C–H bond breakage is comparable.
This would result in a similar amount of propene, ethene,
methane, and hydrogen, which agrees well with our exper-
imental observations at very low oxygen partial pressures
(points at 0 bar oxygen in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). Similar ratios
between the products were also observed in thermal crack-
ing (without oxygen) at low conversions [31,34].
4.4. Mechanism in the presence of gas-phase oxygen
The presence of oxygen has two important effects. First,
we discuss the inﬂuence of oxygen on the homogeneous
chemistry that takes place. Second, we will discuss the ef-
fect of oxygen on the catalyst.
The enhancement seen by the oxygen addition can also
be explained with the proposed radical chemistry [35]. The
introduction of oxygen, even in small amounts, increases the
number and the concentration of the chain carrier radicals.
When oxygen is not present H· and ·CH3 radicals are the
main chain propagators according to reactions (1)–(4). In
the presence of oxygen the i-propyl radical reacts fast with
the oxygen molecule forming a hydroperoxyl (HO2·) radical
and propene. The hydroperoxyl radical further reacts with a
new propane molecule forming H2O2, which by decompo-
sition gives two hydroxyl radicals (·OH). ·OH becomes the
main chain propagator [36] and it forms water by reacting
with a propane molecule. This is perfectly in line with the
fact that hydrogen combustion did not occur selectively in
our reactor. Thus, we conclude that water is mainly formed
in the above-described process. The similarity of the inﬂu-
ence of small amount of oxygen on the propane conversion
in the absence and presence of catalyst conﬁrms the proposal
that O2 mainly inﬂuences the gas-phase radical propagation
reactions, independent of the origin of radical initiation.
The CH3· radical is the precursor for CO and CH4 in the
presence of oxygen. When ethene is formed through reac-
tion (2) a methyl radical is produced that can react further
either to methane or CO. If this methyl radical reacts with
a propane molecule, methane is formed. If it reacts with
oxygen an oxygenated intermediate is formed, which is sub-
sequently transformed into CO and further to CO2. Because
the same numbers of CH3· radicals and ethene molecules
are formed in reaction (2) the sum of the formation rates of
CH4 and CO equals the formation rate of ethene over the
whole range of partial pressures of both propane and oxy-
gen (see Figs. 3 and 4). In the empty reactor the sum of the
rates of CO and CH4 formation does not match the ethene
formation rate. We speculate therefore that a stable oxygen-
containing C1 intermediate is formed (formaldehyde, for
example) which is quantitatively converted to CO over the
catalyst, but is stable in the gas phase. Analysis of oxy-
genates was not performed, but the small gap in the carbon
balance (2–3%) makes this hypothesis feasible, since mech-
anistic models of homogeneous alkane oxidation predict the
formation of formaldehyde [23,36].
So far we have dealt with hydrocarbon activation and
gas-phase reaction steps. The proposed reaction mechanism
is schematically represented in Fig. 15. Assuming the pro-
posed initiation on the catalyst by hydrogen abstraction, the
question arises as to how the catalytic sequence is closed by
regeneration of the active site, i.e., how hydrogen is removed
from the active oxygen.
In the methane oxidative coupling literature primarily
Li/MgO dehydroxylation was proposed as the regeneration
step [37]. However, this step requires an energetically de-
manding removal of lattice oxygen. Regeneration of the ac-
tive site is possible without dehydroxylation with the help
of O2. Recently a new mechanism has been proposed that
304

does not require the highly energetic removal of lattice oxy-
gen, based on computation of energetic state of various sur-
face intermediates [38]. A sequence of reactions has been
proposed by Sinev et al. [39,40]. The four reactions proposed
are presented below:
(5)
O2 + OH−
s →O−
s + HO2·,
(6)
HO2·+ OH−
s →O−
s + H2O2,
(7)
H2O2 →2·OH,
(8)
·OH + OH−
s →O−
s + H2O.
The overall reaction equation of the regeneration is the
same as in the mechanism proposed by Ito et al. [37] but
it does not require or suggest the removal of lattice oxy-
gen. The experimental demonstration of this mechanism at
650 ◦C showed that OH−
s is decomposed upon admission
of oxygen to the reactor while water is formed [39,40].
It was also shown that dehydroxylation can occur as well
especially at high temperatures as a parallel regeneration
route [41]. Analysis of the literature data on redox mode
methane coupling suggests that at intermediate temperatures
(600–650 ◦C) regeneration must occur without lattice oxy-
gen removal, while at high temperatures (> 700 ◦C) lattice
oxygen removal is the most feasible route [42,43]. In addi-
tion to water elimination by dehydroxylation, some dihydro-
gen elimination from the Li/MgO catalyst was also reported
above 600 ◦C [44]. The prevailing route under our condi-
tions is, therefore, speculated to be the mechanism described
in Eqs. (5)–(8).
4.5. Effects of by-products on the catalytic performance
CO2 inhibits the reaction by adsorbing at the active
Li+O−site. It has been shown earlier, that these types of
catalysts strongly adsorb CO2. TPD of carbon dioxide sug-
gested that Li2CO3 forms under reaction conditions [14].
The fact that selectivities do not change upon CO2 addition
(Fig. 8) is in agreement with the hypothesis that the con-
version of propyl radicals to propene, ethene, and methane
is controlled by gas-phase reactions, which are not inﬂu-
enced by CO2. Fitting the rate data (only the catalytic con-
tribution) results in a −1 order in CO2 partial pressure. It
is speculated that Li2CO3 is not formed directly, as that
would result in −0.5 order, but possibly a stable precursor
is formed initially. Adsorbing CO2 on the Li+O−site re-
sults in Li+CO3−[45], which indeed has been detected by
ESR [46]. Adsorbed CO2 was also detected by in situ IR
spectroscopy, and it was suggested that CO3−formed is pre-
cursor for carbonate formation [28]. An alternative, though
similar, explanation for the −1 order in CO2 is based on the
suggestion that under reaction conditions a large fraction of
the active Li+O−sites exist in the form of Li+OH−[47].
Reaction of Li+OH−with CO2 would result in lithium bi-
carbonate, accounting for the −1 order.
The small inhibiting effect of CO is tentatively explained
by slow transformation of CO to CO2 that subsequently
blocks the active site possibly without desorption.
4.6. Importance of secondary reactions
It has been shown earlier that the rate of conversion of
propene was a factor 3 lower than the corresponding rate of
propane conversion under the same conditions when catalyst
was used [17]. Propene appears to be even more stable in the
gas phase, because propene conversion was 40 times lower
than propane conversion under similar conditions, when an
empty reactor was used. Thus, we conclude that propene
conversion occurs through catalytic reactions. This is also in
agreement with the observation that CO2 inhibits the conver-
sion of propene (Fig. 11). Moreover, the CO2 inhibition also
suggests that the catalytic site for propene activation must be
the same Li+O−active center as for propane activation.
The remarkable stability of propene in the gas phase can
be explained by the stability of the allyl (C3H5·) radical,
which is formed upon activation of propene. The part of re-
action pathways, which occurs in the gas phase, depends on
the reactivity of the radicals released upon activation. Al-
lyl radicals do not have a fast decomposition route in the
gas phase, unlike the propyl radicals that are considerably
more reactive. Therefore, the efﬁciency of propagation steps
is greatly reduced; consequently, propane conversion due to
radical chain propagation reactions is higher than that of
propene [48].
COx forms on the catalyst in analogous mode from
propane and propene, as follows. CO is formed from
propane only through catalytic activation pointed out by the
ﬁrst order in propane for the whole partial pressure range
(Fig. 3) and the absence of any formation of CO in the empty
reactor at propane pressure below 0.3 bar (Fig. 5), while CO
formation was rate limited in oxygen (0.5 order in Fig. 4).
Similarly, Figs. 9, 10 show that the conversion of propene to
CO and CO2 is ﬁrst order in both propene and oxygen. This
L. Leveles et al. / Journal of Catalysis 218 (2003) 296–306
305
suggests a rate-determining step involving both propene and
oxygen. Note, that the rate of COx formation is comparable
from both hydrocarbons; thus the total oxidation of propane
at low conversions, during differential measurements in this
paper, does not signiﬁcantly occur via the consecutive reac-
tion of propene.
The presence of propane does not seem to inﬂuence
the conversion of propene signiﬁcantly, but the conversion
of propane is reduced if propene is present, probably by
“quenching” of the radicals by the propene molecule while
forming less reactive allyl radical.
The enhancement of propene conversion upon addition
of hydrogen can be explained by the fact that hydrogen re-
moves the carbonate from the surface of the catalyst, as we
observed some CO evolution when hydrogen was fed over
the catalyst in the absence of any signiﬁcant hydrogen con-
version. In this manner hydrogen increases the availability
of active sites, and thus contributes to the enhancement of
the reaction.
4.7. C–C vs C–H bond breaking
Special attention will be paid to cleavage of C–H bonds
versus cleavage of C–C bonds as these steps control the
selectivity to propene and ethene, respectively. The mech-
anism proposed above describes the conversion of propane
as heterogeneously initiated chain propagation reactions in
the gas phase. Initiation over the catalyst prevails as long as
the propane partial pressure is below typically 0.3 bar. In this
mechanism the product distribution is mainly determined by
the gas-phase propagation steps. New experimental evidence
provides additional support for this hypothesis.
The decrease of dehydrogenation selectivity and in-
crease of cracking selectivity with temperature over Li/MgO
(Fig. 1) are explained by the higher activation energy of
formation of the primary alkyl radicals in the propagation
reactions [23]. The primary radicals preferably follow a de-
composition route involving C–C bond breakage.
The fact that the activity observed for ethane is signiﬁ-
cantly different from that for propane and butane (Fig. 12)
supports the proposition that the rate-determining step is hy-
drogen abstraction, i.e., a C–H bond breakage, during both
catalytic initiation and gas-phase propagation. The bond en-
ergy of a secondary C–H bond is similarly the weakest in
propane and butane (98.5 and 98.2 kcal/mol, respectively),
while a primary C–H bond energy is somewhat higher in
all the alkanes (101.1 kcal/mol) [49,50]. Since ethane pos-
sesses only primary C–H bonds, its activity is signiﬁcantly
different from propane and butane, as the alkane conversion
is determined by the rate of C–H bond scission.
The distribution of oleﬁns formed from ethane, propane,
and butane can be explained by the decomposition routes of
the radicals according to the homogeneous radical chemistry
[23,51]. A primary radical, whether propyl or butyl, leads
preferentially to C–C bond cleavage in β position, resulting
in cracked products, except for the ethyl radical which can
only brake a C–H bond in β position. A secondary propyl
radical can only break a C–H bond resulting in propene,
while a secondary butyl radical can lead to either C–C or
C–H bond cleavage, resulting in propene or butene produc-
tion. It follows that more cracked products are expected from
butane than from propane, and hardly any cracking from
ethane, which is indeed observed experimentally (Fig. 12).
Secondary reactions of propene proceed with a much
lower rate than the primary reactions. This follows from the
observation that the conversion level of propane does not
inﬂuence the selectivities (Fig. 2), unlike in the case of typ-
ical redox catalysts such as vanadia [5,52]. This is in line
with the observations that propene conversion is a factor of
3 lower than that of propane under similar conditions, and is
attributed to the relatively low reactivity of allyl radicals in
the gas phase.
5. Conclusions
In this paper the main features of the reaction kinetics of
the oxidation of propane and propene over Li/Dy/MgO cat-
alysts have been described. A mechanism that qualitatively
explains these kinetic results is proposed in terms of mixed
heterogeneous–homogeneous radical reaction routes.
Alkane activation via a C–H bond splitting is the rate-
determining step for all reaction products. For propane, rates
are ﬁrst order up to 0.3 bar propane. At high propane partial
pressures (> 0.3 bar) the reaction order increases for all hy-
drocarbon products. This has been attributed to contributions
from homogeneous activation of propane.
The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial
for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reac-
tion rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been
attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the
chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via
OH radicals. A second function of oxygen is to regenerate
the catalyst via removal of hydrogen from the catalyst in or-
der to restore the activity of the catalyst for generation of
radicals.
Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the cat-
alyst for all products. The apparent order is −1, which is
attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3−
on the active site. Reactions in the gas phase were not inﬂu-
enced by CO2.
Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively
carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst. The rate
of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of
propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl
radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction condi-
tions.
The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane
conﬁrm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-
determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines
largely the selectivity pattern.
