Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes.

Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production.

In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Our earlier experience with propane oxydehydrogenation allowed us to expect an essential activity of iron modified zeolites ZSM-5 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine or react with a subsequent N2O molecule forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites.

Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity.

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts in terms of selectivity and conversion varies. Iron modified zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) show activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, while iron compounds impregnated on amorphous silicaalumina or silica did not show any activity for ODH reaction. Iron complexes accommodated in channels of ZSM-5 zeolite show the highest activity for ODH reaction. Iron complexes generated in silicalite of MFI structure and activated under the same conditions as Fe-ZSM-5 did not show any activity for ODH reaction, indicating that not only the crystalline structure but also the net charge of the zeolite matrix plays a significant role in the formation of active iron complexes.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent properties of the reaction itself. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improvements in these areas could lead to more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最近进展中，涉及使用各种催化剂系统，如过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的性能有所不同。铁改性的沸石（ZSM-5、莫尔登石、富贾斯石）在使用N2O作为氧化剂时显示出对乙烷氧化脱氢的活性，而以非晶二氧化硅-氧化铝或二氧化硅为载体的铁化合物则未显示任何氧化脱氢反应活性。嵌入到ZSM-5晶格通道中的铁复合物显示出最高的氧化脱氢反应活性。在相同条件下激活的MFI结构的硅酸盐中生成的铁复合物并未显示出氧化脱氢反应活性，这表明不仅晶体结构，而且沸石基质的净电荷在形成活性铁复合物方面也起着重要作用。

该领域面临的挑战包括反应条件的腐蚀性和反应本身的内在性质。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。这些改进可以导致更高效和可持续的ODHP过程。
