[1] "Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes."
[2] "Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production."
[3] "The success in the development of a new method for phenol production involving N2O utilization opened a new perspective for the other complex oxidation processes."
[4] "In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites."
[5] "Our earlier experience with propane oxydehydrogenation [4] allowed us to expect an essential activity of iron modified zeolites ZSM-5 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[6] "Considering the specific features of a-oxygen one could expect an alcohol formation as a result of light paraffins oxidation in the presence of iron modified ZSM-5 zeolite using N2O as an oxidant."
[7] "The oxydehydrogenation of light paraffins, therefore, seems attractive as a potential source of olefins, which are essential reagents for many industrial processes and the use of waste N2O as an oxidant for light paraffins to olefins transformation reveals a new perspective for light paraffins utilization."
[8] "The important role of cationic centres in the mechanism of the formation of a-iron complexes active for the BTOP process has been stressed by Panov et al. [14] and by other authors [15]."
[9] "Only iron species accommodated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant."
[10] "Regarding the above, both the number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1)."
[11] "However, one has to consider that active oxygen species formed over different iron complexes may indicate different susceptibilities for interaction with subsequent reagents (according to Eqs. (2)(4))."

[13] "Therefore, the activity for ethane ODH reaction should be lower than the activity for N2O decomposition."

[20] "Therefore, the activity for ethane ODH reaction should be lower than the activity for N2O decomposition."
[21] "On the other hand, as we have shown in this paper, iron species active for ethane ODH reaction may be formed not only in the channels of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites but also in other zeolite structures (faujasite, mordenite), while benzene to phenol hydroxylation in the presence of N2O occurs only over iron species accommodated in the MFI structure and no activity was found over Fe-Y and Fe-mordenite [16]."
[22] "N2O decomposition over a-iron complexes,indispensable for benzene hydroxylation, results in the formation of a-oxygen [14], which may be inserted into the CH bond forming OH group."
[23] "The activity of the samples under study for N2O decomposition increased with iron concentration (Fig. 1)."

[25] "Ethane oxidation over iron modified zeolites of MFI structure resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from 55% to 87% (Fig. 7)."
[26] "Additionally, ethene formed as a product of the ODH reaction shows a higher stability than propene. The CH bond in ethane (420 kJ/mol) is clearly stronger than the CH bond in propane (two CH bonds in propane show energy equal to 401 kJ/mol)."
[27] "This disparity in energy bonds may be responsible for the absence of oxygenates among the ethane oxidation products."
[28] "The interaction of reagents (ethane and N2O) with active centres in the range of temperature from RT to 400 8C was performed in a vacuum cell and recorded by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 11)."

</ChineseVersionAnswer>

Answer: The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as nitrous oxide (N2O), have been highlighted in the provided literature. Iron-modified zeolites, particularly those with a MFI structure like ZSM-5, demonstrate significant activity in the ODH process, converting propane to propene with selectivity. This highlights the potential of N2O as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly oxidant for hydrocarbon conversion, especially in light of the increasing interest in utilizing waste N2O.

Challenges in this field, including corrosiveness and intrinsic reaction properties, are acknowledged. For instance, the high stability of the CH bond in propane leads to the formation of oxygenates during the ODH process, which contrasts with the ethane oxidation where only ethene is produced efficiently. This disparity in energy bonds explains why oxygenates are not formed from ethane under the applied conditions.

The persistent challenges involve improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies for addressing these issues include:

1. **Improving C-H Bond Activation**: Developing catalysts that can effectively activate C-H bonds without causing unwanted side reactions, thereby enhancing selectivity and conversion rates.

2. **Enhancing Catalyst Regenerability**: Designing catalyst systems that maintain high activity and selectivity over multiple cycles, reducing operational costs and environmental impacts.

3. **Optimizing Reaction Systems**: Tailoring reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and oxidant concentration, to maximize efficiency and minimize side products.

Future research should focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O decomposition and its impact on the formation of active species for propane oxidation. Additionally, exploring alternative soft oxidants with improved reactivity and stability could broaden the scope of available catalysts for hydrocarbon functionalization. Lastly, developing methods to recycle and regenerate catalysts could significantly reduce the environmental footprint of these processes.

Chinese Version Answer:
近期，利用软氧化剂（如N2O）进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展已在提供的文献中进行了强调。铁改性沸石，尤其是具有MFI结构的沸石如ZSM-5，显示出了显著的活性，在氧化脱氢过程中将丙烷转化为丙烯，显示出选择性。这突显了N2O作为经济且环保的碳氢化合物转换氧化剂的潜力，特别是考虑到越来越多地关注利用废弃N2O。

该领域存在的挑战包括腐蚀性和固有的反应特性。例如，丙烷中CH键的高稳定性导致在氧化脱氢过程中形成氧化合物，这与仅从乙烷产生高效乙烯形成鲜明对比。这种能量键差异解释了为什么在应用条件下不会从乙烷形成氧化合物的原因。

持续的挑战包括改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。实现这些目标的策略包括：

1. **改善C-H键活化**：开发能够有效激活C-H键而不引发不希望的副反应的催化剂，从而提高选择性和转化率。

2. **增强催化剂再生能力**：设计保持高活动性和选择性多年循环的催化剂系统，减少运营成本和环境影响。

3. **优化反应系统**：调整反应条件，如温度、压力和氧化剂浓度，以最大化效率并减少副产品。

未来研究应集中在理解N2O分解的详细机制及其对形成活性物种的影响。此外，探索具有更好反应性和稳定性的替代软氧化剂可以扩大可用催化剂的范围，用于碳氢化合物功能化。最后，开发回收和再生催化剂的方法可以大大减少这些过程的环境足迹。

Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes.

Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

Performing the reaction at 450 °C resulted in a high ethene yield and complete N2O removal.

The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a portion of active oxygen species is enable to react with ethane according to Eq. (4).

The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1).

Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity.

The net charge of zeolite structure, and, the consequent appearance of cationic centres in the zeolites matrix results from the presence of aluminium atoms in silicaalumina crystal structure. The Si/Al ratio influences both the number of iron ions introduced by the exchange procedure into the cationic position as well as the environment of iron species and the samples acidity [13].

Only iron species accommodated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. The oxidative activity of iron complexes accommodated in the zeolite matrix of various structures differed noticeably and it increased in the following sequence Fe-Y < Fe-Mor < Fe-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3).

Despite the significantly various iron capacity in ZSM-5 zeolites of an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (1.4 and 0.4 wt.% of iron,respectively) the ethane conversion over the samples was very similar.

The environment of iron species generated in zeolite matrix may be, to some extent, characterised by UVvis reflectance spectra.

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

4. Conclusions

1. Iron modified zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) show activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, while iron compounds impregnated on amorphous silicaalumina or silica did not show any activity for ODH reaction.

2. Iron complexes accommodated in channels of ZSM-5 zeolite show the highest activity for ODH reaction.

3. Iron complexes generated in silicalite of MFI structure and activated under the same conditions as Fe-ZSM-5 did not show any activity for ODH reaction. This indicates that not only crystalline structure but also the net charge of the zeolite matrix play significant role in the formation of active iron complexes.

1. The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants include the commercialization of direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant, which is considered one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production. N2O was found to be an excellent oxidant for difficult oxidation processes. At 450 °C, it produced a high ethene yield and completely removed N2O.

2. The decomposition of N2O resulted in the formation of different oxygen species. Some of these species recombined or reacted with subsequent N2O molecules, forming O2 molecules that were nearly inactive for the oxygenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a fraction of active oxygen species could react with ethane.

3. The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix varied based on the Si/Al ratio, ranging from 1.4%, 0.4%, and 0.09% for ratios of 25, 50, and 100, respectively. The structure and number of iron species influenced the catalyst activity.

4. Zeolites with channels or cages (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) showed activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, whereas iron compounds on amorphous silicaalumina or silica did not exhibit any activity for the reaction. Iron complexes within the ZSM-5 matrix had the highest activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. Silicalite of MFI structure, despite being modified similarly to Fe-ZSM-5, did not show any activity for ODH reaction, indicating the importance of both the zeolite structure and the net charge in the formation of active iron complexes.

5. The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation led to the simultaneous effective utilization of N2O. Despite varying iron capacities in ZSM-5 zeolites of different Si/Al ratios, the ethane conversion rates were remarkably similar. The UVvis reflectance spectra of the iron species in the zeolite matrix provided insights into their environment.

6. The process of ethane oxydehydrogenation with N2O as an oxidant in the presence of iron modified zeolites can be considered an effective method for light paraffins functionalization and N2O utilization.

Conclusions:
1. Iron-modified zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) display activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation when N2O is used as an oxidant, whereas iron compounds on amorphous silicaalumina or silica do not show any activity for the ODH reaction.
2. Iron complexes located in the channels of ZSM-5 zeolite demonstrate the highest activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane.
3. Iron complexes formed in silicalite of MFI structure, even when activated under conditions similar to Fe-ZSM-5, fail to show any activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. This highlights the critical roles of both the zeolite structure and the net charge in the formation of active iron complexes.
4. The utilization of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, efficient N2O utilization.

Challenges:
Persistent challenges in the field include corrosion resistance and the inherent properties of the reactions, which necessitate further research and development.

Areas for future research and development:
Key areas for future research include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. The focus should be on developing more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and efficiently activate C-H bonds, as well as on refining the regeneration protocols to extend catalyst lifetimes.

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature demonstrates that iron-modified zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, exhibit high activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant. This finding suggests that N2O can effectively utilize light paraffins to produce olefins, providing a new approach to light paraffin utilization. The study also indicates that the structure of the zeolite matrix plays a crucial role in the formation of active iron complexes, affecting both the N2O decomposition and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent properties of the reaction, which can limit catalyst performance. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency. Strategies might involve developing more robust catalyst materials, refining the reaction conditions, and exploring alternative oxidants to overcome these challenges.

In the context of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP), the use of N2O as an oxidant leads to simultaneous and effective N2O utilization, showcasing the potential of this approach in both functionalizing light paraffins and efficiently utilizing waste N2O.
