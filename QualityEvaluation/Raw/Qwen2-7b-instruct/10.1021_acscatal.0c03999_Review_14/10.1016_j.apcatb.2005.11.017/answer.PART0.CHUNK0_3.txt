Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes.

Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

Performing the reaction at 450 °C resulted in a high ethene yield and complete N2O removal.

The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a portion of active oxygen species is enable to react with ethane according to Eq. (4).

The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1).

Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity.

The net charge of zeolite structure, and, the consequent appearance of cationic centres in the zeolites matrix results from the presence of aluminium atoms in silicaalumina crystal structure. The Si/Al ratio influences both the number of iron ions introduced by the exchange procedure into the cationic position as well as the environment of iron species and the samples acidity [13].

Only iron species accommodated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. The oxidative activity of iron complexes accommodated in the zeolite matrix of various structures differed noticeably and it increased in the following sequence Fe-Y < Fe-Mor < Fe-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3).

Despite the significantly various iron capacity in ZSM-5 zeolites of an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (1.4 and 0.4 wt.% of iron,respectively) the ethane conversion over the samples was very similar.

The environment of iron species generated in zeolite matrix may be, to some extent, characterised by UVvis reflectance spectra.

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

4. Conclusions

1. Iron modified zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) show activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, while iron compounds impregnated on amorphous silicaalumina or silica did not show any activity for ODH reaction.

2. Iron complexes accommodated in channels of ZSM-5 zeolite show the highest activity for ODH reaction.

3. Iron complexes generated in silicalite of MFI structure and activated under the same conditions as Fe-ZSM-5 did not show any activity for ODH reaction. This indicates that not only crystalline structure but also the net charge of the zeolite matrix play significant role in the formation of active iron complexes.

4. The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

1. The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants include the commercialization of direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant, which is considered one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production. N2O was found to be an excellent oxidant for difficult oxidation processes. At 450 °C, it produced a high ethene yield and completely removed N2O.

2. The decomposition of N2O resulted in the formation of different oxygen species. Some of these species recombined or reacted with subsequent N2O molecules, forming O2 molecules that were nearly inactive for the oxygenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a fraction of active oxygen species could react with ethane.

3. The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix varied based on the Si/Al ratio, ranging from 1.4%, 0.4%, and 0.09% for ratios of 25, 50, and 100, respectively. The structure and number of iron species influenced the catalyst activity.

4. Zeolites with channels or cages (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) showed activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, whereas iron compounds on amorphous silicaalumina or silica did not exhibit any activity for the reaction. Iron complexes within the ZSM-5 matrix had the highest activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. Silicalite of MFI structure, despite being modified similarly to Fe-ZSM-5, did not show any activity for ODH reaction, indicating the importance of both the zeolite structure and the net charge in the formation of active iron complexes.

5. The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation led to the simultaneous effective utilization of N2O. Despite varying iron capacities in ZSM-5 zeolites of different Si/Al ratios, the ethane conversion rates were remarkably similar. The UVvis reflectance spectra of the iron species in the zeolite matrix provided insights into their environment.

6. The process of ethane oxydehydrogenation with N2O as an oxidant in the presence of iron modified zeolites can be considered an effective method for light paraffins functionalization and N2O utilization.

Conclusions:
1. Iron-modified zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) display activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation when N2O is used as an oxidant, whereas iron compounds on amorphous silicaalumina or silica do not show any activity for the ODH reaction.
2. Iron complexes located in the channels of ZSM-5 zeolite demonstrate the highest activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane.
3. Iron complexes formed in silicalite of MFI structure, even when activated under conditions similar to Fe-ZSM-5, fail to show any activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. This highlights the critical roles of both the zeolite structure and the net charge in the formation of active iron complexes.
4. The utilization of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, efficient N2O utilization.

Challenges:
Persistent challenges in the field include corrosion resistance and the inherent properties of the reactions, which necessitate further research and development.

Areas for future research and development:
Key areas for future research include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. The focus should be on developing more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and efficiently activate C-H bonds, as well as on refining the regeneration protocols to extend catalyst lifetimes.
