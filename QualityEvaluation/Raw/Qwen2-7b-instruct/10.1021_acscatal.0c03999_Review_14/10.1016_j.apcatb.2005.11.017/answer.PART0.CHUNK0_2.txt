[1] "In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites."
[2] "The best catalytic performance was found on iron modified zeolites of MFI structure."
[3] "Considering that the O species,which was found to be involved in the oxydehydrogenation reaction [5,6] could be formed as a result of N2O decomposition on different transition oxide species, the iron oxides supported on different zeolite structures and on non-zeolite supports were also applied as catalysts for the reaction under study."
[4] "The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1)."
[5] "The important role of cationic centres in the mechanism of the formation of a-iron complexes active for the BTOP process has been stressed by Panov et al. [14] and by other authors [15]."
[6] "Taking into consideration that the first reaction step both for N2O decomposition and for hydrocarbon ODH requires N2O activation with the subsequent formation of active oxygen species O* one could expect that iron complexes of similar structure should be responsible both for N2O decomposition and ODH reaction, as consistent with the suggestion of Kondratenko and Pe rez-Ramirez [3]."
[7] "Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity."
[8] "The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization."
[9] "Simultaneously, with the growth of reaction temperature from 350 to 450 8C, N2O decomposition increased considerably and at 450 8C no N2O remainder was recorded (Fig. 13)."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the study focused on the performance of iron modified zeolites, specifically ZSM-5, mordenite, and faujasite, in the presence of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant. These catalysts demonstrated high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane, indicating their potential for ODHP processes. Iron complexes within the zeolite channels showed the highest activity, suggesting their importance in the reaction mechanism.

The study also highlighted the role of zeolite structure and the presence of cationic centers in influencing catalyst activity. Zeolites with a crystalline MFI structure were found to be particularly effective, showcasing the critical impact of zeolite structure on the formation of active iron complexes. Moreover, the net charge of the zeolite matrix was identified as another crucial factor affecting catalytic performance.

Challenges in the field, such as the corrosiveness of certain catalysts and the inherent reaction properties, were acknowledged. These factors limit the efficiency and longevity of ODHP processes. Future research directions were outlined, focusing on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation proved effective, facilitating the simultaneous utilization of N2O. As the reaction temperature increased from 350 to 450°C, N2O decomposition significantly increased, culminating in complete removal at 450°C. This finding underscores the potential of utilizing N2O as an environmentally friendly oxidant in ODHP processes.

In summary, the study presents recent progress in ODHP using soft oxidants, emphasizing the importance of zeolite structure, catalyst regeneration, and the efficient utilization of N2O. Future research aims to address existing challenges and optimize ODHP processes for broader applications.
