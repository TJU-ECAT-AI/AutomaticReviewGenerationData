This study investigates the effect of pre-reduction on the performance of Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It highlights the importance of pre-reduction in altering the catalyst's active sites, leading to improved performance. The optimal conditions for achieving a 20% propylene yield at a 24% overall propane conversion involve a hydrogen pre-reduction process at 600°C for 10 hours at 560°C. The study suggests that the active sites responsible for the formation of abundant methane over the untreated catalyst are the carbon and FexC species generated through the activation of surface adsorbed oxygen species during propane cracking. Pre-reduction treatments consume surface adsorbed oxygen species and generate Fe and Fe2+ species, which are active for propane dehydrogenation. However, the study also notes that the large size of Fe grains inhibits propane hydrogenolysis, while the absence of surface electronegative oxygen species suppresses propylene cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation performance.

本研究探讨了预还原对Fe2O3/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能影响。强调了预还原过程对于改变催化剂活性位点的重要性，从而提高其性能。通过氢气预还原处理10小时，在600°C和560°C条件下，达到20%丙烯产率和24%总体丙烷转化的最佳条件。研究指出，未处理催化剂上形成丰富甲烷的活性位点是通过表面吸附氧物种激活后由丙烷裂解产生的碳和FexC物种。预还原处理消耗表面吸附氧物种并生成Fe和Fe2+物种，这些物种对于丙烷脱氢反应是活跃的。然而，研究也指出，Fe颗粒的大尺寸抑制了丙烷氢解反应，而在缺乏表面电负性氧物种的情况下，丙烯裂解和氢解反应被抑制，导致脱氢性能显著改善。
