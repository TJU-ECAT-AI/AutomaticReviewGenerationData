[1] "Catalytic systems based on supported or unsupported iron are a kind of active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "Among the studied catalysts,iron-containing zeolites with low iron loadings have been extensively reported."
[3] "Due to the stronger acidity of zeolites which favored cok- ing and cracking reactions, the selectivity was rather low."
[4] "In order to further optimize the reaction results, many researchers have paid their attention to the use of supports with weak acidity, e.g.: Al2O3 or zeolites with high Si/Al."
[5] "Nevertheless, the selectivity was always improved at the expense of activity."
[6] "In comparison, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provides an efficient way to convert propane to propylene with high selectivity."
[7] "Most studies were focused on commercial Cr-based [911] and Pt-based [1214] catalysts."
[8] "Far few researchers are concerned with the performance of iron-based catalysts in this reaction, let alone the nature of active sites for propane dehydrogenation."
[9] "In one paper [15], we reported that the introduction of sulfate species significantly improved propylene yield and selectivity over Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst via the strong interaction with Fe atoms in the form of FeO S, which led to the formation of Fe sites at electron-deficient state and thus higher adsorption capacity of propane."
[10] "However, no detailed experiment on the role of Fe species at different valence was conducted."
[11] "Typically, oxidized Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst mainly contains Fe in the form of well-dispersed Fe3+ or -Fe2O3 (at high loadings)."
[12] "Under appropriate reducing atmosphere, Fe2O3 can be reduced in the following steps: Fe2O3 Fe3O4 FeO Fe."
[13] "Depending on the reducing conditions, different intermediate iron species are formed, which provides a theoretical basis for the identification of the role of Fe species at different valence in propane dehydrogenation."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this study highlights the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts show significant improvements in selectivity and conversion rates compared to earlier studies. However, challenges remain, such as the corrosiveness of the process and its inherent reaction properties. The key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

One of the persistent challenges in this field is the optimization of catalyst performance. Despite advancements, the selectivity and activity often come at the expense of each other. This highlights the need for developing catalysts that can balance both selectivity and activity effectively. Another area of focus is the development of more environmentally friendly catalysts that reduce corrosion and improve reaction efficiency.

Key strategies for future research might include the design of novel catalyst supports with tailored acidity levels to enhance selectivity while maintaining high activity. Additionally, exploring the role of Fe species at different valence states could lead to the discovery of more active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Understanding the dynamics of Fe reduction under various reducing atmospheres provides insights into the formation of different intermediate iron species, which could be crucial for identifying the most effective catalysts.

In summary, while there has been progress in optimizing catalyst systems for ODHP, the field still faces significant challenges. Future work should concentrate on developing more selective, active, and environmentally friendly catalysts, as well as refining reaction systems to achieve optimal performance.
