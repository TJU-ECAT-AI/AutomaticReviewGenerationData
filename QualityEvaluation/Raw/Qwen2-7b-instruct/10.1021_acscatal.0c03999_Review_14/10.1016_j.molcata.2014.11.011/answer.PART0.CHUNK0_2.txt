[1] "Catalytic systems based on supported or unsupported iron are a kind of active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "Among the studied catalysts,iron-containing zeolites with low iron loadings have been extensively reported."
[3] "Due to the stronger acidity of zeolites which favored cok- ing and cracking reactions,the selectivity was rather low."
[4] "In order to further optimize the reaction results,many researchers have paid their attention to the use of supports with weak acidity,e.g.: Al2O3 or zeolites with high Si/Al."
[5] "Nevertheless,the selectivity was always improved at the expense of activity."
[6] "In comparison,catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provides an efficient way to convert propane to propylene with high selectivity."
[7] "To date,most studies were focused on commercial Cr-based [911] and Pt-based [1214] catalysts."
[8] "Far few researchers are concerned with the performance of iron-based catalysts in this reaction,let alone the nature of active sites for propane dehydrogenation."
[9] "In one paper [15],we reported that the introduction of sulfate species significantly improved propylene yield and selectiv- ity over Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst via the strong interaction with Fe atoms in the form of FeOS,which led to the formation of Fe sites at electron-deficient state and thus higher adsorption capacity of propane."
[10] "However,no detailed experiment on the role of Fe species at different valence was conducted."
[11] "Typically,oxidized Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst mainly contains Fe in the form of well-dispersed Fe3+ or -Fe2O3 (at high loadings)."
[12] "Under appropriate reducing atmosphere, Fe2O3 can be reduced in the following steps: Fe2O3 Fe3O4 FeO Fe."
[13] "In this paper,the performance of Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalysts reduced under different reducing agent,temperature and time in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was studied first."
[14] "Subsequently,the effects of reduction on the existing state of iron were discussed."
[15] "Based on these results,the nature of active iron species in propane conversion was revealed."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, the literature highlights the comparative performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These systems are evaluated in terms of selectivity and conversion efficiency. However, challenges persist in this field, notably corrosion resistance and the intrinsic properties of the reactions. Future research directions are emphasized, focusing on strategies to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regeneration capabilities, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

The persistent challenges in ODHP include corrosion issues associated with the catalyst materials and the inherent reactivity of propane, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. Efforts are directed towards developing more stable catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions and maintaining high conversion rates while preserving product selectivity. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation aim to facilitate more efficient conversion of propane to propylene, potentially through the design of novel catalyst structures or the incorporation of specific metal sites that enhance adsorption and activation of propane molecules.

Enhancing catalyst regenerability is crucial for the practical implementation of ODHP processes, as it allows for the recovery and reuse of catalysts, thereby reducing operational costs and environmental impacts. Researchers are exploring methods to regenerate catalysts without significant loss of activity, including the use of mild regeneration conditions, the development of in-situ regeneration techniques, and the design of catalyst supports that can mitigate deactivation pathways.

Revamping reaction systems involves optimizing the operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the use of promoters, to achieve better control over the reaction kinetics and product distribution. This includes the selection of appropriate reaction media, such as solvents that can modulate the reactivity and selectivity of the ODHP process. Additionally, the integration of advanced analytical techniques for real-time monitoring of reaction progress and product composition enables more precise control over the reaction parameters, contributing to improved overall efficiency and yield.

In conclusion, the key areas for future research in ODHP encompass the development of more selective and stable catalysts, optimization of reaction conditions, and innovative approaches to catalyst regeneration. These efforts aim to overcome the current limitations and unlock the full potential of ODHP as a viable alternative to traditional hydrodealkylation processes for propylene production.
