The  optimal  results,20  wt%  propylene yield  at an  overall propane conversion of 24 wt% was  obtained over  the  sample  pre-reduced by  hydrogen at  600 C  for  10  h  at  560 C.
Based on  XRD, XPS  and  IR  results,  it  is  proposed that  the  carbon  and  FexC  species formed from  propylene cracking under  the  activation of surface  adsorbed oxygen species are  the  active  sites  for  the  formation of abundant methane over  untreated  10FeAl  catalyst.
Pre-reduction treatment leads to  the  consumption of surface adsorbed oxygen species and the  formation of  Fe  and  Fe2+ species,which are  active for propane dehydrogenation.
For  one  thing,propane hydrogenolysis is strongly inhibited due to the  large  size  (around 30 nm)  of Fe  grains.  For  another,propylene cracking and  the  generation of  carbon and  FexC  species  are largely suppressed in the  absence of  surface  electronegative oxygen species,hence  inhibiting propane cracking and  hydrogenolysis reactions,resulting in  greatly improved dehydrogenation performance.

Introduction Catalytic systems based on supported or unsupported iron are a kind of active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [17].
Among the studied catalysts,iron-containing zeolites with low iron loadings have been extensively reported [2,3,6,7].
Due to the stronger acidity of zeolites which favored cok- ing and cracking reactions,the selectivity was rather low.
In order to further optimize the reaction results,many researchers have paid their attention to the use of supports with weak acidity,e.g.: Al2O3 or zeolites with high Si/Al [8].
Nevertheless,the selectivity was always improved at the expense of activity.
In comparison,catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provides an efficient way to convert propane to propylene with high selec- tivity.
To date,most studies were focused on commercial Cr-based [911] and Pt-based [1214] catalysts.
Far few researchers are concerned with the performance of iron-based catalysts in this reaction,let alone the nature of active sites for propane dehydro- genation.
In one paper [15],we reported that the introduction of sulfate species significantly improved propylene yield and selectiv- ity over Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst via the strong interaction with Fe atoms in the form of Fe

(C.

However,no detailed experiment on the role of Fe species at different valence was conducted.
Typically,oxidized Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst mainly contains Fe in the form of well-dispersed Fe3+ or -Fe2O3 (at high loadings).
Under appropriate reducing atmosphere, Fe2O3 can be reduced in the following steps [16]: Fe2O3 Fe3O4 FeO
Fe Depending on the reducing conditions,different intermediate iron species are formed,which provides a theoretical basis for the identification of the role of Fe species at different valence in propane dehydrogenation.
In this paper,the performance of Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalysts reduced under different reducing agent,temperature and time in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was studied first.
Subse- quently,the effects of reduction on the existing state of iron were discussed.
Based on these results,the nature of active iron species in propane conversion was revealed.

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
