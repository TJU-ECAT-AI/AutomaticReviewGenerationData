<p>The introduction of sulfate species significantly improved propylene yield and selectivity over Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst via the strong interaction with Fe atoms in the form of FeOS, which led to the formation of Fe sites at electron-deficient state and thus higher adsorption capacity of propane.</p>
<p>Typically, oxidized Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst mainly contains Fe in the form of well-dispersed Fe3+ or -Fe2O3 (at high loadings).</p>
<p>Under appropriate reducing atmosphere, Fe2O3 can be reduced in the following steps: Fe2O3 Fe3O4 FeO Fe</p>
<p>In this paper, the performance of Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalysts reduced under different reducing agent, temperature and time in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was studied first.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the effects of reduction on the existing state of iron were discussed.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the nature of active iron species in propane conversion was revealed.</p>

This study investigated the impact of pre-reduction on the performance of Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It found that pre-reduction with hydrogen at 600°C for 10 hours resulted in the optimal yield of 20 wt% propylene at a 24 wt% overall propane conversion. The active sites for the formation of abundant methane were attributed to the carbon and FexC species generated through the cracking of propylene under the activation of surface adsorbed oxygen species. Pre-reduction treatments led to the consumption of surface adsorbed oxygen species and the formation of Fe and Fe2+ species, which were active for propane dehydrogenation. This process inhibited propane hydrogenolysis due to the large size of Fe grains and suppressed propylene cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions in the absence of surface electronegative oxygen species, resulting in improved dehydrogenation performance.

本文研究了预还原对Fe2O3/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能影响。研究发现，氢气在600°C下预还原10小时的效果最佳，使丙烯产量达到20%，总丙烷转化率为24%。活性位点通过表面吸附氧物种激活，促进了大量甲烷的生成，这是由丙烷裂解产生的碳和FexC物种导致的。预还原处理导致表面吸附氧物种消耗，并形成了Fe和Fe2+物种，这些物种对丙烷脱氢有活性。由于Fe颗粒的尺寸较大，该过程抑制了丙烷氢化，并且在缺乏表面电负性氧物种的情况下，减少了丙烯裂解和氢化反应，从而提高了脱氢性能。
