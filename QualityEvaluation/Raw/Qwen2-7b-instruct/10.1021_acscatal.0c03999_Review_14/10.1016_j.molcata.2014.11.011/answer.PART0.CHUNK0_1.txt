<p>The effect of carbon monoxide and hydrogen pre-reduction on the performance of 10FeAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation was studied.</p>
<p>The optimal results, 20 wt% propylene yield at an overall propane conversion of 24 wt%, was obtained over the sample pre-reduced by hydrogen at 600°C for 10 h at 560°C.</p>
<p>Based on XRD, XPS, and IR results, it is proposed that the carbon and FexC species formed from propylene cracking under the activation of surface adsorbed oxygen species are the active sites for the formation of abundant methane over untreated 10FeAl catalyst.</p>
<p>Pre-reduction treatment leads to the consumption of surface adsorbed oxygen species and the formation of Fe and Fe2+ species, which are active for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

The study focuses on the impact of pre-reduction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen on the performance of a 10FeAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. The best results were achieved when the catalyst was pre-reduced with hydrogen at 600°C for 10 hours at 560°C, resulting in a 20 wt% propylene yield at a 24 wt% overall propane conversion. The researchers propose that the active sites for the formation of methane over the untreated catalyst are the carbon and FexC species produced from propylene cracking under the influence of surface adsorbed oxygen species. Pre-reduction treatments consume surface adsorbed oxygen species, leading to the formation of Fe and Fe2+ species, which are beneficial for propane dehydrogenation. This study highlights the importance of catalyst pre-reduction in improving the efficiency of propane to propylene conversion. No detailed experiments were conducted on the role of Fe species at different valences in this process.

研究关注了在氢气预还原条件下，10FeAl催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能影响。最佳结果出现在以氢气在600°C下预还原10小时，在560°C的条件下，获得了20 wt%的丙烯产率和24 wt%的总体丙烷转化率。研究者提出，未处理催化剂上形成甲烷的活性位点是丙烯裂解产生的碳和FexC物种，在表面吸附氧物种的激活下产生。预还原处理消耗了表面吸附的氧物种，并形成了Fe和Fe2+物种，这些物种对丙烷脱氢具有活性。这项研究强调了预还原在提高丙烷转化为丙烯效率方面的重要性。没有进行关于不同价态Fe物种作用的详细实验。
