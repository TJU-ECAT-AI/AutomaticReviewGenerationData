Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the importance of catalyst systems in determining the selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been explored. The performance of these catalysts in ODHP processes varies significantly based on their ability to efficiently activate C-H bonds and convert propane to higher olefins. Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalyst components and the inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion efficiency. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. The multi-technique approach employed in studying ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate provides insights into how catalyst design can be optimized for better selectivity control and product purity.

In conclusion, the literature demonstrates that by combining kinetic analysis, operando surface-coverage quantification, and advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical modeling, researchers can unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the distinct selectivity patterns observed in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly in ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. This multi-faceted approach not only enhances our understanding of the underlying chemistry but also offers practical strategies for catalyst design aimed at achieving high selectivity and improved efficiency in alkane functionalization reactions.

The mechanistic origin of the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts has been successfully elucidated through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The study employs a multi-technique approach, integrating steady-state kinetics, operando surface-coverage quantification, and advanced spectroscopic techniques like photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO) and prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) to correlate the catalytic performance with detailed mechanistic insights. Ultimately, this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the surface-confined and gas-phase radical-chain pathways involved in alkane activation, leading to the selective generation of olefins from ethane. The integration of these methodologies enables the rationalization of the observed selectivity differences at the molecular level, offering valuable insights for the design of more efficient catalysts and the optimization of alkane functionalization processes.

This research underscores the potential of chlorine-based processes in facilitating one-step olefin production at a technical scale and outlines the guidelines for catalyst design aimed at achieving direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation. Moreover, it presents a strategic framework for unraveling the mechanistic picture in complex reaction networks, which is crucial for advancing the field of hydrocarbon functionalization. The findings contribute to overcoming persistent challenges in the field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, by providing insights into the critical roles played by halogens in alkane activation and olefin formation, thus paving the way for future improvements in catalyst regenerability and reaction system optimization to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of ODHP processes.
