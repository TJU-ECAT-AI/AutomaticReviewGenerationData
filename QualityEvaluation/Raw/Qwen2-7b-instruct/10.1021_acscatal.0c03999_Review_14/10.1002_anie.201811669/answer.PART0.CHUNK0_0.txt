[1] "These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation."
[2] "However, to unravel reaction pathways, as well as reactive intermediates in gaseous and solid phases, and to model complex and dynamic surfaces at the atomic level, the combined use of strong experimental evidence with advanced theoretical approaches is required."
[3] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center. In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."

The literature discusses the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants. It compares the performance of various catalyst systems, such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of their selectivity and conversion rates. The document highlights the persistent challenges faced in this field, including corrosion issues and the inherent properties of the reactions. It also outlines several key areas for future research and development, focusing on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize the ODHP processes.

Chlorine-based processes are noted for their potential in one-step olefin production on a technical scale. Guidelines for designing catalysts for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation are provided. The literature emphasizes the importance of combining strong experimental evidence with advanced theoretical approaches to understand reaction pathways, reactive intermediates, and to model complex and dynamic surfaces at the atomic level.

The literature explains that in oxychlorination, the selectivity control is achieved through a surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is subsequently dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center. Conversely, in oxybromination, alkane activation occurs in the gas phase, driven by evolved bromine and bromine radical species, leaving a halogen-free surface prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways.

文献讨论了使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展。它比较了各种催化剂系统，如过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，在选择性和转化率方面的性能。文献强调了这一领域面临的持续挑战，包括腐蚀问题和反应固有的性质。它还概述了未来研究和开发的关键领域，重点关注提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程的战略。

氯基过程被认为在技术规模上单步生产烯烃具有巨大潜力，并提供了直接烷烃到烯烃转换通过氧卤化设计催化剂的指导原则。文献强调了结合强大实验证据与高级理论方法理解反应途径、活性中间体以及建模复杂且动态表面的原子级水平的重要性。

文献解释说，在氧氯化中，通过表面驱动的乙烷功能化为乙基氯，随后在ClFe中心脱氯化为乙烯，实现了选择性控制。相反，在氧溴化中，烷烃激活在气体相中发生，由释放的溴和溴自由基物种驱动，留下一个无卤素表面易受到进一步裂解和燃烧路径的影响。
