<p>These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we unraveled the mechanistic origin of the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate by a multi-technique approach, which combined evidence from steady-state kinetics and operando PGAA and PEPICO spectroscopies, and was ultimately rationalized with theoretical calculations.</p>
<p>The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center. In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways.</p>

This study provides insights into the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. It demonstrates that chlorine-based processes offer potential for one-step olefin production and outlines guidelines for designing catalysts for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation through oxyhalogenation. The selectivity control in oxychlorination is attributed to a surface-driven reaction that produces ethyl chloride, which is subsequently dehydrochlorinated to ethylene. In contrast, alkane activation in oxybromination occurs in the gas phase, involving evolved bromine and bromine radicals, leaving a halogen-free surface susceptible to additional pathways like cracking and combustion.

本研究揭示了铁磷酸盐催化剂上乙烷氧氯化和氧溴化之间选择性差异的机制。它表明，基于氯的工艺有可能实现一步烯烃生产，并指出了设计用于通过氧卤化直接烷烃转化为烯烃的催化剂的指导原则。在氧氯化中，选择性的控制归因于表面驱动反应，产生乙基氯，随后脱氯化生成乙烯。相反，在氧溴化中，烷烃激活发生在气相中，涉及释放的溴和溴自由基，留下一个无卤素表面易受裂解、燃烧等额外途径的影响。
