[1] "These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation."
[2] "However, to unravel reaction pathways, as well as reactive intermediates in gaseous and solid phases, and to model complex and dynamic surfaces at the atomic level, the combined use of strong experimental evidence with advanced theoretical approaches is required."
[3] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center. In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."

The document discusses the recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) using iron phosphate catalysts, specifically focusing on the differences in selectivity between oxychlorination and oxybromination. The superior selectivity of oxychlorination to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst is attributed to a surface-confined reaction. Advanced techniques like prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO) have been employed to correlate surface coverage and gas-phase radicals to catalytic performance. The detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks have been unraveled, revealing that the sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved through a surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, followed by dehydrochlorination to ethylene. Conversely, in oxybromination, alkane activation occurs in the gas phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, leaving a halogen-free surface more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways.

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the importance of catalyst systems in determining the selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalysts, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been explored. The performance of these catalysts in ODHP processes varies significantly based on their ability to efficiently activate C-H bonds and convert propane to higher olefins. Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalyst components and the inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion efficiency. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. The multi-technique approach employed in studying ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate provides insights into how catalyst design can be optimized for better selectivity control and product purity.

In conclusion, the literature demonstrates that by combining kinetic analysis, operando surface-coverage quantification, and advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical modeling, researchers can unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the distinct selectivity patterns observed in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly in ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. This multi-faceted approach not only enhances our understanding of the underlying chemistry but also offers practical strategies for catalyst design aimed at achieving high selectivity and improved efficiency in alkane functionalization reactions.

The mechanistic origin of the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts has been successfully elucidated through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods.
