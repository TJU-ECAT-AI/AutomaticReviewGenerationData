[1] "We demonstrate that the superior selectivity to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst in oxychlorination is the consequence of a surface-confined reaction."
[2] "Surface-coverage analysis of the catalyst and identification of gas-phase radicals in operando mode are correlated to the catalytic performance by a multi-technique approach, which combines kinetic studies with advanced characterization techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy."
[3] "These results provide strategies for unraveling detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks."
[4] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center."
[5] "In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."

The document discusses the recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) using iron phosphate catalysts, specifically focusing on the differences in selectivity between oxychlorination and oxybromination. The superior selectivity of oxychlorination to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst is attributed to a surface-confined reaction. Advanced techniques like prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO) have been employed to correlate surface coverage and gas-phase radicals to catalytic performance. The detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks have been unraveled, revealing that the sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved through a surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, followed by dehydrochlorination to ethylene. Conversely, in oxybromination, alkane activation occurs in the gas phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, leaving a halogen-free surface more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways.

文档讨论了在铁磷酸盐催化剂上使用氧化氯化进行轻烷烃功能化的最新进展，特别是对氧氯化和氧溴化选择性的差异。氧氯化选择性高的原因被归因于表面限定反应。先进的技术如脉冲伽马激活分析（PGAA）和光电子光离子偶合谱学（PEPICO）被用来将催化剂的表面覆盖度与气相自由基与催化性能相关联。复杂反应网络的详细机制已被揭示，表明氧氯化中选择性的锐利控制是通过表面驱动的乙烷功能化实现的，生成乙基氯，随后脱氯化生成乙烯。相反，在氧溴化中，烷烃活化发生在气体相中，伴随着释放出的溴和溴自由基物种，留下一个卤素自由表面，更易发生进一步的裂解和燃烧途径。
