<p>The development of novel technologies for the selective functionalization of light alkanes is a critical step to enable the utilization of natural gas as an energy vector in the transition between the oil and the renewables era.</p>
<p>This pivotal advancement is limited by our understanding of the mechanisms governing the heterogeneously catalzed reactions for direct hydrocarbon upgrading, which can provide design criteria for active, selective, and stable catalysts.</p>
<p>In the case of light-alkane functionalization generally requiring high temperatures and/or aggressive reactants, the level of complexity is further amplified by the possibility of gas-phase reaction pathways, in which highly reactive radical species and/or radical initiators are liberated from the surface to generate desired and undesired products.</p>
<p>To understand the mechanistic origin of such selectivity control, we combined kinetic studies with operando surface-coverage quantification by prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and monitoring of gas-phase radicals by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), ultimately rationalized at the molecular level by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</p>
<p>The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center.</p>
<p>In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation.</p>

Recent research has elucidated the mechanism behind the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. This selectivity is attributed to a surface-confined reaction in oxychlorination, which efficiently converts ethane into ethyl chloride, followed by dehydrochlorination to ethylene. In contrast, oxybromination involves gas-phase radical chain reactions leading to a mixture of alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion products. This work provides insights into catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefin transformations via oxyhalogenation, emphasizing the potential of chlorine-based processes for technical-scale olefin production. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the complex reaction networks in hydrocarbon functionalization processes to optimize the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions.

最近的研究已经揭示了乙烷氧氯化和氧溴化在铁磷酸催化剂上表现出不同选择性的机制。这种选择性归因于氧氯化过程中表面控制的反应，有效地将乙烷转化为乙基氯，随后进一步脱氯化生成乙烯。相比之下，氧溴化涉及气相自由基链反应，导致产生乙基溴、裂解和燃烧产物的混合物。这项工作为通过氧卤化直接烷烃转化为烯烃提供了催化剂设计的指导原则，强调了基于氯的工艺在技术规模生产烯烃的巨大潜力。研究结果还突出了理解复杂反应网络在烃类功能化过程中的重要性，以优化反应的选择性和效率。
