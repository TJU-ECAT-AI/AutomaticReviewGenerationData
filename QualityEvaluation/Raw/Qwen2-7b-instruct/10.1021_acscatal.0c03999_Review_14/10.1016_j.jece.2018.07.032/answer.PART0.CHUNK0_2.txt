Recent studies have highlighted the potential of the reverse water gas shift reaction for mitigating CO2 emissions. Nanocrystalline MgO has emerged as a favorable support for nickel-based catalysts in this context. Transition metal/metal oxide systems, along with main group element metal oxides, have proven effective in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showcasing high activity and selectivity. However, challenges such as corrosion resistance and maintaining catalyst stability over multiple cycles persist. Future research efforts aim to address these issues through enhancing C-H bond activation mechanisms, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize both conversion and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
