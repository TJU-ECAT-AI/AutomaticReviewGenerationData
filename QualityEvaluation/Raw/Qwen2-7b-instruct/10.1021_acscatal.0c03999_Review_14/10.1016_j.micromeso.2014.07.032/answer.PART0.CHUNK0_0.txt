Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on developing efficient catalyst systems, particularly transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is evaluated based on their selectivity and conversion efficiency. Challenges persist, such as the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the ODHP process. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP processes. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared using ferrocene as an iron precursor, has demonstrated superior performance in ODHP with nitrous oxide after severe calcination. The active sites identified in this process are FeOAl species.
