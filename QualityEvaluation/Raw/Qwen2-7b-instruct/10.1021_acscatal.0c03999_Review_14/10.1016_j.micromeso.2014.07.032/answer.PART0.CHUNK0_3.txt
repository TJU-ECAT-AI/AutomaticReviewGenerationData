Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve improvements in catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Among these, Fe-ZSM-5 stands out due to its superior performance after severe calcination. However, challenges persist, including corrosion and inherent reaction properties, which affect catalyst deactivation. Future research focuses on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to boost ODHP processes.
