[1] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction."
[2] "First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."
[3] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly nitrous oxide (N2O), have focused on improving catalyst performance. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been utilized, with notable improvements in selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges persist, however, including the corrosiveness of N2O and understanding its intrinsic reaction properties. These factors limit the efficiency and longevity of catalytic systems. Future research directions aim to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
