<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Fe-ZSM-5 was synthesized using ferrocene as the iron precursor. 
2. Nitrous oxide's chemisorption on FeOAl species generates stable mono-oxygen species that efficiently react with propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. 
3. An outstanding stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of around 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 were maintained for more than 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.
4. FeOAl species were confirmed as the active sites in the reaction.
5. The study focuses on the reaction and deactivation mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using Fe-ZSM-5.
6. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface.
