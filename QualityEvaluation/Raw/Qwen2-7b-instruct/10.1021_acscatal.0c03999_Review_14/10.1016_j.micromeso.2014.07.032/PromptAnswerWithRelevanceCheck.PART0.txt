<p>Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction.</p>
<p>In the past decades, activation and conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites have been extensively investigated.</p>

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an alternative oxidant to dioxygen (O2). This approach is particularly advantageous because it can reduce the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which are often produced as byproducts during the reaction with O2. This results in higher olefin selectivity and olefin yield, making N2O a promising oxidant for the production of light olefins.

The literature highlights the use of iron-zeolites, specifically Fe-ZSM-5, as catalysts for ODHP with N2O. After a severe calcination process, the catalyst exhibits superior performance in this reaction. It is found that highly isolated FeOAl species are the active sites responsible for the efficient conversion of propane to propylene. These species are characterized by their simple constitution and the absence of Brnsted acid sites, making Fe-ZSM-5 an ideal model catalyst for studying the ODHP with N2O.

Challenges in this field include the development of catalysts with improved stability and regenerability. The literature discusses the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O, where the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are key issues. Understanding the specific origin and nature of coke deposits is crucial for devising effective methods to prevent their formation and increase the catalyst lifetime.

Key areas for future research and development include strategies to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems. This could involve exploring new catalyst materials, modifying existing ones, or developing innovative reaction conditions to achieve higher conversion rates and selectivities while maintaining or improving catalyst stability.

近年来，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展主要集中在使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为替代氧化剂。与氧气（O2）相比，这种方法的优势在于可以减少二氧化碳（CO和CO2）等副产品的生成，从而提高烯烃的选择性和产率，使N2O成为生产轻烯烃的有前景的氧化剂。

文献强调了铁沸石，尤其是Fe-ZSM-5，作为N2O下丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂的应用。经过剧烈煅烧后，催化剂表现出优异的性能。发现高度孤立的FeOAl物种是负责高效丙烷转化为丙烯的关键活性位点。这些物种以其简单结构和无酸性位点的特点，使得Fe-ZSM-5成为研究N2O下ODHP的理想模型催化剂。

该领域面临的挑战包括催化剂稳定性和再生能力的提升。文献讨论了催化剂在N2O下的失活机制，其中催化剂表面的焦炭沉积是关键问题。了解焦炭沉积的具体来源和性质对于开发有效防止其形成并延长催化剂寿命的方法至关重要。

未来研究和发展的重要领域包括增强C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统。这可能涉及探索新的催化剂材料、修改现有材料或开发创新的反应条件，以实现更高的转化率和选择性，并同时保持或改善催化剂稳定性。
