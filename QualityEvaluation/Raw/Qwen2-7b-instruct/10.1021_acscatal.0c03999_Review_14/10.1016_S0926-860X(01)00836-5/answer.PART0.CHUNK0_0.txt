The document discusses the effects of different oxidants and vanadia loading on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). When oxygen is replaced by nitrous oxide, the initial rates of product formation decrease across all studied temperatures. High selectivity towards propene can be attained by fully covering the support surface with well-dispersed vanadia species. The Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence is proposed to occur during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over certain catalysts. Initial rates of product formation for ODHP are derived from near differential degree of conversion for two oxidants, oxygen and nitrous oxide, over differently-loaded vanadia/alumina materials. The contact potential difference (CPD) measurements show that replacing an oxidizing mixture with nitrogen does not significantly alter CPD over VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials, whereas CPD decreases sharply for VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials when the oxidizing mixture is switched to nitrogen.

文档讨论了不同氧化剂和钒含量对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的影响。当氧气被亚硝酸盐取代时，在所有研究的温度下，产物形成初始速率都会降低。通过在支持物表面全面覆盖均匀分散的钒物种可以实现高丙烯选择性。提出火星-范克里夫伦还原序列在某些催化剂上发生期间发生氧化脱氢反应。从不同氧化剂（氧气和亚硝酸盐）对不同负载的钒/氧化铝材料的近差分转化率推导出ODHP的初始产品形成速率。接触电位差（CPD）测量显示，将氧化混合物替换为氮气不会显著改变VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3材料的CPD，而当氧化混合物被切换为氮气时，VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3材料的CPD会急剧下降。
