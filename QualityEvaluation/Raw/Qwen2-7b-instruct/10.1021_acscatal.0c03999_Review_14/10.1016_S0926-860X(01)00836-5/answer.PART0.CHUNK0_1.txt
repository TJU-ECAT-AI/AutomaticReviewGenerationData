[1] "This study has shown that catalytic performance of various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced active sites."
[2] "The efficiency of isolated VOx species for the selective ODP reaction is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia."
[3] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."
[4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, the literature highlights the critical impact of solid-material properties on catalyst performance. Specifically, the reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and reoxidation ability of catalysts significantly influence selectivity and conversion rates. The efficiency of isolated vanadia species is compromised by non-selective oxidation over the acidic support surface, which is not adequately covered by active vanadia. To optimize ODHP processes, designing surfaces fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species is recommended to minimize propene adsorption on the support. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen to control selective versus combustion reactions is also crucial. This approach leverages the site-isolation theory to enhance propene selectivity when oxygen is replaced with nitrous oxide.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of catalysts and the intrinsic reaction properties of the process. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP are key areas for future research and development.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最近进展中，文献强调了固体材料属性对催化剂性能的影响。具体而言，还原性、钒物种结构、电子属性以及催化剂还原活性位点的再氧化能力显著影响选择性和转化率。孤立的钒物种效率受到酸性支持表面非选择性氧化的干扰，该表面未充分覆盖活性钒。为了在ODHP过程中实现高性能，设计完全由分散良好的钒物种覆盖的催化表面以减少丙烯在支持表面的吸附是推荐的策略。优化参与丙烷和丙烯激活的活性晶格氧的稳态浓度以控制选择性氧化与燃烧反应也是关键。这种方法利用位点隔离理论增强了当氧气被亚硝酸盐替代时的丙烯选择性。

这一领域持续面临的挑战包括催化剂的腐蚀性和过程的固有反应属性。改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP流程是未来研究和发展的关键领域。
