[1] "Replacing oxy- gen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[2] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
[3] "Over these catalysts, ODP was proposed to occur via a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence."
[4] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."
[5] "Replacing an oxidising mixture by nitrogen does not significantly change CPD during 1 h over VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalytic materials, while for VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 CPD decreases sharply."

The document discusses the effects of different oxidants and vanadia loading on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). When oxygen is replaced by nitrous oxide, the initial rates of product formation decrease across all studied temperatures. High selectivity towards propene can be attained by fully covering the support surface with well-dispersed vanadia species. The Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence is proposed to occur during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over certain catalysts. Initial rates of product formation for ODHP are derived from near differential degree of conversion for two oxidants, oxygen and nitrous oxide, over differently-loaded vanadia/alumina materials. The contact potential difference (CPD) measurements show that replacing an oxidizing mixture with nitrogen does not significantly alter CPD over VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials, whereas CPD decreases sharply for VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials when the oxidizing mixture is switched to nitrogen.

文档讨论了不同氧化剂和钒含量对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的影响。当氧气被亚硝酸盐取代时，在所有研究的温度下，产物形成初始速率都会降低。通过在支持物表面全面覆盖均匀分散的钒物种可以实现高丙烯选择性。提出火星-范克里夫伦还原序列在某些催化剂上发生期间发生氧化脱氢反应。从不同氧化剂（氧气和亚硝酸盐）对不同负载的钒/氧化铝材料的近差分转化率推导出ODHP的初始产品形成速率。接触电位差（CPD）测量显示，将氧化混合物替换为氮气不会显著改变VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3材料的CPD，而当氧化混合物被切换为氮气时，VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3材料的CPD会急剧下降。

[1] "This study has shown that catalytic performance of various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced active sites."
[2] "The efficiency of isolated VOx species for the selective ODP reaction is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia."
[3] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."
[4] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, the literature highlights the critical impact of solid-material properties on catalyst performance. Specifically, the reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and reoxidation ability of catalysts significantly influence selectivity and conversion rates. The efficiency of isolated vanadia species is compromised by non-selective oxidation over the acidic support surface, which is not adequately covered by active vanadia. To optimize ODHP processes, designing surfaces fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species is recommended to minimize propene adsorption on the support. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen to control selective versus combustion reactions is also crucial. This approach leverages the site-isolation theory to enhance propene selectivity when oxygen is replaced with nitrous oxide.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of catalysts and the intrinsic reaction properties of the process. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP are key areas for future research and development.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最近进展中，文献强调了固体材料属性对催化剂性能的影响。具体而言，还原性、钒物种结构、电子属性以及催化剂还原活性位点的再氧化能力显著影响选择性和转化率。孤立的钒物种效率受到酸性支持表面非选择性氧化的干扰，该表面未充分覆盖活性钒。为了在ODHP过程中实现高性能，设计完全由分散良好的钒物种覆盖的催化表面以减少丙烯在支持表面的吸附是推荐的策略。优化参与丙烷和丙烯激活的活性晶格氧的稳态浓度以控制选择性氧化与燃烧反应也是关键。这种方法利用位点隔离理论增强了当氧气被亚硝酸盐替代时的丙烯选择性。

这一领域持续面临的挑战包括催化剂的腐蚀性和过程的固有反应属性。改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP流程是未来研究和发展的关键领域。

1. The catalytic performance of vanadia-alumina materials in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is significantly influenced by the reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and the catalyst's ability to reoxidize reduced active sites. 
2. Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures.
3. Low vanadia loading (0.5 and 1 wt.%) results in the primary formation of all major products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) during ODHP.
4. In catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. Conversely, isolated vanadium species primarily form propene and COx directly from propane.
5. Over vanadia-alumina, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds through a redox mechanism, as indicated by conductivity and UVVIS data.
6. The effectiveness of isolated vanadia species in selectively oxidizing propane is overshadowed by non-selective oxidation over the bare surface of the acidic support, which lacks active vanadia coverage.

The study analyzed the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using vanadia-based catalysts with varying vanadium loadings. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant showed decreased overall activity compared to oxygen (O2), yet increased selectivity towards propene formation. The study suggests that the effectiveness of isolated vanadia sites is crucial for propene selectivity, though these sites do not cover the entire support surface. The decreased steady-state concentration of active sites, attributed to N2O's lesser decomposition compared to O2, contributes to higher propene selectivity. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationships between catalytic performance and the properties of vanadia species, such as their electronic properties, reducibility, and structure, as well as the catalyst's ability to activate oxidants. Future research could focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to better control selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

该研究分析了使用不同负载量的范德华基催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，与氧气（O2）相比，总体活性降低，但丙烯选择性增加。研究表明，孤立的范德华位点对于丙烯选择性至关重要，尽管这些位点并未覆盖整个支持表面。N2O较慢的分解速率与O2激活相比，导致活性位点浓度降低和丙烯选择性的提高。研究强调理解催化性能与范德华物种的性质之间的关系的重要性，如它们的电子性质、可还原性和结构，以及催化剂激活氧化剂的能力。未来的研究可以集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以更好地控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应方面。
