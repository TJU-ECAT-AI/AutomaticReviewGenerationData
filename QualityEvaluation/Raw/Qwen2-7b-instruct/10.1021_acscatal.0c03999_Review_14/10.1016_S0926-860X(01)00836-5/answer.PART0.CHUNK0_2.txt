[1] "This study has shown that catalytic performance of various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced active sites."
[2] "Replacing oxy- gen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
[4] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[5] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[6] "The efficiency of isolated VOx species for the selective ODP reaction is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia."

1. The catalytic performance of vanadia-alumina materials in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is significantly influenced by the reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and the catalyst's ability to reoxidize reduced active sites. 
2. Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures.
3. Low vanadia loading (0.5 and 1 wt.%) results in the primary formation of all major products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) during ODHP.
4. In catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. Conversely, isolated vanadium species primarily form propene and COx directly from propane.
5. Over vanadia-alumina, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds through a redox mechanism, as indicated by conductivity and UVVIS data.
6. The effectiveness of isolated vanadia species in selectively oxidizing propane is overshadowed by non-selective oxidation over the bare surface of the acidic support, which lacks active vanadia coverage.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）中，各种VOx/-Al2O3材料的催化性能主要受到固体材料性质的影响，如氧化物的可还原性、钒物种结构、电子性质以及催化剂还原活性位点的能力。
2. 将氧气替换为一氧化二氮导致所有研究温度下产品形成初始速率降低。
3. 低钒含量（0.5和1 wt.%）会导致在ODHP过程中主要产品的原发性形成（CO、CO2和C3H6）。
4. 在具有聚集体钒物种的催化材料中，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯进一步氧化为COx。相反，孤立的钒物种主要直接从丙烷形成丙烯和COx。
5. 在vanadia-alumina上，通过一个氧化还原机制进行丙烷氧化脱氢，这是由电导率和UVVIS数据所表明的。
6. 隔离的vanadia物种在选择性氧化丙烷中的效率被裸露的酸性支持表面的非选择性氧化所覆盖，该表面缺乏活性vanadia覆盖。
