[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."
[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[3] "The fundamental insights into phase composition,reduction, structure and dispersion of vanadium sites as well as electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 were derived from characterisation of the materials by XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (UVVIS-DRS), contact potential difference (CPD) and electrical conductivity measurements."
[4] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."
[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

1. The initial rates of products formation during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over vanadia/-Al2O3 materials were determined using two oxidants, O2 and N2O. 
2. Using N2O as an oxidant led to a decrease in overall activity but an increase in propene selectivity for the same degree of propane conversion.  
3. Insights into the phase composition, reduction, structure, dispersion of vanadium sites, and electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts were obtained through various characterization techniques.
4. Full coverage of the support surface with well-dispersed vanadia species can enhance propene selectivity in ODP.
5. N2O's lesser favorability in activating the catalyst compared to O2 results in a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites, thereby increasing propene selectivity.

1. 对于氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODP），通过不同负载量的VOx/-Al2O3催化剂材料（0.5至9.5 wt.%的钒）在两种不同的氧化剂O2和N2O下，从接近差异程度的转化率中确定了产品的初始生成速率。
2. 使用N2O作为氧化剂导致总体活性降低，但相同丙烷转化度下丙烯选择性增加。
3. 通过XRD、TPR、EPR、UVVIS散射反射光谱（UVVIS-DRS）、接触电位差（CPD）和电导率测量等技术对VOx/-Al2O3催化剂进行了深入了解。
4. 全覆盖支持表面的分散良好的钒物种可以提高ODP中的丙烯选择性。
5. N2O在激活催化剂方面的不利性与O2相比，导致活性中心浓度下降，从而提高了丙烯选择性。
