[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."
[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[3] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective."
[4] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."
[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
[6] "The results on catalyst characterisation are discussed to establish relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties such as electronic prop- erties, reducibility and structure of VOx species as well as the catalyst ability for oxidant activation."

The study analyzed the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using vanadia-based catalysts with varying vanadium loadings. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant showed decreased overall activity compared to oxygen (O2), yet increased selectivity towards propene formation. The study suggests that the effectiveness of isolated vanadia sites is crucial for propene selectivity, though these sites do not cover the entire support surface. The decreased steady-state concentration of active sites, attributed to N2O's lesser decomposition compared to O2, contributes to higher propene selectivity. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationships between catalytic performance and the properties of vanadia species, such as their electronic properties, reducibility, and structure, as well as the catalyst's ability to activate oxidants. Future research could focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to better control selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

该研究分析了使用不同负载量的范德华基催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，与氧气（O2）相比，总体活性降低，但丙烯选择性增加。研究表明，孤立的范德华位点对于丙烯选择性至关重要，尽管这些位点并未覆盖整个支持表面。N2O较慢的分解速率与O2激活相比，导致活性位点浓度降低和丙烯选择性的提高。研究强调理解催化性能与范德华物种的性质之间的关系的重要性，如它们的电子性质、可还原性和结构，以及催化剂激活氧化剂的能力。未来的研究可以集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以更好地控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应方面。
