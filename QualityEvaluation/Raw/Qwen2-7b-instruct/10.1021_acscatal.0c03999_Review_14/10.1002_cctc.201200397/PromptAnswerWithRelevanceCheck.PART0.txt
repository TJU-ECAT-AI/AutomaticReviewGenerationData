[1] "As CrOx catalysts supported on the SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active, they represent potentially promising catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP)."
[2] "However, reduction of the active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction is known to lead to severe deactivation."
[3] "With an Ni promoter on the CrOx/silica catalyst, CO2 is a more effective oxidant and reduced Cr2+ states are regenerated to active Cr3+ states."
[4] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[5] "N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms for the prepared catalysts demonstrate typeIV isotherms with H1-type hysteresis loops for all the samples."
[6] "The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air."
[7] "The conversion of CO2 and propane increases linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni."
[8] "Importantly, Ni maintains the stable catalytic activity."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts. Transition metal catalysts, especially those containing chromium (Cr), show high activity due to the ability to form active Cr3+ sites. However, the reduction of these active sites during the reaction often leads to severe deactivation. The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter enhances the catalytic activity by increasing the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states. This results in the successful production of propylene in the ODHP reaction. 

The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for the prepared catalysts show type IV isotherms with H1-type hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst increases the conversion of CO2 and propane linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni, while maintaining stable catalytic activity. Ex situ XPS measurements reveal that Ni promotes the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, thus enabling a stable yield of propylene.

Future research and development in this field should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might include the design of novel catalyst materials, modification of existing catalysts, and the development of advanced reaction conditions that can increase the selectivity and conversion rates while minimizing corrosion and side reactions.

近期在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面取得了进展，涉及过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物作为催化剂的应用。特别是含铬（Cr）的过渡金属催化剂显示出高活性，由于能够形成活性Cr3+位点。然而，在反应过程中这些活性位点的还原往往导致严重的失活。引入镍（Ni）作为促进剂可以增强催化活性，通过提高CO2的有效性来增加其氧化能力，并将还原的Cr2+状态再生回活性的Cr3+状态。这使得在ODHP反应中成功生产丙烯成为可能。

制备的催化剂的N2吸附-脱附等温线显示为类型IV等温线，带有H1型滞后环，表明存在介孔结构。向CrOx/silica催化剂中添加Ni增加了CO2和丙烷的转化率，随着Ni负载量的增加呈线性增加，同时保持了稳定的催化活性。离线XPS测量表明Ni促进了Cr3+状态的维持，这是ODHP反应中的活性位点，从而实现了稳定丙烯产量。

未来的研究和发展应集中在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程效率方面。可能的策略包括设计新型催化剂材料、修改现有催化剂以及开发先进的反应条件，以提高选择性和转化率，同时减少腐蚀和副反应。

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) into a chromium oxide catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) significantly enhances its performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with carbon dioxide (CO2). This improvement is characterized by stable catalytic activity and high selectivity for propylene production. The introduction of Ni facilitates the easy regeneration of reduced chromium oxide phases, as confirmed through a three-step hydrogen temperature programmed reduction analysis. As a result, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst notably boosts CO2 conversion efficiency and ensures the continuous production of propylene. The study further elucidates that the deactivation of the catalyst primarily occurs due to the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition. The utilization of Ni in the catalyst design significantly reduces deactivation rates and enables the regeneration of active sites, thereby maintaining the catalyst's stability throughout the ODHP reaction. Notably, the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst demonstrates exceptional stability in the ODHP process, thanks to its maintenance of the active phase composed of chromium(III) ions.
