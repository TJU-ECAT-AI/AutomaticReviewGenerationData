          [1] "As CrOx catalysts supported on the SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active, they represent potentially promising catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP)."
          [2] "However, reduction of the active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction is known to lead to severe deactivation."
          [3] "With an Ni promoter on the CrOx/silica catalyst, CO2 is a more effective oxidant and reduced Cr2+ states are regenerated to active Cr3+ states."
          [4] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
          [5] "N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms for the prepared catalysts demonstrate typeIV isotherms with H1-type hysteresis loops for all the samples."
          [6] "The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air."
          [7] "The conversion of CO2 and propane increases linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni."
          [8] "Importantly, Ni maintains the stable catalytic activity."
          [9] "In exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sites-reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state."
          [10] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts. Transition metal catalysts, especially those containing chromium (Cr), show high activity due to the ability to form active Cr3+ sites. However, the reduction of these active sites during the reaction often leads to severe deactivation. The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter enhances the catalytic activity by increasing the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states. This results in the successful production of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

          近期在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面取得了进展，涉及过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物作为催化剂的应用。特别是含铬（Cr）的过渡金属催化剂显示出高活性，由于能够形成活性Cr3+位点。然而，在反应过程中这些活性位点的还原往往导致严重的失活。引入镍（Ni）作为促进剂可以增强催化活性，通过提高CO2的有效性来增加其氧化能力，并将还原的Cr2+状态再生回活性的Cr3+状态。这使得在ODHP反应中成功生产丙烯成为可能。

          [1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
          [2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
          [3] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
          [4] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."
          [5] "This result revealed that the deactivation of the Cr/Si catalyst was affected mainly by the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition."

          Propylene, a key chemical in the petrochemical industry, serves as a precursor for the production of valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. The introduction of Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst improves the ODHP process by inducing the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. This leads to a high-stable catalyst with enhanced activity and selectivity, maintaining the active phase of Cr3+ states and reducing catalyst deactivation.

          [1] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state.1416"

          Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. However, the addition of Ni to the catalyst can induce the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), regenerating the reduced CrOx. This promotional activation of CO2 is attributed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst. The role of Ni as a promoter in the reaction is detailed through exsitu XPS measurements.

          尽管CrOx/silica催化剂具有高活性，但它们会因焦炭沉积和CrOx还原而迅速失活，将协调不饱和的Cr3+状态转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。然而，在催化剂中加入Ni可以诱导CO2分解为CO和激活O（O*ads），从而再生还原的CrOx。CO2的这种促进激活归因于Cr/Si催化剂上的添加Ni。Ni作为反应促进剂的作用通过离线XPS测量进行了详细研究。
