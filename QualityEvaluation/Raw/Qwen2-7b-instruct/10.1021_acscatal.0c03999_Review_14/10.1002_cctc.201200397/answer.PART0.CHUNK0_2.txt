[1] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state.1416"
[2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[3] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."
[4] "This promotional activation of CO2 owed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "The active and inactive states of Cr can be differentiated through exsitu XPS data, the role of Ni as a promoter of the reaction was investigated in detail by exsitu XPS measurements."
