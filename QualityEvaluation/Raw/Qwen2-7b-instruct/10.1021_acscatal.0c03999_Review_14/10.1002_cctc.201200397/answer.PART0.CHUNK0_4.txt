Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) into a chromium oxide catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) significantly enhances its performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with carbon dioxide (CO2). This improvement is characterized by stable catalytic activity and high selectivity for propylene production. The introduction of Ni facilitates the easy regeneration of reduced chromium oxide phases, as confirmed through a three-step hydrogen temperature programmed reduction analysis. As a result, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst notably boosts CO2 conversion efficiency and ensures the continuous production of propylene. The study further elucidates that the deactivation of the catalyst primarily occurs due to the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition. The utilization of Ni in the catalyst design significantly reduces deactivation rates and enables the regeneration of active sites, thereby maintaining the catalyst's stability throughout the ODHP reaction. Notably, the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst demonstrates exceptional stability in the ODHP process, thanks to its maintenance of the active phase composed of chromium(III) ions.

最近的研究表明，在二氧化硅负载的铬氧化物催化剂（Cr/Si）中添加0.5wt%镍（Ni）可以显著提高其在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢过程中二氧化碳（CO2）的转化率和丙烯选择性。这种改进体现在催化剂活性的稳定性和丙烯生产效率的提高上。Ni的引入使还原的铬氧化物相得以轻松再生，这一过程通过三步氢气温度程序化还原分析得到了证实。因此，将0.5wt% Ni添加到10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中，显著提高了CO2的转化率，并确保了丙烯的持续生产。研究进一步指出，催化剂的失活主要由活性位点的转变而非焦炭沉积引起。通过在催化剂设计中使用Ni，可以显著降低失活速率并实现活性位点的再生，从而维持催化剂在整个ODHP反应过程中的稳定性。值得注意的是，0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂在ODHP过程中表现出极高的稳定性，得益于其保持了以铬（III）离子组成的活性相。
