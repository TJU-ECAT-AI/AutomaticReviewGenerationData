[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[3] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
[4] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."
[5] "This result revealed that the deactivation of the Cr/Si catalyst was affected mainly by the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the development of catalyst systems that utilize transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is evaluated based on selectivity and conversion rates. Key challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and optimizing the inherent reaction properties of the ODHP process. Future research and development focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states. Introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst reduces catalyst deactivation and enables the regeneration of active sites, thus achieving a stable yield of propylene.

The deactivation of the Cr/Si catalyst was found to be mainly influenced by the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition, highlighting the effectiveness of Ni in maintaining the catalyst's performance.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，催化剂系统的发展涉及到过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的应用。这些催化剂的性能根据选择性和转化率进行评估。此领域的主要挑战包括处理腐蚀性以及优化ODHP过程的内在反应特性。未来的研究和发展集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程上。

Ni促进的Cr/Si催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高稳定性，通过保持其Cr3+状态的活性相位实现这一目标。在Cr/Si催化剂上引入Ni可以降低催化剂的失活，并实现活性位点的再生，从而达到稳定的丙烯产量。

研究发现，Cr/Si催化剂的失活主要由活性位点的转变而非焦炭沉积所影响，这凸显了Ni在保持催化剂性能方面的有效性。
