[1] "Nakagawa et al. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[2] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[3] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[4] "Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[5] "Mebel et al. reported that the activation energy for the dissociation of CO2 on Ni atoms is significantly lowered than that for CO2 in the absence of Ni atoms through abinitio calculations."
[6] "Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster."
[7] "The strong chemisorption of CO2 on Ni leads to the bending of the molecule because the d orbital is mixed with 2πμ in the CO2 orbital to form 6a1."
[8] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbon-oxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[9] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[10] "The regenerated CrOx could act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, which leads to reduced deactivation of the catalyst."
[11] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."
[12] "XRD patterns for the catalysts are shown in Figure1."
[13] "The effect of Ni addition by using the sequential impregnation method was examined."
[14] "To confirm physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts, XRD, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), high-resolution (HR)-TEM, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, and UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) experiments were performed."
[15] "All the samples show three peaks(100), (110), and (200) in their corresponding patterns, which are typical 2D hexagonally ordered mesostructures (p6mm) of SBA-15."
[16] "For the as-calcined SBA-15 sample, the estimated value of d100 is 10.0nm (2θ=0.88)."
[17] "Small shifts of the XRD peaks in Cr/Si and 0.5Ni-Cr/Si to higher angles suggest that the ordered mesostructure shrunk slightly, which could owe to the repeated calcination steps after impregnations of Cr precursor and Ni precursor, respectively."
[18] "The UV/Vis DRS of prepared catalysts is illustrated in Figure5."
[19] "There are four characteristic peaks and three bands centered at 261, 360, and 469nm that are assigned to Cr6+ species."
[20] "The first two peaks are assigned to the 1A11T2 transition of tetrahedral CrOx, and the third peak is assigned to the 1A11T1 transition."
[21] "However, the peak at 610nm corresponds to the A2gT2g charge transfer, which is typical of octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ in α-Cr2O3."
[22] "The UV/Vis DRS results indicate that the prepared catalysts contain both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, although Cr3+ species is dominant by α-Cr2O3."
[23] "After the addition of Ni, the overall intensity of the four peaks decreases slightly."
[24] "This suggests that the added Ni affects the Cr species and converts them into other species, such as nickel chromate."
[25] "The ODHP catalytic activities of the prepared catalysts are shown in Figure6."
[26] "0.5Ni-Cr/Si and Cr/Si catalysts demonstrate different trends."
[27] "At the first point of reaction data, the conversion of CO2 and propane for the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst is significantly higher than that for the non-promoted catalyst whereas the selectivity for propylene is nearly zero, which leads to the zero yield of propylene as well."
[28] "This promotional activation of CO2 owed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst."
[29] "The deactivation tendency of the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was significantly lower than that of the non-promoted catalyst."
[30] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity."
[31] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."
[32] "The role of Ni as a promoter of the reaction was investigated in detail by exsitu XPS measurements."
[33] "CrOx can be present in various oxidation states: Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+."
[34] "Of the various states, coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states formed from the reduction of higher valence states, that is, Cr6+, are the main active sites for the ODHP reaction whereas the Cr2+ state is active for light alkene polymerization."
[35] "Exsitu XPS spectra of the Cr2p region with two characteristic peaks centered at approximately 577.4 and 587.4eV, corresponding to two Cr2p3/2 and Cr2p1/2 spinorbit components, respectively, are shown in Figure8."
[36] "According to the literature, the binding energy of Cr2p3/2 signals at approximately 577.4eV could be assigned to the Cr3+ state and that of 575.9eV to the Cr2+ state."
[37] "For the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into the inactive Cr2+ state within 90s during the ODHP reaction."
[38] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."
[39] "Therefore, it can be concluded that by introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."
[40] "Cr6+ states in CrOx reduce immediately to Cr3+ on interaction with propane, which acts as a precursor for active sites."
[41] "The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states formed work for dehydrogenation, and the generated hydrogen reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which causes the deactivation of the catalyst."
[42] "The soft oxidant CO2 is activated and dissociates on the Ni surface of the nearby CrOx, and the generated O*ads is transferred to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+ step-by-step to recover the original CrOx phase."
[43] "Consequently, the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."

1. The study discusses the promotion effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.
