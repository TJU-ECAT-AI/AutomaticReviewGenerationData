In recent studies, chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising materials for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) due to their high activity and selectivity. Compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation methods, CO2-PDH processes exhibit higher propane conversion and propene yield. High dispersion of chromium species and their redox capability are critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance in CO2-PDH reactions. Dealumination of Beta zeolite, followed by a simple impregnation procedure for chromium dispersion, results in highly effective catalysts for CO2-PDH. Beta zeolite's unique three-dimensional structure, featuring larger pores than ZSM-5 zeolite (with dimensions of 0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), along with its high thermal and acid stability, makes it a preferred choice for CO2-PDH catalysts. These properties, combined with a large specific surface area, facilitate the dispersion of high concentrations of chromium oxide species, enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

在近期的研究中，氧化铬基催化剂被证明是二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）的有前景材料，由于它们具有高活性和选择性。与传统的非氧化脱氢方法相比，CO2-PDH过程表现出更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。高分散的铬物种及其还原性是实现CO2-PDH反应最佳催化性能的关键因素。通过去铝化β沸石并随后采用简单的浸渍程序进行铬分散，可以制备出高效的CO2-PDH催化剂。β沸石独特的三维结构，其孔径大于ZSM-5沸石（线性孔径为0.75 by 0.57 nm，曲折孔径为0.65 by 0.56 nm），以及其高热稳定性和酸稳定性，使其成为CO2-PDH催化剂的理想选择。这些特性，结合其大的比表面积，促进了高浓度铬氧化物物种的分散，从而提高了整体催化效率。
