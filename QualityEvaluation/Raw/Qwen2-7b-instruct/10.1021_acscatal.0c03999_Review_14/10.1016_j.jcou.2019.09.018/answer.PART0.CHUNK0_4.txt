[1] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

This study focused on developing active and selective catalysts for the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) process. Chromium was incorporated into siliceous SiBeta zeolite to create these catalysts. The dealumination process had a significant impact on the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts compared to those supported on silica (SiBeta) and aluminum (AlBeta). Low acidity in SiBeta was found to be advantageous for achieving high propene selectivity, exceeding 80%. Conversely, higher acidity in the initial AlBeta promoted propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. In a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene increased when using CO2 only over the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it showed a negative effect on propene formation over the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst.

这项研究专注于开发CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）过程的活性和选择性催化剂。通过在硅基SiBeta沸石中引入铬，制备了这些催化剂。去铝化过程对含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性能产生了显著影响，与二氧化硅（SiBeta）和铝（AlBeta）支持的催化剂相比。在低酸度的SiBeta中，发现可以获得超过80％的高丙烯选择性。相反，在初始AlBeta中的较高酸度促进了丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。在丙烷脱氢操作模式之间切换，当仅使用CO2时，丙烯的生成速率在使用SiBeta型的Cr-含催化剂上增加，而Cr-含AlBeta催化剂上则对丙烯生成率产生负面影响。
