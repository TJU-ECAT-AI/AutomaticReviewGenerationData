[1] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The study discusses the development of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The researchers prepared catalysts by incorporating chromium into siliceous SiBeta zeolite through a two-step process involving the removal of aluminum and subsequent chromium introduction via wet impregnation. The dealumination of Beta zeolite had a significant impact on the catalytic properties, with low acidity favoring high selectivity towards propene production. In contrast, the starting aluminum-rich Beta zeolite promoted propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the study found that the formation rate of propene increased when using the chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst in the presence of CO2, whereas a negative effect on propene formation rate was observed with the chromium-containing aluminum Beta zeolite catalyst in the same mode.

该研究讨论了在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）中铬含量β沸石催化剂的开发。研究人员通过两步过程制备了催化剂，包括去除铝和随后通过湿浸渍引入铬到硅基β沸石中。β沸石的去铝化对催化性能产生了显著影响，低酸性有利于高选择性地生产丙烯。相比之下，起始铝含量高的β沸石促进了丙烷裂解为轻质烃。此外，研究发现，在使用含有铬的Siβ沸石催化剂时，当存在二氧化碳时，丙烯的生成速率增加，而在相同模式下使用含有铬的铝β沸石催化剂时，则观察到了丙烯生成速率的负面影响。
