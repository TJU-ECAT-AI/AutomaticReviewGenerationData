In recent studies, chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising materials for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) due to their high activity and selectivity. Compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation methods, CO2-PDH processes exhibit higher propane conversion and propene yield. High dispersion of chromium species and their redox capability are critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance in CO2-PDH reactions. Dealumination of Beta zeolite, followed by a simple impregnation procedure for chromium dispersion, results in highly effective catalysts for CO2-PDH. Beta zeolite's unique three-dimensional structure, featuring larger pores than ZSM-5 zeolite (with dimensions of 0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), along with its high thermal and acid stability, makes it a preferred choice for CO2-PDH catalysts. These properties, combined with a large specific surface area, facilitate the dispersion of high concentrations of chromium oxide species, enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

在近期的研究中，氧化铬基催化剂被证明是二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）的有前景材料，由于它们具有高活性和选择性。与传统的非氧化脱氢方法相比，CO2-PDH过程表现出更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。高分散的铬物种及其还原性是实现CO2-PDH反应最佳催化性能的关键因素。通过去铝化β沸石并随后采用简单的浸渍程序进行铬分散，可以制备出高效的CO2-PDH催化剂。β沸石独特的三维结构，其孔径大于ZSM-5沸石（线性孔径为0.75 by 0.57 nm，曲折孔径为0.65 by 0.56 nm），以及其高热稳定性和酸稳定性，使其成为CO2-PDH催化剂的理想选择。这些特性，结合其大的比表面积，促进了高浓度铬氧化物物种的分散，从而提高了整体催化效率。

The study discusses the development of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The researchers prepared catalysts by incorporating chromium into siliceous SiBeta zeolite through a two-step process involving the removal of aluminum and subsequent chromium introduction via wet impregnation. The dealumination of Beta zeolite had a significant impact on the catalytic properties, with low acidity favoring high selectivity towards propene production. In contrast, the starting aluminum-rich Beta zeolite promoted propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the study found that the formation rate of propene increased when using the chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst in the presence of CO2, whereas a negative effect on propene formation rate was observed with the chromium-containing aluminum Beta zeolite catalyst in the same mode.

This study focused on developing active and selective catalysts for the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) process. Chromium was incorporated into siliceous SiBeta zeolite to create these catalysts. The dealumination process had a significant impact on the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts compared to those supported on silica (SiBeta) and aluminum (AlBeta). Low acidity in SiBeta was found to be advantageous for achieving high propene selectivity, exceeding 80%. Conversely, higher acidity in the initial AlBeta promoted propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. In a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene increased when using CO2 only over the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it showed a negative effect on propene formation over the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst.

这项研究专注于开发CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）过程的活性和选择性催化剂。通过在硅基SiBeta沸石中引入铬，制备了这些催化剂。去铝化过程对含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性能产生了显著影响，与二氧化硅（SiBeta）和铝（AlBeta）支持的催化剂相比。在低酸度的SiBeta中，发现可以获得超过80％的高丙烯选择性。相反，在初始AlBeta中的较高酸度促进了丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。在丙烷脱氢操作模式之间切换，当仅使用CO2时，丙烯的生成速率在使用SiBeta型的Cr-含催化剂上增加，而Cr-含AlBeta催化剂上则对丙烯生成率产生负面影响。
