[1] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[4] "High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."

This study investigates the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The dealumination process significantly impacts the catalytic properties, with a high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species being crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in this process.
