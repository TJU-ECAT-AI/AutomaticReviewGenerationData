<p>Carbon dioxide reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.</p>
<p>Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers.</p>
<p>Hou et al. [3] studied the influence of Ca on the performance of Ni/a-Al2O3 catalysts in the dry reforming reaction, reporting that it depends upon the properties of the support and the amount of added Ca. Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability.</p>
<p>The effect of alkali promoters (Na, Li, K) on Ni/MgO was studied by Arena et al. [14], who reported that alkali promoters affect the reducibility, the morphology, the active surface area and the electronic properties of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation.</p>
<p>The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period.</p>
<p>The addition of K to the catalyst allows for a reduction in carbon deposition, which in turn maintains a more stable and constant catalytic activity over time.</p>
<p>Compared to the unmodified catalyst, the Ni-K catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation.</p>
<p>The results obtained in this work with the K-containing catalysts can be explained on the basis of these conclusions. A fraction of potassium migrates from the support to the nickel surface and it is located first on the step sites that are the most active sites for the reforming reaction. Consequently, a low potassium content produces a decrease in methane conversion.</p>
<p>The analysis of the reaction products (H2 and CO) reveals that the presence of the modifier produces a decrease of the H2/CO ratio (from 0.97 with Ni-Al2O3 to 0.4 with Ni-K-Al2O3).</p>
<p>In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon.</p>

Recent studies have focused on the dry reforming of methane using nickel-based catalysts, particularly examining the impact of various modifiers like calcium (Ca), alkali metals (Na, Li, K), and other metals (Sn, Mn, Ca) on catalyst performance. These modifications aim to improve activity, stability, and selectivity in the reaction. Potassium (K) has been found to effectively reduce carbon deposition, maintaining stable and constant catalytic activity over time. This is attributed to potassium migrating from the support to the nickel surface and occupying the most active sites for reforming reactions, thus decreasing methane conversion. The introduction of potassium leads to a decrease in the H2/CO ratio, suggesting a shift in the reaction pathways. In contrast, the use of calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) has resulted in a significant decrease in activity and increased carbon deposition, posing challenges for catalyst longevity and efficiency. Future research should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes.

最近的研究集中在使用镍基催化剂的干甲烷重整，特别是考察了钙(Ca)、碱金属(Na、Li、K)和其他金属(Sn、Mn、Ca)等改性剂对催化剂性能的影响。这些修改旨在提高反应的活性、稳定性和选择性。钾(K)已被发现能有效减少碳沉积，保持稳定的催化活性和时间。这归因于钾从载体迁移到镍表面并占据重整反应最活跃的位点，从而降低了甲烷的转化率。引入钾导致氢气与一氧化碳比率的下降，表明反应途径发生了变化。相比之下，使用钙(Ca)、锰(Mn)和锡(Sn)的催化剂在30小时操作后显示出显著的活性降低和碳沉积增加，为催化剂的长期性和效率带来了挑战。未来研究应关注改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统策略，以优化丙烷氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）。
