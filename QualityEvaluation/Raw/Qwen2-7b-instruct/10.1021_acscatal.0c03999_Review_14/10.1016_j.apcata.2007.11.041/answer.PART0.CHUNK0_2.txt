[1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
[2] "However, an excess of Ca promotes carbon deposition, readily deactivating the catalyst."
[3] "The unmodified catalyst proved to be very active, selective and stable in the methane dry reforming reaction."
[4] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."
[5] "The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."
[6] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."

1. Nickel is considered the most suitable catalyst due to its availability and low cost in the CO2 reforming of methane process.
2. Excess calcium can promote carbon deposition, leading to the quick deactivation of the catalyst.
3. The unmodified catalyst demonstrates excellent performance in methane dry reforming, being active, selective, and stable.
4. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited low carbon deposition and maintained high stability in its catalytic activity over a 30-hour operation period.
5. The addition of 0.5 wt.% of metals to the catalyst resulted in a slight decrease in activity for the potassium-modified catalyst, but significantly reduced carbon deposition compared to the original catalyst.
6. The calcium, manganese, and tin-modified catalysts showed a substantial decrease in catalytic activity and a notable increase in carbon deposition during the observation period.

1. 镍因其可获得性和低成本，在甲烷二氧化碳重整反应中被认为是最佳催化剂。
2. 过量的钙会促进碳沉积，迅速导致催化剂失活。
3. 未改性催化剂在甲烷干重整反应中表现出色，具有活性、选择性和稳定性。
4. 含钾催化剂在30小时运行周期内显示出低碳沉积和高催化活性稳定性。
5. 添加0.5 wt.%的金属到催化剂中，钾改性催化剂的活性略有下降，但显著减少了碳沉积量，与原催化剂相比。
6. 钙、锰和锡改性催化剂在观察期内显示出催化活性大幅下降和碳沉积显著增加。
