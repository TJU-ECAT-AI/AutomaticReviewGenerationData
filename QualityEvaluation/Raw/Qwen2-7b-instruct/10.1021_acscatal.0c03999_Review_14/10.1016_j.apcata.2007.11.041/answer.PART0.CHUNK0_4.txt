<p>The severe pretreating condition (calcination: 22 h at 850 °C) produced a high metal alumina interaction forming a spinel of nickel aluminate, which after reduction (14 h at 850 °C) has been suggested to markedly suppress carbon deposition.</p>
<p>The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation.</p>
<p>The activity remains practically constant for the unmodified and the K-modified catalyst indicating than the carbon deposits are mostly graphite filaments carrying the nickel particles on the top.</p>
<p>Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface, increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metal-support interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles.</p>

The study focused on the impact of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) on the performance of a nickel-alumina catalyst in the dry reforming of methane. The catalyst was prepared via a solgel method. The unmodified catalyst exhibited high and stable activity with minimal carbon deposition. The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the aforementioned metals led to a slight decrease in activity for the K-modified catalyst, but significantly reduced carbon deposition compared to the original catalyst. In contrast, the Ca-, Mn-, and Sn-modified catalysts showed a substantial decrease in activity and increased carbon deposition. Potassium was found to hinder carbon accumulation, increase reducibility, and modify the metal-support interaction without altering the size or structure of the nickel particles. The results suggest that potassium-modified catalysts can offer improved stability and reduced carbon deposition in methane dry reforming reactions.

研究主要关注钾(K)、钙(Ca)、锰(Mn)和锡(Sn)对镍铝氧化物催化剂在甲烷干重整反应中的影响。催化剂通过溶胶法制备。未改性催化剂表现出高稳定性和低碳沉积的活性。引入0.5 wt.%上述金属后，钾改性催化剂的活性略有下降，但碳沉积量显著减少与原催化剂相比。相反，Ca、Mn和Sn改性催化剂的活性大幅下降，碳沉积量增加。钾被发现能阻碍碳积累、提高可还原性并修改金属-支撑相互作用，同时不改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。结果表明，钾改性催化剂可以提供更好的稳定性并减少碳沉积，在甲烷干重整反应中表现良好。
