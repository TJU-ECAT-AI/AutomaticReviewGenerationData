2. The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation.
The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period. In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The unmodified catalyst performed well in methane dry reforming, showing low carbon deposition and consistent high activity over 30 hours. The introduction of potassium led to slightly reduced but constant activity with lower carbon deposition. In contrast, calcium, manganese, and tin significantly reduced catalyst activity and increased carbon deposition over the tested period.

3. The results of catalyst surface area are shown in Table 1. The addition of modifiers produces a certain reduction in the area, possibly not due to the low content of the modifier used, but to the additional aqueous impregnation method developed. The used catalysts, after 30 h of operation, show a decrease in the surface area.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalyst surface area results are listed in Table 1. The introduction of modifiers resulted in a specific decrease in surface area, likely not attributed to the low modifier concentration, but rather to the developed aqueous impregnation technique. After 30 hours of operation, the used catalysts displayed a reduction in surface area.

催化剂表面积的结果列在表格1中。添加修饰剂导致表面积的特定减少，这可能不是由于使用的修饰剂浓度低，而是由于开发的水溶液浸渍方法。在30小时的操作后，使用的催化剂显示了表面积的减少。

5. The addition of a small amount of potassium has an important effect in reducing the amount of carbon deposited (from 60 mg C/g cat. for the unmodified catalyst to less than 10 mg C/g cat. for the sample with 0.5 wt.% potassium).
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Adding a small quantity of potassium significantly reduces the amount of carbon deposited (from 60 mg C/g catalyst for the unmodified catalyst to less than 10 mg C/g catalyst for the sample containing 0.5 wt.% potassium).

6. In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the case of the nickel-calcium, nickel-manganese, and nickel-tin modified catalysts, the scenario appears distinct, as they exhibit a notable decrease in activity and substantial accumulation of deactivating carbon after 30 hours of operation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于镍-钙、镍-锰和镍-锡修饰的催化剂而言，情况似乎不同，因为它们在30小时的连续运行后显示出活性的明显下降以及大量抑制活性的碳沉积。

7. Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface, increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metal-support interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Our findings affirm that the inclusion of potassium impedes the buildup of carbon on the catalyst surface, enhances reducibility, likely altering the metal-support interaction, and leaves the nickel particle size and structure unchanged.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
我们的数据证实，钾的加入阻碍了催化剂表面碳的积累，提高了可还原性，可能改变了金属-支持相互作用，并且没有改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。

8. The severe pretreating condition (calcination: 22 h at 850 8C) produced a high metal alumina interaction forming a spinel of nickel aluminate, which after reduction (14 h at 850 8C) has been suggested to markedly suppress carbon deposition [18].
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rigorous pre-treatment process (calcination for 22 hours at 850°C) fostered a robust interaction between metal and alumina, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate spinel. Following reduction (14 hours at 850°C), this structure was hypothesized to significantly inhibit carbon deposition [18].
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
严格的预处理过程（在850°C下煅烧22小时）促进了金属与铝酸盐之间的强烈相互作用，形成了镍铝酸盐立方体。在随后的还原（850°C下14小时）后，这种结构被假设可以显著抑制碳沉积[18]。
