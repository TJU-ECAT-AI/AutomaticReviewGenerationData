[1] "The addition of modifiers produces a certain reduction in the area,possibly not due to the low content of the modifier used, but to the additional aqueous impregnation method developed."
[2] "The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation."
[3] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst, only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."
[4] "The K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."
[5] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."

1. The addition of modifiers might not solely depend on their low content but also on the developed aqueous impregnation technique.
2. The unmodified catalyst demonstrated effective methane dry reforming with minimal carbon buildup and steady activity for over 30 hours.
3. Among the tested additives, only cobalt, copper, and zinc increased activity slightly in the dry reforming process, while others decreased it.
4. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited comparable but slightly diminished activity and significantly reduced carbon deposition compared to the base catalyst.
5. Calcium, manganese, and tin modifications led to a notable decrease in catalytic efficiency and substantial carbon accumulation over the study period.

1. 添加剂的影响可能不仅与其含量低有关，还与开发的水溶液浸渍方法有关。
2. 基本催化剂在甲烷干燥重整反应中表现出有效性，碳沉积量低，并且在操作超过30小时期间保持稳定活性。
3. 在测试的添加剂中，仅钴、铜和锌略微提高了干燥重整过程中的活性，而其他则降低了活性。
4. 钾改性催化剂的活动性与原始催化剂相比基本保持不变，但略低，碳沉积量也更低。
5. 钙、锰和锡的修改导致催化效率显著下降和大量碳积累，在研究期间。
