1. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides were compared in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The performance of catalyst systems was evaluated based on selectivity and conversion rates. Transition metal/metal oxides showed higher conversion rates but lower selectivity compared to main group element metal oxides.

2. Challenges in ODHP include corrosiveness and the inherent properties of the reaction. Corrosiveness is a concern due to the harsh conditions required for the reaction. The intrinsic properties of the reaction, such as the balance between hydrogen abstraction and carbon-carbon bond formation, pose additional challenges.

3. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Strategies to address these areas may involve developing more efficient catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and refining process parameters to maximize selectivity and conversion rates.

4. Catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides showed improved selectivity for propylene production. The optimal loading of potassium (K) was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, leading to a conversion of propane of about 31% and a selectivity to propylene of about 91% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

5. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the feed promoted the catalytic activity and maintained it by reducing the concentration of hydrogen (H2) and inhibiting coke formation. This demonstrates the synergistic effect of using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP processes.

6. The results indicated that the catalysts were effective for the reaction and that CO2 in the feed promoted the catalytic activity. The structure and surface acidity of the catalysts were studied using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and microcalorimetric adsorption. These studies provided insights into how the surface properties of the catalysts influenced their performance in the ODHP process.

7. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into chromium/silica catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity. This modification resulted in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene, depending on the nature and loading of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals.

8. The optimized loading of potassium (K) in the catalysts led to improved selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The selectivity could reach 100% while maintaining a 22-31% conversion of propane with approximately 0.2% of K.

9. The acidic sites on the catalysts were almost eliminated when the loading of potassium was increased to 1%. This finding suggests that potassium effectively modifies the surface acidity of the catalysts, affecting their performance in the ODHP process.

10. The use of soft oxidants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene. The addition of potassium (K) to chromium-based catalysts can significantly enhance the selectivity for propylene production, while maintaining a reasonable conversion rate.

11. The catalysts' effectiveness in the dehydrogenation of propane in carbon dioxide (CO2) was demonstrated. The results suggest that the presence of CO2 promotes the catalytic activity and maintains it by reducing the concentration of hydrogen (H2) and inhibiting the formation of coke.

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction."
[4] "The 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst behaved quite well for the dehydrogenation of propane in CO2. The conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene reached 27% and 85%, respectively, at 923 K."
[5] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."
[6] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of CO2 has been shown to increase the equilibrium conversion, maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and enhance propane conversion by reducing hydrogen concentration through the reversed water-gas shift reaction.

Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, particularly those modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metals, have been found to modify surface properties, decrease redox potential, and reduce surface acidity. This leads to a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in propylene selectivity. The optimized loading of alkali metals, such as potassium (K), around 0.2-0.4% in 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, has been identified as providing the best balance between propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

Challenges in the field of ODHP include corrosion resistance and the inherent reaction properties that may affect catalyst stability and longevity. Future research directions should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize efficiency and productivity. Strategies for addressing these challenges could involve developing more durable catalyst materials, refining reaction conditions, and exploring novel catalyst designs that can better withstand harsh environments and maintain high activity over longer periods.
