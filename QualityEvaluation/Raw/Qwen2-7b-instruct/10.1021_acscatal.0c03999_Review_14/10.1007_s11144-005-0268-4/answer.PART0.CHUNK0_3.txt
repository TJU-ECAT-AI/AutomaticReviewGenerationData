Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants have been explored with transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The literature highlights the effectiveness of modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts for ODHP, where CO2 promotes catalytic activity and maintains it by reducing hydrogen concentration and inhibiting coke formation. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides modifies surface properties, decreasing redox potential and surface acidity, leading to decreased propane conversion and increased propylene selectivity. An optimized loading of potassium around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts achieved a propane conversion of 22%-31% and propylene selectivity of 91%-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6. The acidic sites almost disappear with an increased potassium loading to 1%.

Challenges in ODHP include corrosion resistance and reaction properties. Future research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP processes. Strategies involve developing more stable catalysts, refining reaction conditions, and integrating advanced materials for better selectivity and efficiency.

近期，使用软氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）领域取得了进展，涉及过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。文献指出，改性Cr/SiO2催化剂对于ODHP具有高效性，其中CO2促进了催化活性并维持了活性，通过降低了氢气浓度和抑制了焦炭形成。向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了还原电位和酸性位点，导致了丙烷转化率的降低和丙烯选择性的提高。在923 K时，当CO2/C3H8比为3.6时，通过优化钾负载（约为0.2-0.4%）在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂上实现了丙烷转化率为22%-31%，丙烯选择性为91%-100%。

ODHP面临的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和反应特性。未来研究集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程。策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂、细化反应条件以及集成高级材料以提高选择性和效率。
