[1] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[2] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[3] "The effect depended on the nature and loading of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals. The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 22-31% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on optimizing catalyst systems for enhanced selectivity and conversion. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have shown promising results. The introduction of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts has been particularly effective. These modifications alter the surface properties, decrease redox potential, and surface acidity, leading to a reduction in propane conversion and an improvement in propylene selectivity. The optimal loading of potassium (K) in 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts has been found to range around 0.2-0.4%, achieving a propane conversion of 22-31% and a propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6. However, persistent challenges remain, including corrosion resistance and the optimization of C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction systems to improve ODHP efficiency.

近年来，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展集中在优化催化剂系统以提高选择性和转化率。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物显示出有希望的结果。向Cr/SiO2催化剂中引入碱土金属氧化物特别有效。这些修改改变了表面性质，降低了还原电势和表面酸性，导致丙烷转化率降低和丙烯选择性提高。在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中钾（K）的最佳负载范围约为0.2-0.4%，在923 K时，CO2/C3H8摩尔比为3.6的情况下，丙烷转化率为22-31%，丙烯选择性为91-100%。然而，仍然存在一些持久的挑战，包括耐腐蚀性以及优化C-H键活化、催化剂再生能力和反应系统的优化，以提高ODHP过程的效率。
