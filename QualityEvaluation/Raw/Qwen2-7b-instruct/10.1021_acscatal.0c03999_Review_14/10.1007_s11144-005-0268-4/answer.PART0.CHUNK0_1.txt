[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction."
[4] "The 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst behaved quite well for the dehydrogenation of propane in CO2. The conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene reached 27% and 85%, respectively, at 923 K."
[5] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."
[6] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."
[7] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[8] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[9] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of CO2 has been shown to increase the equilibrium conversion, maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and enhance propane conversion by reducing hydrogen concentration through the reversed water-gas shift reaction.

Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, particularly those modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metals, have been found to modify surface properties, decrease redox potential, and reduce surface acidity. This leads to a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in propylene selectivity. The optimized loading of alkali metals, such as potassium (K), around 0.2-0.4% in 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, has been identified as providing the best balance between propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

Challenges in the field of ODHP include corrosion resistance and the inherent reaction properties that may affect catalyst stability and longevity. Future research directions should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize efficiency and productivity. Strategies for addressing these challenges could involve developing more durable catalyst materials, refining reaction conditions, and exploring novel catalyst designs that can better withstand harsh environments and maintain high activity over longer periods.

最近，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展集中在不同催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的表现上。这些催化剂在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下成功地促进了丙烷的脱氢反应。二氧化碳被证明可以增加平衡转化率、维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭形成，并通过逆向水煤气变换反应降低氢浓度来增强丙烷转化率。

过渡金属/金属氧化物催化剂，特别是那些通过添加碱土金属氧化物改良的催化剂，已经被发现能够修改表面性质、降低还原电位和减少酸性基团，从而导致丙烷转化率的降低和丙烯选择性的提高。在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中，钾（K）的优化加载量约为0.2-0.4%，已被确定为提供最佳丙烷转化率与丙烯选择性平衡的催化剂。

该领域面临的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和固有的反应特性，这些特性可能影响催化剂的稳定性和寿命。未来的研究方向应集中在改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化效率和生产力上。解决这些挑战的战略可能包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料、改进反应条件以及探索能够更好地抵抗恶劣环境和保持高活性的新型催化剂设计。
