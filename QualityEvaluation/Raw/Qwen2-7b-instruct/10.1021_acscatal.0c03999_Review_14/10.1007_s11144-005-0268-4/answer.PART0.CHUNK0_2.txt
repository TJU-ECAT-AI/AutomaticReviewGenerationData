[1] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[2] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[3] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts show distinct performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction mix promotes catalytic activity and maintains activity by reducing hydrogen concentration and inhibiting coke formation. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides modifies the surface properties of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, decreasing the redox potential and surface acidity. This leads to a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in propylene selectivity. The optimal loading of potassium (K) in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts is around 0.2% to 0.4%, achieving a propane conversion of about 22%-31% and a propylene selectivity of about 91%-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalyst materials and the inherent properties of the reaction. Strategies for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve better efficiency and selectivity in ODHP processes.

最近，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展涉及使用各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的表现各不相同。二氧化碳（CO2）在反应混合物中的存在促进了催化活性并维持了活性，通过降低氢气浓度和抑制焦炭形成。向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了还原电势和酸性表面，导致丙烷转化率降低和丙烯选择性增加。在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中钾（K）的最佳加载量约为0.2%至0.4%，在923 K下，当CO2/C3H8比为3.6时，可实现丙烷转化率约22%-31%和丙烯选择性约91%-100%。

该领域持续面临的挑战包括某些催化剂材料的腐蚀性以及反应本身的固有属性。未来研究与开发的战略包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以实现ODHP过程更高的效率和选择性。
