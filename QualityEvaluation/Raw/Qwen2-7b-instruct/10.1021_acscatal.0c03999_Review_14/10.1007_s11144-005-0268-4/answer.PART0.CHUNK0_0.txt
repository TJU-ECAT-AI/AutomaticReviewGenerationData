1. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides were compared in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The performance of catalyst systems was evaluated based on selectivity and conversion rates. Transition metal/metal oxides showed higher conversion rates but lower selectivity compared to main group element metal oxides.

2. Challenges in ODHP include corrosiveness and the inherent properties of the reaction. Corrosiveness is a concern due to the harsh conditions required for the reaction. The intrinsic properties of the reaction, such as the balance between hydrogen abstraction and carbon-carbon bond formation, pose additional challenges.

3. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Strategies to address these areas may involve developing more efficient catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and refining process parameters to maximize selectivity and conversion rates.

4. Catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides showed improved selectivity for propylene production. The optimal loading of potassium (K) was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, leading to a conversion of propane of about 31% and a selectivity to propylene of about 91% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

5. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the feed promoted the catalytic activity and maintained it by reducing the concentration of hydrogen (H2) and inhibiting coke formation. This demonstrates the synergistic effect of using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP processes.

6. The results indicated that the catalysts were effective for the reaction and that CO2 in the feed promoted the catalytic activity. The structure and surface acidity of the catalysts were studied using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and microcalorimetric adsorption. These studies provided insights into how the surface properties of the catalysts influenced their performance in the ODHP process.

7. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into chromium/silica catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity. This modification resulted in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene, depending on the nature and loading of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals.

8. The optimized loading of potassium (K) in the catalysts led to improved selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The selectivity could reach 100% while maintaining a 22-31% conversion of propane with approximately 0.2% of K.

9. The acidic sites on the catalysts were almost eliminated when the loading of potassium was increased to 1%. This finding suggests that potassium effectively modifies the surface acidity of the catalysts, affecting their performance in the ODHP process.

10. The use of soft oxidants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene. The addition of potassium (K) to chromium-based catalysts can significantly enhance the selectivity for propylene production, while maintaining a reasonable conversion rate.
