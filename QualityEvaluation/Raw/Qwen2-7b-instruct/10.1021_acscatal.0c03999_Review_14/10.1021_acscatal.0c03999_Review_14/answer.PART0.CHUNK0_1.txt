7. "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
8. "However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route."
9. "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
10. "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
11. "There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired."
12. "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."
13. "For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design."
14. "To summarize, an optimal propane oxychlorination catalyst should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics."
15. "Moreover, the high selectivity, namely, >80%, can be well retained at the C3H8 conversion as high as 53%."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the extensive study of transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements. These catalysts have been utilized for reactions involving CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. Challenges encountered include the inherent properties of reactions and the difficulties in managing corrosiveness, which have led to unique challenges and future research directions specific to each route. The focus for future efforts should be on designing catalysts capable of facilitating the activation of the C-H bond in propane with good regenerability, and renovating reaction systems that can balance industrial needs with the utilization of various acid gases. Carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in ODHP, contributing to redox cycles, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards products, and aiding in coke removal. Competitive adsorption between molecules affects C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield, necessitating the development of dopants that balance adsorption and inhibit strong C3H6 adsorption. Rapid deactivation in CO2ODHP is caused by the reduction of active sites and coke formation. Iron-containing zeolite catalysts' stability can be improved by adjusting the nature and strength of acid sites. An optimal propane oxychlorination catalyst should have moderate redox properties, enabling alkane activation without favoring overoxidation, combustion, or chloride evolution, and possess fast dehydrochlorination kinetics. High selectivity and retention of >80% at a C3H8 conversion of 53% have been achieved in certain processes.

在软氧化剂介导下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展涉及对过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的广泛研究。这些催化剂被用于涉及二氧化碳、氮氧化物、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物的反应。遇到的挑战包括反应的内在属性和处理腐蚀性的困难，这导致了每条路线特有的独特挑战和未来的研究方向。未来努力的方向应集中在设计能够促进丙烷中C-H键激活并具有良好再生能力的催化剂上，以及改造能够平衡工业过程需求与利用各种酸性气体挑战的反应系统。二氧化碳在ODHP中扮演着关键角色，它促进了原电池循环，推动反应向产物侧偏移，并通过逆布杜瓦反应去除焦炭。分子间的竞争吸附影响了C3H8吸附和C3H6产率，需要开发能够平衡吸附和抑制强烈C3H6吸附的掺杂剂。二氧化碳ODHP中的快速失活是由于活性位点的还原和焦炭形成所致。铁基沸石催化剂的稳定性可以通过调整酸位的性质和强度来进一步改善。一个理想的丙烷氧氯化催化剂应该具有适度的原电池性质，既能促进烷烃激活而不利于过氧化、燃烧或氯气的生成，又能具备快速脱氯化动力学。在某些过程中已经实现了高达80%的高选择性和53%转化率的保留。
