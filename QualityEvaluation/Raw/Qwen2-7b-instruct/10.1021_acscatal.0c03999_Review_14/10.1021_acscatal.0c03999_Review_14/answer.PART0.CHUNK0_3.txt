[1] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."
[2] "For CO2ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing compositionstructurecatalysis relationship."
[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."
[4] "Other catalysts that have been explored include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts."
[5] "Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies:"
[6] "For example, the Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of methylene CH bond in C3H8 molecules;"
[7] "The presence of CO2 shows an overall promoting effect on C3H6 formation."
[8] "There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield."
[9] "For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design."
[10] "However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies."
[11] "To summarize, an optimal propane oxychlorination catalyst should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics."
[12] "On the other hand, metal phosphates such as CrPO4 (yield = 50% at 500 C) are moderate oxidizers, leading to high selectivity (i.e., 95%) but lower activity than CeO2 under identical conditions."
[13] "In particular, CO2ODHP exhibits higher selectivity among all reaction routes."
[14] "Moreover, the high selectivity, namely, >80%, can be well retained at the C3H8 conversion as high as 53%."
[15] "Noteworthily, this way of comparison is not completely fair, as it overlooks the effects of other critical parameters, such as temperature, feed compositions, GHSV, etc."
[16] "In conclusion, additional theoretical studies in these areas would be highly beneficial to move the field forward and guide experimental efforts."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this document highlights the extensive study of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions with soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. Redox-type and non-redox-type catalysts have been explored, with a focus on developing a composition-structure-catalysis relationship. Among redox-type catalysts, chromium oxide (CrOx) stands out for its high C3H6 selectivity at increased C3H8 conversion rates. Other catalysts, such as iron, precious metals, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), and nickel, have also been investigated. The document notes that despite notable achievements, several challenges remain, including corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, which necessitate further research. Key areas for future investigation include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to boost ODHP efficiency. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been identified as a promoter of C3H6 formation, and the competitive adsorption between molecules impacts C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Iron-containing zeolite catalysts are noted for showing improved stability through the nature and strength of acid sites, although their exact active sites remain uncertain. Optimal propane oxychlorination catalysts should balance redox properties to prevent overoxidation, combustion, and chlorine evolution while ensuring efficient dehydrochlorination kinetics. Metal phosphates like chromium phosphate (CrPO4) demonstrate high selectivity but lower activity compared to chromium oxide. CO2ODHP exhibits the highest selectivity among various reaction routes, retaining high selectivity even at high C3H8 conversions. The comparison of ODHP with traditional oxygen (O2) oxidant reveals differences in activity and selectivity, acknowledging that other critical parameters, such as temperature, feed compositions, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), were not fully accounted for in the analysis. The document concludes that additional theoretical studies would significantly advance the field and guide experimental efforts, particularly for catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants like nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and halides.

分析氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）使用软氧化剂的最近进展，本文强调了过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在与软氧化剂如二氧化碳、氮氧化物、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物进行ODHP反应方面的广泛研究。探索了还原型和非还原型催化剂，并发展了组成-结构-催化关系。在还原型催化剂中，铬氧化物（CrOx）因其在550°C时在所有催化剂中的高C3H6选择性而突出。其他催化剂，如铁、贵金属、钼碳化物（Mo2C）和镍，也进行了调查。文档指出，尽管取得了显著成就，但仍存在一些挑战，包括腐蚀性和内在反应特性，这需要进一步的研究。未来研究的关键领域包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以提升ODHP效率。已知二氧化碳（CO2）对C3H6形成具有促进作用，分子间的竞争吸附影响了C3H8吸附和C3H6产率。铁基沸石催化剂通过酸位的性质和强度显示出改善稳定性，但其确切的活性位点仍不清楚。理想的丙烷氧氯化催化剂应平衡红氧化性，防止烷烃过氧化、燃烧和氯气释放，同时确保高效的去氯化分解动力学。金属磷酸盐如铬磷酸盐（CrPO4）显示出高选择性但较低的活性，与铬氧化物相比。CO2ODHP在各种反应途径中表现出最高的选择性，并且即使在高C3H8转化率下也能保持高选择性。比较使用传统氧气（O2）氧化剂的ODHP与传统氧气氧化剂的差异，承认在分析中未充分考虑温度、组分组成和其他关键参数，如气体小时空间速度（GHSV）。文档结论是，额外的理论研究将极大地推动该领域的进步并指导实验工作，特别是对于适用于腐蚀性或较少研究的氧化剂（如氮氧化物（NOx）、硫氧化物（SOx）和卤素）的催化剂。
