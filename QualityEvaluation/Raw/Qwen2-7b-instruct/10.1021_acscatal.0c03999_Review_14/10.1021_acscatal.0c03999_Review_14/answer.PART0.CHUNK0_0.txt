[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work."
[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."

[4] "Future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
[5] "Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction."
[6] "There is a competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired."
[7] "For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, it's evident that transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated for their effectiveness in converting propane. Challenges in this field stem from the unique properties of reactions and the issue of corrosiveness, leading to distinct research directions for each route. Efforts should focus on creating catalysts capable of activating the C-H bond in propane with high regenerability and optimizing reaction systems to balance industrial needs with the utilization of diverse acid gases. Carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in the reaction by completing redox cycles, shifting the equilibrium towards products, and aiding in coke removal. The competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6 impacts the efficiency of the process, necessitating dopants to balance adsorption. Rapid deactivation in CO2ODHP is due to site reduction and coke formation, while similar challenges persist in N2OODHP. The stability of iron-containing zeolite catalysts can be enhanced through improvements in acid site design. Comparisons of ODHP with soft oxidants versus traditional methods highlight the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of parameters. Theoretical studies could significantly advance the field by guiding experimental efforts, particularly in identifying catalysts suited for challenging oxidants like NOx, SOx, and halides. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, offer opportunities for process optimization and energy efficiency. Optimizing the C3H8/O2 ratio is essential for maintaining high C3H8 conversion and preventing overoxidation, thus ensuring higher C3H6 selectivity.
