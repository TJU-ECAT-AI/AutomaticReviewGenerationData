7. "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."
8. "For example, there are only a few works regarding metals other than iron-supported/modified zeolites which have been reported. Also, while there are multiple reports regarding MFI and BEA zeolite topology for N2OODHP, the effects of other zeolite topologies remain unknown."
9. "However, a general trend of activity-selectivity spans of each reaction route has been revealed and provided perspective for further research in the dehydrogenation of propane and other light alkanes."
10. "Modeling these pathways through microkinetics or kinetic Monte Carlo has been shown to be very useful in that regard."
