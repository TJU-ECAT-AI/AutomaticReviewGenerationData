Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, it's evident that transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated for their effectiveness in converting propane. Challenges in this field stem from the unique properties of reactions and the issue of corrosiveness, leading to distinct research directions for each route. Efforts should focus on creating catalysts capable of activating the C-H bond in propane with high regenerability and optimizing reaction systems to balance industrial needs with the utilization of diverse acid gases. Carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in the reaction by completing redox cycles, shifting the equilibrium towards products, and aiding in coke removal. The competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6 impacts the efficiency of the process, necessitating dopants to balance adsorption. Rapid deactivation in CO2ODHP is due to site reduction and coke formation, while similar challenges persist in N2OODHP. The stability of iron-containing zeolite catalysts can be enhanced through improvements in acid site design. Comparisons of ODHP with soft oxidants versus traditional methods highlight the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of parameters. Theoretical studies could significantly advance the field by guiding experimental efforts, particularly in identifying catalysts suited for challenging oxidants like NOx, SOx, and halides. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping and membrane reactors, offer opportunities for process optimization and energy efficiency. Optimizing the C3H8/O2 ratio is essential for maintaining high C3H8 conversion and preventing overoxidation, thus ensuring higher C3H6 selectivity.

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this document highlights the extensive study of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions with soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. Redox-type and non-redox-type catalysts have been explored, with a focus on developing a composition-structure-catalysis relationship. Among redox-type catalysts, chromium oxide (CrOx) stands out for its high C3H6 selectivity at increased C3H8 conversion rates. Other catalysts, such as iron, precious metals, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), and nickel, have also been investigated. The document notes that despite notable achievements, several challenges remain, including corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, which necessitate further research. Key areas for future investigation include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to boost ODHP efficiency. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been identified as a promoter of C3H6 formation, and the competitive adsorption between molecules impacts C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Iron-containing zeolite catalysts are noted for showing improved stability through the nature and strength of acid sites, although their exact active sites remain uncertain. Optimal propane oxychlorination catalysts should balance redox properties to prevent overoxidation, combustion, and chlorine evolution while ensuring efficient dehydrochlorination kinetics. Metal phosphates like chromium phosphate (CrPO4) demonstrate high selectivity but lower activity compared to chromium oxide. CO2ODHP exhibits the highest selectivity among various reaction routes, retaining high selectivity even at high C3H8 conversions. The comparison of ODHP with traditional oxygen (O2) oxidant reveals differences in activity and selectivity, acknowledging that other critical parameters, such as temperature, feed compositions, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), were not fully accounted for in the analysis. The document concludes that additional theoretical studies would significantly advance the field and guide experimental efforts, particularly for catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants like nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and halides.
