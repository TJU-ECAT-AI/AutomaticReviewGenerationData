Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively studied. These systems show comparable performance for CO2- and N2OODHP reactions. Challenges persist due to corrosiveness and intrinsic reaction properties, leading to unique future research directions. Key areas for improvement include designing catalysts that efficiently activate the C-H bond with good regenerability, optimizing reaction systems to integrate industrial needs with acid gas utilization, and refining catalyst composition and structure relationships. Redox-type catalysts like CrOx demonstrate higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion, while non-redox-type catalysts such as Ga2O3 exhibit comparable selectivity under lower conversion rates. Exploring a range of catalysts, including Fe, precious metals, Mo2C, and Ni, sheds light on their roles in selective activation. Future research aims to identify redox cycles, elucidate reaction mechanisms, manage competitive adsorption between reactants, and enhance catalyst stability and regeneration. The application of chemical looping and membrane reactors presents opportunities for process intensification and energy efficiency. Optimizing the C3H8/O2 ratio ensures high C3H8 conversion and prevents overoxidation, thereby enhancing C3H6 selectivity.
