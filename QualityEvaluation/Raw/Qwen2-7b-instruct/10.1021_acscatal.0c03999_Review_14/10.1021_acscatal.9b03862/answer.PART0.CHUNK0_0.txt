</ChineseVersionAnswer>

Answer: The article primarily focuses on the selective activation of C-H bonds through the use of NOx-mediated generation of strong H-abstractors in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Answer: The article does not provide specific details about the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It discusses the use of soft oxidants and different catalyst systems, but does not compare their performances quantitatively.

Answer: Persistent challenges mentioned in the article include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent properties of the reactions themselves. These factors can hinder the efficiency and longevity of the catalytic processes involved in ODHP.

Answer: Key areas for future research and development, as suggested in the article, include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing the reaction systems to better facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane processes. The focus is on overcoming the challenges of efficiency, stability, and selectivity in these catalytic transformations.

Answer: The article does not delve into specific challenges related to the performance of catalyst systems, such as those involving transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. It provides a broad overview of the topic without offering detailed comparisons or analysis of individual catalyst performances.
