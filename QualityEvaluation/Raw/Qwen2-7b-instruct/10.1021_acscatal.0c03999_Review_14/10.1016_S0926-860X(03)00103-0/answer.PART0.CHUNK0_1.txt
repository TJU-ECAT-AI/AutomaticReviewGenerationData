[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
[2] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts. The mechanism of such a reduction switches from an inhibition of the oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations to a combination of this inhibition effect with a direct reduction of the surface of the catalyst by N2O at high concentrations."
[3] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
[4] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[5] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature showcases significant improvements in catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides exhibit enhanced selectivity and conversion rates when incorporating soft oxidants like N2O. N2O influences the catalyst's reactivity, leading to a reduction in the oxidation rate and promoting a more selective process. The literature reveals that the effectiveness of N2O varies with concentration, affecting the catalyst's reduction level and subsequent ODHP outcomes. At lower concentrations, N2O inhibits oxygen adsorption, facilitating a slight reduction of the catalyst and enhancing selectivity in propylene production. However, at higher concentrations, N2O directly reduces the catalyst surface, leading to a deeper reduction and a decrease in propane conversion, with propylene production becoming more pronounced. Despite these advancements, the literature acknowledges persistent challenges such as catalyst corrosion and the need for optimized reaction systems. Future research focuses on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，文献展示了催化剂系统的重要改进。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在结合软氧化剂如N2O时表现出增强的选择性和转化率。N2O影响催化剂活性，导致氧化速率降低，促进催化剂还原。文献表明N2O的有效性随浓度变化，影响催化剂的还原程度和随后的ODHP结果。在较低浓度下，N2O抑制氧吸附，实现轻微的催化剂还原并增强丙烯选择性生产。然而，在较高浓度下，N2O直接还原催化剂表面，导致更深的还原并降低丙烷转化率，使得丙烯生产变得更加显著。尽管取得了这些进步，但文献承认存在持续挑战，如催化剂腐蚀以及需要优化的反应系统。未来研究集中在策略上，以提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和精炼反应系统，以最大化ODHP效率。
