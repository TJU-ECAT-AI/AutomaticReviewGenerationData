[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed."
[2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state. At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[3] "The role that the reduced sites play in the selectivity of catalysts in oxidation reactions and the control of this reduced sites during the catalytic reaction by the operational conditions has been discussed extensively previously [4]."
[4] "It is clear that when adjusting the amounts of CO2 and N2O, the optimal oxidation state of the atoms in surface could be modulated in order to improve performances."

1. The introduction of N2O as a dopant in the reaction feed affects the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over nickel molybdate catalysts by promoting the reduction of the catalysts. This effect varies depending on the concentration of N2O in the feed. 

2. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity towards propylene decreases, and the oxygen consumption and selectivity towards CO2 are further reduced. This implies that N2O can induce a deeper reduction of the catalyst sites.

3. The reduced sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the selectivity of catalysts in oxidation reactions, and the operational conditions can control this reduction. Adjusting the amounts of CO2 and N2O can help modulate the optimal oxidation state of the surface atoms to enhance performance.

4. By fine-tuning the amounts of dopants like CO2 and N2O, the oxidation state of the surface atoms can be optimized, which in turn can improve the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的过程中，向反应流中加入N2O能够显著影响镍钼酸盐催化剂的性能。N2O通过促进催化剂的还原来降低催化反应速率，从而实现对催化剂的还原作用。这种效应依赖于流体中的N2O浓度。

2. 当N2O浓度较高时（体积百分比为110%），丙烯的选择性下降，氧气消耗和CO2选择性进一步减少。这表明N2O可以引起催化剂活性位点更深层次的还原。

3. 催化剂表面的还原位点在氧化反应中对选择性起着关键作用，并且可以通过操作条件控制这些位点的还原程度。调整CO2和N2O的量可以优化表面原子的氧化状态，从而提高催化过程的性能。

4. 通过精确调节掺杂剂如CO2和N2O的含量，可以优化表面原子的氧化状态，进而提升催化过程的选择性和效率。
