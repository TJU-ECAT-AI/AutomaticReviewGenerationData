[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."

[3] "This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."

[4] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."

[5] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."

[6] "Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."

[7] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the impact of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as a gas dopant on the performance of nickel molybdate catalysts. The addition of N2O affects the catalytic rate and reduces the catalyst's oxidation state, influencing the conversion, yield, and selectivity of propylene production. Specifically, at low concentrations (300 ppm), the conversion of propane decreases, propylene yield increases, and selectivity improves. However, at higher concentrations (1-10% in volume), the conversion of propane, propylene yield, and selectivity decrease, oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity also decline. Notably, at high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane. These findings suggest that adjusting N2O levels can modulate the catalyst's oxidation state and enhance selectivity in ODHP processes.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the catalysts and the inherent properties of the reaction. Strategies for future research and development should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize efficiency and yield in ODHP. Key areas for exploration might include the development of more robust catalyst materials, the design of novel reaction conditions, and the implementation of advanced process control techniques to fine-tune dopant usage and catalyst performance.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展中，文献强调了氮氧化物（N2O）作为气体助剂对镍钼酸催化剂性能的影响。添加N2O会降低催化速率并促进催化剂的还原，影响丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率、产率和选择性。具体而言，在低浓度（300 ppm）下，丙烷的转化率下降，丙烯产率增加，选择性提高。然而，在高浓度（1-10%体积）下，丙烷的转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，氧气消耗和CO2选择性也减少。值得注意的是，在高N2O浓度下，丙烯可以从丙烷产生。这些发现表明，调整N2O水平可以调节催化剂的氧化状态并增强ODHP过程的选择性。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括催化剂的腐蚀性和反应的固有特性。未来研究与开发的关键策略应集中在改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化效率和产率。探索的重点领域可能包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料、设计新型反应条件以及实施高级过程控制技术来精确调控助剂使用和催化剂性能。
