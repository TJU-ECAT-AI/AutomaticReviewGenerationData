[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed."
[2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state. At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[3] "The role that the reduced sites play in the selectivity of catalysts in oxidation reactions and the control of this reduced sites during the catalytic reaction by the operational conditions has been discussed extensively previously [4]."
[4] "It is clear that when adjusting the amounts of CO2 and N2O, the optimal oxidation state of the atoms in surface could be modulated in order to improve performances."

1. The introduction of N2O as a dopant in the reaction feed affects the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over nickel molybdate catalysts by promoting the reduction of the catalysts. This effect varies depending on the concentration of N2O in the feed. 

2. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity towards propylene decreases, and the oxygen consumption and selectivity towards CO2 are further reduced. This implies that N2O can induce a deeper reduction of the catalyst sites.

3. The reduced sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the selectivity of catalysts in oxidation reactions, and the operational conditions can control this reduction. Adjusting the amounts of CO2 and N2O can help modulate the optimal oxidation state of the surface atoms to enhance performance.

4. By fine-tuning the amounts of dopants like CO2 and N2O, the oxidation state of the surface atoms can be optimized, which in turn can improve the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的过程中，向反应流中加入N2O能够显著影响镍钼酸盐催化剂的性能。N2O通过促进催化剂的还原来降低催化反应速率，从而实现对催化剂的还原作用。这种效应依赖于流体中的N2O浓度。

2. 当N2O浓度较高时（体积百分比为110%），丙烯的选择性下降，氧气消耗和CO2选择性进一步减少。这表明N2O可以引起催化剂活性位点更深层次的还原。

3. 催化剂表面的还原位点在氧化反应中对选择性起着关键作用，并且可以通过操作条件控制这些位点的还原程度。调整CO2和N2O的量可以优化表面原子的氧化状态，从而提高催化过程的性能。

4. 通过精确调节掺杂剂如CO2和N2O的含量，可以优化表面原子的氧化状态，进而提升催化过程的选择性和效率。

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature showcases significant improvements in catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides exhibit enhanced selectivity and conversion rates when incorporating soft oxidants like N2O. N2O influences the catalyst's reactivity, leading to a reduction in the oxidation rate and promoting a more selective process. The literature reveals that the effectiveness of N2O varies with concentration, affecting the catalyst's reduction level and subsequent ODHP outcomes. At lower concentrations, N2O inhibits oxygen adsorption, facilitating a slight reduction of the catalyst and enhancing selectivity in propylene production. However, at higher concentrations, N2O directly reduces the catalyst surface, leading to a deeper reduction and a decrease in propane conversion, with propylene production becoming more pronounced. Despite these advancements, the literature acknowledges persistent challenges such as catalyst corrosion and the need for optimized reaction systems. Future research focuses on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，文献展示了催化剂系统的重要改进。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在结合软氧化剂如N2O时表现出增强的选择性和转化率。N2O影响催化剂活性，导致氧化速率降低，促进催化剂还原。文献表明N2O的有效性随浓度变化，影响催化剂的还原程度和随后的ODHP结果。在较低浓度下，N2O抑制氧吸附，实现轻微的催化剂还原并增强丙烯选择性生产。然而，在较高浓度下，N2O直接还原催化剂表面，导致更深的还原并降低丙烷转化率，使得丙烯生产变得更加显著。尽管取得了这些进步，但文献承认存在持续挑战，如催化剂腐蚀以及需要优化的反应系统。未来研究集中在策略上，以提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和精炼反应系统，以最大化ODHP效率。

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the impact of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as a gas dopant on the performance of nickel molybdate catalysts. The addition of N2O affects the catalytic rate and reduces the catalyst's oxidation state, influencing the conversion, yield, and selectivity of propylene production. Specifically, at low concentrations (300 ppm), the conversion of propane decreases, propylene yield increases, and selectivity improves. However, at higher concentrations (1-10% in volume), the conversion of propane, propylene yield, and selectivity decrease, oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity also decline. Notably, at high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane. These findings suggest that adjusting N2O levels can modulate the catalyst's oxidation state and enhance selectivity in ODHP processes.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the catalysts and the inherent properties of the reaction. Strategies for future research and development should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize efficiency and yield in ODHP. Key areas for exploration might include the development of more robust catalyst materials, the design of novel reaction conditions, and the implementation of advanced process control techniques to fine-tune dopant usage and catalyst performance.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展中，文献强调了氮氧化物（N2O）作为气体助剂对镍钼酸催化剂性能的影响。添加N2O会降低催化速率并促进催化剂的还原，影响丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率、产率和选择性。具体而言，在低浓度（300 ppm）下，丙烷的转化率下降，丙烯产率增加，选择性提高。然而，在高浓度（1-10%体积）下，丙烷的转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，氧气消耗和CO2选择性也减少。值得注意的是，在高N2O浓度下，丙烯可以从丙烷产生。这些发现表明，调整N2O水平可以调节催化剂的氧化状态并增强ODHP过程的选择性。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括催化剂的腐蚀性和反应的固有特性。未来研究与开发的关键策略应集中在改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化效率和产率。探索的重点领域可能包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料、设计新型反应条件以及实施高级过程控制技术来精确调控助剂使用和催化剂性能。

1. Nitrogen dioxide (N2O) introduces a reduction effect on the catalyst surface, slowing down the reoxidation rate through inhibiting oxygen adsorption due to its presence on the catalyst surface. This leads to the surface of the catalyst being in a more reduced state.

2. As the concentration of N2O in the feed increases, the degree of reduction in the catalyst also increases. This results in a decline in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in oxygen consumption, and a further reduction in the selectivity to carbon dioxide.

3. Low concentrations of N2O (such as 300 ppm) cause only a slight reduction in the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in carbon dioxide formation, and a decrease in oxygen consumption.

4. High concentrations of N2O enable the catalyst to produce propylene from propane under transient conditions. However, this likely occurs only when molecular oxygen is also present.

5. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen has significant implications for the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using nickel molybdate catalysts.

1. 硝酸二氧（N2O）通过抑制氧气吸附在催化剂表面，由于N2O的存在，减慢了催化剂的再氧化速率，在催化剂表面引入了还原作用。

2. 随着N2O在流体中的浓度增加，催化剂的还原程度也加深。这导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，氧气消耗量减少，二氧化碳选择性进一步降低。

3. 低浓度的N2O（例如300 ppm）仅使催化剂轻微还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，二氧化碳形成量减少，氧气消耗量减少。

4. 高浓度的N2O使催化剂能够在短时间内从丙烷生成丙烯。然而，这可能只在存在分子氧时发生。

5. 将N2O添加到丙烷和分子氧的流体中对使用镍钼酸盐催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢化性能有重大影响。
