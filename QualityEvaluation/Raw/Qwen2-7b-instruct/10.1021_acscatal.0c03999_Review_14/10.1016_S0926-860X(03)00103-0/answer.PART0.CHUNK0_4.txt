[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
[2] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[3] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
[4] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane."
[5] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

1. Nitrogen dioxide (N2O) introduces a reduction effect on the catalyst surface, slowing down the reoxidation rate through inhibiting oxygen adsorption due to its presence on the catalyst surface. This leads to the surface of the catalyst being in a more reduced state.

2. As the concentration of N2O in the feed increases, the degree of reduction in the catalyst also increases. This results in a decline in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in oxygen consumption, and a further reduction in the selectivity to carbon dioxide.

3. Low concentrations of N2O (such as 300 ppm) cause only a slight reduction in the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in carbon dioxide formation, and a decrease in oxygen consumption.

4. High concentrations of N2O enable the catalyst to produce propylene from propane under transient conditions. However, this likely occurs only when molecular oxygen is also present.

5. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen has significant implications for the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using nickel molybdate catalysts.

1. 硝酸二氧（N2O）通过抑制氧气吸附在催化剂表面，由于N2O的存在，减慢了催化剂的再氧化速率，在催化剂表面引入了还原作用。

2. 随着N2O在流体中的浓度增加，催化剂的还原程度也加深。这导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，氧气消耗量减少，二氧化碳选择性进一步降低。

3. 低浓度的N2O（例如300 ppm）仅使催化剂轻微还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，二氧化碳形成量减少，氧气消耗量减少。

4. 高浓度的N2O使催化剂能够在短时间内从丙烷生成丙烯。然而，这可能只在存在分子氧时发生。

5. 将N2O添加到丙烷和分子氧的流体中对使用镍钼酸盐催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢化性能有重大影响。
