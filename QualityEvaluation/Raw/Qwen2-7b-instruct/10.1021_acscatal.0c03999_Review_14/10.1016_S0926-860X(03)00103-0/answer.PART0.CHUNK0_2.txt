[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
[2] "The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances. At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."
[3] "Clearly the fact of adding some amounts of N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic performances."
[4] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."
[5] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
[6] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1.N2O causes the surface of the catalyst to reduce through inhibiting the adsorption of O2, slowing the reoxidation rate. This leads to a modification of the catalyst's performance.
2.Adding N2O to the feed alters the catalytic behavior, causing a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield, and an improvement in propylene selectivity at a low N2O concentration (300 ppm).
3.Introducing N2O into the reaction feed significantly impacts the catalytic performance.
4.With N2O present, the catalytic sites operate in a more reduced state.
5.As the amount of N2O increases, the catalyst becomes more deeply reduced.
6.At high N2O concentrations, propane can be directly converted to propylene.

1.N2O通过抑制氧气吸附，减缓催化剂的再氧化速率，导致表面催化剂的还原。这导致催化剂性能的改变。
2.在低N2O浓度（300ppm）下向反应物中添加N2O会改变催化剂行为，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率增加，丙烯选择性提高。
3.N2O的引入对催化性能产生了显著影响。
4.存在N2O时，催化位点处于还原状态。
5.随着N2O含量的增加，催化剂变得更加还原。
6.在高N2O浓度下，可以将丙烷直接转化为丙烯。
