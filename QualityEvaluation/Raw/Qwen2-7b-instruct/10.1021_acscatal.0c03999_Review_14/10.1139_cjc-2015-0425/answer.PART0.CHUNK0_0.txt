[1] "A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) MSR and (iii) TSR. All three of these complex chemical reactions can lead to native and non-native H2S within conventional hydrocarbon production."
[2] "It should be noted that while H2S from aquathermolysis is caused by the steam assisted stimulation of heavy oil flow, sulfur containing oils will result in H2S upon desulfurization at surface (upgrading and hydrogenation processes)."
[3] "For TSR, it was shown that steady state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system. The later speciation calculation suggests that faster reaction rates at low-pH does not necessarily imply that HSO4-(aq) is the reactant in the rate-limiting step."
[4] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
[5] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
[6] "New experiments have been reported here, where aqueous SDS degradation was followed with the addition of various salts to increase the ionic strength. These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants."
[7] "Indications of neutral reactants further support a mechanism where S is oxidizing an organic species."
[8] "Alternatively, the measurements of He et al. for n-C16H34 at T = 360°C also have been re-interpreted using an ionic strength plot (Livingston plot). The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates."
[9] "The later suggests that the rate-limiting reaction involves two monovalent ions."
[10] "The two different kinetic regimes must be factored in when extrapolating TSR rates from high-temperature laboratory experiments to reservoir conditions."

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

This literature reviews the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production, focusing on aquathermolysis, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and thermal sulfate reduction (TSR). It highlights the complex chemical reactions that lead to the generation of native and non-native H2S within conventional hydrocarbon production. The review discusses the differences between H2S generated from aquathermolysis, which occurs during the steam-assisted stimulation of heavy oil flow, and that from sulfur-containing oils resulting from desulfurization processes at the surface. The literature also examines the role of steady-state sulfur under acidic conditions in shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system, and how this affects reaction rates. It further explores recent research on the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production and the potential involvement of chemical additives in hydraulic fracturing fluids as oxidants and reductants during the H2S delay through TSR reactions. The review presents experimental findings on the lack of significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength during aqueous SDS degradation, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants. It also discusses the implications of these findings on the kinetic mechanisms of TSR reactions and the need to consider different kinetic regimes when extrapolating laboratory results to reservoir conditions. 

Key areas for future research and development in this field include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to better manage H2S production in oil and gas operations. The literature emphasizes the importance of addressing challenges such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, which are crucial for the safe and efficient handling of H2S in various stages of oil and gas production processes. This includes developing more selective and robust catalyst systems capable of efficiently converting H2S to valuable products while minimizing environmental impacts and operational risks. Future research efforts should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the complex chemical reactions involved in H2S generation and degradation, as well as on designing innovative materials and processes that can effectively manage H2S in oil and gas production scenarios.
