[1] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
[2] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
[3] "New experiments have been reported here, where aqueous SDS degradation was followed with the addition of various salts to increase the ionic strength. These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants."
[4] "Indications of neutral reactants further support a mechanism where S is oxidizing an organic species."
[5] "Alternatively, the measurements of He et al.32 for n-C16H34 at T = 360C also have been re-interpreted using an ionic strength plot (Livingston plot)."
