[1] "A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) MSR and (iii) TSR."
[2] "For TSR, it was shown that steady state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system."
[3] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
[4] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
[5] "New experiments have been reported here, where aqueous SDS degradation was followed with the addition of various salts to increase the ionic strength."
[6] "These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants."
[7] "Alternatively, the measurements of He et al.32 for n-C16H34 at T = 360C also have been re-interpreted using an ionic strength plot (Livingston plot)."
[8] "The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been discussed in terms of catalyst systems, selectivity, and conversion. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been compared in various aspects. Challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and reaction properties, have been highlighted. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include corrosiveness of the reaction environment and inherent limitations in activating C-H bonds. Catalysts often face degradation over time due to harsh reaction conditions. Strategies for improvement focus on developing more robust catalyst materials, enhancing stability through surface modifications, and optimizing reaction conditions to reduce corrosiveness.

Key areas for future research involve:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing catalysts capable of selectively activating C-H bonds without unwanted side reactions is crucial. This requires a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and identifying new catalysts that can achieve high activation efficiency.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Long-term operation of ODHP processes relies on catalysts that maintain high activity and selectivity over extended periods. Research aims to develop catalysts with improved regenerability, enabling them to withstand multiple cycles of activation and deactivation without significant loss in performance.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Streamlining the ODHP process involves refining reactor designs, optimizing operating parameters, and integrating process steps to achieve maximum efficiency. This includes improving heat and mass transfer, minimizing energy consumption, and designing reactors that can handle high throughput while maintaining high product yields.

By addressing these challenges and focusing on these areas, the efficiency and sustainability of ODHP processes can be significantly enhanced, paving the way for more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives in the petrochemical industry.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，针对催化剂系统、选择性和转化率进行了讨论。比较了过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的不同方面。这一领域面临的持续挑战包括腐蚀性和反应性质，这些特性影响着ODHP过程的稳定性和效率。未来的研究方向旨在改进C-H键激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程的效率。

ODHP过程中的主要挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性以及C-H键激活的固有局限性。催化剂经常面临由于苛刻条件导致的降解问题。改善策略集中在开发更耐腐蚀的催化剂材料、通过表面改性增强稳定性以及优化反应条件以减少腐蚀性。

未来研究的关键领域包括：

1. 改进C-H键激活：开发能够选择性地激活C-H键而不会产生副反应的催化剂至关重要。这需要对反应机制有更深的理解，并识别出能实现高激活效率的新催化剂。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：长期运行的ODHP过程依赖于能够保持高活性和选择性的催化剂。研究旨在开发具有更好再生能力的催化剂，使它们能够在多个激活和去激活周期中保持性能不变。

3. 优化反应系统：简化ODHP过程涉及改进反应器设计、优化操作参数并整合工艺步骤以实现最大效率。这包括改进热量和质量传递、减少能耗以及设计能够处理高通量同时维持高产品产率的反应器。

通过解决这些挑战并集中关注这些领域，可以显著提高ODHP过程的效率和可持续性，为更环保和经济可行的石化行业替代方案铺平道路。
