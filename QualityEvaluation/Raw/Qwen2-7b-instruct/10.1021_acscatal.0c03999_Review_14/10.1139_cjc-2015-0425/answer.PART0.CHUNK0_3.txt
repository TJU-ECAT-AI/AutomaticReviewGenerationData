[1] "The majority of produced CO2 from aquathermolysis comes from two sources: (i) carbonate minerals and (ii) various organic species."
[2] "The majority of produced CO2 for an in situ stimulation is released from carbonate mineral."
[3] "The presence of low oxidation states of sulfur, sulfide or elemental sulfur, will initiate and catalyze TSR."
[4] "The absence of a significant correlation with ionic strength, suggests that the rate limiting reaction is associated with a reaction between two neutral species."
[5] "The addition of 1:1 salts [NaCl(aq), NaBr(aq) or KCl(aq)]; , the addition of 2:1 salts [MgCl2(aq) or CaCl2(aq)]."

1. The majority of CO2 produced during aquathermolysis originates from carbonate minerals and organic species. 
2. The majority of CO2 released in situ stimulation comes from carbonate minerals.
3. Low oxidation states of sulfur, sulfide, or elemental sulfur can initiate and catalyze TSR reactions.
4. The rate limiting step in the degradation of SDS is likely associated with a reaction between two neutral species, not influenced by ionic strength.
5. Various salts were added to the SDS reactions, including NaCl, NaBr, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2, to increase ionic strength.
