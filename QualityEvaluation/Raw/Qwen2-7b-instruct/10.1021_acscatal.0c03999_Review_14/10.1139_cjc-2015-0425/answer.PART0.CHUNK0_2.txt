[1] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
[2] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
[3] "Our studies on TSR in shale type fluids are continuing, with the eventual goal of developing a kinetic model to aid producers in estimating H2S production profiles."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, various catalyst systems have been compared in terms of their performance. These systems include transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The focus is on assessing their selectivity and conversion efficiency. Challenges persist in this field, such as the corrosiveness of the reactions and the inherent properties that make C-H bond activation difficult. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Our ongoing studies on thermal sulfur reduction (TSR) in unconventional shale gas production seek to develop a kinetic model that can assist producers in predicting and managing H2S production profiles.
