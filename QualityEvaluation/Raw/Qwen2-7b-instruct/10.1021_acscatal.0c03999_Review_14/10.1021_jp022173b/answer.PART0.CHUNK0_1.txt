Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this literature highlights that the oxidized diamond-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalyst outperforms others in terms of C2H4 yield when dehydrogenating C2H6 in the presence of CO2. The C2H4 yield increases with the addition of CO2 to the reaction atmosphere. Steam, produced in the presence of CO2, plays a crucial role in maintaining catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation process. The study suggests that a higher oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are essential for achieving a high C2H4 yield. Moreover, CO2 is found to eliminate deposited carbon on the catalyst surface, maintain the higher oxidation state of chromium species, and retain the oxygen species on the diamond surface, thus optimizing the dehydrogenation process.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The literature does not provide specific details on these challenges but acknowledges their existence. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies for addressing these challenges involve developing more robust catalysts, refining reaction conditions, and exploring new catalyst supports that can withstand the harsh environment of the dehydrogenation process while maintaining high efficiency and selectivity.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，本文指出，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，利用氧化金刚石支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂在脱氢丁烷中表现出最高的C2H4产率。随着二氧化碳分压的增加，C2H4产率也随之增加。在CO2存在的气氛下产生的蒸汽对维持催化活性起着重要作用。研究发现，为了实现高C2H4产率，在脱氢过程中需要更高氧化态的铬物种以及金刚石表面的氧物种。此外，CO2被发现能够消除催化剂表面沉积的碳，并保持铬物种的高氧化状态和金刚石表面的氧物种，从而优化脱氢过程。

在这一领域持续存在的挑战包括腐蚀性和反应过程的固有特性。本文没有提供这些挑战的具体细节，但承认它们的存在。未来研究和发展的重要领域包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。针对这些挑战的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂、优化反应条件并探索能够在恶劣环境中保持高效性和选择性的同时承受脱氢过程严酷环境的新催化剂支撑材料。
