[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "C2H4 yields over this catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure."
[3] "The role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface."
[4] "Furthermore, to maintain the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 would be necessary."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The literature highlights the performance of oxidized diamond-supported chromium oxide catalysts, noting that their activity in the presence of CO2 is about three times higher than in the absence of CO2. The yield of C2H4 increases with increasing CO2 partial pressure, suggesting that CO2 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. CO2 is essential for maintaining the higher-oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the process and the inherent properties of the reactions. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to make ODHP processes more efficient and sustainable.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面取得的进步涉及各种催化剂系统的应用，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。文献强调了氧化金刚石支持的铬氧化物催化剂的作用，指出其在CO2存在的条件下的活性是CO2不存在时的三倍。C2H4的产率随着CO2分压的增加而增加，这表明CO2在脱氢过程中的关键作用。CO2对于维持金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的高氧化态至关重要，从而增强催化活性。该领域的挑战包括过程的腐蚀性以及反应本身的固有性质。未来的研究方向集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以使ODHP过程更高效、更可持续。
