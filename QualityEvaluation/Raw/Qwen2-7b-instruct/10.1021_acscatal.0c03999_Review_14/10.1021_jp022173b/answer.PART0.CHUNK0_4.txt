[1] "Recently, the surface chemistry of diamond has received much attention, and several functional groups have been introduced onto the diamond surface. 1-3 However, the limit and scope of diamond or oxidized diamond-supported catalyst have not been yet revealed. Further applications of the diamond-supported catalyst need to be explored."
[2] "Oxidized diamond has recently drawn attention as a new unique material phase as a solid carbon oxide. The diamond surface is easily oxidized by oxidative acids such as HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc. and is also oxidized with oxygen at an elevated temperature to form COC ether-type structures and CO carbonyl-type structures."
[3] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressures."
[4] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4). Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required. From the result of FT-IR, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface would also play the important role for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst."
[6] "The role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface. Furthermore, to maintain the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 would be necessary."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was evaluated. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher activity in the presence of CO2, achieving a 22.5% C2H4 yield with 87.7% selectivity. The activity of the catalyst increased with the CO2 partial pressure. H2O was produced during the reaction, suggesting that Cr2O3, acting as a solid acid catalyst, might facilitate carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. The higher-oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface were crucial for achieving a high C2H4 yield in the presence of CO2. CO2 played a dual role: eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction systems and the inherent properties of the reactions. Persistent issues involve improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Future research directions should focus on developing strategies to address these challenges. Key areas for improvement include refining catalyst design to better withstand corrosive environments, exploring methods to recycle and regenerate catalysts efficiently, and innovating reaction systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while minimizing environmental impact.

分析使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，评估了包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统的性能。氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出更高的活性，实现了22.5％的C2H4产率和87.7％的选择性。随着CO2分压的增加，催化剂的活性也有所提高。反应过程中产生H2O，表明Cr2O3作为固体酸催化剂可能促进催化剂表面的碳沉积。高铬物种的氧化态和金刚石表面的氧物种的存在对于在CO2存在下获得高C2H4产率至关重要。CO2在两种角色中发挥作用：消除催化剂表面上沉积的碳，并维持铬物种和金刚石表面的高氧化态和氧物种。 

该领域面临的挑战包括反应系统的腐蚀性和反应本身的内在性质。持续的问题涉及改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统。未来的研究方向应集中在解决这些挑战的方法上。关键改进领域包括精炼催化剂设计以更好地抵抗腐蚀环境，探索回收和再生催化剂的有效方法，以及创新反应系统以提高选择性和转化率的同时减少对环境的影响。
