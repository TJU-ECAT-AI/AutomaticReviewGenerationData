[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "In the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, C2H4 yields increased remarkably with increasing reaction temperature, and a 27.4% C2H4 yield was obtained at 973 K."
[3] "The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts."
[4] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[5] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface."
[6] "Maintaining a higher-oxidation state of the chromium species might be an important factor indicating high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2."
[7] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required."
