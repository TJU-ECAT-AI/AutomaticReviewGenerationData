1. Among the loaded-Cr2O3 catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst had the highest yield of C2H4 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2.

2. CO2 was observed to enhance the C2H4 yield over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts.

3. The presence of CO2 increased the activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst by three times compared to its activity without CO2.

4. The C2H4 yield of the catalyst increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure.

5. To achieve a high yield of C2H4 during the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that the Cr2O3 on the oxidized diamond surface should be in a higher oxidation state.

6. The presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface played an important role in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst in the presence of CO2.

7. CO2 played a role in eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation of C2H6.

8. To maintain the higher oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 was essential.

1. 在负载Cr2O3催化剂中，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在的条件下，C2H6脱氢为C2H4时表现出最高的产率。

2. CO2被观察到可以提高氧化金刚石支持的Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂的C2H4产率。

3. 氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下的活性比没有CO2时高三倍。

4. 随着CO2分压的增加，C2H4产率也相应增加。

5. 要实现C2H6脱氢为C2H4时的高产率，建议Cr2O3在氧化金刚石表面应处于更高的氧化态。

6. 碳氧物种的存在对在CO2存在的条件下使用氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3催化剂脱氢C2H6至C2H4起着重要作用。

7. CO2在脱氢C2H6过程中可能起到了清除催化剂表面沉积碳的作用。

8. 为了维持Cr2O3物种和碳氧物种在金刚石表面的更高氧化态，CO2是必要的。
