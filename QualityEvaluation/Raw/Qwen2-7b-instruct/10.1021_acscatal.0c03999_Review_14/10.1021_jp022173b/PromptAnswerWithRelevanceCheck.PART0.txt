Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this literature highlights that the oxidized diamond-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalyst outperforms others in terms of C2H4 yield when dehydrogenating C2H6 in the presence of CO2. The C2H4 yield increases with the addition of CO2 to the reaction atmosphere. Steam, produced in the presence of CO2, plays a crucial role in maintaining catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation process. The study suggests that a higher oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are essential for achieving a high C2H4 yield. Moreover, CO2 is found to eliminate deposited carbon on the catalyst surface, maintain the higher oxidation state of chromium species, and retain the oxygen species on the diamond surface, thus optimizing the dehydrogenation process.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The literature does not provide specific details on these challenges but acknowledges their existence. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies for addressing these challenges involve developing more robust catalysts, refining reaction conditions, and exploring new catalyst supports that can withstand the harsh environment of the dehydrogenation process while maintaining high efficiency and selectivity.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，本文指出，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，利用氧化金刚石支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂在脱氢丁烷中表现出最高的C2H4产率。随着二氧化碳分压的增加，C2H4产率也随之增加。在CO2存在的气氛下产生的蒸汽对维持催化活性起着重要作用。研究发现，为了实现高C2H4产率，在脱氢过程中需要更高氧化态的铬物种以及金刚石表面的氧物种。此外，CO2被发现能够消除催化剂表面沉积的碳，并保持铬物种的高氧化状态和金刚石表面的氧物种，从而优化脱氢过程。

在这一领域持续存在的挑战包括腐蚀性和反应过程的固有特性。本文没有提供这些挑战的具体细节，但承认它们的存在。未来研究和发展的重要领域包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。针对这些挑战的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂、优化反应条件并探索能够在恶劣环境中保持高效性和选择性的同时承受脱氢过程严酷环境的新催化剂支撑材料。

[1] "Recently, the surface chemistry of diamond has received much attention, and several functional groups have been introduced onto the diamond surface. 1-3 However, the limit and scope of diamond or oxidized diamond-supported catalyst have not been yet revealed. Further applications of the diamond-supported catalyst need to be explored."
[2] "Oxidized diamond has recently drawn attention as a new unique material phase as a solid carbon oxide. The diamond surface is easily oxidized by oxidative acids such as HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc. and is also oxidized with oxygen at an elevated temperature to form COC ether-type structures and CO carbonyl-type structures."
[3] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressures."
[4] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4). Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required. From the result of FT-IR, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface would also play the important role for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was evaluated. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher activity in the presence of CO2, achieving a 22.5% C2H4 yield with 87.7% selectivity. The activity of the catalyst increased with the CO2 partial pressure. H2O was produced during the reaction, suggesting that Cr2O3, acting as a solid acid catalyst, might facilitate carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. The higher-oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface were crucial for achieving a high C2H4 yield in the presence of CO2. CO2 played a dual role: eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction systems and the inherent properties of the reactions. Persistent issues involve improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Future research directions should focus on developing strategies to address these challenges. Key areas for improvement include refining catalyst design to better withstand corrosive environments, exploring methods to recycle and regenerate catalysts efficiently, and innovating reaction systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while minimizing environmental impact.
