[1] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[2] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
[3] "With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation."
[4] "The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation."

The study reveals that the particle size of Ni significantly influences the kinetic parameters, formation pathways, and selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. Smaller Ni particles (0.5 wt%) promote high CO selectivity due to their catalytic activity, while larger particles (10 wt%) favor CH4 formation. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

研究表明，Ni的颗粒大小对CO2氢化反应的动力学参数、产物形成路径和选择性有显著影响。较小的Ni颗粒（0.5 wt%）因其催化活性促进了高CO选择性，而较大的颗粒（10 wt%）则有利于CH4形成。CO2氢化作用被认为发生在Ni/SiO2表面的尖端、角落或台阶位置上。

Past research has demonstrated that sub-nanometer Pt clusters improve the efficiency of toluene oxidation catalysis. Metal particle size studies with Ni, Ru, and Pd catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation suggest that small particles and single atoms yield CO formation, whereas larger particles significantly boost CH4 production.

The turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 hydrogenation on the small Ni clusters in the 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 was notably higher than on the 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts with larger (9 nm) Ni particles. Recent studies have shown that Pt catalysts with sub-nanometer particles or single atoms exhibit exceptionally high activities in toluene oxidation, CO oxidation, and PROX reactions. Literature on the effect of metal particle size on CO2 hydrogenation with Ni, Ru, and Pd catalysts indicates that CO formation is favored on smaller particles and/or single atoms, whereas larger catalyst particles significantly increase CH4 production.

[1] "The TPD profiles and IR spectra have unambiguously indicated that the m-HCOO intermediate is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation over both the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, following the consecutive and parallel reaction pathways, respectively."
[2] "The parallel reactions at work in CO2 hydrogenation on large Ni particles might involve the initial formation of the m-HCOO intermediate and subsequent competitively hydrogenation to CO or CH4."
[3] "Notably, the decomposition of the m-HCOO intermediate to CO might be the major reaction pathway on the 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst."

The TPD profiles and IR spectra clearly show that the m-HCOO intermediate plays a crucial role in CO2 hydrogenation on both the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, following either consecutive or parallel pathways. On large Ni particles, the parallel reactions may involve the formation of the m-HCOO intermediate and subsequent hydrogenation to either CO or CH4. Remarkably, the breakdown of the m-HCOO intermediate to CO appears to be the dominant reaction pathway on the 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst.
