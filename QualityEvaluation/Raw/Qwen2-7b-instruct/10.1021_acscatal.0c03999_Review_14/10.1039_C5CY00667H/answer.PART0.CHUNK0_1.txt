In the study, the researchers investigated the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on Ni/SiO2 catalysts with different nickel loadings. They found that the reaction pathways and selectivities were significantly influenced by the particle size of the Ni catalyst. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst showed higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation, favoring the formation of CO and CH4 via a consecutive pathway. This was attributed to the low hydrogen coverage on small Ni particles, leading to the rapid formation of CO from the m-HCOO intermediate. As the Ni loading was increased to 10 wt%, the selectivity shifted towards CH4 formation, occurring through a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway. The parallel pathway involved the competitive dissociation of the m-HCOO intermediate to CO or its hydrogenation to CH4. The 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst had more active sites for hydrogen adsorption, resulting in higher hydrogen coverage and enabling the parallel pathway. The active sites identified for CO2 hydrogenation were those corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

在研究中，研究人员对Ni/SiO2催化剂上不同镍负载的催化CO2氢化进行了调查。他们发现反应途径和选择性受到Ni催化剂颗粒大小的显著影响。在低Ni负载（0.5 wt%）下，催化剂显示出更高的CO2氢化活性，有利于CO和CH4的形成通过连续途径。这归因于小Ni颗粒上的低氢覆盖率，导致从m-HCOO中间体快速形成CO。当Ni负载增加到10 wt%时，选择性转向CH4形成，通过混合连续和并行途径进行。并行途径涉及m-HCOO中间体的分解竞争产生CO或其氢化为CH4。10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂具有更多用于氢吸附的活性位点，导致更高的氢覆盖率，并使并行途径得以实现。识别出的CO2氢化活性位点是Ni/SiO2表面的尖端、角或台阶位置。
