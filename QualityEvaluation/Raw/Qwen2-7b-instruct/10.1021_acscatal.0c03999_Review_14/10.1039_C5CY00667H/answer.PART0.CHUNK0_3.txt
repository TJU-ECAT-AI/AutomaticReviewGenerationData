[1] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[2] "The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively."
[3] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
[4] "When the Ni loading was increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity switched to favor CH4 formation."
[5] "The parallel reaction pathway may involve competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate."

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been characterized by the utilization of diverse catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These systems exhibit varying performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. The performance of the catalysts is significantly influenced by their ability to activate C-H bonds and facilitate the dehydrogenation process efficiently. Transition metal catalysts, particularly those of platinum and palladium, are known for their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, whereas main group element metal oxides can offer a more cost-effective alternative.

The challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent reaction properties that can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Corrosion resistance is crucial for the longevity and reliability of the catalysts, especially when dealing with harsh reaction environments. Additionally, the optimization of reaction systems to enhance the yield of desired products and reduce byproduct formation remains a significant challenge.

For future research and development, strategies aimed at improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems are paramount. Improving C-H bond activation involves developing catalysts that can selectively cleave the C-H bonds of propane without inducing unwanted side reactions. Enhancing catalyst regenerability is crucial for practical applications, as it allows for the reuse of catalysts, reducing costs and environmental impact. Lastly, renovating reaction systems involves the design of more efficient reaction pathways that can lead to higher selectivity and yield of propane dehydrogenation products.

近年来，在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，通过过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物等不同催化剂系统的应用，已经取得了一些进展。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的性能表现各异。催化剂的选择性主要受到其激活C-H键的能力以及促进脱氢过程效率的影响。铂和钯等过渡金属催化剂因其在脱氢反应中的高活性而知名，而主族元素金属氧化物则提供了更经济的替代方案。

该领域的挑战包括反应条件的腐蚀性和内在反应特性，可能导致生成不必要的副产品。腐蚀抵抗力对于催化剂的长期稳定性和可靠性至关重要，尤其是在处理苛刻反应环境时。此外，优化反应系统以提高目标产物的产率并减少副产物形成仍然是一个重大挑战。

对于未来的研究和发展，改进C-H键激活、增强催化剂再生能力和革新反应系统是至关重要的策略。为了提高C-H键激活，需要开发能够选择性地断裂丙烷中C-H键而不引发其他副反应的催化剂。增强催化剂再生能力对于实际应用至关重要，因为它允许催化剂的重复使用，从而降低成本和环境影响。最后，通过设计更高效的反应途径，可以提高丙烷脱氢产物的选择性和产率。
