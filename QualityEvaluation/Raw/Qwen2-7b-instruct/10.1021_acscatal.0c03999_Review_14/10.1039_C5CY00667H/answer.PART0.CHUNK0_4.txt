[1] "Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been studied on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts with particular focus on the production of CO and CH4."
[2] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[3] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
[4] "With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation."
[5] "The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Different catalyst systems exhibit varying performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. For instance, at low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst provides higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation, with high CO selectivity. However, when Ni loading is increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts towards favoring CH4 formation. The primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be the sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of soft oxidants and their inherent reaction properties, which affect catalyst stability and efficiency. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. These efforts aim to overcome limitations in catalyst durability and selectivity, while also exploring innovative methodologies to increase the efficiency and environmental sustainability of ODHP reactions.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展中，涉及了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。不同的催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面表现出不同的性能。例如，在低Ni负载（0.5 wt%）的情况下，催化剂对于CO2氢化提供了较高的催化活性，具有高CO选择性。然而，当将Ni负载增加到10 wt%（约9 nm颗粒）时，选择性转向有利于CH4形成。CO2氢化的活性中心被提议为Ni/SiO2表面的尖端、角或台阶位置。

这个领域持续存在的挑战包括软氧化剂的腐蚀性和其固有的反应特性，这些因素影响催化剂的稳定性和效率。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括改进C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂再生能力，并对反应系统进行精炼以优化ODHP过程。这些努力旨在克服催化剂耐用性和选择性的局限性，同时探索创新方法来提高ODHP反应的效率和环境可持续性。
