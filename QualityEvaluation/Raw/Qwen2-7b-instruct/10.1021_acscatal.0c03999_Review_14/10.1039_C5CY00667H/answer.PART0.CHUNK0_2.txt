[1] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[2] "The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively."
[3] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
[4] "With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation."
[5] "A formate species in a monodentate configuration is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation on both Ni/ SiO2 catalysts, regardless of the Ni loading and particle size."
[6] "The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the evaluation of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is assessed based on their ability to selectively convert propane into more valuable products while minimizing byproducts and waste. Key findings highlight that the selectivity and conversion rates in ODHP are significantly influenced by the size and composition of the catalyst particles. Smaller particle sizes tend to favor the formation of certain products, whereas larger particles may promote the formation of others. 

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly concerning the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent limitations in C-H bond activation. Corrosive conditions can degrade catalysts over time, reducing their effectiveness and necessitating frequent replacements or regeneration procedures. Moreover, the optimization of C-H bond activation remains a critical area for improvement, as achieving efficient cleavage and subsequent functionalization of hydrocarbon chains requires finely tuned catalyst properties.

Future research directions aim to address these challenges by focusing on strategies to improve catalyst regenerability, develop more durable materials, and refine reaction systems. For instance, the development of catalyst supports that can withstand harsh conditions without degradation, as well as the creation of catalyst designs that facilitate easier regeneration, are key areas of interest. Additionally, exploring novel catalyst compositions and reaction conditions that enable more efficient C-H bond activation without compromising selectivity or stability is crucial for advancing ODHP processes.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面取得的进步涉及对不同催化剂系统的评估，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂的性能根据它们选择性转化丙烷并同时最小化副产品和废物的能力进行评估。主要发现显示，催化剂颗粒的大小和组成显著影响ODHP过程中的选择性和转化率。

尽管取得了这些进步，但仍存在挑战，特别是反应条件的腐蚀性以及固有的C-H键活化限制。腐蚀性条件会随着时间的推移降解催化剂，降低其有效性，需要频繁更换或再生程序。此外，优化C-H键活化仍然是一个关键领域，因为实现高效裂解和随后的功能化碳氢链需要精确调整催化剂特性。

未来的研究方向旨在解决这些挑战，通过改进催化剂的再生性、开发更耐用的材料以及优化反应系统来实现。例如，研究可以承受苛刻条件而不会降解的催化剂支撑材料，以及开发易于再生的催化剂设计是关注的重点。此外，探索新的催化剂组分和反应条件，使C-H键活化更有效，同时不损害选择性或稳定性对于推进ODHP过程至关重要。
