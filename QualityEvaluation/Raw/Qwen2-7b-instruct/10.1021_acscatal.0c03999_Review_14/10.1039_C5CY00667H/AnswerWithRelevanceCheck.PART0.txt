          [1] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
          [2] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
          [3] "With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation."
          [4] "The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation."
          [5] "The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively."
          [6] "The parallel reaction pathway may involve competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate."
          [7] "The formate species in a monodentate configuration is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation on both Ni/ SiO2 catalysts, regardless of the Ni loading and particle size."

          The large difference in nickel particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% loadings significantly impacts the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At lower Ni loading, the catalyst exhibits higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation with a preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading increases to 10 wt% (around 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface. There are two types of reaction pathways: consecutive and parallel, with the former favored by small Ni clusters and the latter by larger Ni particles. The m-HCOO intermediate undergoes competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 in the parallel pathway. A formate species in a monodentate configuration plays a crucial role in CO2 hydrogenation across Ni/SiO2 catalysts, irrespective of Ni loading and particle size.

          尼克尔颗粒大小在0.5 wt%和10 wt%之间的巨大差异显著影响了CO2氢化动力学、CO和CH4形成途径以及反应选择性。在较低的Ni负载下，催化剂表现出较高的CO2氢化活性，并倾向于CO形成。当Ni负载增加至10 wt%（大约9 nm颗粒）时，选择性转向有利于CH4。CO2氢化的活性中心被提议位于Ni/SiO2表面的尖端、角或台阶位置。有两种类型的反应途径：连续和并行，前者由较小的Ni簇优先，后者由较大的Ni颗粒主导。并行途径中的m-HCOO中间体经历竞争性分解为CO或氢化为CH4。不论Ni负载和颗粒大小如何，一种单齿配置的碳酸盐物种在Ni/SiO2催化剂上对CO2氢化起着关键作用。

          Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been explored on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, with a particular emphasis on the production of CO and CH4. The significant difference in nickel particle size between the two loadings impacts the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At a lower Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation, with a strong preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading is increased to 10 wt% (approximately 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4 formation. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are hypothesized to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.
