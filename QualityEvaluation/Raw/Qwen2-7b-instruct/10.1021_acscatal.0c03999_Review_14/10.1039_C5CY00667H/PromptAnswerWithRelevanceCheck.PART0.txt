In the study, the researchers investigated the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on Ni/SiO2 catalysts with different nickel loadings. They found that the reaction pathways and selectivities were significantly influenced by the particle size of the Ni catalyst. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst showed higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation, favoring the formation of CO and CH4 via a consecutive pathway. This was attributed to the low hydrogen coverage on small Ni particles, leading to the rapid formation of CO from the m-HCOO intermediate. As the Ni loading was increased to 10 wt%, the selectivity shifted towards CH4 formation, occurring through a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway. The parallel pathway involved the competitive dissociation of the m-HCOO intermediate to CO or its hydrogenation to CH4. The 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst had more active sites for hydrogen adsorption, resulting in higher hydrogen coverage and enabling the parallel pathway. The active sites identified for CO2 hydrogenation were those corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

在研究中，研究人员对Ni/SiO2催化剂上不同镍负载的催化CO2氢化进行了调查。他们发现反应途径和选择性受到Ni催化剂颗粒大小的显著影响。在低Ni负载（0.5 wt%）下，催化剂显示出更高的CO2氢化活性，有利于CO和CH4的形成通过连续途径。这归因于小Ni颗粒上的低氢覆盖率，导致从m-HCOO中间体快速形成CO。当Ni负载增加到10 wt%时，选择性转向CH4形成，通过混合连续和并行途径进行。并行途径涉及m-HCOO中间体的分解竞争产生CO或其氢化为CH4。10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂具有更多用于氢吸附的活性位点，导致更高的氢覆盖率，并使并行途径得以实现。识别出的CO2氢化活性位点是Ni/SiO2表面的尖端、角或台阶位置。

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the evaluation of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is assessed based on their ability to selectively convert propane into more valuable products while minimizing byproducts and waste. Key findings highlight that the selectivity and conversion rates in ODHP are significantly influenced by the size and composition of the catalyst particles. Smaller particle sizes tend to favor the formation of certain products, whereas larger particles may promote the formation of others. 

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly concerning the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent limitations in C-H bond activation. Corrosive conditions can degrade catalysts over time, reducing their effectiveness and necessitating frequent replacements or regeneration procedures. Moreover, the optimization of C-H bond activation remains a critical area for improvement, as achieving efficient cleavage and subsequent functionalization of hydrocarbon chains requires finely tuned catalyst properties.

Future research directions aim to address these challenges by focusing on strategies to improve catalyst regenerability, develop more durable materials, and refine reaction systems. For instance, the development of catalyst supports that can withstand harsh conditions without degradation, as well as the creation of catalyst designs that facilitate easier regeneration, are key areas of interest. Additionally, exploring novel catalyst compositions and reaction conditions that enable more efficient C-H bond activation without compromising selectivity or stability is crucial for advancing ODHP processes.

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been characterized by the utilization of diverse catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These systems exhibit varying performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. The performance of the catalysts is significantly influenced by their ability to activate C-H bonds and facilitate the dehydrogenation process efficiently. Transition metal catalysts, particularly those of platinum and palladium, are known for their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, whereas main group element metal oxides can offer a more cost-effective alternative.

The challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent reaction properties that can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Corrosion resistance is crucial for the longevity and reliability of the catalysts, especially when dealing with harsh reaction environments. Additionally, the optimization of reaction systems to enhance the yield of desired products and reduce byproduct formation remains a significant challenge.

For future research and development, strategies aimed at improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems are paramount. Improving C-H bond activation involves developing catalysts that can selectively cleave the C-H bonds of propane without inducing unwanted side reactions. Enhancing catalyst regenerability is crucial for practical applications, as it allows for the reuse of catalysts, reducing costs and environmental impact. Lastly, renovating reaction systems involves the design of more efficient reaction pathways that can lead to higher selectivity and yield of propane dehydrogenation products.
