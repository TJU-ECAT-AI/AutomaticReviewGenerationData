[1] "Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g. 13-21 Propene yields up to 25% were achieved."
[2] "It is well-known that nondehydrated VOx/silica materials possess octahedral coordinated VOx species, in which adsorbed water is a ligand."
[3] "Taking the difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
[4] "From this difference in the temporal profiles, it is concluded that the reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O is slower than by O2."
[5] "This assumption is indirectly supported by the recently reported results of the ODP reaction over VOx/Al2O3 50 and VOx/SiO2 51 in cofeed (O2 and C3H8 are fed together) and cyclic (O2 and C3H8 are fed separately and periodically) modes."

1. Recent studies have focused on VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials such as MCM and SBA, achieving propene yields up to 25%.
2. Nondehydrated VOx/silica materials have octahedral coordinated VOx species with adsorbed water acting as a ligand.
3. The oxidizing ability of O2 is greater than that of N2O, resulting in a higher average oxidation state of VOx species under O2 conditions compared to N2O.
4. The reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O occurs at a slower rate than by O2.
5. The results from feeding O2 and C3H8 together or periodically demonstrate indirect support for the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O.

1. 最近的研究集中在VOx聚合物支持在介孔硅基材料（MCM、SBA）上，最高可达到25%的丙烯产率。
2. 非脱水的VOx/silica材料具有八面体配合的VOx物种，在其中吸附的水充当配体。
3. O2的氧化能力大于N2O，导致在O2条件下VOx物种的平均氧化状态高于N2O条件下的状态。
4. N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化速率比O2慢。
5. 饲喂O2和C3H8一起或周期性地喂养的结果间接支持了N2O对还原VOx物种的较慢再氧化速率。
