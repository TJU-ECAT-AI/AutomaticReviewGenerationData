[1] "In this paper, we focus on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems."
[2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."
[4] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

1. The paper focuses on the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, evaluating the performance of different catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion.
2. The paper presents the results of physical and chemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials, their catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction, and the redox dynamics of VOx species.
3. The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy revealed that under C3H8N2O conditions, there is a higher degree of reduction of VOx species compared to C3H8O2 conditions.
4. Through transient analysis, the paper distinguishes the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidizing reduced VOx species; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2.
5. N2O's superior performance in ODHP is attributed to its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species, thereby inhibiting nonselective propene oxidation to COx. It also avoids producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species formed from O2.

1. 本文专注于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，比较了各种催化剂系统的性能，关注选择性和转化率。
2. 论文报告了VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48材料的物理化学表征结果、在ODP反应中的催化性能以及原位UV/vis分析中VOx物种的还原动力学。
3. 原位UV/vis光谱显示，在C3H8N2O条件下，VOx物种的还原程度高于C3H8O2条件。
4. 通过瞬态分析，论文区分了O2和N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力；N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化速度比O2慢。
5. N2O在ODHP中的优越性能归因于其降低活性氧物种表面密度的能力，从而抑制非选择性丙烯氧化为COx。此外，它避免了从O2生成非选择性吸附氧物种。
