[1] "Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."
[2] "Generally, the improving effect of the support material on catalytic performance of vanadia can be related to the following main factors: (1) supporting material helps to avoid the formation of nonselective V2O5 phase, (2) VOMe (Me is metal of the support) sites may be more selective than VOV ones, and (3) supporting material tunes acid-base properties of the resulting catalyst."
[3] "It is concluded that supported vanadium oxide catalysts are typically more selective than the unsupported bulk V2O5 material."
[4] "Moreover, VOx species can cover acidic or basic sites of the support influencing the propene selectivity upon changing their concentration."
[5] "Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
[6] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
[7] "In contrast to O2 adsorption, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species: O- or O2-, which are considered as selective ones."
[8] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been explored. Key findings highlight the benefits of using mesoporous silica-based materials as supports, which can enhance the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides. These materials often exhibit better selectivity compared to unsupported bulk V2O5. The nature of active sites on the support plays a crucial role in determining propene selectivity. The concentration of VOx species can also impact selectivity by covering acidic or basic sites on the support. Studies suggest that N2O performs better than O2 in certain conditions due to its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species, which in turn enhances propene selectivity. Unlike O2, N2O decomposes to yield mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective for ODHP reactions. Additionally, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, thus inhibiting nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

Persistent challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and managing the inherent reaction properties of the catalysts. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies to address these challenges include developing more robust catalyst materials, exploring novel reaction conditions, and employing advanced characterization techniques to better understand reaction mechanisms and optimize catalyst performance.

最近，在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究中，着重于提高选择性和转化率。各种催化剂体系，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，被探索。关键发现表明，使用介孔硅基材料作为支持可以增强钒氧化物的催化性能。这些材料通常比未支持的纯V2O5更具有选择性。支持上活性位点的性质在确定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。VOx物种的浓度也可以影响选择性，因为它可以覆盖支持上的酸性或碱性位点。研究表明，在某些条件下，N2O比O2表现更好，因为其能够降低活性氧物种表面密度，从而增强丙烯选择性。与O2不同，N2O分解产生单核氧物种，被认为是选择性的ODHP反应。此外，N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，从而抑制非选择性连续丙烯氧化到COx。 

这一领域持续的挑战包括处理腐蚀性和管理反应的固有特性。未来研究的方向集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。应对这些挑战的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料、探索新的反应条件，并采用先进的表征技术更好地理解反应机制并优化催化剂性能。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown improved selectivity and conversion with various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The literature highlights that nitrogen dioxide (N2O) outperforms oxygen (O2) as a soft oxidant in ODHP processes over vanadia-based catalysts. N2O facilitates higher reduction degree of vanadium oxide species, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and suppression of nonselective propene oxidation to COx. This is attributed to the slower reoxidation capability of N2O compared to O2, preventing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze consecutive propene oxidation. Future research aims to optimize ODHP processes by improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to address challenges such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究中，各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）表现出改善的选择性和转化率。文献表明，氮氧化物（N2O）作为软氧化剂，在使用范德华催化剂的ODHP过程中优于氧气（O2）。N2O能够使钒氧化物种的还原程度更高，从而提高丙烯选择性并抑制非选择性丙烯氧化为COx。这归因于N2O的再氧化能力较慢，与O2相比，防止形成催化连续丙烯氧化为COx的非选择性吸附氧物种。未来研究旨在通过改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统来解决挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应特性。

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature emphasizes the superior performance of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) over oxygen (O2) in terms of selectivity and conversion when used over various catalyst systems. Specifically, N2O facilitates higher reduction levels of vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and suppression of non-selective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O compared to O2, and the absence of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species formed from O2 that can catalyze undesired reactions.
