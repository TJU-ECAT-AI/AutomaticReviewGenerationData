[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
[2] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."
[3] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature emphasizes the superior performance of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) over oxygen (O2) in terms of selectivity and conversion when used over various catalyst systems. Specifically, N2O facilitates higher reduction levels of vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and suppression of non-selective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O compared to O2, and the absence of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species formed from O2 that can catalyze undesired reactions. Future research directions include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

分析最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面的进展，文献强调氮氧化物（N2O）与氧气（O2）相比，在各种催化剂系统中表现出更好的选择性和转化率。特别是，N2O能够促进VOx物种的更高还原水平，从而提高丙烯选择性并抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化到COx。这归因于N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，以及从O2形成的选择性较低的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化不希望的反应。未来的研究方向包括改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以优化ODHP过程。
