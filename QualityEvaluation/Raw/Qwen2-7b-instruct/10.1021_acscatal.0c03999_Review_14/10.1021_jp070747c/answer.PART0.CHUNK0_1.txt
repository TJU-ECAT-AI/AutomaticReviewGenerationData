[1] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."
[2] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[3] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown improved selectivity and conversion with various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The literature highlights that nitrogen dioxide (N2O) outperforms oxygen (O2) as a soft oxidant in ODHP processes over vanadia-based catalysts. N2O facilitates higher reduction degree of vanadium oxide species, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and suppression of nonselective propene oxidation to COx. This is attributed to the slower reoxidation capability of N2O compared to O2, preventing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze consecutive propene oxidation. Future research aims to optimize ODHP processes by improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to address challenges such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究中，各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）表现出改善的选择性和转化率。文献表明，氮氧化物（N2O）作为软氧化剂，在使用范德华催化剂的ODHP过程中优于氧气（O2）。N2O能够使钒氧化物种的还原程度更高，从而提高丙烯选择性并抑制非选择性丙烯氧化为COx。这归因于N2O的再氧化能力较慢，与O2相比，防止形成催化连续丙烯氧化为COx的非选择性吸附氧物种。未来研究旨在通过改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统来解决挑战，如腐蚀性和固有反应特性。
