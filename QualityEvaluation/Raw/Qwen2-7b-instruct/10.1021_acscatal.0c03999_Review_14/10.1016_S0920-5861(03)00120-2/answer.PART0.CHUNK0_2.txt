<p>The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation.</p>
<p>Our work is based on the well established fact that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface of oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions could modify strongly the surface properties of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The aim of the present contribution is to shed light on these aspects. It concerns the effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O,in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Two arguments point to an oxidating role of CO2:</p>
<p>An attempt to detect CO production resulting from the dissociative adsorption of CO2 was made. Regarding the sensibility of our equipment, no carbon oxide was detected.</p>
<p>These results show unquestionably that CO2 is able to oxidise propane to propene.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these results are a good basis to explain the higher performances obtained by oxidising butane to maleic anhydride in presence of CO2.</p>
<p>When the temperature is low (673 K), an increase in the propene formation is observed when adding 3% CO2. This indicates that probably, under these conditions, the selective oxidation of propane is favoured.</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, molybdenum works in a more reduced state (Table 3).</p>
<p>It could be suggested that N2O limits the oxidation rate of the catalysts by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 on their surface.</p>
<p>This proposed mechanism of inhibition seems to explain correctly the results observed when 300 ppm of N2O is added in the feed.</p>
<p>The nature of the oxygen species formed on the surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxygen (named O) could participate directly as oxidant producing oxygenated products or more precisely propene.</p>
