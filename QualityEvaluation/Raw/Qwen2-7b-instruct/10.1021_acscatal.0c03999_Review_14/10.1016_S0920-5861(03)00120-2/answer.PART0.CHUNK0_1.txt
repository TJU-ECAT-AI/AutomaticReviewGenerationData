[1] "The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation."
[2] "It will be demonstrated that CO2 and N2O are able to modify the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction and that the dissociation of both dopes on the surface of the catalyst have to be taken into account to explain the catalytic performances in their presence."
[3] "Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2."
[4] "In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O, have shown promising improvements in catalyst performance. These gases, when introduced into the feedstock, are capable of modifying the chemical state of active sites on catalysts like NiMoO4. Specifically, CO2 enhances the oxidation state of molybdenum on the catalyst surface, leading to increased conversion and selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) derived from CO2 dissociation, which acts as a more potent oxidant than O2. On the other hand, N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, thus reducing the formation of non-selective oxygen species and controlling the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in increased selectivity to propene and reduced oxygen consumption. These findings challenge the common belief that CO2 is inert in the reaction, highlighting its active role in modifying catalyst selectivity.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and the inherent properties of the reaction. Strategies for future research and development should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize the ODHP processes. Improvements in catalyst stability and selectivity, along with the development of more efficient reaction conditions, are key areas for future investigation.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用软氧化剂，如CO2和N2O的最新进展显示了催化剂性能的显著提升。这些气体在引入反应物流中时，能够改变NiMoO4等催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。具体而言，CO2通过提高催化剂表面钼的氧化态，增强了丙烷的转化率和选择性。这一效果是通过CO2分解在NiMoO4表面形成的吸附氧物种（O(a)）实现的，这种物种作为比O2更强大的氧化剂作用于催化剂表面。另一方面，N2O抑制了O2的吸附，从而减少了非选择性氧物种的形成，并控制了催化剂的氧化速率。这导致了丙烯选择性的增加和氧气消耗的减少。这些发现挑战了CO2在反应中被认为是惰性的普遍看法，强调了其在改变催化剂选择性方面的积极作用。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和反应本身的固有特性。未来研究与开发的关键策略应集中在提高C-H键的活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。提高催化剂稳定性、选择性和开发更高效的反应条件是未来调查的重点领域。
