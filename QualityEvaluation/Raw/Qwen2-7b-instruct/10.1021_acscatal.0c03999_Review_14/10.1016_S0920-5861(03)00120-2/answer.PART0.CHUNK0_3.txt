Catalysts containing less oxidised sites work better than fully oxidised catalysts. The degree of reduction of the catalytic sites, thus their selectivity, can be controlled by adding N2O in the feed. In other words, N2O creates or modulates, during the reaction,selective sites on the surface of the NiMoO4.

Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2. The stronger oxidating character of O(a) is also consistent with the lower selectivity of the process (oxidation of selective products) and with the lower O2 consumption (as part of the oxygen atoms come from CO2 and no more only from O2). A crucial implication of our results is that, contrary to what it is believed, CO2 is not inert in the reaction. It is not only a non-selective product but it also modifies, via O(a),the selectivity of the catalyst.

在反应条件下，CO2和N2O都能成功地改变NiMoO4活性位点的化学状态。CO2通过在催化剂表面形成氧物种（O(a)）来增加钼的氧化状态。这种氧化过程通过CO2在NiMoO4表面的解离发生。O(a)作为氧化剂比O2更有效。O(a)更强的氧化性质也与选择性较低的过程（选择性产品的氧化）以及较低的O2消耗（部分氧原子来自CO2而非仅来自O2）一致。我们的结果的一个重要推论是，与人们的看法相反，CO2并非无活性产物，它不仅是一个非选择性产物，还能通过O(a)修改催化剂的选择性。
