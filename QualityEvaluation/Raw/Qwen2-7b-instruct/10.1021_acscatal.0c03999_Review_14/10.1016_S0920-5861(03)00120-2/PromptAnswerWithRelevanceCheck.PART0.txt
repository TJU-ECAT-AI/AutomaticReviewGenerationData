Catalysts containing less oxidised sites work better than fully oxidised catalysts. The degree of reduction of the catalytic sites, thus their selectivity, can be controlled by adding N2O in the feed. In other words, N2O creates or modulates, during the reaction,selective sites on the surface of the NiMoO4.

N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts.

The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.

The nature of the oxygen species formed on the surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.

Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxygen (named O) could participate directly as oxidant producing oxygenated products or more precisely propene.

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts are optimized for selectivity and conversion in the ODHP process. For instance, the introduction of N2O as a soft oxidant modifies the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 catalysts, leading to increased selectivity and reduced consumption of oxygen. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2 on the catalyst surface, thereby controlling the oxidation rate and creating selective sites on the surface of the catalyst. The dissociated oxygen species from N2O can also participate directly as an oxidant, producing oxygenated products. However, persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties of the process. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes. 

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction media and the complex nature of the ODHP reaction itself, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. The optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions is crucial to overcome these challenges. Strategies for improvement include developing more robust catalyst materials, refining the catalyst preparation methods, and exploring novel reaction mechanisms that reduce energy consumption and enhance selectivity. Additionally, there is a need for the development of integrated reaction systems that can efficiently separate and recycle valuable products, while minimizing waste generation. These advancements aim to make ODHP processes more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，涉及到使用过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物等催化剂系统。这些催化剂在ODHP过程中优化了选择性和转化率。例如，将N2O用作软氧化剂可以修改NiMoO4催化剂活性位点的化学状态，导致提高选择性并减少氧气消耗。N2O抑制了催化剂表面的O2吸附，从而控制了氧化速率，并在NiMoO4催化剂表面上创建或调控了选择性位点。N2O分解产生的氧物种也可以直接作为氧化剂，产生氧化产物。然而，该领域持续面临的挑战包括腐蚀性和反应本身的固有性质。未来的研究方向集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以实现更高效的ODHP过程。 

挑战包括反应介质的腐蚀性和ODHP反应本身的复杂性，这可能导致不希望的副反应。催化剂优化和反应条件的改进对于克服这些挑战至关重要。改进策略包括开发更耐腐蚀的催化剂材料、改进催化剂制备方法以及探索减少能耗并提高选择性的新型反应机制。此外，还需要开发集成反应系统，以有效地分离和回收有价值的产物，同时最小化废物生成。这些进步旨在使ODHP过程更具经济性和环境友好性。

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O, have shown promising improvements in catalyst performance. These gases, when introduced into the feedstock, are capable of modifying the chemical state of active sites on catalysts like NiMoO4. Specifically, CO2 enhances the oxidation state of molybdenum on the catalyst surface, leading to increased conversion and selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) derived from CO2 dissociation, which acts as a more potent oxidant than O2. On the other hand, N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, thus reducing the formation of non-selective oxygen species and controlling the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in increased selectivity to propene and reduced oxygen consumption. These findings challenge the common belief that CO2 is inert in the reaction, highlighting its active role in modifying catalyst selectivity.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and the inherent properties of the reaction. Strategies for future research and development should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize the ODHP processes. Improvements in catalyst stability and selectivity, along with the development of more efficient reaction conditions, are key areas for future investigation.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用软氧化剂，如CO2和N2O的最新进展显示了催化剂性能的显著提升。这些气体在引入反应物流中时，能够改变NiMoO4等催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。具体而言，CO2通过提高催化剂表面钼的氧化态，增强了丙烷的转化率和选择性。这一效果是通过CO2分解在NiMoO4表面形成的吸附氧物种（O(a)）实现的，这种物种作为比O2更强大的氧化剂作用于催化剂表面。另一方面，N2O抑制了O2的吸附，从而减少了非选择性氧物种的形成，并控制了催化剂的氧化速率。这导致了丙烯选择性的增加和氧气消耗的减少。这些发现挑战了CO2在反应中被认为是惰性的普遍看法，强调了其在改变催化剂选择性方面的积极作用。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和反应本身的固有特性。未来研究与开发的关键策略应集中在提高C-H键的活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。提高催化剂稳定性、选择性和开发更高效的反应条件是未来调查的重点领域。

<p>The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation.</p>
<p>Our work is based on the well established fact that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface of oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions could modify strongly the surface properties of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The aim of the present contribution is to shed light on these aspects. It concerns the effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O,in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Two arguments point to an oxidating role of CO2:</p>
<p>An attempt to detect CO production resulting from the dissociative adsorption of CO2 was made. Regarding the sensibility of our equipment, no carbon oxide was detected.</p>
<p>These results show unquestionably that CO2 is able to oxidise propane to propene.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these results are a good basis to explain the higher performances obtained by oxidising butane to maleic anhydride in presence of CO2.</p>
<p>When the temperature is low (673 K), an increase in the propene formation is observed when adding 3% CO2. This indicates that probably, under these conditions, the selective oxidation of propane is favoured.</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, molybdenum works in a more reduced state (Table 3).</p>
<p>It could be suggested that N2O limits the oxidation rate of the catalysts by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 on their surface.</p>
<p>This proposed mechanism of inhibition seems to explain correctly the results observed when 300 ppm of N2O is added in the feed.</p>

Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2. The stronger oxidating character of O(a) is also consistent with the lower selectivity of the process (oxidation of selective products) and with the lower O2 consumption (as part of the oxygen atoms come from CO2 and no more only from O2). A crucial implication of our results is that, contrary to what it is believed, CO2 is not inert in the reaction. It is not only a non-selective product but it also modifies, via O(a),the selectivity of the catalyst.

在反应条件下，CO2和N2O都能成功地改变NiMoO4活性位点的化学状态。CO2通过在催化剂表面形成氧物种（O(a)）来增加钼的氧化状态。这种氧化过程通过CO2在NiMoO4表面的解离发生。O(a)作为氧化剂比O2更有效。O(a)更强的氧化性质也与选择性较低的过程（选择性产品的氧化）以及较低的O2消耗（部分氧原子来自CO2而非仅来自O2）一致。我们的结果的一个重要推论是，与人们的看法相反，CO2并非无活性产物，它不仅是一个非选择性产物，还能通过O(a)修改催化剂的选择性。

最近，使用软氧化剂如二氧化碳和氮氧化物在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中对NiMoO4催化剂活性位点化学状态进行改性方面取得了进展。二氧化碳通过表面NiMoO4上的二氧化碳解离形成氧物种（O(a)），进而提高钼（Mo）的氧化态。这些物种比氧气更具有氧化活性。相反，氮氧化物通过抑制氧气的吸附来限制氧化速率，使催化位点处于还原状态。这一机制允许氮氧化物限制非选择性氧物种的形成并控制氧化速率。此外，氮氧化物有可能直接作为氧化剂参与反应，可能有助于解释观察到的反应过程效果。
