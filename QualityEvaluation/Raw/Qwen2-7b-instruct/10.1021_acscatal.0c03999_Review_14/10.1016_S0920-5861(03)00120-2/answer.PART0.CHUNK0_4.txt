[1] "Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2."
[2] "In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[3] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O, have revealed their ability to modify the chemical state of active sites on NiMoO4 catalysts. CO2 increases the oxidation state of molybdenum (Mo) at the surface of the catalyst through the formation of oxygen species (O(a)) upon dissociation. These species are more active as oxidants than oxygen (O2). Conversely, N2O limits the oxidation rate of catalysts by inhibiting the adsorption of O2, leading to a more reduced state of the catalytic sites. This mechanism allows N2O to limit the formation of non-selective oxygen species and control the oxidation rate. Additionally, N2O could potentially participate directly as an oxidant, possibly contributing to the observed effects on the reaction process.

最近，使用软氧化剂如二氧化碳和氮氧化物在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中对NiMoO4催化剂活性位点化学状态进行改性方面取得了进展。二氧化碳通过表面NiMoO4上的二氧化碳解离形成氧物种（O(a)），进而提高钼（Mo）的氧化态。这些物种比氧气更具有氧化活性。相反，氮氧化物通过抑制氧气的吸附来限制氧化速率，使催化位点处于还原状态。这一机制允许氮氧化物限制非选择性氧物种的形成并控制氧化速率。此外，氮氧化物有可能直接作为氧化剂参与反应，可能有助于解释观察到的反应过程效果。

The persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent properties of the reaction itself. Corrosiveness can damage the catalysts and lead to deactivation over time, requiring frequent regeneration or replacement. Additionally, the complex nature of the reaction system often necessitates optimization to achieve efficient and selective conversion of propane to propene. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are key areas for future research and development. This includes exploring new catalyst materials with improved stability and activity, developing advanced reaction conditions that minimize corrosion and maximize selectivity, and integrating process intensification techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
