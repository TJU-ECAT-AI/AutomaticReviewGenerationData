Catalysts containing less oxidised sites work better than fully oxidised catalysts. The degree of reduction of the catalytic sites, thus their selectivity, can be controlled by adding N2O in the feed. In other words, N2O creates or modulates, during the reaction,selective sites on the surface of the NiMoO4.

N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts.

The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.

The nature of the oxygen species formed on the surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.

Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxygen (named O) could participate directly as oxidant producing oxygenated products or more precisely propene.

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These catalysts are optimized for selectivity and conversion in the ODHP process. For instance, the introduction of N2O as a soft oxidant modifies the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 catalysts, leading to increased selectivity and reduced consumption of oxygen. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2 on the catalyst surface, thereby controlling the oxidation rate and creating selective sites on the surface of the catalyst. The dissociated oxygen species from N2O can also participate directly as an oxidant, producing oxygenated products. However, persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties of the process. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes. 

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction media and the complex nature of the ODHP reaction itself, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. The optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions is crucial to overcome these challenges. Strategies for improvement include developing more robust catalyst materials, refining the catalyst preparation methods, and exploring novel reaction mechanisms that reduce energy consumption and enhance selectivity. Additionally, there is a need for the development of integrated reaction systems that can efficiently separate and recycle valuable products, while minimizing waste generation. These advancements aim to make ODHP processes more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，涉及到使用过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物等催化剂系统。这些催化剂在ODHP过程中优化了选择性和转化率。例如，将N2O用作软氧化剂可以修改NiMoO4催化剂活性位点的化学状态，导致提高选择性并减少氧气消耗。N2O抑制了催化剂表面的O2吸附，从而控制了氧化速率，并在NiMoO4催化剂表面上创建或调控了选择性位点。N2O分解产生的氧物种也可以直接作为氧化剂，产生氧化产物。然而，该领域持续面临的挑战包括腐蚀性和反应本身的固有性质。未来的研究方向集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以实现更高效的ODHP过程。 

挑战包括反应介质的腐蚀性和ODHP反应本身的复杂性，这可能导致不希望的副反应。催化剂优化和反应条件的改进对于克服这些挑战至关重要。改进策略包括开发更耐腐蚀的催化剂材料、改进催化剂制备方法以及探索减少能耗并提高选择性的新型反应机制。此外，还需要开发集成反应系统，以有效地分离和回收有价值的产物，同时最小化废物生成。这些进步旨在使ODHP过程更具经济性和环境友好性。
