Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, this study compares the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Notably, FeZSM-5 displays exceptional resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA undergoes rapid and complete deactivation. 

FeZSM-5 and FeBEA showcase significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. In terms of deactivation rates, ex-H-ZSM-5 exhibits a higher activity and slower deactivation rate than ex-H-BEA, echoing the results observed in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA.

The study underscores the critical role of iron in the reaction, with ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA demonstrating notably higher C3H8 and N2O conversions than ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. 

The enhanced deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to differences in iron constitution and the unique porous structure of FeZSM-5, which includes mesopores resulting from dealumination during steam treatment. 

These findings highlight the importance of iron content, distribution, and the zeolite framework's structure in determining the efficiency and longevity of catalysts in ODHP processes. Future research directions should focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

在使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，最近的研究比较了各种催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的性能，在选择性和转化率方面进行了对比。值得注意的是，FeZSM-5表现出显著的抗失活能力，而FeBEA则经历了快速且完全的失活。

与商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA催化剂相比，FeZSM-5和FeBEA具有更高的初始丙烯产率，尽管它们的铁含量仅为后者的30至40倍。在失活率方面，ex-H-ZSM-5的活性和失活速率高于ex-H-BEA，这与ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的结果相吻合。

研究强调了铁在反应中的关键作用，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的C3H8和N2O转化率明显高于ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA。

蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5在ODHP中对N2O的高抗失活性可能归因于两种催化剂中铁构成的差异以及FeZSM-5独特的多孔结构，该结构包含在蒸汽处理过程中形成的介孔。

这些发现突出了铁含量、分布以及沸石骨架结构在确定ODHP过程催化剂效率和寿命中的重要性。未来的研究方向应集中在增强C-H键激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程上。

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have demonstrated the efficiency of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have shown remarkable catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, a significant challenge in this field is the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which can be reversed through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. Iron plays a crucial role in the reaction, as evidenced by the higher conversion rates observed in Fe-zeolites compared to their non-iron counterparts. The initial propene yield is influenced by the iron content and form, but the deactivation behavior varies among different catalysts. For instance, FeZSM-5 exhibits better resistance to deactivation, possibly due to its unique iron constitution and open structure, which facilitates better transport properties and active site accessibility. Future research should focus on strategies to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency and reduce coke formation.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of soft oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes. Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion. They enable the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K with space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. 

However, the field faces persistent challenges, notably corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The deactivation of catalysts through coke formation is a significant hurdle, as coke blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, reducing propene yield. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA.

The key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation. Moreover, understanding the role of iron species and their location in the deactivation process is crucial for developing more robust catalysts. The research also needs to explore ways to mitigate corrosion and optimize reaction conditions to ensure the efficiency and longevity of the catalysts.

最近的研究表明，使用软氧化剂如N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程的有效性。主要组分金属氧化物，尤其是铁沸石，已被发现是这种转换的高效催化剂。它们能够同时利用廉价且丰富的丙烷和有害环境气体N2O，实现高达25%的丙烯产率，在723 K下，空间速度为400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat。

然而，该领域面临持续的挑战，主要是腐蚀和反应过程本身的固有性质。催化剂通过焦炭形成而失活是一个重大的障碍，因为焦炭堵塞了沸石孔系统中的活性反应位点，降低了丙烯产率。与完全失活的ex-FeBEA相比，ex-FeZSM-5在ODHP过程中表现出显著的抗失活能力，其焦炭含量是ex-Fe-silicalite和ex-FeBEA的3倍。

未来研究和发展的重要领域包括提高C-H键激活策略、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。通过开发具有更大开放结构的催化剂、通过碱性介质脱硅来创建微孔，以及探索更开放的孔架构，有可能减少焦炭堵塞孔隙并促进更好的反应物和产物传输，从而减轻失活。此外，深入了解铁物种及其在失活过程中的位置对于开发更稳定的催化剂至关重要。研究还需要探索减少腐蚀和优化反应条件的方法，以确保催化剂的效率和寿命。

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have led to the development of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these systems is characterized by selectivity and conversion rates, with Fe-zeolites demonstrating exceptional catalytic activity for the ODHP of propane with N2O. These catalysts can achieve propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K, showcasing their efficiency and suitability for valorizing inexpensive propane and harmful N2O. Despite the high initial activity, these catalysts can be regenerated effectively through oxygen treatment, highlighting their durability and practical applicability.

Challenges in the field of ODHP, particularly corrosion resistance and intrinsic reaction properties, remain persistent issues. The nature and location of active extraframework iron species are crucial in determining the catalyst's deactivation behavior, which varies significantly among different catalyst systems. For instance, FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation compared to FeBEA, despite having a higher initial performance. This difference can be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework. 

Key areas for future research and development include enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might involve refining the catalyst design to better facilitate the reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. Additionally, the integration of advanced analytical techniques, such as the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), can provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and catalyst performance, guiding the development of more effective and sustainable catalyst systems for ODHP.

The document highlights that FeZSM-5 offers a distinct advantage over FeBEA in terms of deactivation resistance, possibly due to its unique iron constitution and porosity. This suggests that the presence of iron as active oligonuclear species in FeZSM-5 plays a crucial role in promoting oxygen desorption, thereby enhancing its activity in direct N2O decomposition. The higher conversion of N2O over FeZSM-5 compared to Fe-silicalite, as depicted in Figure 2, underscores the importance of the zeolite framework's structure in determining the catalyst's performance. Future research might aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this enhanced activity and explore ways to extend the deactivation resistance of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O, potentially through the optimization of iron species or the introduction of novel zeolite architectures.
