[1] "Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]."
[2] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[3] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
[4] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex-FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly focusing on the performance of catalyst systems involving transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, highlight the efficiency of FeZSM-5 in comparison to other catalysts. It demonstrates remarkable resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA exhibits a very rapid and complete deactivation. There's a notable parallel in the activity and deactivation rates between ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA, as well as ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, suggesting a significant impact of catalyst constitution with respect to iron content and location. The enhanced activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O can be attributed to the presence of a larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear species, facilitating more effective oxygen desorption.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，针对过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物催化剂系统的性能进行了研究，发现FeZSM-5表现出卓越的催化性能。它对失活表现出显著的抵抗力，而FeBEA则显示出非常快速且完全的失活。在铁含量和位置方面，ex-H-ZSM-5与ex-H-BEA以及ex-FeZSM-5与ex-FeBEA之间存在明显的平行活动性和失活率，这表明催化剂构成对铁含量和位置有重要影响。ex-FeZSM-5在使用N2O进行ODHP时的增强活性可归因于铁作为活性寡核物种的较大比例，更有效地促进了氧的释放。
