[1] "Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]."
[2] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
[4] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
[5] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[6] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."
[7] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, this study compares the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Notably, FeZSM-5 displays exceptional resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA undergoes rapid and complete deactivation. 

FeZSM-5 and FeBEA showcase significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. In terms of deactivation rates, ex-H-ZSM-5 exhibits a higher activity and slower deactivation rate than ex-H-BEA, echoing the results observed in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA.

The study underscores the critical role of iron in the reaction, with ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA demonstrating notably higher C3H8 and N2O conversions than ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. 

The enhanced deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to differences in iron constitution and the unique porous structure of FeZSM-5, which includes mesopores resulting from dealumination during steam treatment. 

These findings highlight the importance of iron content, distribution, and the zeolite framework's structure in determining the efficiency and longevity of catalysts in ODHP processes. Future research directions should focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

在使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，最近的研究比较了各种催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的性能，在选择性和转化率方面进行了对比。值得注意的是，FeZSM-5表现出显著的抗失活能力，而FeBEA则经历了快速且完全的失活。

与商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA催化剂相比，FeZSM-5和FeBEA具有更高的初始丙烯产率，尽管它们的铁含量仅为后者的30至40倍。在失活率方面，ex-H-ZSM-5的活性和失活速率高于ex-H-BEA，这与ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的结果相吻合。

研究强调了铁在反应中的关键作用，ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的C3H8和N2O转化率明显高于ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA。

蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5在ODHP中对N2O的高抗失活性可能归因于两种催化剂中铁构成的差异以及FeZSM-5独特的多孔结构，该结构包含在蒸汽处理过程中形成的介孔。

这些发现突出了铁含量、分布以及沸石骨架结构在确定ODHP过程催化剂效率和寿命中的重要性。未来的研究方向应集中在增强C-H键激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程上。
