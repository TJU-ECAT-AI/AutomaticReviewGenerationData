[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[2] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[3] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[4] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account."
[5] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have demonstrated the efficiency of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have shown remarkable catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, a significant challenge in this field is the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which can be reversed through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. Iron plays a crucial role in the reaction, as evidenced by the higher conversion rates observed in Fe-zeolites compared to their non-iron counterparts. The initial propene yield is influenced by the iron content and form, but the deactivation behavior varies among different catalysts. For instance, FeZSM-5 exhibits better resistance to deactivation, possibly due to its unique iron constitution and open structure, which facilitates better transport properties and active site accessibility. Future research should focus on strategies to enhance C-H bond activation, improve catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency and reduce coke formation.

近期，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展表明，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统的效率。铁沸石，尤其是FeZSM-5和FeBEA，显示出惊人的催化活性，在723 K时可实现高达25%的丙烯产率。然而，该领域的一个重大挑战是催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活，可以通过在773 K的氧气中再生来恢复其活性。铁在反应中起着关键作用，从Fe-沸石中的更高转化率可以看出，与非铁催化剂相比。初始丙烯产率受到铁含量和形式的影响，但不同催化剂的失活行为存在差异。例如，FeZSM-5对失活具有更好的抵抗力，这可能归因于其独特的铁构成和开放结构，这些结构有助于改善运输性质和活性位点可接近性。未来的研究应集中在提高C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统上，以最大化ODHP效率并减少焦炭形成。
