[1] "Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an interesting process for the valorization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."
[3] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[4] "However, the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[5] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[6] "The calcined samples contain the majority of iron in tetrahedral positions of the zeolite framework [13,14]."
[7] "Ac- tivation of N2O, the first step in ODHP as well as in other N2O conversions [5,19,20], requires coordination of atomic oxygen to the active site, which is impossible for framework iron."
[8] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."
[9] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
[10] "The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior."
[11] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[12] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
[13] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account."
[14] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[15] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."
[16] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."
[17] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have led to the development of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these systems is characterized by selectivity and conversion rates, with Fe-zeolites demonstrating exceptional catalytic activity for the ODHP of propane with N2O. These catalysts can achieve propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K, showcasing their efficiency and suitability for valorizing inexpensive propane and harmful N2O. Despite the high initial activity, these catalysts can be regenerated effectively through oxygen treatment, highlighting their durability and practical applicability.

Challenges in the field of ODHP, particularly corrosion resistance and intrinsic reaction properties, remain persistent issues. The nature and location of active extraframework iron species are crucial in determining the catalyst's deactivation behavior, which varies significantly among different catalyst systems. For instance, FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation compared to FeBEA, despite having a higher initial performance. This difference can be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework. 

Key areas for future research and development include enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might involve refining the catalyst design to better facilitate the reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. Additionally, the integration of advanced analytical techniques, such as the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), can provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and catalyst performance, guiding the development of more effective and sustainable catalyst systems for ODHP.

The document highlights that FeZSM-5 offers a distinct advantage over FeBEA in terms of deactivation resistance, possibly due to its unique iron constitution and porosity. This suggests that the presence of iron as active oligonuclear species in FeZSM-5 plays a crucial role in promoting oxygen desorption, thereby enhancing its activity in direct N2O decomposition. The higher conversion of N2O over FeZSM-5 compared to Fe-silicalite, as depicted in Figure 2, underscores the importance of the zeolite framework's structure in determining the catalyst's performance. Future research might aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this enhanced activity and explore ways to extend the deactivation resistance of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O, potentially through the optimization of iron species or the introduction of novel zeolite architectures.

近期，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的进展显著。这些系统的性能由选择性和转化率决定，铁沸石表现出出色的催化活性，用于用N2O氧化脱氢丙烷。在723 K时，这些催化剂可以实现高达25%的丙烯产量，这表明它们在廉价的丙烷和有害的N2O中具有良好的价值化能力。尽管初始活性很高，但这些催化剂可以通过氧气处理有效地再生，突显出其耐用性和实用性。

ODHP领域的挑战，特别是耐腐蚀性和固有反应特性，仍然是持久的问题。活性额外框架铁物种的存在及其在沸石骨架中的位置对于确定催化剂的失活行为至关重要，不同催化剂体系的失活行为差异显著。例如，FeZSM-5与FeBEA相比，显示出惊人的失活抵抗力，尽管其初始性能较高。这种差异可能归因于Zeolite骨架的独特铁构成和孔隙结构。 

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括增强C-H键激活、提高催化剂可再生性以及优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程的效率。可能的策略包括改进催化剂设计以更好地促进反应动力学，开发更坚固的催化剂载体，并探索减少焦炭形成并增强产品选择性的替代反应条件。此外，高级分析技术的应用，如锥形元件振动微天平（TEOM），可以提供对失活机制和催化剂性能的深入见解，指导开发更有效和可持续的ODHP催化剂系统。

文献指出，FeZSM-5在N2O分解直接氧化方面相对于Fe-silicalite展现出较高的活性优势，这可能是由于FeZSM-5中作为活性寡核铁物种的铁的存在促进了氧解离，从而增强了其活性。图2中FeZSM-5与Fe-silicalite在N2O转化方面的对比显示了沸石骨架结构在确定催化剂性能中的重要性。未来研究可能旨在阐明这一增强活性的具体机制，并探索通过优化铁物种或引入新型沸石架构来延长Fe-沸石在ODHP与N2O过程中的失活抵抗力的可能性。
