2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O was carried out at 723 K in a mixture of 100 mbar C3H8 and 100 mbar N2O in He at a total pressure of 2 bar and a weight-hourly space velocity (WSHV) of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The product gases were analyzed by an online micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns.
3. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat.
4. Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
5. The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs.
6. The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation behavior too.
7. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of soft oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes. Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion. They enable the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K with space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. 

However, the field faces persistent challenges, notably corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The deactivation of catalysts through coke formation is a significant hurdle, as coke blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, reducing propene yield. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA.

The key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation. Moreover, understanding the role of iron species and their location in the deactivation process is crucial for developing more robust catalysts. The research also needs to explore ways to mitigate corrosion and optimize reaction conditions to ensure the efficiency and longevity of the catalysts.

最近的研究表明，使用软氧化剂如N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程的有效性。主要组分金属氧化物，尤其是铁沸石，已被发现是这种转换的高效催化剂。它们能够同时利用廉价且丰富的丙烷和有害环境气体N2O，实现高达25%的丙烯产率，在723 K下，空间速度为400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat。

然而，该领域面临持续的挑战，主要是腐蚀和反应过程本身的固有性质。催化剂通过焦炭形成而失活是一个重大的障碍，因为焦炭堵塞了沸石孔系统中的活性反应位点，降低了丙烯产率。与完全失活的ex-FeBEA相比，ex-FeZSM-5在ODHP过程中表现出显著的抗失活能力，其焦炭含量是ex-Fe-silicalite和ex-FeBEA的3倍。

未来研究和发展的重要领域包括提高C-H键激活策略、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。通过开发具有更大开放结构的催化剂、通过碱性介质脱硅来创建微孔，以及探索更开放的孔架构，有可能减少焦炭堵塞孔隙并促进更好的反应物和产物传输，从而减轻失活。此外，深入了解铁物种及其在失活过程中的位置对于开发更稳定的催化剂至关重要。研究还需要探索减少腐蚀和优化反应条件的方法，以确保催化剂的效率和寿命。
