[1] "The oxidative condensation products of the title reaction are catalytically active, presumably because sulfur enters into their composition."
[2] "In most detail tede- hydrogenation of ethylbenzene [4-7] has been studied. It has been established [4-6] that in the course of this reaction on u one can observe the deposition of oxidative condensa- tion products (OCP)."
[3] "The aim of the present study was to investigate propane dehydrogenation by SO2 on carbon, (SBET=436 m2/g) obtained by ash granulation (the authors thank V.A. Semikolenov for the donation of this catalyst)."
[4] "To establish the mechanism of participation of the oxidant propylene formation and OCP, pulses of either propane (R), or propane with an oxidizing agent (RSO) or separate pulses of propane and an oxidizing agent (R and SO) were admitted to the catalyst."
[5] "It is seen that after 100 min of catalyst operation the formation rate of propylene (in mol/s m2) is approximately four times as high as after 3 min. OCP deposition increases the portion of a step- wise mechanism (Fig. 2)."
[6] "For the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by SO2 in the presence of y-Al2O3 it has been shown previously [63 that the concentration of sulfur in OCP rises as they are depositing. Apparently, a similar phenomenon also takes place in the reaction examined."

The study investigates propane dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide (SO2) on a carbon catalyst, focusing on the catalytic activity of oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed on the catalyst surface. The researchers found that the surface area of the catalyst diminishes over time, suggesting the formation of OCP. The amount of propylene produced increases with the number of pulses of the reaction mixture, indicating a concerted mechanism involving the interaction of propane with SO2. Moreover, the catalytic activity of OCP is enhanced by sulfur preadsorption, affecting the dehydrogenation properties of the catalyst. These findings contribute to understanding the role of OCP in propane dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by SO2, providing insights into optimizing the process.

The persistent challenges in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as SO2, include the corrosiveness of the reaction system and the inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion. Strategies for future research and development in this field could focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. These advancements might involve the development of more selective and durable catalysts, the design of more efficient reaction conditions, and the exploration of alternative oxidants that reduce corrosiveness while maintaining high activity.

本研究探讨了在碳催化剂上由二氧化硫（SO2）催化丙烷脱氢的机理，重点关注催化剂表面形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）的催化活性。研究人员发现，催化剂的表面积随时间减少，表明OCP的形成。反应混合物脉冲的数量增加导致丙烯产量增加，这说明了丙烷与SO2之间的协同作用机制。此外，通过预吸附硫提高催化活性的OCP，影响催化剂的脱氢性能。这些发现为理解SO2催化条件下OCP在丙烷脱氢反应中的作用提供了见解，并有助于优化该过程。

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢（ODHP）时，面临的持久挑战包括反应系统的腐蚀性和固有的反应特性，这些限制了选择性和转化率。未来研究和开发领域的策略可以集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统上，以优化ODHP过程。这些进步可能涉及开发更选择性且耐用的催化剂、设计更高效的反应条件以及探索降低腐蚀性同时保持高活性的替代氧化剂。
