The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidizing agent over carbon catalyst. The catalytic activity of the oxidative condensation products formed during the reaction is presumed due to sulfur incorporation into their structure. The process involves the application of SO2 for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, which has been studied in detail for ethylbenzene. The specific activity of the catalyst increases due to the enhanced reaction capability of the oxidative condensation products (OCP) compared to the initial catalyst. The study aims to examine the ODHP of propane on carbon, with the catalyst SBET=436 m2/g obtained through ash granulation. Experiments under flow and pulse conditions indicate decreasing propane conversion over time, suggesting the formation of OCP on the catalyst surface. The mechanism of propylene formation and the role of OCP are explored through pulse experiments with propane and SO2. The sulfur concentration in the sample is found to significantly impact the catalytic properties of OCP. The sulfur entering the OCP composition is proposed to participate in propane activation and enhance the stepwise mechanism as the yield of OCP grows.

Recent studies have explored the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. In these experiments, various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been employed to assess their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. The catalytic activity of oxidative condensation products (OCP) has been noted to increase over time, suggesting enhanced reactivity compared to initial catalysts. Experiments were conducted under both flow and pulse catalytic conditions to evaluate the efficiency of these catalysts. It was observed that propane conversion decreased over time during flow reactions, indicating a decrease in catalyst surface area and possibly the formation of OCP on the catalyst surface. Pulse experiments revealed that the amount of propylene formed after a pulse of RSO (propane with SO2) was significantly higher than after a pulse of R alone, attributing this to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2. This suggests that OCP play a crucial role in the reaction, enhancing the catalytic activity and contributing to the formation of propylene. The sulfur concentration within the OCP composition was found to affect the catalytic properties significantly, possibly aiding in the activation of C-H bonds and promoting a stepwise mechanism for propylene production.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalysts and the intrinsic properties of the reaction system. To address these issues, future research and development efforts should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP processes. Strategies for achieving these goals may include the design of more stable catalysts, the use of novel reaction media, and the implementation of advanced process control techniques to maintain optimal operating conditions.

最近的研究已经探索了在软氧化剂的帮助下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的可能性。在此过程中，使用了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，以评估它们在选择性和转化率方面的性能。观察到氧化缩合产物（OCP）的催化活性随着时间的推移而增加，这表明与初始催化剂相比，它们具有更强的反应能力。进行了流体和脉冲催化条件下的实验来评估这些催化剂的效率。发现流动反应条件下，随着时间的推移，丙烷转化率下降，这可能表明催化剂表面面积减少，并且催化剂表面可能形成了OCP。脉冲实验显示，在脉冲R（纯丙烷）之后加入SO2（硫化物），产生的丙烯量显著高于仅脉冲R的情况，这归因于丙烷与SO2的协同作用机制。这表明OCP在反应中起着关键作用，增强其催化活性并促进丙烯的生成。观察到硫化物存在于OCP组成中时，其浓度对催化性质产生显著影响，可能有助于激活C-H键并促进分步机制，促进丙烯生产。

在这一领域持续存在的挑战包括某些催化剂的腐蚀性以及反应系统的固有属性。为解决这些问题，未来的研究和发展应集中在改进C-H键的激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程方面。实现这些目标的策略可能包括设计更稳定的催化剂、使用新型反应介质以及实施先进的过程控制技术以维持最佳运行条件。

The study investigates propane dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide (SO2) on a carbon catalyst, focusing on the catalytic activity of oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed on the catalyst surface. The researchers found that the surface area of the catalyst diminishes over time, suggesting the formation of OCP. The amount of propylene produced increases with the number of pulses of the reaction mixture, indicating a concerted mechanism involving the interaction of propane with SO2. Moreover, the catalytic activity of OCP is enhanced by sulfur preadsorption, affecting the dehydrogenation properties of the catalyst. These findings contribute to understanding the role of OCP in propane dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by SO2, providing insights into optimizing the process.

The persistent challenges in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as SO2, include the corrosiveness of the reaction system and the inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion. Strategies for future research and development in this field could focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. These advancements might involve the development of more selective and durable catalysts, the design of more efficient reaction conditions, and the exploration of alternative oxidants that reduce corrosiveness while maintaining high activity.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢（ODHP）时，面临的持久挑战包括反应系统的腐蚀性和固有的反应特性，这些限制了选择性和转化率。未来研究和开发领域的策略可以集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统上，以优化ODHP过程。这些进步可能涉及开发更选择性且耐用的催化剂、设计更高效的反应条件以及探索降低腐蚀性同时保持高活性的替代氧化剂。
