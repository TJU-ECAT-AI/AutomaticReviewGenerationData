[1] "The oxidative condensation products of the title reaction are catalytically active, presumably because sulfur enters into their composition."
[2] "It is known that SO 2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."
[3] "In pulse experiments the catalyst activity was characterized by the amount of propylene (mol) formed per one pulse (1.75 cm3)."
[4] "Carrying out the reaction under flow conditions at a constant contact time indicates that propane conversion decreases with time (Table I)."
[5] "Upon admitting SO after a pulse of R to the catalyst, no propylene is formed, which indicates the weak adsorption of propane."
[6] "The amount of propylene formed after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2."
[7] "It is seen that the difference in the amounts of propylene formed after R and RSO pulses, which was ascribed to the contribution of the concerted mechanism for propylene interaction with SO2, remains unchanged as the amount of OCP rises."
[8] "The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidizing agent over carbon catalyst. The catalytic activity of the oxidative condensation products formed during the reaction is presumed due to sulfur incorporation into their structure. The process involves the application of SO2 for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, which has been studied in detail for ethylbenzene. The specific activity of the catalyst increases due to the enhanced reaction capability of the oxidative condensation products (OCP) compared to the initial catalyst. The study aims to examine the ODHP of propane on carbon, with the catalyst SBET=436 m2/g obtained through ash granulation. Experiments under flow and pulse conditions indicate decreasing propane conversion over time, suggesting the formation of OCP on the catalyst surface. The mechanism of propylene formation and the role of OCP are explored through pulse experiments with propane and SO2. The sulfur concentration in the sample is found to significantly impact the catalytic properties of OCP. The sulfur entering the OCP composition is proposed to participate in propane activation and enhance the stepwise mechanism as the yield of OCP grows.

该研究探讨了在硫化物（SO2）作为氧化剂的情况下，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程。由于硫掺入其结构中，推测这些催化剂活性产物具有催化活性。应用SO2进行烃类脱氢的这一过程已对乙苯进行了详细的研究。催化剂的特定活性增加，这是由于初始催化剂相比，氧化性凝结产物（OCP）的增强反应能力。研究旨在考察在碳上进行的丙烷的ODHP，催化剂SBET=436 m2/g通过灰分颗粒化获得。在流体和脉冲条件下进行的实验表明，随时间的推移，丙烷转化率逐渐下降，这表明催化剂表面形成了OCP。通过使用丙烷和SO2的脉冲实验，探索了丙烯形成机制以及OCP的作用。发现样品中的硫浓度显著影响OCP的催化性质。进入OCP组成的硫被认为参与了丙烷活化，并随着OCP产率的增长增强了步进机制。
