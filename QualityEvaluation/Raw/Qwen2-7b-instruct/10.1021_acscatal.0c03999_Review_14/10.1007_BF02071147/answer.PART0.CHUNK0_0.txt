[1] "It is known that SO 2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."
[2] "In pulse experiments the catalyst activity was characterized by the amount of propylene (mol) formed per one pulse (1.75 cm3)."
[3] "The surface area of the catalyst diminishes and one can observe disbalance with respect to carbon."
[4] "Upon admitting SO after a pulse of R to the catalyst, no propylene is formed, which indicates the weak adsorption of propane."
[5] "The amount of propylene formed after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2."
[6] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."
[7] "It can be suggested that the sulfur entering into the OCP composition participates in propane activation and increases the contribution of the stepwise mechanism with growing yield of OCP."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the study highlights the use of carbon-supported sulfur dioxide as an effective oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation. The performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, is discussed in terms of selectivity and conversion. The study emphasizes the importance of sulfur concentration in enhancing the catalytic properties of the formed oxidative condensation products (OCP).

Challenges in the field of ODHP include corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems are proposed as key areas for future research and development.

The sulfur concentration in OCP is suggested to play a significant role in propane activation, increasing the contribution of the stepwise mechanism as the yield of OCP grows. This indicates a potential pathway for enhancing the efficiency of ODHP processes.
