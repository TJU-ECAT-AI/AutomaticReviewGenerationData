[2] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."
[3] "The specific activity of this catalyst increases, which is attributed to the greater ability of OCP to enhance the reaction compared to that of the initial catalyst."

[5] "Carrying out the reaction under flow conditions at a constant contact time indicates that propane conversion decreases with time (Table I)."
[6] "The content of propylene formed upon admitting R (Fig. la) is low and varies slightly from pulse to pulse."
[7] "Upon admitting SO after a pulse of R to the catalyst, no propylene is formed, which indicates the weak adsorption of propane."
[8] "The amount of propylene formed in a pulse of R admitted to a carbon pretreated by 50 pulses, is close to that after a pulse of R admitted to a fresh sample."
[9] "The significantly higher yield of propylene after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2."
[10] "The suggestion of the high catalytic activity of OCP is also confirmed by the formation rates of propylene (Table i) calculated taking into account changes in the catalyst surface area during the reaction."

Recent studies have explored the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. In these experiments, various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been employed to assess their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. The catalytic activity of oxidative condensation products (OCP) has been noted to increase over time, suggesting enhanced reactivity compared to initial catalysts. Experiments were conducted under both flow and pulse catalytic conditions to evaluate the efficiency of these catalysts. It was observed that propane conversion decreased over time during flow reactions, indicating a decrease in catalyst surface area and possibly the formation of OCP on the catalyst surface. Pulse experiments revealed that the amount of propylene formed after a pulse of RSO (propane with SO2) was significantly higher than after a pulse of R alone, attributing this to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2. This suggests that OCP play a crucial role in the reaction, enhancing the catalytic activity and contributing to the formation of propylene. The sulfur concentration within the OCP composition was found to affect the catalytic properties significantly, possibly aiding in the activation of C-H bonds and promoting a stepwise mechanism for propylene production.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalysts and the intrinsic properties of the reaction system. To address these issues, future research and development efforts should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP processes. Strategies for achieving these goals may include the design of more stable catalysts, the use of novel reaction media, and the implementation of advanced process control techniques to maintain optimal operating conditions.

最近的研究已经探索了在软氧化剂的帮助下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的可能性。在此过程中，使用了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，以评估它们在选择性和转化率方面的性能。观察到氧化缩合产物（OCP）的催化活性随着时间的推移而增加，这表明与初始催化剂相比，它们具有更强的反应能力。进行了流体和脉冲催化条件下的实验来评估这些催化剂的效率。发现流动反应条件下，随着时间的推移，丙烷转化率下降，这可能表明催化剂表面面积减少，并且催化剂表面可能形成了OCP。脉冲实验显示，在脉冲R（纯丙烷）之后加入SO2（硫化物），产生的丙烯量显著高于仅脉冲R的情况，这归因于丙烷与SO2的协同作用机制。这表明OCP在反应中起着关键作用，增强其催化活性并促进丙烯的生成。观察到硫化物存在于OCP组成中时，其浓度对催化性质产生显著影响，可能有助于激活C-H键并促进分步机制，促进丙烯生产。

在这一领域持续存在的挑战包括某些催化剂的腐蚀性以及反应系统的固有属性。为解决这些问题，未来的研究和发展应集中在改进C-H键的激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程方面。实现这些目标的策略可能包括设计更稳定的催化剂、使用新型反应介质以及实施先进的过程控制技术以维持最佳运行条件。
