          Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as gaseous elemental sulfur (S2), have shown promise in suppressing the overoxidation to COx that typically occurs with oxygen (O2). Studies on a group of six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, ranging from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, emphasizing the critical role of the metal-sulfur bond strength in the SODHP process. Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, from 86% with S-ZrO2 to 38% with PdS. These findings indicate that sulfur vapor can effectively serve as an oxidant for ODHP, suggesting the potential for a new, promising route to propylene production. Propane conversion rates are highly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The wide range of propylene selectivity, from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS, highlights the importance of catalyst selection in achieving optimal results. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was explored through adjustments in the gas feed contact time, and it was noted that reaction rates cannot easily be compared across all six catalysts due to the inability to accurately measure active site density and sulfide surface area. The current results encourage further investigation of SODHP as a selective and efficient method for producing propylene. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the sulfur binding energy decreases, as illustrated in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.

          使用软氧化剂，例如气体元素硫（S2），进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展表明，这种方法有潜力抑制通常与氧气（O2）发生过氧化的COx。对于一组六种金属硫化物催化剂的研究揭示了丙烯形成显着的活化能（范围从72-134 kJ/mol）与催化剂的硫结合能成正比，强调了金属-硫键强度在SODHP过程中的关键作用。丙烯选择性在催化剂之间有很大差异，从使用S-ZrO2的86%到使用PdS的38%。这些发现表明，气体硫蒸汽可以有效地用作ODHP的氧化剂，暗示了选择性生产丙烯的新有前景的途径。在550°C时，丙烷转化率高度依赖于催化剂的选择，范围从4.7%到8.1%。丙烯选择性从使用S-ZrO2的86%到使用PdS的38%的广泛差异突出了催化剂选择的重要性，以实现最佳结果。通过调整气体流体接触时间来探索丙烷转化率与产品选择性之间的关系，并注意到由于无法准确测量活性位点密度和硫化表面面积，因此难以比较所有六个催化剂的反应速率。当前的结果鼓励进一步研究SODHP作为选择性和高效生产丙烯的途径。图8中显示的显着激活能（Eapp）随着硫结合能的减少而降低，强调了较弱金属-硫键强度在增强催化活性中的重要性。

          For a group of six metal sulfide catalysts, the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, which range from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, indicating that the strength of the metal-sulfur bond plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, with values ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. The literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields. The propane conversion rates are significantly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The role of gas phase sulfur (S2) in replenishing surface sulfur vacancies is highlighted, as evidenced by the zero-order dependence of S2 on S-ZrO2, which implies that gas phase sulfur is involved after the rate-determining step. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was investigated by modifying the contact time of the gas feed, revealing that the severity of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity is catalyst-dependent. The intrinsic properties of the sulfide that govern the catalytic activity in SODHP reactions are of particular interest, given the strong dependence of the catalytic properties on the identity of the metal sulfide. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the binding energy decreases, as depicted in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.
