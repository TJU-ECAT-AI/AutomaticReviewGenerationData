Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the document highlights the effectiveness of gaseous elemental sulfur (S2) as an oxidant, particularly in enhancing ethylene selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The study presents a comparison of selectivity and conversion across various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. It is noted that propylene selectivities vary significantly depending on the catalyst identity, with S-ZrO2 achieving 86% propylene selectivity at 550°C, whereas PdS yields only 38%. The apparent activation energies for propylene formation, ranging from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, indicating that the strength of metal-sulfur bonds plays a pivotal role in SODHP activity. The document also emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainties in gas chromatography peak areas when calculating conversion and selectivity. The zero-order dependence of S2 in the reaction with S-ZrO2 underscores the involvement of gas phase sulfur in replenishing sulfur vacancies on the catalyst surface. This highlights the role of gas phase sulfur in maintaining a steady supply of reactive sulfur species essential for the SODHP process.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on expanding the use of sulfur vapor (S2) as an alternative oxidant. Compared to oxygen (O2), S2 offers a thermodynamically softer oxidant, potentially leading to more selective propylene formation. Various metal sulfide catalyst systems, including transition metals and main group elements, have been evaluated for their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. Catalysts like ZrO2, TiO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, MoS2, and PdS have shown significant variation in propylene yields, with selectivities reaching up to 86% over ZrO2-based catalysts and as low as 38% over PdS. The activity of these catalysts correlates with the XPS sulfur binding energy, suggesting that the strength of the metal-sulfur bond plays a crucial role in determining the activity of the catalysts. The use of sulfur vapor as an oxidant in ODHP has been demonstrated to be effective, with the potential to produce propylene selectively. Catalysts' selectivity and conversion rates are highly dependent on their composition and structure. Altering the contact time of the gas feed has been found to influence the trade-off between propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Gas phase sulfur, in the form of S2, is involved after the rate-determining step of C-H activation, which is initiated by a surface sulfur species. This highlights the importance of understanding the reaction mechanisms to optimize ODHP processes and develop more efficient catalysts. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
