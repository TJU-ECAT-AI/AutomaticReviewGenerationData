Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on expanding the use of sulfur vapor (S2) as an alternative oxidant. Compared to oxygen (O2), S2 offers a thermodynamically softer oxidant, potentially leading to more selective propylene formation. Various metal sulfide catalyst systems, including transition metals and main group elements, have been evaluated for their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. Catalysts like ZrO2, TiO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, MoS2, and PdS have shown significant variation in propylene yields, with selectivities reaching up to 86% over ZrO2-based catalysts and as low as 38% over PdS. The activity of these catalysts correlates with the XPS sulfur binding energy, suggesting that the strength of the metal-sulfur bond plays a crucial role in determining the activity of the catalysts. The use of sulfur vapor as an oxidant in ODHP has been demonstrated to be effective, with the potential to produce propylene selectively. Catalysts' selectivity and conversion rates are highly dependent on their composition and structure. Altering the contact time of the gas feed has been found to influence the trade-off between propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Gas phase sulfur, in the form of S2, is involved after the rate-determining step of C-H activation, which is initiated by a surface sulfur species. This highlights the importance of understanding the reaction mechanisms to optimize ODHP processes and develop more efficient catalysts. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

最近，利用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展集中在扩展硫蒸气（S2）作为替代氧化剂的应用。与氧气（O2）相比，S2提供了一种更温和的氧化剂，可能有助于更选择性地形成丙烯。各种金属硫化物催化剂系统，包括过渡金属和主族元素，已被评估用于其性能，包括选择性和转化率。ZrO2、TiO2、Cr2O3、Co3O4、MoS2和PdS等催化剂显示出显著的差异，在550°C下丙烷转化率从4.7%到8.1%，丙烯选择性最高可达86%（ZrO2基催化剂）和最低仅38%（PdS）。这些催化剂的活性与XPS硫结合能成正比，表明金属-硫键的强度在决定催化剂活性方面起着关键作用。使用硫蒸气作为ODHP中的氧化剂已被证明是有效的，有可能选择性地生产丙烯。催化剂的选择性和转化率高度依赖于其组成和结构。通过改变气体流体接触时间可以影响丙烷转化率与丙烯选择性的权衡。在率定性步骤之后，气体相硫（S2）参与，该步骤由表面硫物种启动C-H活化。这强调了理解反应机制的重要性，以优化ODHP过程并开发更高效的催化剂。未来研究方向旨在提高C-H键激活效率、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。
