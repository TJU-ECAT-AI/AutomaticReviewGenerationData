[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2."
[2] "Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically softer oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation."
[3] "We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."
[4] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[5] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."
[6] "Propane conversion is significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 C."
[7] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."
[8] "Control experiments were next performed to examine the effect of sulfur (S2) in the SODHP reaction. Without sulfur in the reactant feed, the propane conversion is significantly diminished over the sulfide catalysts."
[9] "The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the gas feed."
[10] "Since neither the active site density nor the sulfide surface area could be accurately measured for these catalysts, reaction rates cannot easily be used to compare all six catalysts."

1. The application of alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a viable strategy to mitigate the easy overoxidation to COx, with gaseous disulfur (S2) being a potentially more selective oxidant.
2. Six metal sulfide catalysts were evaluated for their performance in SODHP, achieving propylene selectivities up to 86% at temperatures between 450 and 550°C.
3. The apparent activation energies for propylene formation across these catalysts ranged from 72 to 134 kJ/mol, closely aligning with the sulfur binding energies as determined by XPS, highlighting the importance of metal-sulfur bond strength in the activity of these catalysts.
4. Further investigations into sulfur vapor oxidative dehydrogenation (SODHP) should focus on optimizing the selective and efficient production of propylene.
5. The propane conversion rates varied significantly among the different catalysts, with values ranging from 4.7% to 8.1% at 550°C.
6. The propylene selectivity exhibited wide variation, from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS.
7. Experiments showed that the absence of sulfur in the reactant feed significantly reduced the propane conversion over sulfide catalysts.
8. By adjusting the contact time of the gas feed, the relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was explored.
9. Due to the inability to accurately measure active site density or sulfide surface area, reaction rates could not be effectively used to compare the six catalysts.
