[1] "Overall, the prior literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields."
[2] "Additionally, the H2S byproduct formed from an SODHP process could be regenerated as elemental sulfur via the efficient industrial Claus process (Figure 1b)."
[3] "These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production."
[4] "Conversion and selectivity were calculated as an average of several time points to account for uncertainties in the GC peak areas of propane and other gases."
[5] "Similar structural trends were observed in previous studies on these catalysts."
[6] "However, spent PdS displays significantly sharper peaks compared to the fresh catalyst, suggesting increased crystallite dimensions/order."
[7] "The sulfur order in the rate law was also measured for S-Co3O4 to ascertain whether there was a kinetic difference regarding the role of sulfur for this catalyst."
[8] "Following C-H activation, the formation of propylene and H2S would then leave a sulfur vacancy on the sulfide surface."
[9] "Additionally, respectable propylene yields are obtained for a number of the catalysts examined."
[10] "Note that, although sulfur vapor is preheated to 700 C prior to reaction with propane (see Experimental Section), the actual SODHP reaction temperature is 550 C or lower."

Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the study demonstrated that sulfur vapor (S2) can serve as an effective oxidant for ODHP. This novel SODHP process has been shown to produce propylene yields up to 86% using a catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes produced by atomic layer deposition. The results suggest that sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) might be a promising new route to propylene production. Catalyst evaluation showed that conversion and selectivity varied significantly across different catalyst systems, with propylene selectivities ranging from 38% to 86%. The study highlighted the importance of metal-sulfur bond strength in determining the reaction activity, with lower sulfur binding energy correlating to higher catalytic activity. The performance of catalysts was influenced by factors such as the type of metal used, with transition metal sulfides and main group element metal oxides demonstrating varying degrees of effectiveness. The study also addressed challenges in the field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and proposed future research directions focusing on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize propylene yields. The findings underscore the potential of SODHP as a viable route for selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts, paving the way for further advancements in the field.
