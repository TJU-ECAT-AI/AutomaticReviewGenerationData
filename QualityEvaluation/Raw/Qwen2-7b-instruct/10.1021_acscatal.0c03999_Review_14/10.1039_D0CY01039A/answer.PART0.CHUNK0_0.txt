[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2."
[2] "For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity."
[3] "The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene."
[4] "Propane conversion is significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 C."
[5] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."
[6] "Since neither the active site density nor the sulfide surface area could be accurately measured for these catalysts, reaction rates cannot easily be used to compare all six catalysts."
[7] "The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the gas feed."
[8] "For the present SODHP system, the severity of the trade-off is markedly catalyst-dependent."
[9] "Since the SODHP catalytic properties are strongly dependent on the metal sulfide identity, another question concerning this reaction is what intrinsic sulfide properties govern catalyst activity."
[10] "As shown in Figure 8, Eapp decreases as the binding energy decreases (weaker M-S bonding)."
