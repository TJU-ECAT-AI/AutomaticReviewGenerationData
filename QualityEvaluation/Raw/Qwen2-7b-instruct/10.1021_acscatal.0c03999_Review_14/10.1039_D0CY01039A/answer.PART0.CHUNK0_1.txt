Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the document highlights the effectiveness of gaseous elemental sulfur (S2) as an oxidant, particularly in enhancing ethylene selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The study presents a comparison of selectivity and conversion across various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. It is noted that propylene selectivities vary significantly depending on the catalyst identity, with S-ZrO2 achieving 86% propylene selectivity at 550°C, whereas PdS yields only 38%. The apparent activation energies for propylene formation, ranging from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, indicating that the strength of metal-sulfur bonds plays a pivotal role in SODHP activity. The document also emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainties in gas chromatography peak areas when calculating conversion and selectivity. The zero-order dependence of S2 in the reaction with S-ZrO2 underscores the involvement of gas phase sulfur in replenishing sulfur vacancies on the catalyst surface. This highlights the role of gas phase sulfur in maintaining a steady supply of reactive sulfur species essential for the SODHP process.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢的最新进展，文档强调了气体元素硫（S2）作为氧化剂的有效性，特别是在增强甲烷（OCM）中的乙烯选择性中起到了缓解过度氧化的热力学驱动力的作用。研究对各种催化剂系统的性能进行了比较，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，发现丙烯选择性因催化剂的差异而显著变化，例如在550°C时S-ZrO2可实现86%的丙烯选择性，而PdS仅为38%。对于从S-ZrO2到PdS的催化剂，其形成丙二醇的显着激活能范围从72-134 kJ/mol，并与相应催化剂的XPS硫结合能平行，表明金属-硫键强度在SODHP活性中起关键作用。文档还强调了在计算转化率和选择性时考虑气相色谱峰面积不确定性的重要性。S-ZrO2反应中S2的零级依赖性突出了气体相硫在补充催化剂表面的硫空位中的作用。这凸显了气体相硫在维持SODHP过程所需活性硫物种稳定供应中的作用。
