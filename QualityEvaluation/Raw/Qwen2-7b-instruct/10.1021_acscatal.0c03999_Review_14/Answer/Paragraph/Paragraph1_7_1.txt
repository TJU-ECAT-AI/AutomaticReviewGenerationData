            Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have significantly expanded the scope of catalyst systems, focusing primarily on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These advancements have been characterized by the development of highly selective and efficient catalysts capable of achieving up to 25% propene yield at 723 K, notably with iron-zeolites like FeZSM-5 and FeBEA. These materials demonstrate remarkable resistance against deactivation while showing significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial catalysts, despite containing 30-40 times less iron. 

            The role of iron in these reactions is pivotal, with FeZSM-5 and FeBEA exhibiting higher activity and initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts. However, persistent challenges in this field include catalyst deactivation via coke formation, which affects propene yield, and the inherent reaction properties that lead to corrosion issues. Strategies for mitigating these challenges include developing open structures, creating mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures to minimize deactivation by coke and enhance reactant and product transport.

            Looking ahead, future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. This includes strategies for developing open structures, creating mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures to mitigate deactivation by coke and facilitate better reactant and product transport. Additionally, there is a growing interest in utilizing soft oxidants like sulfur vapor and alternative oxidants such as molecular chlorine for ODHP, which offer new routes to propylene production with potential for reducing COx formation and improving overall selectivity.

            In summary, the field of ODHP using soft oxidants is advancing rapidly, driven by the development of efficient catalysts and innovative reaction systems. Future research will likely focus on addressing persistent challenges and expanding the applicability of these technologies to achieve greater efficiency and selectivity in propene production.

            近年来，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的技术发展迅速，主要集中在过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物催化剂系统上。这些进展已实现了在723 K时达到最高25%的丙烯产率，其中铁-沸石如FeZSM-5和FeBEA表现出色。这些材料不仅表现出对失活的显著抵抗力，而且初始丙烯产量远高于商业催化剂，尽管它们的铁含量仅为后者的30-40倍。

            铁在这些反应中的作用至关重要，FeZSM-5和FeBEA相较于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA催化剂，显示出更高的活性和初始丙烯产量。然而，这一领域持续面临的挑战包括由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这影响了丙烯产量，以及反应本身的性质导致的腐蚀问题。缓解这些挑战的策略包括开发开放结构、通过去硅化创建介孔孔道以及探索更开放的孔结构，以减少焦炭对催化剂的损害并提高反应物和产物的运输效率。

            展望未来，研究方向旨在改进C-H键激活、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。这包括开发开放结构、通过去硅化创建介孔孔道以及探索更开放的孔结构，以减少焦炭对催化剂的损害并促进更好的反应物和产物运输。此外，对利用硫蒸汽等软氧化剂和替代氧化剂如分子氯进行ODHP的兴趣日益增长，这为以较低COx排放和更高选择性生产丙烯提供了新途径。

            总之，ODHP使用软氧化剂领域的进展迅速，由高效催化剂和创新反应系统的开发推动。未来研究可能将重点放在开发具有增强稳定性和活性的高级催化剂材料上，探索优化丙烯生产的最佳反应条件，并研究与其他化学过程的集成，以形成协同系统。此外，需要开发能够预测在各种操作条件下催化剂性能的模型和仿真工具，以此指导ODHP过程的设计和优化。机器学习算法和数据驱动的方法的集成也有助于加速新型催化剂和反应路径的发现。同时，探索可持续和环境友好的催化剂，如基于丰富金属和可再生能源的催化剂，对于降低ODHP过程的环境足迹具有重要意义。最后，开发结合多个化学转换的集成系统可以提供一种更具整体性的合成有价值化学品（如丙烯）的方法，同时最大限度地减少废物生成和能源消耗。
