            Recent studies highlight the use of soft oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with iron-based catalysts, notably FeZSM-5, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in converting propane to propene using nitrogen dioxide (N2O) ([1], DOI: 10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035). These catalysts enable a cyclic process for continuous propene production through alternating reaction and regeneration cycles, showcasing the reversibility of catalyst deactivation and its potential for optimizing the ODHP process ([4], DOI: 10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035).

            Recent advancements in ODHP with soft oxidants, such as sulfur vapor (S2) ([6], DOI: 10.1039/D0CY01039A), offer a promising alternative to oxygen, suppressing overoxidation. Studies on metal sulfide catalysts reveal the critical role of metal-sulfur bond strength in determining activation energy and propylene selectivity, with selectivities ranging from 38% to 86% ([2], DOI: 10.1039/D0CY01039A).

            Challenges, including corrosion and deactivation, particularly coke formation, hinder efficiency. FeZSM-5 and FeBEA show superior performance, with higher propene yields and resistance against deactivation compared to conventional catalysts ([3], DOI: 10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005). Research focuses on enhancing C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to mitigate these challenges and improve overall efficiency.

            The large difference in nickel particle size significantly influences CO2 hydrogenation kinetics, product selectivity, and pathways for CO and CH4 formation. At lower loadings, the catalyst favors CO production, while higher loadings shift selectivity towards CH4 ([10], DOI: 10.1039/C5CY00667H). Active sites are hypothesized to be at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface, with two reaction pathways identified: consecutive and parallel, each with its own preference for small clusters or large particles ([1], DOI: 10.1039/C5CY00667H).

            Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as a new group of catalysts for ODHP, offering a minimized surface concentration of metal cations and a dynamic surface that reduces unsaturation and interactions with reactive products, leading to improved selectivity towards olefins ([3], DOI: 10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3).

            The high stability of CrPO, corroborated by extensive characterization, underscores its potential for optimized ODHP processes ([5], DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.9b01315).

            An intense research effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively ([1], DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.9b01315).

            Challenges in the field include catalyst corrosion and inherent reaction properties. Future research focuses on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to address these challenges and improve ODHP processes. The persistent challenges, such as corrosiveness and reaction kinetics, require innovative approaches to develop more robust and efficient catalysts.

            Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new catalyst materials with enhanced stability and selectivity, exploring synergies between different catalyst types, and integrating advanced reaction engineering principles to optimize ODHP processes. Additionally, the integration of advanced diagnostics and monitoring technologies could provide real-time insights into reaction dynamics, enabling more precise control and tuning of reaction conditions. This could pave the way for more sustainable and economically viable ODHP processes in the future.
