            Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have significantly contributed to the field of chemical engineering, particularly in the development of efficient catalyst systems for the production of propylene. This review highlights the pivotal role of catalyst types, performance metrics, and strategies for optimizing reaction systems. Specifically, the utilization of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, along with the introduction of soft oxidants like sulfur vapor and alkali metal chlorides, has opened new avenues for enhancing the selectivity and conversion in ODHP processes.

            Transition metal/metal oxides, exemplified by chromium (Cr) supported on SBA-15, have demonstrated high activity due to the formation of active Cr3+ sites, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, the reduction of these sites during the reaction often leads to severe deactivation. The incorporation of nickel (Ni) as a promoter has proven effective in increasing CO2's effectiveness as an oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states, thus enabling the successful production of propylene. This synergy between Cr and Ni showcases the importance of catalyst design in optimizing ODHP processes.

            Main group element metal oxides, such as Fe-zeolites, have also gained attention for their catalytic performance in various environmental applications and selective oxidation for chemical production. FeZSM-5, in particular, exhibits remarkable resistance against deactivation, making it a promising candidate for ODHP processes. The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of FeZSM-5 compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content, underscores the need for strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst longevity.

            Challenges in the field of ODHP, including corrosion and inherent reaction properties, necessitate ongoing research efforts. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems are key areas for future development. For instance, the use of nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction for CO2 mitigation presents a promising direction for addressing CO2 emissions.

            Looking ahead, the integrative understanding and prospective outlook reveal an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring new catalyst materials, refining reaction conditions, and developing advanced reactor designs to optimize ODHP processes. By leveraging insights from recent studies, researchers can anticipate and address challenges such as managing corrosiveness and optimizing C-H bond activation, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable propylene production.

            Key areas for future research and development include:
            - Improving C-H bond activation through the discovery of novel catalyst materials.
            - Enhancing catalyst regenerability by understanding the mechanisms behind catalyst deactivation and developing strategies for efficient regeneration.
            - Renovating reaction systems to optimize the balance between selectivity and conversion, considering factors such as temperature, pressure, and reaction medium.

            These advancements will not only contribute to the field of chemical engineering but also address broader environmental concerns by promoting the sustainable production of petrochemicals.

            最近，在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面的进展在化学工程领域产生了重要影响，特别是对于提高丙烯生产效率的关键催化剂系统的开发。本文重点回顾了催化剂类型、性能指标以及优化反应系统策略对ODHP过程的贡献。

            利用过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，结合软氧化剂如硫蒸汽和碱金属氯化物的使用，为增强选择性和转化率提供了新途径。例如，通过SBA-15支持的铬（Cr）表现出高活性，关键在于形成活性Cr3+位点，这对丙烷的氧化脱氢至关重要。然而，反应过程中Cr3+位点的还原会导致严重的失活。镍（Ni）作为促进剂的引入显著提高了CO2作为氧化剂的有效性，并且能够再生还原的Cr2+状态回至活性Cr3+状态，从而成功地生成丙烯。Cr与Ni之间的协同作用凸显了催化剂设计在优化ODHP过程中的重要性。

            主族元素金属氧化物，如铁-沸石，也因其在环境应用和选择性氧化中的表现而受到关注。FeZSM-5表现出抵抗失活的优异性能，是ODHP过程的理想候选材料。尽管FeZSM-5相比商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA催化剂具有30-40倍较低的铁含量，仍能表现出更高的活性和更低的失活速率，这提示需要采取措施来防止焦炭形成并延长催化剂寿命。

            ODHP领域的挑战包括腐蚀性和内在反应性质，需要持续的研究工作。提高C-H键激活、增强催化剂可再生性和改造反应系统是未来发展的关键领域。例如，将纳米晶镁氧作为镍基催化剂的支持材料，在水煤气逆向反应中处理二氧化碳排放，提供了一种有前景的方向。

            鉴于近期研究的深入，未来展望揭示了探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能侧重于探索新的催化剂材料、优化反应条件以及发展先进的反应器设计以优化ODHP过程。通过利用最新研究的洞察力，研究人员可以预见并解决诸如管理腐蚀性和优化C-H键激活等挑战，从而为更高效、更可持续的丙烯生产铺平道路。

            未来研究和发展领域的关键包括：
            - 通过发现新型催化剂材料来改善C-H键激活。
            - 通过理解催化剂失活机制并发展高效的再生策略来增强催化剂可再生性。
            - 通过考虑温度、压力和反应介质等因素优化反应系统，以平衡选择性和转化率。

            这些进步不仅会推动化学工程领域的发展，而且还会通过促进石油化学品的可持续生产来应对更广泛的环境问题。
