Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) employing soft oxidants have significantly expanded the field of catalytic technology. This review delves into the exploration of catalyst types, notably focusing on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in the context of their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. The pivotal role of catalyst characteristics, such as nickel, chromium, and iron, in influencing reaction pathways and product distributions is highlighted. For instance, studies by \[10.1039/C5CY00667H\] elucidate the substantial effect of nickel particle size on the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, leading to distinct formation pathways for CO and CH4, with smaller particles at lower loading favoring CO production, while higher loading results in CH4 preference. The identification of active sites on the catalyst surface, primarily at kink, corner, or step positions, further underscores the complexity and specificity of these reactions.

        Persistent challenges in the field, including the corrosiveness of the reaction media and the inherent properties of the reaction itself, are also discussed. For example, the necessity for high temperatures to increase olefin equilibrium concentrations, as noted in \[10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018\], poses significant hurdles for industrial implementation. Despite the notable activity of Ruthenium-titanium dioxide catalysts, achieving a high selectivity of 95% towards propylene with 50% propane conversion at 400°C, the economic feasibility remains limited due to yields not exceeding 35%.

        The utilization of sulfur vapor (S2) as an alternative oxidant, as detailed in \[10.1039/D0CY01039A\], demonstrates a promising strategy to suppress overoxidation to COx, offering a novel route to propylene production. Metal sulfide catalysts, particularly those of S-ZrO2 and PdS, exhibit a wide variation in propylene selectivity, ranging from 86% to 38%, which underscores the critical role of catalyst selection. The correlation between sulfur binding energy and activation energy for propylene formation, along with the observed decrease in apparent activation energy with decreasing sulfur binding energy, further illuminates the catalytic activity enhancement potential.

        Iron-zeolites, such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have garnered considerable interest due to their exceptional catalytic performance in various environmental applications and selective oxidation for chemical production. \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\] highlights the remarkable resistance of FeZSM-5 against deactivation while a rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA, demonstrating the importance of catalyst structure in ODHP. These catalysts, despite their corrosion challenges, show significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial counterparts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. The essential role of iron in the reaction is clearly concluded from the higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA.

        The utilization of Cr/Si and CrOx catalysts, especially when enhanced by Ni promotion, has shown promise in ODHP, as discussed in \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. Ni allows the catalyst to maintain stable activity by regenerating active Cr3+ states, addressing the challenge of catalyst deactivation. The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were found to be in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air, showcasing the effectiveness of Ni in enhancing the stability and efficiency of CrOx catalysts for ODHP.

        The use of supported alkali metal chloride melts as new catalysts for ODHP, as explored in \[10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3\], offers minimized metal cation surface concentration, providing a dynamic surface that reduces interaction with reactive products. The order of catalyst selectivity to olefins follows the sequence Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD, indicating the nuanced influence of alkali metals on the reaction dynamics.

        In summary, the recent advancements in ODHP utilizing soft oxidants have significantly advanced our understanding of catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and the optimization of reaction systems. Challenges such as corrosion and the intrinsic properties of the reaction require innovative strategies for catalyst stabilization and regenerability. Future research should concentrate on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient catalyst structures that can withstand harsh reaction conditions while maintaining high activity and selectivity. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes could be paramount. Moreover, the integration of soft oxidants with advanced materials science and computational chemistry could pave the way for the discovery of novel catalysts with unprecedented properties. The optimization of reaction conditions, including temperature control and the precise regulation of reaction media, could also significantly contribute to the economic feasibility of ODHP. As the field evolves, it becomes increasingly evident that a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from chemistry, materials science, and engineering, will be crucial for realizing the full potential of ODHP technologies.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jece.2018.07.032]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005], [10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3], [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4], [10.1021/acscatal.9b01315], [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035], [10.1039/D0CY01039A], [10.1039/C5CY00667H], [10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018], and [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have utilized soft oxidants, focusing on catalyst systems like transition metal/metal oxide and main group element metal oxide catalysts. Nanocrystalline MgO has proven beneficial as a nickel-based catalyst support in CO2 mitigation. Challenges like corrosion and intrinsic reaction properties persist, necessitating future research aimed at optimizing C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system design.

        The reverse water gas shift reaction is a promising method for CO2 mitigation, with Fe-zeolites gaining great interest for their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and selective oxidation for chemical production. Nanocrystalline MgO has emerged as a favorable support for nickel-based catalysts, demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning corrosion and intrinsic reaction properties. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to address these challenges, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

        The role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework. Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.

        Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new groups of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions, minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. As temperature increases, olefin selectivity rises, and COx formation decreases in parallel, indicating enhanced performance under higher temperatures.

        Recent studies highlight the dual role of oxygen and carbon dioxide in regenerating chromium species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41. This catalytic process involves dehydrogenating propane to propene by chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to chromium tri-oxy-octahedra. Oxygen reoxidizes these reduced species back to chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra, enabling a reduction-oxidation cycle crucial for the ODHP reaction. Notably, carbon dioxide selectively drives this cycle, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane with enhanced efficiency.

        Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) is found as the most selective system, reaching propylene yields that rival the best catalysts reported to date. The high stability of CrPO was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run.

        Many recent studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential route to the corresponding alkenes. Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K. Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O. Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analyzed. Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%).

        The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.

        The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity. With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation. Sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation. The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively. The parallel reaction pathway may involve competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate. The formate species in a monodentate configuration is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation on both Ni/SiO2 catalysts, regardless of the Ni loading and particle size.

        The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C. It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility. The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization.

        The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air. The conversion of CO2 and propane increases linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni. Importantly, Ni maintains the stable catalytic activity. In exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sites-reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state. This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene.
