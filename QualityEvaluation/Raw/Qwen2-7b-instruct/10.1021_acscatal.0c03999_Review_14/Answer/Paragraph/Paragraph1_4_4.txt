        Recent advances in developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination have led to the identification of chromium phosphate (CrPO) as the most selective system, achieving propylene yields rivaling the best catalysts reported. Notably, CrPO shows high stability and reactivity, characterized by its ability to release chlorine from the surface, leading to swift dehydrochlorination kinetics and a reduced production of molecular chlorine in the gas phase. This reduces the likelihood of propane cracking and combustion, contributing to high selectivity. Despite these promising results, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries, particularly in optimizing the phosphates' ability to evolve chlorine from their surface. Future research should focus on enhancing catalyst regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane processes. The use of soft oxidants demonstrates promise in this field, offering a sustainable solution for CO2 reduction.

        Recent studies highlight the efficacy of catalyst systems like transition metals/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, demonstrate high activity, achieving up to 25% propene yield at 723 K. Challenges include corrosion and deactivation, often due to coke formation, which reduces propene yield. Future research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems. Strategies include enhancing open structures, developing mesopores, and exploring new architectures to mitigate deactivation and improve overall process efficiency.

        The main problem limiting the industrial application of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. Key findings highlight the use of ruthenium-titania catalysts, with the Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared via incipient wetness impregnation showing the highest catalytic activity. Achieving high yields, however, remains a challenge, with the best catalysts yielding up to 35%, insufficient for economic feasibility. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems for better efficiency are essential for future research and development.

        Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new groups of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. These melts provide a dynamic surface that reduces unsaturation of cations and anions, minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Increasing temperature enhances olefin selectivity while decreasing COx formation, indicating improved C-H bond activation under these conditions. The dynamic nature of these melts contributes to enhanced catalyst regenerability, making them a promising avenue for future ODHP research and development.

        The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.

        Many recent studies have explored the catalytic ox- idative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential route to the corresponding alkenes. Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K. Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O. Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analyzed. Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%).

        Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS. It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the CsH8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41. It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

        The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity. With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation. The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation. Two reaction pathways exist: consecutive and parallel, with the latter preferred by large Ni particles and involving competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate.

        Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion.

        近期在开发高效丙烷氧氯化催化剂方面取得的进展表明，铬磷酸（CrPO）作为最选择性的系统，能够达到与迄今为止报道的最佳催化剂相媲美的丙烯产率。值得注意的是，CrPO表现出高稳定性和反应性，其特征在于能够释放氯原子到表面，从而实现快速脱氯化氢动力学，并减少气体相中的分子氯生成，降低丙烷裂解和燃烧的可能性，进而提高选择性。然而，目前用于丙烷氧氯化的系统数量有限，这为新的发现提供了巨大的潜力，特别是优化磷化物释放氯的能力。未来研究应集中在提高催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统，以优化丙烷氧化脱氢过程。

        近期研究表明，过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物催化剂体系的效率。铁沸石，尤其是FeZSM-5和FeBEA，显示出高达25%的丙烯产率，在723 K时，挑战包括腐蚀和失活，通常由焦炭形成导致丙烯产量降低。未来研究的重点是提高C-H键激活、催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统的效率。策略包括增强开放结构、发展介孔结构并探索新架构，以减轻失活并提高整体工艺效率。

        氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）的主要问题是必须使用高温以增加烯烃平衡浓度，因为丙烷的脱氢化是一个吸热反应。关键发现表明，使用钌-二氧化钛催化剂，通过浸渍湿法制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂显示出最高的催化活性。然而，实现高产率仍然是一个挑战，最好的催化剂产率达到35%，不足以满足经济可行性。对于改善C-H键激活、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以提高效率的研究对于未来的发展至关重要。

        支持的碱金属氯化物熔融体作为具有最小可访问金属离子表面浓度的应用的新组催化剂。这些熔融体提供了一个动态表面，减少了阳离子和阴离子的不饱和性，减少了与高度反应产物的相互作用。催化剂按烯烃选择性顺序排列为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。随着温度的升高，烯烃选择性增加，同时COx形成量下降，表明在这些条件下提高了C-H键激活。这些熔融体的动态性质有助于提高催化剂的再生能力，使其成为未来ODHP研究和发展的一个有前途的方向。

        使用替代氧化剂进行氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）是一种抑制氧气易于过氧化COx的有前景的战略。对于一组6种金属硫化物催化剂，丙烯形成的有效激活能范围为72-134 kJ/mol，并且与相应的催化剂XPS硫结合能平行，表明M-S键强度在SODHP活性中起着关键作用。丙烯选择性变化很大，从S-ZrO2的86%到PdS的38%。这些结果表明，硫蒸汽（S2）可以作为ODHP的有效氧化剂，并且这种新颖的SODHP过程可能是丙烯生产的新有前景的途径。

        许多近期研究探讨了轻烷烃的催化氧化脱氢作为向相应的烯烃的潜在途径。铁沸石是使用N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢的高效催化剂，初始丙烯产率为20-25%在723-773 K。蒸汽活化的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐、Fe贝塔）是使用N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢的高效催化剂。由于催化剂失活是可逆的，连续丙烯生产的可行性已经进行了分析，通过交替反应和再生周期。在723-773 K时，实现了20-25%的初始丙烯产率，丙烷转化率约为45%，丙烯选择率约为50%。

        不仅O2但CO2也可以从还原的Cr3+Og八面体中再生Cr6+C>4四面体，如通过TPR和EXAFS的结果所建议的。清楚地观察到，CO从CO2在Cr-MCM-41上进行CsH8脱氢期间被选择性产生。可以得出结论，在反应期间，C?Hg被Cr6+O4四面体脱氢成C3H6，同时被还原成Cr3+Og八面体。还原的Cr3+Og八面体被CO2重新氧化成Cr6+O4四面体，因此Cr6+C>4四面体和Cr3+Og八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在使用CO2对C3H8进行脱氢过程中起着重要作用。

        铬粒子大小之间存在显著差异，0.5 wt%和10 wt%镍负载强烈影响CO2氢化动力学参数、CO和CH4的形成路径以及反应选择性。在低镍负载（0.5 wt%）下，催化剂在高CO选择性下的催化活性较高。将镍负载增加至10 wt%（约9 nm颗粒），选择性转向有利于CH4形成。Ni/SiO2表面上的kink、corner或step位置被提议作为CO2氢化的初级活性位点。存在两种反应途径：连续和并行，后者由大Ni颗粒偏好，并涉及m-HCOO中间体的竞争性分解或CH4氢化。

        评估了代表每个识别催化剂类别的选定系统在丙烷和HCl的氧化以及丙基氯脱氯化。这项分析揭示了磷化物的反应性是材料释放氯原子到表面的能力的函数，而高选择性向丙烯是快脱氯化氢动力学与生成分子氯在气相的受阻能力以及丙烷裂解和燃烧的低倾向的后果。
