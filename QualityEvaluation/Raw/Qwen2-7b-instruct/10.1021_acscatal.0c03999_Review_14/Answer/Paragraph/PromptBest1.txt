Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jece.2018.07.032]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005], [10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3], [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4], [10.1021/acscatal.9b01315], [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035], [10.1039/D0CY01039A], [10.1039/C5CY00667H], [10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018], and [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have utilized soft oxidants, focusing on catalyst systems like transition metal/metal oxide and main group element metal oxide catalysts. Nanocrystalline MgO has proven beneficial as a nickel-based catalyst support in CO2 mitigation. Challenges like corrosion and intrinsic reaction properties persist, necessitating future research aimed at optimizing C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system design.

        The reverse water gas shift reaction is a promising method for CO2 mitigation, with Fe-zeolites gaining great interest for their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and selective oxidation for chemical production. Nanocrystalline MgO has emerged as a favorable support for nickel-based catalysts, demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning corrosion and intrinsic reaction properties. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to address these challenges, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

        The role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework. Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.

        Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new groups of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions, minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. As temperature increases, olefin selectivity rises, and COx formation decreases in parallel, indicating enhanced performance under higher temperatures.

        Recent studies highlight the dual role of oxygen and carbon dioxide in regenerating chromium species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41. This catalytic process involves dehydrogenating propane to propene by chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to chromium tri-oxy-octahedra. Oxygen reoxidizes these reduced species back to chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra, enabling a reduction-oxidation cycle crucial for the ODHP reaction. Notably, carbon dioxide selectively drives this cycle, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane with enhanced efficiency.

        Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) is found as the most selective system, reaching propylene yields that rival the best catalysts reported to date. The high stability of CrPO was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run.

        Many recent studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential route to the corresponding alkenes. Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K. Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O. Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analyzed. Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%).

        The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.

        The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity. With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation. Sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation. The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively. The parallel reaction pathway may involve competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate. The formate species in a monodentate configuration is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation on both Ni/SiO2 catalysts, regardless of the Ni loading and particle size.

        The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C. It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility. The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization.

        The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air. The conversion of CO2 and propane increases linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni. Importantly, Ni maintains the stable catalytic activity. In exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sites-reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state. This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene.

        Recent studies highlight the use of oxygen and carbon dioxide in regenerating chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. This process involves the dehydrogenation of propane to propene by chromium's simultaneous reduction and oxidation cycles, as elucidated in reference \[10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4\].

Recent advances in developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination have led to the identification of chromium phosphate (CrPO) as the most selective system, achieving propylene yields rivaling the best catalysts reported. Notably, CrPO shows high stability and reactivity, characterized by its ability to release chlorine from the surface, leading to swift dehydrochlorination kinetics and a reduced production of molecular chlorine in the gas phase. This reduces the likelihood of propane cracking and combustion, contributing to high selectivity. Despite these promising results, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries, particularly in optimizing the phosphates' ability to evolve chlorine from their surface. Future research should focus on enhancing catalyst regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane processes.

        Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion. The use of soft oxidants demonstrates promise in this field, offering a sustainable solution for CO2 reduction.

        Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. FeZSM-5 and FeBEA showcase significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe). The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA.

        The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C. It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility.

        Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un- saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.

        The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. These results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene.
        
        Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, particularly concerning the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst performance. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are critical areas for future research and development. Future efforts should aim to address the limitations of current catalysts, including their susceptibility to corrosion and deactivation, and to develop more robust and efficient catalysts capable of operating under mild conditions. Additionally, the integration of advanced materials science and computational methods to design and predict catalyst performance could accelerate the discovery of novel catalyst systems and reaction pathways for ODHP.

            Recent studies highlight the use of soft oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with iron-based catalysts, notably FeZSM-5, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in converting propane to propene using nitrogen dioxide (N2O). Achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K, these catalysts enable a cyclic process for continuous propene production through alternating reaction and regeneration cycles. This innovative approach has been successfully demonstrated, showcasing the reversibility of catalyst deactivation and its potential for optimizing the ODHP process.

            However, persistent challenges include catalyst corrosion and reaction kinetics. The reverse water gas shift reaction is a promising method for CO2 mitigation, and nanocrystalline MgO has emerged as a favorable support for nickel-based catalysts. Despite recent advancements, the large difference in nickel particle size between different loadings significantly affects kinetic parameters, product selectivity, and pathways for CO and CH4 formation. High activity and lower rates of deactivation are observed with ex-FeZSM-5, likely due to its mesoporous structure and different iron constitution compared to conventional catalysts.

            The use of sulfur vapor for ODHP offers a promising alternative to oxygen, suppressing overoxidation. Studies on metal sulfide catalysts reveal the critical role of metal-sulfur bond strength in determining activation energy and propylene selectivity, with selectivities ranging from 38% to 86%. Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new groups of catalysts for applications requiring minimized metal cation surface concentrations, offering improved selectivity towards olefins.

            Transition metal/metal oxides, particularly chromium (Cr) catalysts supported on SBA-15, show high activity due to Cr3+ sites, but deactivation occurs during reactions. Nickel (Ni) promotion enhances catalyst activity by increasing CO2's effectiveness as an oxidant and regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+, stabilizing the catalytic process. Exsitu XPS measurements confirm the regeneration of active Cr3+ states under Ni promotion.

            Challenges, including catalyst corrosion and deactivation, particularly coke formation, hinder efficiency. FeZSM-5 and FeBEA show superior performance, with higher propene yields and resistance against deactivation compared to conventional catalysts. Research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to mitigate these challenges and optimize ODHP processes.

            Future research efforts will concentrate on developing strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies might involve improving catalyst structure, such as creating mesopores through desilication, to mitigate deactivation and optimize ODHP processes. Key areas for future investigation aim to address these challenges and improve overall efficiency, with a focus on sustainable and economically feasible methods for propene production.

            Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants highlight the efficiency of iron-zeolites, like FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, in achieving up to 25% propene yield at 723 K. Challenges include catalyst deactivation via coke formation, affecting propene yield. Iron's role in the reaction is evident, as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA show higher activity and initial propene yields compared to commercial catalysts, despite containing less iron. Future research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP processes' efficiency and selectivity.

            Nanocrystalline MgO emerges as a favorable support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction for CO2 mitigation. Key areas for future research include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies include developing open structures, creating mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures to mitigate deactivation by coke and facilitate better reactant and product transport.

            Chromium phosphate (CrPO) stands out for its exceptional stability and high selectivity, rivaling the best catalysts reported. Challenges include catalyst stability and regenerability, with future research aiming to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems. Strategies for improving CrPO's reactivity and stability are key areas for future investigation.

            Sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP, offering a new, promising route to propylene production. Studies suggest that sulfur vapor effectively serves as an ODHP oxidant, highlighting the potential for further investigation into SODHP as a selective and efficient method for propylene production.

            The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx. Key findings include the correlation between metal-sulfur bond strength and catalytic activity, with propylene selectivities varying widely among catalysts. These results underscore the importance of catalyst selection in achieving optimal results and highlight the potential for further investigation into SODHP as a selective and efficient method for propylene production.

            The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, influencing the formation of CO and CH4 and the reaction selectivity. At low Ni loading, the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity. With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation. Sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation. The parallel reaction pathway may involve competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 of the m-HCOO intermediate.

            Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as a new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions, minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD, with increasing temperature leading to an increase in selectivity to olefins while reducing the formation of COx.

            The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

            Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite. This feature contributes to the catalyst's higher activity and resistance against deactivation via coke formation, demonstrating the potential for developing more efficient and stable catalysts through tailored modification techniques.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants has seen significant advancements in catalyst development, with a focus on improving the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of catalysts. Despite the progress, challenges such as catalyst deactivation and corrosion must be addressed. Future research efforts should concentrate on strategies to enhance C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system optimization to achieve more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) employing soft oxidants have significantly expanded the field of catalytic technology. This review delves into the exploration of catalyst types, notably focusing on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in the context of their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. The pivotal role of catalyst characteristics, such as nickel, chromium, and iron, in influencing reaction pathways and product distributions is highlighted. For instance, studies by \[10.1039/C5CY00667H\] elucidate the substantial effect of nickel particle size on the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, leading to distinct formation pathways for CO and CH4, with smaller particles at lower loading favoring CO production, while higher loading results in CH4 preference. The identification of active sites on the catalyst surface, primarily at kink, corner, or step positions, further underscores the complexity and specificity of these reactions.

        Persistent challenges in the field, including the corrosiveness of the reaction media and the inherent properties of the reaction itself, are also discussed. For example, the necessity for high temperatures to increase olefin equilibrium concentrations, as noted in \[10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018\], poses significant hurdles for industrial implementation. Despite the notable activity of Ruthenium-titanium dioxide catalysts, achieving a high selectivity of 95% towards propylene with 50% propane conversion at 400°C, the economic feasibility remains limited due to yields not exceeding 35%.

        The utilization of sulfur vapor (S2) as an alternative oxidant, as detailed in \[10.1039/D0CY01039A\], demonstrates a promising strategy to suppress overoxidation to COx, offering a novel route to propylene production. Metal sulfide catalysts, particularly those of S-ZrO2 and PdS, exhibit a wide variation in propylene selectivity, ranging from 86% to 38%, which underscores the critical role of catalyst selection. The correlation between sulfur binding energy and activation energy for propylene formation, along with the observed decrease in apparent activation energy with decreasing sulfur binding energy, further illuminates the catalytic activity enhancement potential.

        Iron-zeolites, such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have garnered considerable interest due to their exceptional catalytic performance in various environmental applications and selective oxidation for chemical production. \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\] highlights the remarkable resistance of FeZSM-5 against deactivation while a rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA, demonstrating the importance of catalyst structure in ODHP. These catalysts, despite their corrosion challenges, show significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial counterparts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. The essential role of iron in the reaction is clearly concluded from the higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA.

        The utilization of Cr/Si and CrOx catalysts, especially when enhanced by Ni promotion, has shown promise in ODHP, as discussed in \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. Ni allows the catalyst to maintain stable activity by regenerating active Cr3+ states, addressing the challenge of catalyst deactivation. The prepared Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalysts were found to be in the form of NiO and α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 after calcination in air, showcasing the effectiveness of Ni in enhancing the stability and efficiency of CrOx catalysts for ODHP.

        The use of supported alkali metal chloride melts as new catalysts for ODHP, as explored in \[10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3\], offers minimized metal cation surface concentration, providing a dynamic surface that reduces interaction with reactive products. The order of catalyst selectivity to olefins follows the sequence Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD, indicating the nuanced influence of alkali metals on the reaction dynamics.

        In summary, the recent advancements in ODHP utilizing soft oxidants have significantly advanced our understanding of catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and the optimization of reaction systems. Challenges such as corrosion and the intrinsic properties of the reaction require innovative strategies for catalyst stabilization and regenerability. Future research should concentrate on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
