Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.9b01315\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.jece.2018.07.032\], \[10.1039/C5CY00667H\], \[10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018\], \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\], \[10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3\], and \[10.1039/D0CY01039A\]. Recent advances in developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination have led to the identification of chromium phosphate (CrPO) as the most selective system, achieving propylene yields rivaling the best catalysts reported. Notably, CrPO shows high stability and reactivity, characterized by its ability to release chlorine from the surface, leading to swift dehydrochlorination kinetics and a reduced production of molecular chlorine in the gas phase. This reduces the likelihood of propane cracking and combustion, contributing to high selectivity. Despite these promising results, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries, particularly in optimizing the phosphates' ability to evolve chlorine from their surface. Future research should focus on enhancing catalyst regenerability and renovating reaction systems to optimize the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane processes.

        Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion. The use of soft oxidants demonstrates promise in this field, offering a sustainable solution for CO2 reduction.

        The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity. With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation. The sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation. The consecutive and parallel reaction pathways show preferences for small Ni clusters and large Ni particles, respectively. The formate species in a monodentate configuration is intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation on both Ni/SiO2 catalysts, regardless of the Ni loading and particle size.

        Many recent studies have explored the catalytic ox- idative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential route to the corresponding alkenes. Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K. Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O. Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analyzed. Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%).

        Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. FeZSM-5 and FeBEA showcase significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content. The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe). The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA.

        The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C. It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility.

        Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un- saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.

        The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72-134 kJ/mol and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M-S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. These results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene.
        
        Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, particularly concerning the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst performance. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are critical areas for future research and development. Future efforts should aim to address the limitations of current catalysts, including their susceptibility to corrosion and deactivation, and to develop more robust and efficient catalysts capable of operating under mild conditions. Additionally, the integration of advanced materials science and computational methods to design and predict catalyst performance could accelerate the discovery of novel catalyst systems and reaction pathways for ODHP.
        
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalyst materials that can operate under mild conditions, reducing the energy demand and environmental impact of ODHP processes. The exploration of alternative oxidants, such as sulfur vapor, could offer new routes for propylene production with enhanced selectivity and efficiency. Moreover, the integration of advanced materials science and computational methods could enable the design of catalysts with tailored properties, optimized for specific reaction conditions and product selectivity. The optimization of reaction systems, including the enhancement of catalyst regenerability and the development of sustainable processes for waste heat recovery, represents another promising direction for future research. By addressing these challenges, the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can pave the way for more sustainable and economically viable chemical production processes, contributing to the advancement of green chemistry and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a process pivotal for the production of higher value-added chemicals such as propylene, continues to attract significant attention due to its potential environmental benefits and economic advantages. Recent advances in this field have primarily focused on the development and utilization of soft oxidants, which offer lower oxygen pressures and temperatures compared to traditional methods, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing operational safety. This approach has opened new avenues for more sustainable chemical synthesis.

In terms of catalyst types, researchers have explored a wide array of materials, including noble metals, transition metals, metal oxides, and supported catalysts, each with distinct advantages and limitations. For instance, noble metals like platinum and palladium are highly effective but are expensive and prone to sintering under operating conditions. In contrast, transition metals such as iron, cobalt, and manganese offer lower costs and better stability, although they may require higher temperatures or longer reaction times. The use of supported catalysts, where active metals are dispersed over a support material, has been particularly promising, as it can improve activity, selectivity, and stability by facilitating better mass transport properties and reducing agglomeration.

Performance metrics, crucial for evaluating the efficiency of ODHP processes, include conversion rates, selectivities, and yield of desired products. Optimization strategies often involve fine-tuning the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading, as well as the choice of solvent and the type of soft oxidant used. Advanced modeling techniques and computational chemistry tools have also played a vital role in predicting and understanding the complex reaction mechanisms, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts and reaction systems.

Looking towards future research directions, there is a strong emphasis on developing catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity, especially those that can operate under milder conditions to further reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. There is also a growing interest in the integration of ODHP with other chemical processes, aiming to create multi-functional catalytic systems that can produce a variety of valuable chemicals from a single feedstock. Additionally, the exploration of novel soft oxidants, such as water or carbon dioxide, and the development of scalable synthesis methods for these catalysts are anticipated to be key areas of focus, driving innovation and efficiency gains in the field of ODHP.
