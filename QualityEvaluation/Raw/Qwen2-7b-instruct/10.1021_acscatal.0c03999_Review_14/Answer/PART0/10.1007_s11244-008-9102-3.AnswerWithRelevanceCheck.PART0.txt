          [1] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized."
          [2] "The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un- saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."
          [3] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
          [4] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."

          Recent studies have revealed that supported alkali metal chloride melts can serve as innovative catalysts for applications requiring a minimized surface concentration of accessible metal cations. These melts offer a dynamic surface that effectively minimizes the unsaturation of both cations and anions, thereby reducing their interaction with highly reactive products. Among various catalysts, the order of selectivity towards olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Moreover, as the temperature rises, the selectivity towards olefins enhances, and the formation of COx concurrently diminishes, suggesting a less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

          最近的研究表明，支持的碱金属氯化物熔体可以用作需要降低可接近金属离子表面浓度的应用的新一代催化剂。这些熔体提供了一个动态表面，有效减少了阳离子和阴离子的不饱和度，从而减少了它们与高度反应性产品的相互作用。在各种催化剂中，选择性到烯烃的顺序是Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。此外，随着温度的升高，烯烃的选择性增加，COx的形成同时减少，这表明在这些条件下，对烯烃的再吸附程度较低。

          [1] "For oxidative dehydrogenation, the present systems relies on metal cations that do not change their oxidation state, but facilitate the redox cycle by allowing the formation of a sizable concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen."
          [2] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
          [3] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
          [4] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."

          Oxidative dehydrogenation processes typically depend on metal cations that maintain their oxidation state but support the redox cycle through the formation of a significant concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen. The selectivity to olefins among the catalysts follows the order: Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The highest selectivity for ethene (94%) during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene (70%) during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is achieved above the temperature at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts, with the concentration remaining nearly constant afterwards. As temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins improves, paralleling a reduction in COx formation.

          氧化脱氢化过程通常依赖于保持氧化态不变但通过氧存在下形成大量氯酸根离子来支持氧化还原循环的金属离子。催化剂对烯烃的选择性顺序为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。在熔融碱金属氯化物相温度之上，实现最大选择性：乙烷氧化脱氢化时的乙烯（94%）和丙烷氧化脱氢化时的丙烯（70%），之后熔点保持几乎不变。随着温度升高，烯烃的选择性增加，COx的形成同时减少。

          [1] "The highest activity was found for Li-MD (5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K)."
          [2] "Substitution of Li+ by higher alkali metal ions resulted in a marked decrease in catalytic activity."

          The study has identified Li-MD as the catalyst with the highest activity at a rate of 5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K. Replacing Li+ with higher alkali metal ions led to a notable decline in catalytic activity. The ranking of the catalysts with respect to olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. As temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins improves, while the formation of COx simultaneously decreases, indicating a reduced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

          [1] "Three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts."

          The ranking of the catalysts with respect to olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Under reaction conditions where the alkali metal chloride phase is molten, catalysts exhibit significantly higher olefin selectivities compared to those containing solid chlorides. As the temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins rises, while the formation of COx decreases in tandem, suggesting a reduced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.
