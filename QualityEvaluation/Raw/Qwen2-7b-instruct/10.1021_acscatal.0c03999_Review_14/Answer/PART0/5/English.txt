The ranking of the catalysts with respect to olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Under reaction conditions where the alkali metal chloride phase is molten, catalysts exhibit significantly higher olefin selectivities compared to those containing solid chlorides. As the temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins rises, while the formation of COx decreases in tandem, suggesting a reduced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

Chromium oxide supported on silica or alumina has traditionally been utilized in industrial processes for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of their respective alkanes. More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metals were tested on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), with chromium showing the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a high yield of propene (above 15%) with a high selectivity (above 90%). When the chromium loading was altered on MCM-41-DHT, the pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area with increased chromium content. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR.
