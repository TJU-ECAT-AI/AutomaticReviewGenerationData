          [1] "Fe-zeolites have gained great interest in view of their excellent catalytic performance in various environmental applications and in selective oxidation for chemical production [15]."
          [2] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 and FeBEA showcase significantly higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA catalysts, despite having 30-40 times less iron content."
          [4] "The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe)."
          [5] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [6] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

          Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have demonstrated the efficiency of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have shown remarkable catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, the field faces persistent challenges, notably corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The deactivation of catalysts through coke formation is a significant hurdle, as coke blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, reducing propene yield. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程已经证明了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的效率。铁沸石，特别是FeZSM-5和FeBEA，显示出惊人的催化活性，在723 K时可实现高达25%的丙烯产率。然而，该领域面临持续的挑战，尤其是腐蚀和过程本身的固有性质。催化剂通过焦炭形成而失活是一个重大的障碍，因为焦炭堵塞了沸石孔系统中的活性反应位点，减少了丙烯产率。在ODHP过程中表现出显著抗失活能力的ex-FeZSM-5中的焦炭含量是ex-Fe-silicalite和完全失活的ex-FeBEA的3倍。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。通过改善催化剂的开放结构、通过脱硅开发微孔以及探索更开放的孔架构，有可能减少焦炭堵塞孔隙并促进更好的反应物和产品传输，从而减轻失活。

          Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of soft oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes. Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion, enabling the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant and relatively inexpensive feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, in particular, have shown high activity and selectivity in the ODHP of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The deactivation of these catalysts through coke formation is a significant challenge, as it reduces the propene yield by blocking active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Future research should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might include refining the catalyst design to better facilitate reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts, and their nature and distribution, along with the zeolite host and catalyst acidity, have little impact on the initial propene yield but significantly influence the deactivation behavior. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework, which facilitates better transport of reactants and products and reduces the risk of coke formation.

          最近的研究表明，使用软氧化剂如N2O进行氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程的有效性。主要组分金属氧化物，特别是铁沸石，被发现是这种转换的高效催化剂，允许同时利用丰富且相对便宜的丙烷和有害环境气体N2O。特别地，蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在使用N2O进行ODHP时显示出高活性和选择性，可以在723 K时实现高达25%的丙烯产率和400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat的空间速度。通过焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个重大挑战，因为它通过堵塞沸石孔系统中的活性反应位点降低了丙烯产率。ex-FeZSM-5中的焦炭含量是ex-Fe-silicalite和完全失活的ex-FeBEA的3倍，ex-FeZSM-5表现出显著的抗失活能力。未来的研究应该集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程的效率。可能的策略包括改进催化剂设计以更好地促进反应动力学、开发更坚固的催化剂支持，并探索减少焦炭形成和增强产品选择性的替代反应条件。在蒸汽处理过程中产生的额外框架铁物种对于产生活性催化剂是必不可少的，它们的性质和分布、沸石载体和催化剂酸度对初始丙烯产率影响较小，但显著影响失活行为。蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5在使用N2O进行ODHP时的高抗失活性可能归因于沸石框架的独特铁构成和孔隙结构，这有利于反应物和产品的更好传输，并降低焦炭形成的风险。
