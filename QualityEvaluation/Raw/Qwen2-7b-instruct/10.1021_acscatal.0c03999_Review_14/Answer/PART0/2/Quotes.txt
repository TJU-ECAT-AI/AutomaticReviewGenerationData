          [3] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
          [4] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."

[1] "Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K, but they deactivate due to coke formation."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
          [3] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."

          [6] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

          [16] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."

          [17] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
          [2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
          [3] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
          [4] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."
          [5] "This result revealed that the deactivation of the Cr/Si catalyst was affected mainly by the transformation of active sites rather than coke deposition."

[1] "Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K, but they deactivate due to coke formation."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
          [3] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
          [4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."

[1] "We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal."
          [2] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
          [3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."
          [4] "CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date."

          [6] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

          [15] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."
          [16] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."

          [3] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
          [4] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."

[1] "We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal."
          [2] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
          [3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."

          [6] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

          [11] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [12] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [13] "The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account."
          [14] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [15] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."
          [16] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite [13], which is confirmed attending to the higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2."
          [17] "This has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex- FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite [14,20]."
