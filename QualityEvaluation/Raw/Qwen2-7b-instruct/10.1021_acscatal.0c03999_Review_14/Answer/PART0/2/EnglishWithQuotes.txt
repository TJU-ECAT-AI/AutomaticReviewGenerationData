More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metals were tested on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), with chromium showing the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a high yield of propene (above 15%) with a high selectivity (above 90%). When the chromium loading was altered on MCM-41-DHT, the pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area with increased chromium content. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},

Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, with values ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. The literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields. The propane conversion rates are significantly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The role of gas phase sulfur (S2) in replenishing surface sulfur vacancies is highlighted, as evidenced by the zero-order dependence of S2 on S-ZrO2, which implies that gas phase sulfur is involved after the rate-determining step. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was investigated by modifying the contact time of the gas feed, revealing that the severity of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity is catalyst-dependent. The intrinsic properties of the sulfide that govern the catalytic activity in SODHP reactions are of particular interest, given the strong dependence of the catalytic properties on the identity of the metal sulfide. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the binding energy decreases, as depicted in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CY01039A"},

Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion, enabling the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant and relatively inexpensive feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, in particular, have shown high activity and selectivity in the ODHP of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The deactivation of these catalysts through coke formation is a significant challenge, as it reduces the propene yield by blocking active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Future research should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might include refining the catalyst design to better facilitate reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts, and their nature and distribution, along with the zeolite host and catalyst acidity, have little impact on the initial propene yield but significantly influence the deactivation behavior. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework, which facilitates better transport of reactants and products and reduces the risk of coke formation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
