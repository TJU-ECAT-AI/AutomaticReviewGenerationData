Propylene, a key chemical in the petrochemical industry, serves as a precursor for the production of valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. The introduction of Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst improves the ODHP process by inducing the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. This leads to a high-stable catalyst with enhanced activity and selectivity, maintaining the active phase of Cr3+ states and reducing catalyst deactivation.

Iron zeolites are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures between 723-773 K. However, they are prone to deactivation due to the formation of coke, which can significantly affect their performance. The exceptional efficiency of iron zeolites can be attributed to the unique role of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms within the zeolite structure to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, thereby efficiently dehydrogenating propane. The reversibility of catalyst deactivation has facilitated the development of a cyclic operation process for continuous propene production, which alternates between reaction and regeneration phases. In a setup employing two parallel fixed-bed reactors utilizing FeZSM-5, stable propene yields greater than 20% were observed over a 2000-minute cycle, with reaction and regeneration temperatures set at 723 K and 823 K, respectively. This catalytic process not only optimizes the conversion of both propane (C3H8) and N2O but also offers a cost-effective solution for on-site propylene production, particularly when utilizing low-cost sources of N2O found in the tail-gases of chemical processes where high concentrations of N2O are generated.

Various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been assessed for their selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges such as corrosion resistance and maintaining catalyst stability are ongoing. Future research is focused on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems for more efficient ODHP processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation processes typically depend on metal cations that maintain their oxidation state but support the redox cycle through the formation of a significant concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen. The selectivity to olefins among the catalysts follows the order: Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The highest selectivity for ethene (94%) during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene (70%) during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is achieved above the temperature at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts, with the concentration remaining nearly constant afterwards. As temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins improves, paralleling a reduction in COx formation.

Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been explored on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, with a particular emphasis on the production of CO and CH4. The significant difference in nickel particle size between the two loadings impacts the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At a lower Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation, with a strong preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading is increased to 10 wt% (approximately 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4 formation. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are hypothesized to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

A thorough evaluation of transition metal phosphates (MPO, where M represents Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination has been conducted, highlighting significant variations in reactivity and product distribution dependent on the metal involved. The activity of the catalysts followed the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, with the selectivity for propylene ranking as CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion rate of 5-20%. Four distinct categories of catalysts have been discerned based on the preferred end product: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO). Among these, CrPO, demonstrating stability over 60 hours of continuous operation, was identified as the most selective system for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts reported so far. This stability was confirmed through detailed characterization employing X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which revealed no changes in structure and morphology after extended operation. The phosphates' reactivity is contingent on their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while a high propylene selectivity is the result of rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibited generation of molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced likelihood of propane cracking and combustion.

Chromium oxide supported on silica or alumina has traditionally been utilized in industrial processes for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of their respective alkanes. More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metals were tested on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), with chromium showing the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a high yield of propene (above 15%) with a high selectivity (above 90%). When the chromium loading was altered on MCM-41-DHT, the pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area with increased chromium content. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR.

For a group of six metal sulfide catalysts, the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, which range from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, indicating that the strength of the metal-sulfur bond plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, with values ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. The literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields. The propane conversion rates are significantly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The role of gas phase sulfur (S2) in replenishing surface sulfur vacancies is highlighted, as evidenced by the zero-order dependence of S2 on S-ZrO2, which implies that gas phase sulfur is involved after the rate-determining step. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was investigated by modifying the contact time of the gas feed, revealing that the severity of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity is catalyst-dependent. The intrinsic properties of the sulfide that govern the catalytic activity in SODHP reactions are of particular interest, given the strong dependence of the catalytic properties on the identity of the metal sulfide. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the binding energy decreases, as depicted in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen is an exothermic process. Catalysts containing ruthenium also demonstrate good performance in reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is considered the most direct and selective method for producing propylene. The Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion. A yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides. The highest selectivity (94-96%) was achieved at 200°C over the PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at a conversion rate of about 20%. Formed HCl was proposed to be oxidized by oxygen back to Cl2 (the Deacon reaction), which has been a thermodynamically complex challenge due to the lack of effective catalysts for this process.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of soft oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes. Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion, enabling the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant and relatively inexpensive feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, in particular, have shown high activity and selectivity in the ODHP of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The deactivation of these catalysts through coke formation is a significant challenge, as it reduces the propene yield by blocking active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Future research should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might include refining the catalyst design to better facilitate reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts, and their nature and distribution, along with the zeolite host and catalyst acidity, have little impact on the initial propene yield but significantly influence the deactivation behavior. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework, which facilitates better transport of reactants and products and reduces the risk of coke formation.

Propylene, a key chemical in the petrochemical industry, serves as a precursor for the production of valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. The introduction of Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst improves the ODHP process by inducing the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. This leads to a high-stable catalyst with enhanced activity and selectivity, maintaining the active phase of Cr3+ states and reducing catalyst deactivation.

Iron zeolites are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures between 723-773 K. However, they are prone to deactivation due to the formation of coke, which can significantly affect their performance. The exceptional efficiency of iron zeolites can be attributed to the unique role of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms within the zeolite structure to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, thereby efficiently dehydrogenating propane. The reversibility of catalyst deactivation has facilitated the development of a cyclic operation process for continuous propene production, which alternates between reaction and regeneration phases. In a setup employing two parallel fixed-bed reactors utilizing FeZSM-5, stable propene yields greater than 20% were observed over a 2000-minute cycle, with reaction and regeneration temperatures set at 723 K and 823 K, respectively. This catalytic process not only optimizes the conversion of both propane (C3H8) and N2O but also offers a cost-effective solution for on-site propylene production, particularly when utilizing low-cost sources of N2O found in the tail-gases of chemical processes where high concentrations of N2O are generated.

Various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been assessed for their selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges such as corrosion resistance and maintaining catalyst stability are ongoing. Future research is focused on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems for more efficient ODHP processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation processes typically depend on metal cations that maintain their oxidation state but support the redox cycle through the formation of a significant concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen. The selectivity to olefins among the catalysts follows the order: Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The highest selectivity for ethene (94%) during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene (70%) during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is achieved above the temperature at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts, with the concentration remaining nearly constant afterwards. As temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins improves, paralleling a reduction in COx formation.

Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been explored on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, with a particular emphasis on the production of CO and CH4. The significant difference in nickel particle size between the two loadings impacts the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At a lower Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation, with a strong preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading is increased to 10 wt% (approximately 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4 formation. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are hypothesized to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

A thorough evaluation of transition metal phosphates (MPO, where M represents Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination has been conducted, highlighting significant variations in reactivity and product distribution dependent on the metal involved. The activity of the catalysts followed the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, with the selectivity for propylene ranking as CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion rate of 5-20%. Four distinct categories of catalysts have been discerned based on the preferred end product: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO). Among these, CrPO, demonstrating stability over 60 hours of continuous operation, was identified as the most selective system for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts reported so far. This stability was confirmed through detailed characterization employing X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which revealed no changes in structure and morphology after extended operation. The phosphates' reactivity is contingent on their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while a high propylene selectivity is the result of rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibited generation of molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced likelihood of propane cracking and combustion.

Chromium oxide supported on silica or alumina has traditionally been utilized in industrial processes for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of their respective alkanes. More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metals were tested on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), with chromium showing the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a high yield of propene (above 15%) with a high selectivity (above 90%). When the chromium loading was altered on MCM-41-DHT, the pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area with increased chromium content. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR.

For a group of six metal sulfide catalysts, the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, which range from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, indicating that the strength of the metal-sulfur bond plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, with values ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. The literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields. The propane conversion rates are significantly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The role of gas phase sulfur (S2) in replenishing surface sulfur vacancies is highlighted, as evidenced by the zero-order dependence of S2 on S-ZrO2, which implies that gas phase sulfur is involved after the rate-determining step. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was investigated by modifying the contact time of the gas feed, revealing that the severity of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity is catalyst-dependent. The intrinsic properties of the sulfide that govern the catalytic activity in SODHP reactions are of particular interest, given the strong dependence of the catalytic properties on the identity of the metal sulfide. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the binding energy decreases, as depicted in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen is an exothermic process. Catalysts containing ruthenium also demonstrate good performance in reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is considered the most direct and selective method for producing propylene. The Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion. A yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides. The highest selectivity (94-96%) was achieved at 200°C over the PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at a conversion rate of about 20%. Formed HCl was proposed to be oxidized by oxygen back to Cl2 (the Deacon reaction), which has been a thermodynamically complex challenge due to the lack of effective catalysts for this process.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of soft oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes. Main group element metal oxides, particularly iron zeolites, have been found to be efficient catalysts for this conversion, enabling the simultaneous valorization of propane, an abundant and relatively inexpensive feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, in particular, have shown high activity and selectivity in the ODHP of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The deactivation of these catalysts through coke formation is a significant challenge, as it reduces the propene yield by blocking active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Future research should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. Strategies might include refining the catalyst design to better facilitate reaction kinetics, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring alternative reaction conditions that minimize coke formation and enhance product selectivity. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts, and their nature and distribution, along with the zeolite host and catalyst acidity, have little impact on the initial propene yield but significantly influence the deactivation behavior.

The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts, and their nature and distribution, along with the zeolite host and catalyst acidity, have little impact on the initial propene yield but significantly influence the deactivation behavior. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O might be attributed to the unique iron constitution and porosity of the zeolite framework, which facilitates better transport of reactants and products and reduces the risk of coke formation.
