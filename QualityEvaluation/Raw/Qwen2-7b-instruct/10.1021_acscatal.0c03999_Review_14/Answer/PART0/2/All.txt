Four distinct categories of catalysts have been discerned based on the preferred end product: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO). Among these, CrPO, demonstrating stability over 60 hours of continuous operation, was identified as the most selective system for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts reported so far. This stability was confirmed through detailed characterization employing X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which revealed no changes in structure and morphology after extended operation. The phosphates' reactivity is contingent on their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while a high propylene selectivity is the result of rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibited generation of molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced likelihood of propane cracking and combustion.", "Chinese": "对于过渡金属磷酸盐（MPO，M代表Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Cu）作为丙烷氧氯化催化剂的全面评估揭示了反应活性和产物分布之间的显著差异，这些差异依赖于所涉及的金属。催化剂的活性按照以下顺序排列：CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO，在5-20%丙烷转化率下，丙烯选择性排名为CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%)。根据所偏好生成的最终产品，已识别出四种不同的催化剂类别：丙烯（CrPO）、裂解产物（MnPO、NiPO、TiPO、CoPO）、氯化烃（CuPO）或二氧化碳（VPO）。其中，CrPO在连续运行超过60小时的情况下表现出稳定性，被确认为最具选择性的丙烷氧氯化（POC）催化剂系统，能够达到高达50%的丙烯产率，与迄今为止报告的顶级催化剂相抗衡。这种稳定性通过采用X射线衍射、拉曼和X射线光电子能谱，以及扫描和高分辨率透射电子显微镜的详细表征得到证实，在长时间运行后结构和形态没有变化。磷化物的活性取决于其从表面释放氯的能力，而高度的丙烯选择性则归因于快速脱氯化动力学与抑制气体相中分子氯生成能力的结合，以及对丙烷裂解和燃烧倾向的减少。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.9b01315"},
