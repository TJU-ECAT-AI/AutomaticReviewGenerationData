Three key factors are identified as contributing to the superior selectivity towards olefins: 
          1. The low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts, which reduces interactions with highly reactive products.
          2. The high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, which diminishes interactions with olefins.
          3. The spatial separation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt.
