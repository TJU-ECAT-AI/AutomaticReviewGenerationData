During the reaction, propane (C3H8) is converted to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are then reoxidized by CO2, leading to a critical reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a pivotal role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.", "Chinese": "在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）时，从还原的铬酸根八面体（Cr3+Og）再生铬六价氧四面体（Cr6+C>4）不仅可以通过氧气（O2），也可以通过二氧化碳（CO2），这是由热重分析（TPR）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱得到的结论。在反应过程中，丙烷（C3H8）通过Cr6+O4四面体转化为丙烯（C3H6），同时被还原为Cr3+Og八面体。然后，还原的Cr3+Og八面体由CO2氧化，导致一个关键的还原-氧化循环，这对CO2条件下Cr-MCM-41上的丙烷脱氢起到关键作用。", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
