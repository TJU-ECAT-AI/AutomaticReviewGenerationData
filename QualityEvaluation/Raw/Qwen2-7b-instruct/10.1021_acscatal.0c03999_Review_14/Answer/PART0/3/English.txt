Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. However, the addition of Ni to the catalyst can induce the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), regenerating the reduced CrOx. This promotional activation of CO2 is attributed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst. The role of Ni as a promoter in the reaction is detailed through exsitu XPS measurements.

The study has identified Li-MD as the catalyst with the highest activity at a rate of 5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K. Replacing Li+ with higher alkali metal ions led to a notable decline in catalytic activity. The ranking of the catalysts with respect to olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. As temperature increases, the selectivity towards olefins improves, while the formation of COx simultaneously decreases, indicating a reduced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

The performance of the catalysts in propane oxychlorination decreases in the sequence: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, with the selectivity towards propylene ranking as CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion level of 5-20%. To ensure accurate evaluation, the materials were stabilized for more than 5 hours under the reaction conditions to minimize any potential impact from catalyst restructuring. The selectivity profiles across the catalysts were analyzed at approximately 20% propane conversion. It was observed that the high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) remains stable across a wide temperature range (673-773 K) and varying alkane feed concentration (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl content (1.5-15 vol.). Furthermore, the catalyst's performance was tested over an extended period under moderate propane conversion, demonstrating its stable catalytic activity for over 60 hours in propane oxychlorination (POC). Notably, despite MnPO exhibited the lowest chlorine evolution efficiency and combustion tendency similar to CrPO, its high propensity for propane cracking and moderate C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination capability constrained the C3H6 selectivity in the POC process.

The regeneration of chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst is facilitated not only by oxygen (O2) but also by carbon dioxide (CO2), as indicated by the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. During the reaction, propane (C3H8) is converted to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are then reoxidized by CO2, leading to a critical reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a pivotal role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.
