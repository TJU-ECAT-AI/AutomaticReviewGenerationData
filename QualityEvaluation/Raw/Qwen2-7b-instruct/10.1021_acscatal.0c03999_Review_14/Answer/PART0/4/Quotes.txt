[1] "Three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts."
          [2] "The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins."
          [3] "The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

[1] "The high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be preserved over a broad range of temperatures (673-773 K) and feed concentration of alkane (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl (1.5-15 vol.)."
          [2] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
          [3] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."
