Three factors are believed to explain the high selectivity towards olefins: 
          1. The low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts, which minimizes interactions with highly reactive products.
          2. The high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, which reduces interactions with olefins.
          3. The spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt.

High C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be maintained over a wide range of temperatures (673-773 K) and alkane feed concentration (1.5-6 vol.%) along with HCl content (1.5-15 vol.). Despite MnPO displayed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency akin to CrPO, its high propensity for propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties constrained C3H6 selectivity in propane oxychlorination (POC). Lastly, the low C3H6 selectivity observed during POC over CuPO and VPO can be attributed to their similar hindrance in dehydrochlorination processes and their respective high Cl2 generation tendency, which explains the formation of coke and their strong inclination towards combustion.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with the use of various catalyst systems, particularly transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The study indicates that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, in particular, exhibit high activity in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, with yields above 15% and selectivities above 90% for propene production. The selectivity to CO from CO2 during the dehydrogenation process over Cr-MCM-41 is also highlighted, demonstrating the potential for efficient CO2 utilization.
