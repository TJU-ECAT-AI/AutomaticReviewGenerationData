Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts. Transition metal catalysts, especially those containing chromium (Cr), show high activity due to the ability to form active Cr3+ sites. However, the reduction of these active sites during the reaction often leads to severe deactivation. The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter enhances the catalytic activity by increasing the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states. This results in the successful production of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

Recent studies have delved into the use of soft oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential pathway to produce alkenes. Transition metals like iron, when utilized in zeolite form, have shown remarkable efficiency in converting propane to propene through the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant. Iron-zeolites, particularly iron zeolites of types FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, have demonstrated high catalytic activity, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K. The reversible nature of catalyst deactivation has opened up possibilities for a cyclic process that allows for continuous propene production by alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles. This process has been successfully demonstrated using FeZSM-5, where propene yields exceeding 20% were obtained over a duration of 2000 minutes, utilizing two fixed-bed reactors that operate in parallel, with one reactor undergoing reaction at 723 K while the other undergoes regeneration at 823 K.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using soft oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and the use of nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction for CO2 mitigation.

Recent studies have revealed that supported alkali metal chloride melts can serve as innovative catalysts for applications requiring a minimized surface concentration of accessible metal cations. These melts offer a dynamic surface that effectively minimizes the unsaturation of both cations and anions, thereby reducing their interaction with highly reactive products. Among various catalysts, the order of selectivity towards olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Moreover, as the temperature rises, the selectivity towards olefins enhances, and the formation of COx concurrently diminishes, suggesting a less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

The large difference in nickel particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% loadings significantly impacts the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At lower Ni loading, the catalyst exhibits higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation with a preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading increases to 10 wt% (around 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface. There are two types of reaction pathways: consecutive and parallel, with the former favored by small Ni clusters and the latter by larger Ni particles. The m-HCOO intermediate undergoes competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 in the parallel pathway. A formate species in a monodentate configuration plays a crucial role in CO2 hydrogenation across Ni/SiO2 catalysts, irrespective of Ni loading and particle size.

A comprehensive research effort has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, with notable examples being iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2). These catalysts have achieved propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% respectively, with high selectivity ranging from 80% to 98%. However, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries. Metal phosphates are deemed a feasible solution because they encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, altering the bond lengths and electronic properties compared to bulk metal oxides. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) stands out as the most selective system, capable of yielding propylene with efficiency rivaling that of the best catalysts reported. Its remarkable stability was substantiated through extensive characterization methods, revealing no changes in structure and morphology post-long-term operation. The phosphates' reactivity is determined by their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while high propylene selectivity is a result of swift dehydrochlorination kinetics, coupled with an inhibited capability to produce molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced tendency towards propane cracking and combustion.

Recent studies have shown that both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. This process involves the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, creating a crucial reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a significant role in the ODHP process over Cr-MCM-41.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as gaseous elemental sulfur (S2), have shown promise in suppressing the overoxidation to COx that typically occurs with oxygen (O2). Studies on a group of six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, ranging from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, emphasizing the critical role of the metal-sulfur bond strength in the SODHP process. Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, from 86% with S-ZrO2 to 38% with PdS. These findings indicate that sulfur vapor can effectively serve as an oxidant for ODHP, suggesting the potential for a new, promising route to propylene production. Propane conversion rates are highly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The wide range of propylene selectivity, from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS, highlights the importance of catalyst selection in achieving optimal results. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was explored through adjustments in the gas feed contact time, and it was noted that reaction rates cannot easily be compared across all six catalysts due to the inability to accurately measure active site density and sulfide surface area. The current results encourage further investigation of SODHP as a selective and efficient method for producing propylene. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the sulfur binding energy decreases, as illustrated in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.

The main challenge in applying oxidative dehydrogenation of propane industrially is the requirement for high temperatures to increase olefin equilibrium concentration, given that the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. Researchers have studied oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular chlorine in a flow reactor with a fixed bed of catalysts, employing a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures ranging from 150 to 450 degrees Celsius. It was found that a Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] demonstrated the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion, with a consumption turnover frequency of 45 × 10^3 s^-1. However, achieving high yields remains challenging, with the best-known yield reaching 35%, which is insufficient for economic feasibility. The total enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is merely 60.34 kJ/mol, which simplifies the task of waste heat utilization.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have demonstrated the efficiency of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have shown remarkable catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, the field faces persistent challenges, notably corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The deactivation of catalysts through coke formation is a significant hurdle, as coke blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, reducing propene yield. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation.

At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion, with a consumption turnover frequency of 45 × 10^3 s^-1. However, achieving high yields remains challenging, with the best-known yield reaching 35%, which is insufficient for economic feasibility. The total enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is merely 60.34 kJ/mol, which simplifies the task of waste heat utilization.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have demonstrated the efficiency of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Iron-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, have shown remarkable catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, the field faces persistent challenges, notably corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of the process. The deactivation of catalysts through coke formation is a significant hurdle, as coke blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, reducing propene yield. The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts. Transition metal catalysts, especially those containing chromium (Cr), show high activity due to the ability to form active Cr3+ sites. However, the reduction of these active sites during the reaction often leads to severe deactivation. The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter enhances the catalytic activity by increasing the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states. This results in the successful production of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

Recent studies have delved into the use of soft oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential pathway to produce alkenes. Transition metals like iron, when utilized in zeolite form, have shown remarkable efficiency in converting propane to propene through the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant. Iron-zeolites, particularly iron zeolites of types FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, have demonstrated high catalytic activity, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K. The reversible nature of catalyst deactivation has opened up possibilities for a cyclic process that allows for continuous propene production by alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles. This process has been successfully demonstrated using FeZSM-5, where propene yields exceeding 20% were obtained over a duration of 2000 minutes, utilizing two fixed-bed reactors that operate in parallel, with one reactor undergoing reaction at 723 K while the other undergoes regeneration at 823 K.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using soft oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and the use of nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction for CO2 mitigation.

Recent studies have revealed that supported alkali metal chloride melts can serve as innovative catalysts for applications requiring a minimized surface concentration of accessible metal cations. These melts offer a dynamic surface that effectively minimizes the unsaturation of both cations and anions, thereby reducing their interaction with highly reactive products. Among various catalysts, the order of selectivity towards olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Moreover, as the temperature rises, the selectivity towards olefins enhances, and the formation of COx concurrently diminishes, suggesting a less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

The large difference in nickel particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% loadings significantly impacts the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation, the pathways for CO and CH4 formation, and the reaction selectivity. At lower Ni loading, the catalyst exhibits higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation with a preference for CO formation. When the Ni loading increases to 10 wt% (around 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts to favor CH4. The active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be located at kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface. There are two types of reaction pathways: consecutive and parallel, with the former favored by small Ni clusters and the latter by larger Ni particles. The m-HCOO intermediate undergoes competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4 in the parallel pathway. A formate species in a monodentate configuration plays a crucial role in CO2 hydrogenation across Ni/SiO2 catalysts, irrespective of Ni loading and particle size.

A comprehensive research effort has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, with notable examples being iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2). These catalysts have achieved propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% respectively, with high selectivity ranging from 80% to 98%. However, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries. Metal phosphates are deemed a feasible solution because they encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, altering the bond lengths and electronic properties compared to bulk metal oxides. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) stands out as the most selective system, capable of yielding propylene with efficiency rivaling that of the best catalysts reported. Its remarkable stability was substantiated through extensive characterization methods, revealing no changes in structure and morphology post-long-term operation. The phosphates' reactivity is determined by their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while high propylene selectivity is a result of swift dehydrochlorination kinetics, coupled with an inhibited capability to produce molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced tendency towards propane cracking and combustion.

Recent studies have shown that both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. This process involves the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, creating a crucial reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a significant role in the ODHP process over Cr-MCM-41.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as gaseous elemental sulfur (S2), have shown promise in suppressing the overoxidation to COx that typically occurs with oxygen (O2). Studies on a group of six metal sulfide catalysts have revealed that the apparent activation energies for propylene formation, ranging from 72-134 kJ/mol, correlate with the sulfur binding energies of the catalysts, emphasizing the critical role of the metal-sulfur bond strength in the SODHP process. Propylene selectivities vary significantly among catalysts, from 86% with S-ZrO2 to 38% with PdS. These findings indicate that sulfur vapor can effectively serve as an oxidant for ODHP, suggesting the potential for a new, promising route to propylene production. Propane conversion rates are highly dependent on the catalyst used, with values ranging from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550°C. The wide range of propylene selectivity, from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS, highlights the importance of catalyst selection in achieving optimal results. The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was explored through adjustments in the gas feed contact time, and it was noted that reaction rates cannot easily be compared across all six catalysts due to the inability to accurately measure active site density and sulfide surface area. The current results encourage further investigation of SODHP as a selective and efficient method for producing propylene. The decrease in apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation as the sulfur binding energy decreases, as illustrated in Figure 8, underscores the importance of weaker metal-sulfur bonding in enhancing catalytic activity.

The main challenge in applying oxidative dehydrogenation of propane industrially is the requirement for high temperatures to increase olefin equilibrium concentration, given that the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. Researchers have studied oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular chlorine in a flow reactor with a fixed bed of catalysts, employing a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures ranging from 150 to 450 degrees Celsius.
