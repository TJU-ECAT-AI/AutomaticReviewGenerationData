The coke content in ex-FeZSM-5, which exhibited remarkable resistance against deactivation, was 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Improving the open structure of catalysts, developing mesopores through desilication, and exploring more open pore architectures could potentially reduce pore blocking by coke and facilitate better transport of reactants and products, thereby mitigating deactivation.", "Chinese": "使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程已经证明了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的效率。铁沸石，特别是FeZSM-5和FeBEA，显示出惊人的催化活性，在723 K时可实现高达25%的丙烯产率。然而，该领域面临持续的挑战，尤其是腐蚀和过程本身的固有性质。催化剂通过焦炭形成而失活是一个重大的障碍，因为焦炭堵塞了沸石孔系统中的活性反应位点，减少了丙烯产率。在ODHP过程中表现出显著抗失活能力的ex-FeZSM-5中的焦炭含量是ex-Fe-silicalite和完全失活的ex-FeBEA的3倍。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。通过改善催化剂的开放结构、通过脱硅开发微孔以及探索更开放的孔架构，有可能减少焦炭堵塞孔隙并促进更好的反应物和产品传输，从而减轻失活。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
