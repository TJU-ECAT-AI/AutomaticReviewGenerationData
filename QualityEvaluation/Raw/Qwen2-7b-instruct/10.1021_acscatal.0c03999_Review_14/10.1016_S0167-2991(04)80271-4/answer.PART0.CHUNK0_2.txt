[1] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."
[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra."
[3] "The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

1. The study highlights the role of both oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in regenerating the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra, as demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. 

2. During the reaction, propane (C3H8) is dehydrogenated to propene (C3H6) by the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is concurrently reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. 

3. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is oxidized back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, illustrating a critical reduction-oxidation cycle in the dehydrogenation process with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst.

1. 研究强调了氧气(O2)和二氧化碳(CO2)在从还原的Cr3+Og八面体再生Cr6+O4四面体中的作用，这通过热重分析(TPR)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱得到了证实。

2. 在反应过程中，丙烷(C3H8)被Cr6+O4四面体脱氢生成丙烯(C3H6)，同时被还原为Cr3+Og八面体。

3. 还原的Cr3+Og八面体通过CO2氧化回Cr6+O4四面体，表明在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上使用CO2进行脱氢反应中，还原-氧化循环起着关键作用。
