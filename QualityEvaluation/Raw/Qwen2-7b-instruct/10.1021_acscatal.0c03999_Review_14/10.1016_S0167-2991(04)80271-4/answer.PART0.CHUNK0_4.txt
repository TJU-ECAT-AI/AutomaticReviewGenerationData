[1] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."
[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra."
[3] "The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on catalyst systems that include transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The study highlights the importance of structure-catalytic property relationships, where Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane. The mechanism involves Cr6+O4 tetrahedra reducing propane to C3H6, which is simultaneously oxidized back to Cr3+Og octahedra. CO2 plays a crucial role in this cycle, enabling the regeneration of active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra. Challenges in the field include corrosion resistance and optimizing catalyst regenerability, with future research aiming to improve C-H bond activation, develop more regenerative catalysts, and refine reaction systems to enhance the efficiency of ODHP processes.

近期在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究中，主要关注了过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物作为催化剂系统的应用。研究强调了结构-催化性能关系的重要性，在Cr-MCM-41催化剂中，其在CO2条件下对丙烷脱氢表现出高活性和选择性。机制表明，Cr6+O4四面体在还原丙烷至C3H6的同时，也被氧化回Cr3+Og八面体。CO2在这一循环中起着关键作用，能够再生活性的Cr6+O4四面体。该领域面临的挑战包括耐腐蚀性以及催化剂再生能力的优化，未来的研究方向旨在改进C-H键活化、开发更可再生的催化剂以及完善反应系统，以提高ODHP过程的效率。
