          Recent studies have shown that both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. This process involves the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, creating a crucial reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a significant role in the ODHP process over Cr-MCM-41.

          最近的研究表明，在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）时，氧气和二氧化碳都能从还原的铬酸根八面体（Cr3+Og）再生铬六价氧四面体（Cr6+C>4）。这一过程涉及丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢转化为丙烯（C3H6），由Cr6+O4四面体完成，同时将Cr3+Og八面体还原。还原的Cr3+Og八面体通过二氧化碳被重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，形成了一个关键的还原-氧化循环，对Cr-MCM-41上的ODHP过程至关重要。

          Chromium oxide supported on silica or alumina has traditionally been utilized in industrial processes for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of their respective alkanes. More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metals were tested on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), with chromium showing the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a high yield of propene (above 15%) with a high selectivity (above 90%). When the chromium loading was altered on MCM-41-DHT, the pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area with increased chromium content. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR.

          The regeneration of chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst is facilitated not only by oxygen (O2) but also by carbon dioxide (CO2), as indicated by the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. During the reaction, propane (C3H8) is converted to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are then reoxidized by CO2, leading to a critical reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a pivotal role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.
