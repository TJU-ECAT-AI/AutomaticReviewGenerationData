[1] "Silica or alumina supported chromium oxide was industrially used for the productions of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes."
[2] "Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances."
[3] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."
[4] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[5] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
[6] "Cr-MCM-41 was prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, XANES, and EXAFS spectroscopic measurements."
[7] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a low surface area compared to Cr-MCM-41 and no detectable pore volume."
[8] "We have reported that only one kind of monochromate species was observed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, whereas several types of chromate species possibly including both monochromates and polychromates existed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method by UV Raman spectroscopy."
[9] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[10] "The results of TPR for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT (Si/Cr=50) sample are shown in Fig. 7. A peak observed between 350600 C (a) is probably due to the reduction of Cr6+,14 and disappeared in the second TPR (b)."

1. Chromium oxide supported on silica or alumina has traditionally been utilized in industrial processes for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of their respective alkanes. More recently, chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 has demonstrated good performance in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

2. The study evaluated the effectiveness of various metals (chromium, gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt) on MCM-41-DHT, finding that chromium had the highest activity for the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, with gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt following suit in decreasing order of activity.

3. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene production.

4. The pore diameter remained constant at 2.7 nm for Cr-MCM-41 catalysts up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite a decrease in both pore volume and surface area as the chromium content increased.

5. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized using the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method, and their structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy.

6. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts had a lower surface area compared to other catalysts and showed no detectable pore volume.

7. Only one type of monochromate species was identified on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the DHT method, while several types of chromate species, potentially including both monochromates and polychromates, were found on Cr-MCM-41 prepared via the template-ion exchange (TIE) method.

8. The XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41-DHT with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 revealed a weakened preedge peak and a shift to lower energy, suggesting that chromium changed from tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ after the reaction.

9. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample showed a peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6+, which disappeared in the second TPR, indicating the reduction of chromium.

10. The regeneration of the Cr6+ species after oxidation treatment with oxygen played a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

1. 铬氧化物支持在硅或铝酸盐上在工业中被用于通过烷烃的脱氢生产丙烯和异丁烯。最近，由浸渍方法制备的铬氧化物支持在SBA-15上已被应用于丙烷的脱氢和氧化脱氢，并表现出良好的催化性能。

8. Cr-MCM-41-DHT样品中硅/铬比为50的XANES光谱显示反应前的预边缘峰变弱，边缘位置向更低的能量移动，这表明铬从四面体配合的Cr6+转变为八面体配合的Cr3+。

9. Cr-MCM-41-DHT样品的温度程序还原（TPR）结果显示一个归因于Cr6+还原的峰值，在第二次TPR中消失，表明铬的还原。
