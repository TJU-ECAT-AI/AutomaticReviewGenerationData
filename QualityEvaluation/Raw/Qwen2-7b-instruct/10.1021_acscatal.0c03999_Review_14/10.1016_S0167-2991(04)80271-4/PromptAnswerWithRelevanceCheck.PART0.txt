Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with the use of various catalyst systems, particularly transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The study indicates that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, in particular, exhibit high activity in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, with yields above 15% and selectivities above 90% for propene production. The selectivity to CO from CO2 during the dehydrogenation process over Cr-MCM-41 is also highlighted, demonstrating the potential for efficient CO2 utilization.

A reduction-oxidation cycle involving Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41. The Cr6+O4 tetrahedra reduce to Cr3+Og octahedra during the reaction, which subsequently gets reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, thereby regenerating the active site. This cycle is responsible for the catalytic activity of the Cr-MCM-41 catalysts in the dehydrogenation process.

However, the field of ODHP faces persistent challenges, such as catalyst corrosion and inherent reaction properties. To improve the performance of ODHP processes, researchers should focus on developing strategies for better C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Future research efforts should aim to address these challenges and develop more efficient and durable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The persistent challenges in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reaction itself, which can lead to catalyst degradation. Efforts to address these challenges involve the development of more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and maintain their activity over multiple cycles.

Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation to facilitate more efficient conversion of propane to propene, enhancing the regenerability of catalysts to extend their operational life, and refining reaction systems to optimize the ODHP processes. Strategies for achieving these goals may involve the design of novel catalyst materials, the modification of existing catalyst supports, and the implementation of innovative reaction conditions that can promote the desired chemical transformations while minimizing side reactions and catalyst degradation.

最近，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷（ODHP）的氧化脱氢在使用不同催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）方面取得了有前景的结果。研究表明，Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2脱氢丙烷中表现出高活性，产率超过15%，选择性超过90%用于丙烯生产。在Cr-MCM-41上观察到从CO2选择性产生的CO也表明了有效利用CO2的可能性。

在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上的脱氢过程中，Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+Og八面体之间的还原-氧化循环起着关键作用。Cr6+O4四面体在反应期间转化为Cr3+Og八面体，随后通过CO2重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，从而再生活性位点。这一循环是Cr-MCM-41催化剂在脱氢过程中的催化活性的基础。

然而，ODHP领域面临持续的挑战，如催化剂腐蚀和反应本身的固有性质。为了提高ODHP过程的性能，研究者应集中于开发更好的C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂可再生性和优化反应系统。未来的研究努力应致力于解决这些挑战并开发更高效和耐用的催化剂来促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。

ODHP领域的持续挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性和反应本身的固有特性，这些可能导致催化剂降解。克服这些挑战的努力涉及开发能够承受苛刻条件且保持活动性的更坚固催化剂。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括改进C-H键活化以实现更高效的丙烷向丙烯转化、增强催化剂可再生性以延长其使用寿命以及优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。实现这些目标的策略可能包括设计新型催化剂材料、修改现有催化剂支撑物和实施能够促进所需化学转换同时减少副反应和催化剂降解的新反应条件。
