[1] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."
[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Recent studies have shown that both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate chromium hexa-oxo-tetrahedra (Cr6+C>4) from reduced chromium tri-oxy-octahedra (Cr3+Og) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. This process involves the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra are reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, creating a crucial reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a significant role in the ODHP process over Cr-MCM-41.

最近的研究表明，在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）时，氧气和二氧化碳都能从还原的铬酸根八面体（Cr3+Og）再生铬六价氧四面体（Cr6+C>4）。这一过程涉及丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢转化为丙烯（C3H6），由Cr6+O4四面体完成，同时将Cr3+Og八面体还原。还原的Cr3+Og八面体通过二氧化碳被重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，形成了一个关键的还原-氧化循环，对Cr-MCM-41上的ODHP过程至关重要。
