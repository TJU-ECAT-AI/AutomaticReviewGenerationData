Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is characterized by their ability to selectively convert propane into olefins with high yields. The Li/Dy/MgO catalyst, in particular, has shown exceptional performance, achieving up to 50% yield of olefin (propene and ethene) from propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking. 

A key feature of the reaction kinetics is that alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting serves as the rate-determining step for all products. The presence of gas-phase oxygen is crucial for propane conversion, enhancing the reaction rates significantly. Conversely, carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the catalyst activity for all products, blocking active sites by forming Li+CO3.

Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends indicate that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. The gas-phase radical chemistry plays a dominant role in determining the selectivity pattern of the products. 

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalyst materials and the inherent properties of the reaction itself, which can limit catalyst longevity and efficiency. Future research directions include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to address these challenges. Strategies might involve developing more stable catalyst materials, refining catalyst synthesis methods, and exploring novel reaction conditions to maximize product yields and minimize side reactions.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展涉及到各种催化剂系统的使用，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。这些催化剂的性能通过其选择性将丙烷转化为烯烃的能力来表征。特别是Li/Dy/MgO催化剂已经显示出出色的表现，从丙烷氧化脱氢和裂解中实现了高达50%的烯烃（丙烯和乙烯）产率。

反应动力学的关键特征是，所有产物的烷基化通过C-H键断裂作为速率决定步骤。气体相氧的存在对于丙烷的转化至关重要，显著提高了反应速率。相反，二氧化碳对催化剂的所有产品具有强烈的抑制作用，通过形成Li+CO3阻塞活性位点。

从乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势可以看出，烷烃中的氢原子抽象是速率决定步骤。气体相自由基化学在确定产品选择性模式方面起着主导作用。

这一领域的挑战包括某些催化剂材料的腐蚀性和反应本身的固有性质，这可以限制催化剂的使用寿命和效率。未来的研究方向包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以解决这些挑战。可能的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂材料、改进催化剂合成方法以及探索新的反应条件以最大限度地提高产品产率并减少副反应。
