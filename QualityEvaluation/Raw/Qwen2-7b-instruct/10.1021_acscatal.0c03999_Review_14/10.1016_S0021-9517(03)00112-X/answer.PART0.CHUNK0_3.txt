Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants have led to notable improvements in selectivity and conversion rates compared to traditional methods. Catalyst systems composed of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have demonstrated enhanced performance. Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) stands out as particularly effective, achieving up to 50% yields of olefin products (propene and ethene) from propane conversion. 

The rate-determining step in these reactions involves alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting, with oxygen playing a crucial role in accelerating propane conversion. The presence of gas-phase oxygen significantly boosts reaction rates by facilitating fast reaction pathways through the formation of OH radicals. However, carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on catalyst activity, blocking active sites by forming Li+CO3 compounds.

Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends support the hypothesis that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-limiting step, with the selectivity patterns dictated largely by gas-phase radical chemistry. Despite these advances, challenges remain, such as corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties that limit catalyst stability and regenerability. Future research efforts should focus on optimizing C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to improve the efficiency and sustainability of ODHP processes.

Key areas for future investigation include developing novel catalyst materials that can withstand harsh operating conditions, exploring innovative reaction conditions that minimize byproducts, and designing more efficient reactor designs that maximize contact times and minimize energy consumption. These advancements could pave the way for a more sustainable and economically viable alternative to traditional olefin production methods.

近期，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）取得了显著进步，与传统方法相比，选择性和转化率得到了提升。由过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物组成的催化剂系统表现出优越性能。锂促进的镁氧化物（Li/MgO）尤其突出，能够从丙烷转化中获得高达50%的烯烃产物（丙烯和乙烯）。

这些反应中的关键步骤是通过C-H键断裂实现烷烃活化。氧气的存在对于丙烷转化至关重要，它通过形成OH自由基打开快速反应路径来显著提高反应速率。然而，二氧化碳对催化剂活性有强烈的抑制作用，通过形成Li+CO3化合物阻塞活性位点。

乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势支持氢原子从烷烃中提取是决定性步骤的假设，选择性模式主要由气相自由基化学决定。尽管取得了这些进展，但仍存在挑战，如腐蚀性和固有的反应特性限制了催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。未来的研究重点应集中在优化C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改进反应系统以提高ODHP过程的效率和可持续性。

关键研究领域包括开发能够承受苛刻操作条件的新催化剂材料、探索减少副产品的创新反应条件以及设计更高效的反应器设计以最大化接触时间和最小化能耗。这些进展可能为更可持续和经济上可行的烯烃生产替代方法铺平道路。
