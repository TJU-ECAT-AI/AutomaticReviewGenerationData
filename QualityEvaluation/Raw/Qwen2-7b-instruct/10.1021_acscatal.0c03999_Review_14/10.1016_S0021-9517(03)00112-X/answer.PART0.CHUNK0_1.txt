[1] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[2] "The presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[3] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."
[4] "Propene appears to be even more stable in the gas phase, because propene conversion was 40 times lower than propane conversion under similar conditions, when an empty reactor was used."
[5] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step."

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These systems have demonstrated varying performance in terms of selectivity and conversion rates. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, such as those containing vanadium, chromium, or tungsten, often exhibit high activity but suffer from corrosion issues. Main group element metal oxides, like those containing magnesium or lithium, offer better stability and lower corrosiveness but may have lower activity. The presence of small amounts of oxygen significantly influences the radical gas-phase chemistry, leading to a substantial increase in the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals. Carbon dioxide acts as a strong inhibitor against the reaction, despite not altering the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the activation site of propane. Propene is notably more stable in the gas phase, with conversion rates 40 times lower than propane under similar conditions. The reaction kinetics of ethane, propane, and butane reveal that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step, with the nature of the resulting radical determining the selectivity of the products.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面的进展集中在过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物催化剂系统上。这些系统在选择性和转化率方面表现各异。包含如钒、铬或钨等过渡金属的金属氧化物催化剂通常表现出高活性，但存在腐蚀问题。而以镁或锂为主要组分的金属氧化物则提供了更好的稳定性与较低的腐蚀性，但可能具有较低的活性。少量氧气的存在对自由基气相化学过程产生了显著影响，导致链传播体类型和浓度的大幅增加。二氧化碳作为反应的强抑制剂，尽管不会改变产物分布，但由于其对丙烷激活位点的强烈吸附作用。丙烯在气相中特别稳定，在相似条件下，其转化率是丙烷的40倍。乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的反应动力学揭示了从烷烃的氢解离作为决定性步骤，所形成的自由基的性质决定了产物的选择性。
