The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on developing catalyst systems that can efficiently convert propane into olefins, particularly propene and ethene, with improved selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalyst systems, including those based on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been explored. Lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts have shown promising results, achieving up to 50% yield of olefin products from propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking. The reaction kinetics have been studied by varying the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture. Alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting has been identified as the rate-determining step for all reaction products, and the presence of gas-phase oxygen plays a crucial role in enhancing propane conversion. However, carbon dioxide significantly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. Consecutive reactions of propene predominantly yield carbon oxides and occur mainly on the catalyst surface. Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step, influencing the selectivity patterns of the products.

Persistent challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and managing the inherent reaction properties of the catalysts. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems are critical areas for future research and development. Improving the efficiency of C-H bond activation could lead to higher conversion rates and better product selectivity. Developing catalysts with enhanced regenerability would extend their operational life and reduce costs. Refining reaction systems to better control reaction conditions could optimize ODHP processes, leading to more sustainable and economically viable production methods for olefins.

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. These systems have demonstrated varying performance in terms of selectivity and conversion rates. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, such as those containing vanadium, chromium, or tungsten, often exhibit high activity but suffer from corrosion issues. Main group element metal oxides, like those containing magnesium or lithium, offer better stability and lower corrosiveness but may have lower activity. The presence of small amounts of oxygen significantly influences the radical gas-phase chemistry, leading to a substantial increase in the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals. Carbon dioxide acts as a strong inhibitor against the reaction, despite not altering the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the activation site of propane. Propene is notably more stable in the gas phase, with conversion rates 40 times lower than propane under similar conditions. The reaction kinetics of ethane, propane, and butane reveal that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step, with the nature of the resulting radical determining the selectivity of the products.

最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方面的进展集中在过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物催化剂系统上。这些系统在选择性和转化率方面表现各异。包含如钒、铬或钨等过渡金属的金属氧化物催化剂通常表现出高活性，但存在腐蚀问题。而以镁或锂为主要组分的金属氧化物则提供了更好的稳定性与较低的腐蚀性，但可能具有较低的活性。少量氧气的存在对自由基气相化学过程产生了显著影响，导致链传播体类型和浓度的大幅增加。二氧化碳作为反应的强抑制剂，尽管不会改变产物分布，但由于其对丙烷激活位点的强烈吸附作用。丙烯在气相中特别稳定，在相似条件下，其转化率是丙烷的40倍。乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的反应动力学揭示了从烷烃的氢解离作为决定性步骤，所形成的自由基的性质决定了产物的选择性。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts is characterized by their ability to selectively convert propane into olefins with high yields. The Li/Dy/MgO catalyst, in particular, has shown exceptional performance, achieving up to 50% yield of olefin (propene and ethene) from propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking. 

A key feature of the reaction kinetics is that alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting serves as the rate-determining step for all products. The presence of gas-phase oxygen is crucial for propane conversion, enhancing the reaction rates significantly. Conversely, carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the catalyst activity for all products, blocking active sites by forming Li+CO3.

Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends indicate that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. The gas-phase radical chemistry plays a dominant role in determining the selectivity pattern of the products. 

Challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of certain catalyst materials and the inherent properties of the reaction itself, which can limit catalyst longevity and efficiency. Future research directions include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to address these challenges. Strategies might involve developing more stable catalyst materials, refining catalyst synthesis methods, and exploring novel reaction conditions to maximize product yields and minimize side reactions.

反应动力学的关键特征是，所有产物的烷基化通过C-H键断裂作为速率决定步骤。气体相氧的存在对于丙烷的转化至关重要，显著提高了反应速率。相反，二氧化碳对催化剂的所有产品具有强烈的抑制作用，通过形成Li+CO3阻塞活性位点。

从乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势可以看出，烷烃中的氢原子抽象是速率决定步骤。气体相自由基化学在确定产品选择性模式方面起着主导作用。

这一领域的挑战包括某些催化剂材料的腐蚀性和反应本身的固有性质，这可以限制催化剂的使用寿命和效率。未来的研究方向包括改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以解决这些挑战。可能的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂材料、改进催化剂合成方法以及探索新的反应条件以最大限度地提高产品产率并减少副反应。

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants have led to notable improvements in selectivity and conversion rates compared to traditional methods. Catalyst systems composed of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have demonstrated enhanced performance. Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) stands out as particularly effective, achieving up to 50% yields of olefin products (propene and ethene) from propane conversion. 

The rate-determining step in these reactions involves alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting, with oxygen playing a crucial role in accelerating propane conversion. The presence of gas-phase oxygen significantly boosts reaction rates by facilitating fast reaction pathways through the formation of OH radicals. However, carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on catalyst activity, blocking active sites by forming Li+CO3 compounds.

Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends support the hypothesis that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-limiting step, with the selectivity patterns dictated largely by gas-phase radical chemistry. Despite these advances, challenges remain, such as corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties that limit catalyst stability and regenerability. Future research efforts should focus on optimizing C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to improve the efficiency and sustainability of ODHP processes.

Key areas for future investigation include developing novel catalyst materials that can withstand harsh operating conditions, exploring innovative reaction conditions that minimize byproducts, and designing more efficient reactor designs that maximize contact times and minimize energy consumption. These advancements could pave the way for a more sustainable and economically viable alternative to traditional olefin production methods.
