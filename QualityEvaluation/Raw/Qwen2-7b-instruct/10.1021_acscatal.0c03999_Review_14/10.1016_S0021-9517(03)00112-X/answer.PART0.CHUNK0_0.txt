The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on developing catalyst systems that can efficiently convert propane into olefins, particularly propene and ethene, with improved selectivity and conversion rates. Various catalyst systems, including those based on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, have been explored. Lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts have shown promising results, achieving up to 50% yield of olefin products from propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking. The reaction kinetics have been studied by varying the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture. Alkane activation via a C-H bond splitting has been identified as the rate-determining step for all reaction products, and the presence of gas-phase oxygen plays a crucial role in enhancing propane conversion. However, carbon dioxide significantly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. Consecutive reactions of propene predominantly yield carbon oxides and occur mainly on the catalyst surface. Ethane, propane, and butane conversion trends confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step, influencing the selectivity patterns of the products.

Persistent challenges in this field include dealing with corrosiveness and managing the inherent reaction properties of the catalysts. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems are critical areas for future research and development. Improving the efficiency of C-H bond activation could lead to higher conversion rates and better product selectivity. Developing catalysts with enhanced regenerability would extend their operational life and reduce costs. Refining reaction systems to better control reaction conditions could optimize ODHP processes, leading to more sustainable and economically viable production methods for olefins.
