[1] "The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene."
[2] "The DFT results suggest that similar to Pt(111), CeO2/Pt(111) also enhances the reforming of ethane."
[3] "The difference in activity between the two classes of catalysts can be further explained through measuring the apparent activation barrier of both CO2 and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, as shown in Figure3."
[4] "Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C."

Recent research has identified that platinum/ceria (Pt/CeO2) catalysts are effective for converting ethane into synthesis gas, whereas molybdenum carbide (Mo2C)-based materials maintain the carbon-carbon (CC) bond in ethane to produce ethylene. The ceria layer on the platinum surface facilitates the reforming of ethane similarly to Pt(111). By measuring the activation barriers of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and molybdenum-alumina (Mo2C/γ-Al2O3) catalysts, the differences in activity between the two catalyst types can be explained. Deactivation is evident in both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, especially when treated with pure carbon dioxide, which fully oxidizes the molybdenum carbide, leading to its complete loss of reactivity.

最近的研究发现，铂/氧化铈（Pt/CeO2）催化剂能够有效地将乙烷转化为合成气，而钼化物（Mo2C）基材料则可以保持乙烷中的碳-碳（CC）键，从而产生乙烯。铈层在铂表面的催化作用类似于Pt(111)，促进乙烷的重整反应。通过测量铂/CeO2和钼铝（Mo2C/γ-Al2O3）催化剂上二氧化碳（CO2）和乙烷的活化能，可以解释两种催化剂之间的活性差异。铂/CeO2和钼/γ-Al2O3催化剂均表现出明显的失活现象，尤其是当它们被纯二氧化碳处理时，完全氧化钼化物，导致其完全失去活性。
