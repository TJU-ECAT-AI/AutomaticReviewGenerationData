<p>For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>The difference in reaction temperatures between ethane and methane dry reforming also provides a potential opportunity for reactively separating shale gas, thereby directly producing synthesis gas from ethane and CO2, while leaving the methane unreacted.</p>
<p>It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom.</p>
<p>This is due to the much higher affinity of the Mo2C(001) surface toward O relative to Pt(111).</p>
<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane.</p>
<p>One explanation, obtained through DFT calculations, indicates the higher binding energy of oxygen on Mo2C destabilizes CO bond formation and leads to ethylene as the primary product.</p>
<p>To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity (Figure2c).</p>
<p>XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on comparing the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document highlights that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for producing synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials are effective at preserving the CC bond of propane to produce ethylene. However, the deactivation of catalysts remains a persistent challenge, especially concerning the high binding energy of oxygen on Mo2C, which destabilizes CO bond formation, leading to ethylene as the primary product. The document proposes future research directions aimed at improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to mitigate deactivation and increase efficiency in ODHP processes. To address the high deactivation rate, the introduction of hydrogen (H2) into the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species, restoring the catalyst's activity. The XANES measurements confirm that the oxidation state of Mo changes during various gas treatments, indicating the formation of an oxycarbide phase upon reaction with ethane and CO2, which is crucial for ethylene formation but also contributes to deactivation. The key areas for future research include developing catalysts with improved stability, exploring novel reaction conditions, and refining the catalyst design to enhance selectivity and conversion rates in ODHP.

近期，关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究侧重于比较不同催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的性能。文献指出，铂/氧化铈催化剂对于产生合成气具有潜力，而钼基材料则能有效地保持丙烷的CC键以生成乙烯。然而，催化剂的失活仍然是一个持续存在的挑战，尤其是由于钼表面较高的氧结合能力导致CO键形成不稳，从而主要生成乙烯。文献提出了未来研究方向，旨在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以提高ODHP过程的效率。为应对高失活率，向反应流体中引入氢（H2）有助于去除无活性氧化物，恢复催化剂活性。XANES测量显示钼的氧化态在各种气体处理过程中发生变化，表明在与乙烷和CO2反应时形成了氧化碳化物相，这对于生成乙烯至关重要，但也部分导致了催化剂的失活。未来研究的关键领域包括开发稳定性更好的催化剂、探索新的反应条件以及改进催化剂设计以提高选择性和转化率。

[1] "Several groups have studied ODH of ethane with pure O2,9 which is more reactive but does not have the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions. ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism,10 where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."
[2] "For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.6 Dry reforming of ethane, however, becomes thermodynamically favorable at a lower temperature than for methane (ca. 600C), making the process more feasible under milder conditions.7"
[3] "These findings are supported by DFT calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of the catalysts under insitu reaction conditions."
[4] "Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involves evaluating the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, based on selectivity and conversion rates. The literature highlights that ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) occurs through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst initially dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and hydrogen (H2). Subsequently, the hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, yielding water (H2O) as a byproduct. Researchers have struggled with high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation when attempting dry reforming of methane and CO2. However, ethane reforming is thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures, making the process more feasible under milder conditions. DFT calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) are utilized to characterize catalysts under in situ reaction conditions, providing insights into their performance. The study indicates that Pt/CeO2 is effective for producing synthesis gas, whereas Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 selectively produces ethylene from ethane, albeit with catalyst deactivation. Pure CO2 treatment fully oxidizes Mo2C, suggesting that adsorbed oxygen is essential for forming an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates ethane, potentially contributing to catalyst deactivation.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and understanding the intrinsic properties of reactions. Key areas for future research and development involve improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

分析最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进步，涉及评估不同催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的选择性和转化率。文献指出，乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）通过Mars-van Krevelen机制发生，催化剂首先将乙烷分解为乙烯和氢气（H2）。随后，氢气通过逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应将二氧化碳（CO2）还原为一氧化碳（CO），产生水（H2O）作为副产品。研究人员在尝试甲烷和CO2的干重整时遇到了高反应温度和催化剂失活的问题。然而，乙烷重整在较低温度下变得热力学有利，使得在温和条件下过程更加可行。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）被用于在原位反应条件下表征催化剂，提供对其性能的见解。研究结果表明，Pt/CeO2适用于生产合成气，而Mo2C/γ-Al2O3则从乙烷中选择性地生成乙烯，尽管催化剂会失活。纯CO2处理完全氧化了Mo2C，这表明吸附的氧对于形成可与乙烷脱氢的氧化碳化物相至关重要，可能部分导致基于Mo2C的催化剂的失活。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和理解反应内在性质。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以实现高效和可持续的ODHP过程。

The recent study has identified that Pt/CeO2 catalysts are promising for producing synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene. This conclusion is supported by DFT calculations and XANES characterization of the catalysts under in situ reaction conditions. The researchers have discovered that the Pt(111) surface prefers forming synthesis gas, while the Mo2C(001) surface leads to ethylene formation. These findings align with the DFT predictions and XANES results. The study also found that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom. Moreover, the atomic hydrogen on Mo2C(001) prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas. The DFT results indicate that CeO2/Pt(111) also enhances the reforming of ethane similarly to Pt(111). To understand the rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were conducted for ethane. The XANES measurements revealed clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane. The adsorbed oxygen from CO2 is essential to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, contributing at least partially to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts.

最近的研究发现，Pt/CeO2催化剂在生产合成气方面表现出色，而基于Mo2C的材料则能保持乙烷中的CC键，从而产生乙烯。这些结论得到了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和原位X射线吸收谱近边结构（XANES）表征的支持。研究者发现，Pt(111)表面更倾向于形成合成气，而Mo2C(001)表面则促进乙烯生成。这些发现与DFT预测和XANES结果相吻合。研究还发现，对于具有相似吸附配置的物种而言，氧原子吸附的物种与碳原子吸附的物种之间的结合能差异更为显著。此外，在Mo2C(001)表面上，原子氢更倾向于重新组合并从表面以氢气的形式脱附。DFT结果表明，CeO2/Pt(111)也能像Pt(111)一样增强乙烷的重整。为了更好地理解Mo2C/γ-Al2O3上快速失活的机制，对乙烷进行了反应级数测量。XANES测量显示，Mo在所有气体处理过程中均显示出明显的氧化态变化，除了纯乙烷。吸附于CO2上的氧是形成氧化碳化物相所必需的，该相能够脱氢乙烷，并且至少部分地导致基于Mo2C的催化剂出现失活现象。

[1] "Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts. Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation."
[2] "There is a support effect, with SiO2 displaying the highest activity,13 and doping the catalyst with small amounts of Fe, Co, and Mn further improves ethylene selectivity."
[3] "For carbide catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 has about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity; however, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active."
[4] "The addition of H2 improves the initial catalytic activity, but the CO selectivity increases while that of ethylene decreases."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the evaluation of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been employed to enhance selectivity and conversion rates. The performance of catalysts like Cr-based oxide catalysts, SiO2-supported catalysts, and Mo2C-based catalysts has been assessed. While Cr2O3 catalysts can convert large amounts of ethane, they exhibit low CO2 conversion and short lifetimes due to coke formation. The introduction of Fe, Co, and Mn dopants improves ethylene selectivity on SiO2-supported catalysts. Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts show around 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity, but pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not as active. The addition of hydrogen to the reaction feed can boost initial catalytic activity, but it may lead to an increase in CO selectivity and a decrease in ethylene yield. 

Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including corrosion resistance and managing the inherent properties of the reaction. Key areas for future research and development aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies might include developing more durable catalyst supports, exploring new catalyst materials, and refining reaction conditions to achieve higher efficiency and selectivity. Insitu XANES measurements were utilized to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions, revealing the necessity of adsorbed O from CO2 to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane but contributes to catalyst deactivation.

近期，丙烷软氧化剂氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究集中在各种催化剂系统的评估上。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物被用来提高选择性和转化率。Cr基氧化物催化剂、SiO2支持的催化剂和Mo2C基催化剂的性能已被评估。尽管Cr2O3催化剂可以大量转化乙烷，但其整体CO2转化率低且寿命短，这可能是由于焦炭形成。向SiO2支持的催化剂中添加Fe、Co和Mn可进一步提高乙烯选择性。Mo2C/SiO2催化剂显示约10%的转化率和高乙烯选择性，但纯Mo2C和MoO3/SiO2活性较低。向反应流体中添加氢可以提高初始催化活性，但可能会导致CO选择性增加和乙烯产率下降。

然而，仍然存在一些挑战，包括耐腐蚀性问题和管理反应的固有性质。未来研究和开发的关键领域旨在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。可能的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂支撑材料、探索新的催化剂材料并细化反应条件，以实现更高的效率和选择性。利用原位XANES测量确认了Mo2C在反应条件下的氧化状态，揭示了从CO2吸附的O对于形成碳化物相的必要性，该相能够脱氢化乙烷，但至少部分地导致基于Mo2C的催化剂失活。

Recent research has identified that platinum/ceria (Pt/CeO2) catalysts are effective for converting ethane into synthesis gas, whereas molybdenum carbide (Mo2C)-based materials maintain the carbon-carbon (CC) bond in ethane to produce ethylene. The ceria layer on the platinum surface facilitates the reforming of ethane similarly to Pt(111). By measuring the activation barriers of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and molybdenum-alumina (Mo2C/γ-Al2O3) catalysts, the differences in activity between the two catalyst types can be explained. Deactivation is evident in both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, especially when treated with pure carbon dioxide, which fully oxidizes the molybdenum carbide, leading to its complete loss of reactivity.

最近的研究发现，铂/氧化铈（Pt/CeO2）催化剂能够有效地将乙烷转化为合成气，而钼化物（Mo2C）基材料则可以保持乙烷中的碳-碳（CC）键，从而产生乙烯。铈层在铂表面的催化作用类似于Pt(111)，促进乙烷的重整反应。通过测量铂/CeO2和钼铝（Mo2C/γ-Al2O3）催化剂上二氧化碳（CO2）和乙烷的活化能，可以解释两种催化剂之间的活性差异。铂/CeO2和钼/γ-Al2O3催化剂均表现出明显的失活现象，尤其是当它们被纯二氧化碳处理时，完全氧化钼化物，导致其完全失去活性。
