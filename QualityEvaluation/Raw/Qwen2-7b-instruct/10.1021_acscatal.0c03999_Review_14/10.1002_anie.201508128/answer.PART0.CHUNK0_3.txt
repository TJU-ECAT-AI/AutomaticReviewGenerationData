[1] "Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts. Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation."
[2] "There is a support effect, with SiO2 displaying the highest activity,13 and doping the catalyst with small amounts of Fe, Co, and Mn further improves ethylene selectivity."
[3] "For carbide catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 has about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity; however, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active."
[4] "The addition of H2 improves the initial catalytic activity, but the CO selectivity increases while that of ethylene decreases."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the evaluation of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been employed to enhance selectivity and conversion rates. The performance of catalysts like Cr-based oxide catalysts, SiO2-supported catalysts, and Mo2C-based catalysts has been assessed. While Cr2O3 catalysts can convert large amounts of ethane, they exhibit low CO2 conversion and short lifetimes due to coke formation. The introduction of Fe, Co, and Mn dopants improves ethylene selectivity on SiO2-supported catalysts. Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts show around 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity, but pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not as active. The addition of hydrogen to the reaction feed can boost initial catalytic activity, but it may lead to an increase in CO selectivity and a decrease in ethylene yield. 

Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including corrosion resistance and managing the inherent properties of the reaction. Key areas for future research and development aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies might include developing more durable catalyst supports, exploring new catalyst materials, and refining reaction conditions to achieve higher efficiency and selectivity. Insitu XANES measurements were utilized to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions, revealing the necessity of adsorbed O from CO2 to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane but contributes to catalyst deactivation.

近期，丙烷软氧化剂氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究集中在各种催化剂系统的评估上。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物被用来提高选择性和转化率。Cr基氧化物催化剂、SiO2支持的催化剂和Mo2C基催化剂的性能已被评估。尽管Cr2O3催化剂可以大量转化乙烷，但其整体CO2转化率低且寿命短，这可能是由于焦炭形成。向SiO2支持的催化剂中添加Fe、Co和Mn可进一步提高乙烯选择性。Mo2C/SiO2催化剂显示约10%的转化率和高乙烯选择性，但纯Mo2C和MoO3/SiO2活性较低。向反应流体中添加氢可以提高初始催化活性，但可能会导致CO选择性增加和乙烯产率下降。

然而，仍然存在一些挑战，包括耐腐蚀性问题和管理反应的固有性质。未来研究和开发的关键领域旨在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP过程。可能的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂支撑材料、探索新的催化剂材料并细化反应条件，以实现更高的效率和选择性。利用原位XANES测量确认了Mo2C在反应条件下的氧化状态，揭示了从CO2吸附的O对于形成碳化物相的必要性，该相能够脱氢化乙烷，但至少部分地导致基于Mo2C的催化剂失活。
