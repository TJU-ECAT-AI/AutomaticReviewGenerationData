<p>For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>The difference in reaction temperatures between ethane and methane dry reforming also provides a potential opportunity for reactively separating shale gas, thereby directly producing synthesis gas from ethane and CO2, while leaving the methane unreacted.</p>
<p>It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom.</p>
<p>This is due to the much higher affinity of the Mo2C(001) surface toward O relative to Pt(111).</p>
<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane.</p>
<p>One explanation, obtained through DFT calculations, indicates the higher binding energy of oxygen on Mo2C destabilizes CO bond formation and leads to ethylene as the primary product.</p>
<p>To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity (Figure2c).</p>
<p>XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>

Recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on comparing the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. The document highlights that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for producing synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials are effective at preserving the CC bond of propane to produce ethylene. However, the deactivation of catalysts remains a persistent challenge, especially concerning the high binding energy of oxygen on Mo2C, which destabilizes CO bond formation, leading to ethylene as the primary product. The document proposes future research directions aimed at improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to mitigate deactivation and increase efficiency in ODHP processes. To address the high deactivation rate, the introduction of hydrogen (H2) into the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species, restoring the catalyst's activity. The XANES measurements confirm that the oxidation state of Mo changes during various gas treatments, indicating the formation of an oxycarbide phase upon reaction with ethane and CO2, which is crucial for ethylene formation but also contributes to deactivation. The key areas for future research include developing catalysts with improved stability, exploring novel reaction conditions, and refining the catalyst design to enhance selectivity and conversion rates in ODHP.

近期，关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究侧重于比较不同催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的性能。文献指出，铂/氧化铈催化剂对于产生合成气具有潜力，而钼基材料则能有效地保持丙烷的CC键以生成乙烯。然而，催化剂的失活仍然是一个持续存在的挑战，尤其是由于钼表面较高的氧结合能力导致CO键形成不稳，从而主要生成乙烯。文献提出了未来研究方向，旨在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以提高ODHP过程的效率。为应对高失活率，向反应流体中引入氢（H2）有助于去除无活性氧化物，恢复催化剂活性。XANES测量显示钼的氧化态在各种气体处理过程中发生变化，表明在与乙烷和CO2反应时形成了氧化碳化物相，这对于生成乙烯至关重要，但也部分导致了催化剂的失活。未来研究的关键领域包括开发稳定性更好的催化剂、探索新的反应条件以及改进催化剂设计以提高选择性和转化率。
