The recent study has identified that Pt/CeO2 catalysts are promising for producing synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene. This conclusion is supported by DFT calculations and XANES characterization of the catalysts under in situ reaction conditions. The researchers have discovered that the Pt(111) surface prefers forming synthesis gas, while the Mo2C(001) surface leads to ethylene formation. These findings align with the DFT predictions and XANES results. The study also found that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom. Moreover, the atomic hydrogen on Mo2C(001) prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas. The DFT results indicate that CeO2/Pt(111) also enhances the reforming of ethane similarly to Pt(111). To understand the rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were conducted for ethane. The XANES measurements revealed clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane. The adsorbed oxygen from CO2 is essential to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, contributing at least partially to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts.

最近的研究发现，Pt/CeO2催化剂在生产合成气方面表现出色，而基于Mo2C的材料则能保持乙烷中的CC键，从而产生乙烯。这些结论得到了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和原位X射线吸收谱近边结构（XANES）表征的支持。研究者发现，Pt(111)表面更倾向于形成合成气，而Mo2C(001)表面则促进乙烯生成。这些发现与DFT预测和XANES结果相吻合。研究还发现，对于具有相似吸附配置的物种而言，氧原子吸附的物种与碳原子吸附的物种之间的结合能差异更为显著。此外，在Mo2C(001)表面上，原子氢更倾向于重新组合并从表面以氢气的形式脱附。DFT结果表明，CeO2/Pt(111)也能像Pt(111)一样增强乙烷的重整。为了更好地理解Mo2C/γ-Al2O3上快速失活的机制，对乙烷进行了反应级数测量。XANES测量显示，Mo在所有气体处理过程中均显示出明显的氧化态变化，除了纯乙烷。吸附于CO2上的氧是形成氧化碳化物相所必需的，该相能够脱氢乙烷，并且至少部分地导致基于Mo2C的催化剂出现失活现象。
