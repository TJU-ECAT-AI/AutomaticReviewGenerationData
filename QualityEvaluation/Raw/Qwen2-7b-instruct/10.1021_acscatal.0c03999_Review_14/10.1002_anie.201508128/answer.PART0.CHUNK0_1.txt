[1] "Several groups have studied ODH of ethane with pure O2,9 which is more reactive but does not have the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions. ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism,10 where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."
[2] "For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.6 Dry reforming of ethane, however, becomes thermodynamically favorable at a lower temperature than for methane (ca. 600C), making the process more feasible under milder conditions.7"
[3] "These findings are supported by DFT calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of the catalysts under insitu reaction conditions."
[4] "Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involves evaluating the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, based on selectivity and conversion rates. The literature highlights that ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) occurs through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst initially dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and hydrogen (H2). Subsequently, the hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, yielding water (H2O) as a byproduct. Researchers have struggled with high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation when attempting dry reforming of methane and CO2. However, ethane reforming is thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures, making the process more feasible under milder conditions. DFT calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) are utilized to characterize catalysts under in situ reaction conditions, providing insights into their performance. The study indicates that Pt/CeO2 is effective for producing synthesis gas, whereas Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 selectively produces ethylene from ethane, albeit with catalyst deactivation. Pure CO2 treatment fully oxidizes Mo2C, suggesting that adsorbed oxygen is essential for forming an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates ethane, potentially contributing to catalyst deactivation.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and understanding the intrinsic properties of reactions. Key areas for future research and development involve improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

分析最近在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进步，涉及评估不同催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的选择性和转化率。文献指出，乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）通过Mars-van Krevelen机制发生，催化剂首先将乙烷分解为乙烯和氢气（H2）。随后，氢气通过逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应将二氧化碳（CO2）还原为一氧化碳（CO），产生水（H2O）作为副产品。研究人员在尝试甲烷和CO2的干重整时遇到了高反应温度和催化剂失活的问题。然而，乙烷重整在较低温度下变得热力学有利，使得在温和条件下过程更加可行。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）被用于在原位反应条件下表征催化剂，提供对其性能的见解。研究结果表明，Pt/CeO2适用于生产合成气，而Mo2C/γ-Al2O3则从乙烷中选择性地生成乙烯，尽管催化剂会失活。纯CO2处理完全氧化了Mo2C，这表明吸附的氧对于形成可与乙烷脱氢的氧化碳化物相至关重要，可能部分导致基于Mo2C的催化剂的失活。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括耐腐蚀性和理解反应内在性质。未来研究和发展的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以实现高效和可持续的ODHP过程。
