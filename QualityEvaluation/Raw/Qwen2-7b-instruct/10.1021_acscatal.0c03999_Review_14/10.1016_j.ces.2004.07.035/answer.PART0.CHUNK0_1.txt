Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on utilizing iron zeolites as highly efficient catalysts for the reaction with nitrogen dioxide (N2O). These catalysts demonstrate initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K, but they face a challenge of deactivation due to coke formation. This deactivation is reversible, leading to the development of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production. This involves alternating reaction and regeneration cycles in two fixed-bed reactors in parallel, with reaction temperatures at 723 K and regeneration temperatures at 823 K. The use of this process enables the simultaneous functionalization of propane (C3H8) and the utilization of N2O, a cost-effective source of oxygen for the reaction. This technology can be economically applied in chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration, such as in tail-gases, for on-site propylene production.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and the inherent properties of the reaction, which can limit the effectiveness and longevity of the catalysts. Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize the reaction systems to maximize yield and efficiency. This could involve refining catalyst materials, modifying operating conditions, and developing advanced reactor designs that better manage heat and mass transfer, as well as facilitate the regeneration of the catalysts.

最近，利用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究集中在使用铁沸石作为使用氮氧化物（N2O）的高效催化剂。这些催化剂在723-773 K的温度范围内表现出20-25%的丙烯产率，但它们面临由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活问题。这种失活是可逆的，导致开发了一种循环操作过程以实现连续丙烯生产。这涉及到在两个并联的固定床反应器中交替反应和再生周期，反应温度为723 K，再生温度为823 K。利用这一过程可以同时实现丙烷（C3H8）的功能化和N2O的利用，这是一种成本效益高的氧气来源，用于反应。这项技术可以在产生高浓度N2O的化学过程中经济地应用于现场丙烯生产，例如在尾气中。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括反应环境的腐蚀性以及反应固有的特性，这些特性可能限制催化剂的有效性和寿命。未来研究和开发的关键领域包括改进C-H键激活策略、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化产率和效率。这可能涉及改进催化剂材料、调整操作条件以及开发更好的反应器设计，这些设计能更好地管理热和质量传输，并促进催化剂的再生。
