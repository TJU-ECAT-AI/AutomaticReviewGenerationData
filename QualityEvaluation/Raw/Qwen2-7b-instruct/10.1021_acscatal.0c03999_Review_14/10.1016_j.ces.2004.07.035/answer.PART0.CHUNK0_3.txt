Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, particularly focusing on transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, indicates that the use of modified V and Mo oxides has shown propene yields ranging from 10-30% with O2 as the oxidant. However, the study emphasizes the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated ODHP process, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at temperatures between 723-773 K. The key challenge faced in this field is the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which is influenced by the zeolite host and the reaction temperature. To address this, TEOM studies have proven crucial in correlating activity and deactivation by simultaneously measuring reaction and coking rates, as well as assessing catalyst regeneration. This has led to the development of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propylene production over FeZSM-5, where propene yields exceeding 20% were achieved over a period of 2000 minutes through the alternating use of two fixed-bed reactors operating at 723 K for reaction and 823 K for regeneration. This innovative process enables the simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of N2O, highlighting advancements in catalyst efficiency and process optimization for ODHP.

分析近期利用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的进展，针对不同催化剂体系（特别是过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物），研究表明使用改性V和Mo氧化物时，丙烯产率在O2作为氧化剂的情况下为10-30%。然而，研究强调了蒸汽活化的Fe沸石在N2O介导的ODHP过程中的优越性能，其初始丙烯产率达到25%，工作温度范围为723-773 K。该领域面临的挑战是催化剂因焦炭形成而失活，这受到载体沸石和反应温度的影响。为了应对这一挑战，同时测量反应和结焦速率以及评估催化剂再生的TEOM研究证明至关重要。这导致了一种循环操作过程的发展，用于连续生产丙烯，通过交替使用两个固定床反应器，在723 K下反应和823 K下再生，实现了超过20%的丙烯产率，持续时间为2000分钟。这一创新过程使丙烷的同步功能化和N2O的利用成为可能，突出了在ODHP过程中催化剂效率和过程优化方面的进步。
