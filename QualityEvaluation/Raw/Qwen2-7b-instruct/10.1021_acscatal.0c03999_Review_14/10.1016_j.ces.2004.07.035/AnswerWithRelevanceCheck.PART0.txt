          [4] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
          [5] "Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
          [6] "The continuous propene production via a cyclically-operated process was demonstrated over FeZSM-5, where propene yields > 20% were achieved during a period of 2000 min, in a configuration of two fixed-bed reactors in parallel with alternation of re- action (at 723 K) and regeneration (at 823 K) cycles."

          Recent studies have delved into the use of soft oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential pathway to produce alkenes. Transition metals like iron, when utilized in zeolite form, have shown remarkable efficiency in converting propane to propene through the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant. Iron-zeolites, particularly iron zeolites of types FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, have demonstrated high catalytic activity, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K. The reversible nature of catalyst deactivation has opened up possibilities for a cyclic process that allows for continuous propene production by alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles. This process has been successfully demonstrated using FeZSM-5, where propene yields exceeding 20% were obtained over a duration of 2000 minutes, utilizing two fixed-bed reactors that operate in parallel, with one reactor undergoing reaction at 723 K while the other undergoes regeneration at 823 K.

          近期研究探索了软氧化剂介导下轻烷烃的氧化脱氢作为潜在的制备烯烃途径。使用过渡金属，尤其是铁，通过氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，铁沸石显示出高效转换丙烷为丙烯的能力。铁沸石，包括FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Feβ型，展现出优异的催化活性，在约723-773 K的温度范围内，实现了20-25%的初始丙烯产率。催化剂失活的可逆性为连续丙烯生产开辟了可能，即通过交替进行反应和再生循环来实现。这一过程已在FeZSM-5上成功实施，实现了超过20%的丙烯产率，持续时间为2000分钟，使用了两个并行运行的固定床反应器，其中一个反应器在723 K下进行反应，另一个在823 K下进行再生。

          [1] "Fe-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K, but they deactivate due to coke formation."
          [2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
          [3] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
          [4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
          [5] "This catalytic process leads to the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O and can be economically applied for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O, e.g. in tail-gases of chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration."

          Iron zeolites are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidant, achieving initial propene yields of 20-25% at temperatures between 723-773 K. However, they are prone to deactivation due to the formation of coke, which can significantly affect their performance. The exceptional efficiency of iron zeolites can be attributed to the unique role of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms within the zeolite structure to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, thereby efficiently dehydrogenating propane. The reversibility of catalyst deactivation has facilitated the development of a cyclic operation process for continuous propene production, which alternates between reaction and regeneration phases. In a setup employing two parallel fixed-bed reactors utilizing FeZSM-5, stable propene yields greater than 20% were observed over a 2000-minute cycle, with reaction and regeneration temperatures set at 723 K and 823 K, respectively. This catalytic process not only optimizes the conversion of both propane (C3H8) and N2O but also offers a cost-effective solution for on-site propylene production, particularly when utilizing low-cost sources of N2O found in the tail-gases of chemical processes where high concentrations of N2O are generated.

          铁沸石在氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂下对丙烷的氧化脱氢表现出高度的催化效率，初始丙烯产率在723-773 K的温度范围内达到20-25%。然而，由于焦炭的生成，它们很容易发生失活，这对其性能造成严重影响。铁沸石的高效性可归因于N2O作为单氧供体的独特作用，以及沸石结构中特定铁形式能够协调反应性的原子氧物种，从而高效地脱氢丙烷。催化剂失活的可逆性促进了连续丙烯生产的循环操作过程的发展，该过程交替进行反应和再生阶段。在利用FeZSM-5的两个并行固定床反应器的设置中，在723 K和823 K的反应和再生温度下，观察到稳定的丙烯产率超过20%，持续时间为2000分钟。这一催化过程不仅优化了丙烷（C3H8）和N2O的转化，而且提供了一种成本效益高的现场丙烯生产解决方案，特别是在利用化学过程中高浓度N2O产生的低成本N2O源时。
