Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving selectivity and conversion rates. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, like vanadium and molybdenum, have shown promise with initial propene yields reaching up to 25% at 798 K. Main group element metal oxides, notably iron-zeolites, have also proven effective in ODHP using nitrogen dioxide (N2O), achieving yields between 20-25% at temperatures around 773 K. However, catalysts often deactivate due to coke formation, particularly influenced by the type of zeolite host and reaction temperature. To combat this, researchers have employed techniques like tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) studies to monitor activity, deactivation, and regeneration simultaneously. This information has been crucial in designing cyclic processes that alternate between reaction and regeneration phases, ensuring continuous propene production over catalysts like FeZSM-5. Challenges in this field include managing corrosiveness and optimizing C-H bond activation. Future research aims to improve catalyst regenerability, develop more efficient reaction systems, and potentially use alternative feedstocks to optimize ODHP processes.

近期，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究重点在于提高选择性和转化率。过渡金属/金属氧化物催化剂，如钒和钼，在798 K时的初始丙烯产率为25%，显示出潜力。主要组元金属氧化物，特别是铁沸石，也已证明在使用氮氧化物（N2O）进行ODHP时有效，其产率在773 K左右达到20-25%。然而，催化剂由于焦炭形成而失效，这受到所用沸石载体类型和反应温度的影响。为应对这一问题，研究者们采用尖锥元件振动微天平（TEOM）研究来同时监测活性、失活和再生情况。这些信息对于设计交替反应与再生阶段的循环过程至关重要，确保连续丙烯生产，尤其是在FeZSM-5等催化剂上。该领域面临的挑战包括管理腐蚀性并优化C-H键活化。未来研究旨在提高催化剂再生能力，开发更高效的反应系统，并可能使用替代原料优化ODHP流程。
