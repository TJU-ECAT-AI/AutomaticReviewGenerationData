Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, varies in terms of selectivity and conversion. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts generally show higher initial propene yields compared to main group element metal oxides. However, they face challenges such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties. Main group element metal oxides, like iron zeolites, are noted for their efficiency in N2O-mediated ODHP, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773K, comparable to those of vanadium and molybdenum-based catalysts with oxygen. The deactivation process is significantly influenced by the zeolite host and reaction temperature. Iron zeolites exhibit distinct deactivation behaviors, with beta-form exhibiting the fastest deactivation, followed by silicalite, and ZSM-5 showing remarkable stability. The final coke content in ZSM-5 is approximately 3 times higher than in silicalite and beta-form. The reaction temperature has a substantial impact on catalytic performance and the time scale for deactivation. Notably, the residual propylene yield remains similar after regeneration for fresh and recycled ZSM-5. The economic application of this process is feasible in chemical processes producing high concentrations of N2O, particularly those utilizing HNO3 as an oxidizing agent. This process effectively integrates the heat generated during regeneration into the reaction phase, optimizing energy usage.

在软氧化剂介导下，对丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）进行了近期研究。不同催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，在选择性和转化率方面的表现各不相同。过渡金属/金属氧化物催化剂通常能实现更高的初始丙烯产率，相比之下，主族元素金属氧化物如铁沸石则显示出在N2O介导的ODHP中的高效性，能够在773K条件下实现24%的初始丙烯产率，与使用氧气的V和Mo基催化剂相当。催化剂的失活过程受载体材料和反应温度的影响显著。铁沸石表现出不同的失活行为，β型沸石的失活速度最快，其次是硅铝酸盐，而ZSM-5展现出极佳的稳定性。ZSM-5的最终焦炭含量大约是硅铝酸盐和β型沸石的三倍。反应温度对催化性能和失活时间尺度有重大影响。值得注意的是，经过再生后，新鲜和回收的ZSM-5的残余丙烯产率保持相似。这一过程在产生高浓度N2O的特定化学过程中具有经济应用潜力，特别是那些利用HNO3作为氧化剂的过程。该过程有效地将再生过程中产生的热量整合到反应阶段，优化了能量利用。
