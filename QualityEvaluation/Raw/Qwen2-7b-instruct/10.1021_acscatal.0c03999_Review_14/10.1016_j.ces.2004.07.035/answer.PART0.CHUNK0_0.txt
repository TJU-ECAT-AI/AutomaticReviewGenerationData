Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (N2O), have focused on improving the performance of catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been evaluated. Fe-zeolites, particularly iron zeolites like FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, have shown exceptional efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, achieving initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at temperatures around 723-773 K. However, these catalysts face a significant challenge due to deactivation caused by coke formation.

To address this issue, researchers have analyzed the reversibility of catalyst deactivation and the feasibility of a cyclically operated process, involving alternation between reaction and regeneration cycles. This approach allows for continuous propene production, maintaining propene yields above 20% for up to 2000 minutes. In this cyclic process, two fixed-bed reactors operate in parallel, with one undergoing reaction at 723 K while the other undergoes regeneration at 823 K. The key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize efficiency and yield.

These efforts aim to overcome challenges such as corrosion and the inherent reaction properties of propane. Strategies for improvement involve refining catalyst materials and structures, developing more efficient regeneration methods, and modifying reaction conditions to better control the dehydrogenation process. The ultimate goal is to create sustainable and economically viable ODHP processes that utilize soft oxidants like N2O, potentially reducing environmental impact while expanding the availability of propene as a valuable chemical intermediate.

近期，对于使用软氧化剂（如氮氧化物N2O）进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究重点在于提高催化剂系统的性能。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物被评估。铁沸石（特别是FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Feβ）在使用N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢时表现出极高的效率，在约723-773 K的温度下，初始丙烯产率可达20-25%，同时具有相似的丙烷转化率（约45%）和丙烯选择性（约50%）。然而，这些催化剂面临的主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的失活。

为了解决这一问题，研究人员分析了催化剂失活的可逆性和循环操作过程的可行性，涉及反应与再生周期的交替。这种方法允许连续丙烯生产，在长达2000分钟的时间内保持丙烯产率超过20%。在这个循环过程中，两个固定床反应器并行运行，一个在723 K下进行反应，另一个在823 K下进行再生。未来研究与开发的关键领域包括改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化效率和产率。

这些努力旨在克服腐蚀和丙烷固有的反应性质等挑战。改进策略包括精炼催化剂材料和结构、发展更高效的再生方法以及调整反应条件以更好地控制脱氢过程。最终目标是创建可持续且经济可行的ODHP流程，利用软氧化剂如N2O，可能减少环境影响并扩大丙烯作为重要化学中间体的可用性。
