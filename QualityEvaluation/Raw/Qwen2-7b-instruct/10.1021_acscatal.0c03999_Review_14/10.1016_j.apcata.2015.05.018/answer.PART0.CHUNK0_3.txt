[1] "The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction: C3H8
C3H6 +
H2,
r 298 =
124.27
kJ/mol."
[2] "Furthermore,one of the undesirable byproducts is methyl acetylene which poisons the polymerization catalysts in the further polypropylene production."

[5] "The latter complicates the industrial realization of this process due to the necessity of waste-heat utilization."
[6] "For many years,this way of the olefins production was thermodynamically complicated by the necessity to perform the Deacon reaction,for which no effective catalysts were available."
[7] "Nowadays,a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst is proposed for the Deacon reaction that allows performing this process at temperatures below

[1921]."
[8] "Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives,such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane [22]."
[9] "Probably,the reactivity of ruthenium compounds in the reactions involving chlorine and organochlorines is due to the high ruthenium affinity to chlorine."
[10] "It was shown that the K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 catalyst was more active in the Deacon reaction in comparison with RuO2 and exceeds all known catalysts for activity and selectivity in the oxychlorination of ethane and methane [22]."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, can be compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. The selectivity towards propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400°C with Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10]. The consumption turnover frequency was 45×10^3 s^-1, comparable with the highest known values obtained at the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35%, which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility. The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine offers an advantage due to the simplicity of waste-heat utilization and the low enthalpy change of the reaction. However, challenges such as corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties still exist. Future research and development should focus on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing the reaction system to maximize the yield of propylene.

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving the activation of C-H bonds in propane to facilitate more efficient dehydrogenation.
2. Developing catalysts with enhanced regenerability to maintain high performance over multiple cycles.
3. Modifying the reaction system to better control reaction conditions and optimize propylene yield.

分析使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，各种催化剂体系（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的性能可以进行比较。在400°C时，丙烷转化为50%，氯完全转化，通过以水溶液形式将K4[Ru2OCl10]氯化氢酸浸渍到二氧化钛中制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂的丙烯选择性达到95%。消耗的周转频率为45×10^3 s^-1，与已知最高值的氧化脱氢反应相匹配。尽管迄今为止，丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的丙烯产量最高不超过35%，无法满足经济可行性。然而，使用分子氯进行氧化脱氢具有优势，由于反应热的简单利用和较低的焓变。但仍然存在腐蚀性和固有反应性质等挑战。未来研究与发展应集中在以下关键领域：
1. 提高丙烷中C-H键的活化，以实现更高效的脱氢。
2. 开发具有增强再生性的催化剂，以维持高循环性能。
3. 调整反应系统以更好地控制反应条件并优化丙烯产率。
