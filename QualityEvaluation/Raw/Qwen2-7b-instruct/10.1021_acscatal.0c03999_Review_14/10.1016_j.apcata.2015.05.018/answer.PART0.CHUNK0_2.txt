[1] "The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular oxygen is the exothermic process."
[3] "Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives,such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane."
[4] "It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity."
[5] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C."
[6] "The aim of this work was the study of catalysts based on ruthenium oxychloride in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular chlorine."
