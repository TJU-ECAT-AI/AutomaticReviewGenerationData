          [1] "The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction."
          [2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C."
          [3] "It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity."
          [4] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C."
          [5] "The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."
          [6] "The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."

          The main challenge in applying oxidative dehydrogenation of propane industrially is the requirement for high temperatures to increase olefin equilibrium concentration, given that the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction. Researchers have studied oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular chlorine in a flow reactor with a fixed bed of catalysts, employing a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures ranging from 150 to 450 degrees Celsius. It was found that a Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] demonstrated the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion, with a consumption turnover frequency of 45 × 10^3 s^-1. However, achieving high yields remains challenging, with the best-known yield reaching 35%, which is insufficient for economic feasibility. The total enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is merely 60.34 kJ/mol, which simplifies the task of waste heat utilization.

          在工业应用氧化脱氢化丙烷过程中，主要的挑战是需要高温来增加烯烃平衡浓度，因为丙烷脱氢反应是吸热的。研究人员在固定床催化剂流化反应器中研究了使用分子氯气的氧化脱氢化丙烷，使用了一系列钌-二氧化钛催化剂，在150至450度的温度范围内。发现，通过将二氧化钛浸渍于含有K4[Ru2OCl10]的水合盐酸溶液中制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂显示出了最高的催化活性。在400°C时，该催化剂实现了50%丙烷转化率和完全氯转化率下的95%丙烯选择性，消耗速率常数为45×10^3 s^-1。然而，实现高产率仍然是一个挑战，已知的最佳产率为35%，这不足以满足经济可行性。反应C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6的总焓，r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol仅为60.34 kJ/mol，这简化了废热利用的任务。

          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular oxygen is the exothermic process."
          [2] "Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane."
          [3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the most direct and selective route for the production of propylene."

          [6] "The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides."
          [7] "The highest selectivity (94–96%) was achieved at 200 C over PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20%."
          [8] "Formed HCl was proposed to be oxidized by oxygen back to Cl2 (the Deacon reaction)."
          [9] "For many years, this way of the olefins production was thermodynamically complicated by the necessity to perform the Deacon reaction, for which no effective catalysts were available."

          Oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen is an exothermic process. Catalysts containing ruthenium also demonstrate good performance in reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is considered the most direct and selective method for producing propylene. The Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion. A yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides. The highest selectivity (94-96%) was achieved at 200°C over the PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at a conversion rate of about 20%. Formed HCl was proposed to be oxidized by oxygen back to Cl2 (the Deacon reaction), which has been a thermodynamically complex challenge due to the lack of effective catalysts for this process.
