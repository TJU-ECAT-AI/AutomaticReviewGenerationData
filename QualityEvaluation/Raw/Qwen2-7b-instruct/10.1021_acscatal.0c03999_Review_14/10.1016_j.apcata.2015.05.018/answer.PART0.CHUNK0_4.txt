[1] "The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular oxygen is the exothermic process: C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O, r 298 = 117.57 kJ/mol."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the most direct and selective route for the production of propylene."
[4] "The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction: C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, r 298 = 124.27 kJ/mol."
[5] "The application of halogens for the dehydrogenation was proposed more than 40 years ago, based on thermodynamic calculations."
[6] "For many years, this way of the olefins production was thermodynamically complicated by the necessity to perform the Deacon reaction, for which no effective catalysts were available."
[7] "Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane."
[8] "It is noteworthy that the use of molecular chlorine in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was suggested based on thermodynamic calculations."
[9] "The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r 298 = 60.34 kJ/mol, is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."
