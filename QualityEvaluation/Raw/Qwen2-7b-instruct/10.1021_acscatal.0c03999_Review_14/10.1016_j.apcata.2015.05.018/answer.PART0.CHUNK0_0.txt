[1] "The main problem limiting the industrial application of this method is the necessity to use high temperatures in order to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration since the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation by molecular chlorine was studied in a flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed using a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures between 150 and 450 C."
[3] "It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity."
[4] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C."
[5] "The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."
[6] "The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."

1. The main challenge in applying oxidative dehydrogenation of propane industrially is the requirement for high temperatures to enhance olefin concentration, given that the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction.

2. Researchers have conducted a study on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular chlorine in a flow reactor with a fixed bed of catalyst, employing a series of ruthenium-titania catalysts at temperatures ranging from 150 to 450 degrees Celsius.

3. The catalyst prepared by impregnating titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] via the incipient wetness method demonstrated the highest catalytic activity.

4. At a propane conversion rate of 50% and complete chlorine conversion, the catalyst achieved a propylene selectivity of 95%.

5. Even with the best catalysts currently known, the yield of propylene in oxidative dehydrogenation does not surpass 35%, which falls short of economic viability.

6. The total enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol is merely 60.34 kJ/mol, facilitating the utilization of waste heat.

1. 工业应用氧化脱氢化丙烷的主要挑战是需要高温度来增加烯烃平衡浓度，因为丙烷脱氢反应是吸热的。

2. 研究人员在固定床催化剂流化反应器中研究了使用分子氯气的氧化脱氢化丙烷，使用一系列钌-二氧化钛催化剂，在150至450度的温度范围内。

3. 通过将二氧化钛浸渍于K4[Ru2OCl10]的水溶液中进行初始湿润浸渍制备的催化剂显示出了最高的催化活性。

4. 在丙烷转化率为50%，完全氯转化的情况下，催化剂的丙烯选择性达到了95%。

5. 即使是最优秀的催化剂，目前在氧化脱氢化丙烷过程中的丙烯产率也不超过35%，这不足以满足经济可行性。

6. 反应C3H8 + Cl2 → 2HCl + C3H6的总焓，r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol仅为60.34 kJ/mol，有利于废热利用。
