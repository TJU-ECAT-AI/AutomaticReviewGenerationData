The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on developing efficient catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides, particularly those containing ruthenium, have shown promising results. For instance, a Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] demonstrated the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, this catalyst achieved a 95% selectivity toward propylene with a 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion, with a consumption turnover frequency of 45 × 10^3 s^-1. However, achieving high yields remains challenging, with the best-known yield reaching 40% using Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides. Another notable catalyst is the PtH3PMo12O40, which achieved selectivities of 94-96% at 200°C, though at a lower conversion rate of around 20%. The Deacon reaction, which oxidizes formed HCl back to Cl2, has been a significant challenge due to its thermodynamic complexity and the lack of effective catalysts. Nevertheless, catalysts based on ruthenium have also shown potential in other reactions involving chlorine, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane.

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosion issues and the inherent reaction properties that make it difficult to achieve high yields efficiently. Strategies for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to better control reaction conditions and product selectivity. The focus on catalyst design, modification, and support materials is crucial to address these challenges and advance the efficiency and economic viability of ODHP processes.

最近在使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究中，重点集中在高效催化剂系统的开发。过渡金属及其氧化物，尤其是含钌的催化剂，显示出有前景的结果。例如，通过浸渍水合盐酸溶液中的钛酸钾制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂显示出了最高的催化活性。在400°C时，该催化剂实现了50%丙烷转化率和完全氯转化率下的丙烯选择性达到95%，消耗速率常数为45×10^3 s^-1。然而，实现高产率仍然是一个挑战，已知的最佳产率为40%，使用Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O混合氧化物。另一种值得注意的催化剂是PtH3PMo12O40，在200°C时实现了94%-96%的选择性，但转化率约为20%。Deacon反应，将生成的HCl氧化回Cl2，由于其热力学复杂性和缺乏有效催化剂而成为一大挑战。不过，基于钌的催化剂在涉及氯或其衍生物的其他反应中也显示出潜力，如甲烷和乙烷的氧氯化。持续存在的挑战包括腐蚀问题和固有的反应特性，这些使得难以有效地实现高产率。未来研究与发展的策略包括改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以更好地控制反应条件和产物选择性。重点在于催化剂设计、修改和支持材料的研究，以解决这些挑战并推动ODHP过程的效率和经济可行性。
