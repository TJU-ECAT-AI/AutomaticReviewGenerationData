The literature discusses the potential of chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) to offer transformative benefits in energy storage, conversion, and environmental impact reduction. It highlights the versatility of CLBC in chemical production, where redox catalysts enable the rational design of chemical looping schemes that can minimize exergy loss and reduce the number of unit operations. This can lead to significant energy savings and CO2 emissions reduction, sometimes achieving orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional methods. The literature also mentions the potential for expanding the scope of chemical products that can be produced using chemical looping, leveraging a wide range of feedstocks and energy sources. It acknowledges that while CLBC has shown promising results, further development and optimization are needed to fully realize its potential in the chemical industry.
