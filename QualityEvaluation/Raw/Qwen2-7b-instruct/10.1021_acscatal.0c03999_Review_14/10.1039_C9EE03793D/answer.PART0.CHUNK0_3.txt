[1] "Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization."
[2] "In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture."
[3] "While a number of chemical looping based chemical production approaches have shown promising results, this concept can be further expanded to a significantly wider sets of products using a variety of feedstock and energy sources."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants show that various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, exhibit different performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. Challenges persist in this field due to corrosiveness and intrinsic reaction properties. Future research and development efforts should focus on strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and redesign reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.
