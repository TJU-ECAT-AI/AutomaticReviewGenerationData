[1] "Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization."
[2] "In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture."
[3] "While a number of chemical looping based chemical production approaches have shown promising results, this concept can be further expanded to a significantly wider sets of products using a variety of feedstock and energy sources."

Chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization in chemical production compared to state-of-the-art technologies. It can lead to a substantial reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, often by an order of magnitude, without the requirement for carbon dioxide capture. This approach can be further extended to produce a wide range of products using diverse feedstocks and energy sources.

化学循环在化工生产中相比现有技术提供了显著的过程强化和熵损耗最小化的机会。它可以实现能量消耗和二氧化碳排放量的大幅减少，通常减少一个数量级，且无需进行二氧化碳捕获。这一方法还可以进一步扩展到使用各种原料和能源源生产更广泛的系列产品。
