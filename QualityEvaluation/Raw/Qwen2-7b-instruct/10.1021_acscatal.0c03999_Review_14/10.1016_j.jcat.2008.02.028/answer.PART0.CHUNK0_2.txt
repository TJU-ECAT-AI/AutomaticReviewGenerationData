[1] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[2] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation [6,12]."
[3] "High activity is ascribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, whereas lower activity is usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5."
[4] "In contrast, alumina- or titania-supported samples showed higher surface density (78 V/nm2),corresponding to polymeric vanadyl species."
[5] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."
[6] "To the best of our knowledge, to date no study has been carried out on the possible preparation of nanostructured V-supported catalysts for the present application."
[7] "A new procedure based on flame pyrolysis (FP) of an organic solution of metal ion precursors has been devised for the preparation of different single or mixed oxides [2229]."
[8] "In principle, the dilution inside porous silica should allow better dispersion of the active component, thereby providing also better control of the heat generated by the reaction and hence a decrease in local hot spots, which may be detrimental to process selectivity."
[9] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP-prepared silica by a traditional procedure."
[10] "The FP method usually leads to poorly porous materials with surface areas not exceeding 150 m2/g [2229]."
[11] "In contrast, the FP method usually leads to poorly porous materials with surface areas not exceeding 150 m2/g [2229]. This may represent another advantage of this preparation procedure over conventional techniques."
[12] "The catalysts considered in the present work were prepared by FP, with the aim of developing systems in which the active component is dispersed inside the inert matrix (silica in the present case) instead of being deposited over it."
[13] "The FP method favored the formation of VOSi bonds and thus the generation of isolated VOx species at concentrations greater than are usually obtained with impregnated silica."
[14] "The finding of a greater concentration of isolated VOx species in V10Si with respect to V10Si-i demonstrates the positive effect on selectivity to propylene, but only when the reaction was carried out under anaerobic conditions."
[15] "The same effect was observed for V2O5/SiO2 co-gel systems [30] and was attributed to the fact that when the reaction is carried out in the presence of molecular oxygen, the generation of unselective O2species (rather than the dispersion of the active sites) controls the selectivity of the process."
[16] "It is evident that the concomitant generation of the V and Si oxides achieved by the FP method led to a system that provides superior performance under anaerobic conditions due to the increased concentration of isolated VOx sites."
