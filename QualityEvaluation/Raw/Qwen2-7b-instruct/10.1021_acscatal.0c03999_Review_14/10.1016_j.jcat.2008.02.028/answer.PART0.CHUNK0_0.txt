[1] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[2] "On a further increase in V loading, V2O5 formed, thereby diminishing catalyst performance."
[3] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP-prepared silica by a traditional procedure."
[4] "The two catalysts exhibited very similar activity, but the V10Si sample demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated. In terms of selectivity and conversion, the performance varies significantly across different catalyst systems. Notably, the performance under anaerobic conditions often surpasses that under co-feed conditions, especially with catalysts prepared through flame pyrolysis (FP). This is attributed to the higher concentration of isolated VOx sites in the FP-prepared samples, which effectively controls the availability of surface O2 sites, limiting consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions. 

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties that can affect catalyst stability and longevity. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are crucial for future research and development. Flame pyrolysis (FP) preparation methods offer advantages in hosting higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, enabling higher selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts.

Key areas for future research include refining the FP technique to further enhance V dispersion and selectivity, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple metal oxides or incorporating promoters to improve performance. Additionally, studies aiming to understand the precise mechanisms of C-H bond activation and the role of different catalyst components in controlling reaction pathways could provide valuable insights for designing more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

近年来，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究主要集中在不同催化剂体系的发展上。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物被广泛研究。在选择性和转化率方面，不同催化剂体系的表现差异显著。值得注意的是，在厌氧条件下，使用火焰热解（FP）制备的催化剂的性能往往超过共供气条件下的性能，尤其是在FP预处理的硅胶上。这归因于FP预处理样品中较高的孤立VOx物种浓度，有效地控制了表面O2物种的可用性，限制了连续和并行的总燃烧反应。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括腐蚀性和固有的反应特性，这些因素可能影响催化剂的稳定性和寿命。提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程是未来研发的关键领域。火焰热解（FP）制备方法的优势在于能够承载更高的V浓度而不形成V2O5，从而实现与传统制备催化剂相比更高的选择性。

未来研究的关键领域包括进一步细化FP技术以增强V分散性和选择性、开发更耐用的催化剂支撑材料，并探索结合多种金属氧化物或引入促进剂以改善性能的可能性。此外，旨在理解C-H键活化精确机制以及不同催化剂成分在控制反应途径中的作用的研究，将为设计更高效和可持续的ODHP过程提供宝贵见解。
