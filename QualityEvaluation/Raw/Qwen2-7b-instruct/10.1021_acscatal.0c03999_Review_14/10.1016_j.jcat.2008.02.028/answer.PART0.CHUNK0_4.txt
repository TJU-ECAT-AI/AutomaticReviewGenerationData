[1] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation."
[2] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."
[3] "High activity is ascribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, whereas lower activity is usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5."
[4] "However, the yield of alkenes obtained on most catalysts is decreased by parallel or consecutive reactions, mainly the combustion of reactant and products to CO and CO2 and formation of oxygenated byproducts, such as acetic acid."
[5] "A further paramagnetic contribution, P, was added to F3 (Fig. 4a). Its hyperfine pattern can be easily interpreted by subtracting the component F3 of the spectra of Fig. 4 spectrum b or c (multiplied by a proper factor) from the spectral region F3 + P of spectrum a. In this way, the EPR pattern P appeared, very similar to that of the FP samples (Fig. 2)."
[6] "This effect would explain the high concentration of hydroxyls in our FP samples and the stabilization of vanadium into the silica matrix."
[7] "Remarkably, the selectivity to propylene or to COx was fully stable after 30 min TOS, although variations were very small."
[8] "The two samples exhibited very similar performance in the co-feed mode, but the V10Si sample demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions."

Recent studies on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated for their ability to selectively convert propane to alkenes with high conversion efficiency. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, centered on the reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vanadium (V) species, has been widely used to model the kinetics of the reaction. Active sites in the form of isolated or polymerized vanadate species, leading to a VOx monolayer, are generally attributed to high activity. However, the presence of bulk V2O5 typically correlates with lower activity.

Despite the potential for increased yields of alkenes, the ODHP process often faces challenges such as the decrease in alkene yield due to parallel or consecutive reactions, including combustion of reactants and products to CO and CO2, and the formation of oxygenated byproducts like acetic acid. The stability of selectivity towards propylene and COx after a 30-minute time on stream (TOS) highlights the robustness of the catalyst systems employed.

In particular, the use of flame pyrolysis (FP) for the preparation of catalysts has shown promising results. FP allows for the dispersion of active components inside the inert matrix, leading to better control of the reaction heat and reduced formation of localized hot spots, which can be detrimental to the selectivity of the process. The FP method also offers advantages over conventional techniques in terms of better control of the preparation procedure and preferred formation of nanosized agglomerates.

Moreover, the FP preparation method has facilitated the incorporation of higher concentrations of metal oxides without the segregation of bulk V2O5, thereby enabling higher selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. The unexpected high surface hydroxyl concentrations detected on FP samples, despite high calcination temperatures, are crucial for stabilizing dispersed V species.

Future research directions in this field should focus on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and redesigning reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. This includes developing new catalyst materials with enhanced selectivity and stability, improving the understanding of reaction mechanisms, and exploring alternative reaction conditions to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.

最近，有关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究主要集中在不同催化剂体系的性能分析。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在选择性地将丙烷转化为烯烃方面进行了广泛研究，且具有高转化效率。火星范克雷文机制被广泛应用以模拟反应的动态学，该机制以还原和随后的氧化为V为中心。作为活性位点的孤立或聚合的vanadate物种，形成VOx单层，通常与高活性相关联。然而，大量V2O5的存在通常与较低的活性相关。

尽管有可能提高烯烃的产量，但ODHP过程常常面临挑战，包括由于平行或连续反应导致的烷基产物减少，如反应物和产物的燃烧生成CO和CO2，以及形成氧代副产品，如乙酸。在30分钟时间上的流（TOS）后，丙烯或COx的选择性保持稳定的事实表明，所使用的催化剂系统表现出良好的稳定性。

特别是，通过火焰汽化（FP）制备催化剂的方法显示出有前景的结果。FP允许活性成分在惰性矩阵内部分散，从而更好地控制反应热并减少局部热点的形成，这可能对过程的选择性产生不利影响。与传统技术相比，FP方法在准备程序的控制、更优选的纳米级聚集体形成以及更高的金属氧化物浓度方面提供了优势。

此外，FP制备方法使能够以高于传统方法的方式在不发生V2O5分离的情况下包含更高浓度的金属氧化物，从而实现比传统催化剂更高的选择性。FP样品中检测到的意外高的表面羟基浓度，即使在高温煅烧后，对于稳定分散的V物种至关重要。

未来研究的方向应集中在改进C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂再生能力以及重新设计反应系统以优化ODHP过程。这包括开发具有增强选择性和稳定性的新型催化剂材料、加深对反应机理的理解，并探索降低能耗和环境影响的替代反应条件。
