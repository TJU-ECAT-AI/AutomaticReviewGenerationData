[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, because the overall reac- tion pathway is exothermic, and the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative routes are avoided [15]."
[2] "However, the yield of alkenes obtained on most catalysts is decreased by parallel or consecutive reactions, mainly the com- bustion of reactant and products to CO and CO2 and formation of oxygenated byproducts, such as acetic acid [6]."
[3] "On the other hand, selectivity problems also can be partly overcome by optimizing the catalyst formulation."
[4] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[5] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subse- quent reoxidation [6,12]."
[6] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active ox- idized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."
[7] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated [13,18,19]; it seems that V5+ is dis- persed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species,which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increas- ing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
[8] "High activity is as- cribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, whereas lower activity is usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5."
[9] "It has been shown [13] that samples supported on SiO2 mainly constitute isolated VOx species up to a surface density of ca. 2 V/nm2."
[10] "In contrast, alumina- or titania- supported samples showed higher surface density (78 V/nm2),corresponding to polymeric vanadyl species."
[11] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."
[12] "A new procedure based on flame pyrolysis (FP) of an organic solution of metal ion precursors has been devised for the preparation of different single or mixed oxides [2229]."
[13] "Consequently, the catalysts considered in the present work were prepared by FP, with the aim of developing systems in which the active component is dispersed inside the inert matrix (silica in the present case) instead of being deposited over it."
[14] "In contrast, the FP method usually leads to poorly porous materials with surface areas not exceeding 150 m2/g [2229]."
[15] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP- prepared silica by a traditional procedure."
[16] "The reaction under anaerobic conditions led to improved selectivity to propylene (around 2530% higher for a 3540% propane conversion) compared with that under co-feed conditions."
[17] "Remarkably, this property was specific to the V2O5SiO2 system. In fact, when vanadium oxide was sup- ported over either alumina or titania, no effective improvement in propylene selectivity was observed for the anaerobic opera- tion with respect to the co-feed mode [17]."
[18] "This is likely due to the peculiarity of the latter samples, which exhibited much higher-than-expected surface hydroxyl concentrations that decreased with increasing V loadings."
[19] "Furthermore, as evidenced by the spectroscopic characterization, the development of VOSi bonds confirms that a prerequisite for the formation of isolated VOx species was the presence of a high concentration of surface hydroxyl groups."
[20] "The finding of a greater concentration of isolated VOx species in V10Si with respect to V10Si-i demonstrates the positive effect on selectivity to propylene, but only when the reaction was carried out under anaerobic conditions."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. The key findings include:

1. Transition metal oxides, specifically vanadium oxides (VOx), have been extensively explored for their potential in producing alkenes through the ODH of light alkanes. These catalysts often show promise in yields of ethylene, propylene, and butenes.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation pathway is typically exothermic, offering an attractive alternative to non-oxidative methods. However, the yield of alkenes can be reduced due to parallel or consecutive reactions, such as combustion and the formation of oxygenated byproducts like acetic acid.

3. Catalyst optimization is crucial in overcoming selectivity issues. Various factors influence catalyst performance, including the type of active phase, support material, and the specific reaction conditions.

4. Vanadium oxides (VOx) have been the most widely investigated active phases due to their ability to produce high yields of alkenes when loaded properly on suitable supports. This is attributed to the dispersed nature of the active sites, which can be isolated or polymerized depending on the loading and support characteristics.

5. The active sites on vanadium oxide catalysts often consist of isolated vanadate species, which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing loading until a monolayer is formed. Higher activity is associated with isolated or polymerized vanadate species, while bulk V2O5 shows lower activity.

6. The surface density of active sites is influenced by the support material. For instance, silica-supported samples typically exhibit isolated VOx species up to a surface density of around 2 V/nm², while alumina or titania-supported samples have higher surface densities, corresponding to polymeric vanadyl species.

7. Catalyst preparation methods play a significant role in achieving high dispersion and selectivity. Impregnation is a common method, leading to deposition of vanadium on the surface of the support. However, a new flame pyrolysis (FP) technique has been developed for preparing catalysts with dispersed active components inside the inert matrix.

8. Flame pyrolysis (FP) methods often result in poorly porous materials with limited surface areas, typically not exceeding 150 m²/g. This can offer advantages over conventional techniques in terms of better dispersion control and heat generation management.

9. The study aimed to develop nanostructured vanadium-based catalysts with varying vanadium loadings through flame pyrolysis. These catalysts were compared for their performance in the ODH of propane against a traditionally impregnated sample.

10. The FP-prepared catalysts showed improved selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions, compared to co-feed operations. This improvement was attributed to the enhanced isolation of active sites and the absence of oligomeric species, which are more prevalent in samples prepared by impregnation.

11. The catalysts prepared through flame pyrolysis demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene, especially under anaerobic conditions, due to the presence of a higher concentration of isolated VOx species. This is believed to be influenced by the surface hydroxyl groups that stabilize the dispersed V species.

12. Challenges in the field include the corrosiveness of the reaction medium and the inherent properties of the catalysts. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

Key areas for future research and development include:

- Strategies for improving C-H bond activation: Investigating new catalysts and modifying existing ones to more efficiently activate C-H bonds for the desired dehydrogenation reactions.
- Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that can withstand multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration without significant loss of activity or selectivity.
- Optimizing reaction systems: Designing reaction conditions and systems that can maximize the efficiency of the ODHP process, taking into account factors such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates.
- Improving selectivity and conversion: Continuously refining catalyst formulations and operating conditions to achieve higher yields of alkenes with minimal side reactions and waste products.
- Expanding catalyst applications: Exploring the use of ODHP in various industrial processes, such as petrochemical production, biofuels synthesis, and chemical manufacturing, to broaden its impact and versatility.

3. 催化剂优化对于克服选择性问题至关重要。各种因素影响催化剂性能，包括活性相类型、支撑材料和特定反应条件。

4. 钒氧化物（VOx）由于其在适当负载下的分散性质而被广泛研究，这种分散的活性位点可以是孤立的或聚合的，具体取决于负载和支撑材料特性。

5. 钒氧化物催化剂上的活性位点通常由孤立的钒酸盐物种组成，这些物种随着负载增加而逐渐寡聚化并聚合，直到形成单层。较高活性与孤立或聚合的钒酸盐物种相关联，而纯二氧化钛显示较低活性。

6. 活性位点的表面密度受到支撑材料的影响。例如，硅基材料支持的样品通常具有孤立的VOx物种，表面密度约为每平方纳米2个钒原子，而铝基或二氧化钛支持的样品具有更高的表面密度，对应于聚合的钒酰基物种。

7. 催化剂制备方法对实现高分散性和选择性起着重要作用。浸渍是一种常见方法，导致将钒沉积到支撑物表面上。然而，一种新的火焰热解（FP）技术已被开发用于准备在惰性矩阵内部包含分散活性成分的催化剂。

8. 火焰热解（FP）方法往往导致孔隙度低的材料，表面面积不超过150平方米每克。这可能优于传统技术，在分散控制和热量生成管理方面提供优势。

9. 该研究旨在通过火焰热解开发具有不同钒负载的纳米结构的钒基催化剂，并与通过传统方法浸渍氟化硅的样本进行比较，以评估其在丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能。

10. 火焰热解制备的催化剂在无氧条件下表现出改善的丙烯选择性，与共供气操作相比。这种改进归因于活性位点的增强隔离以及与浸渍样本中更多存在的寡聚物种相比，存在更高的孤立VOx物种浓度。

11. 火焰热解制备的催化剂在无氧条件下显示出更高的丙烯选择性，特别是在存在表面羟基组分的情况下，这些羟基组分稳定了分散的V物种。

12. 在这个领域面临的挑战包括反应介质的腐蚀性和催化剂的内在属性。未来的研究方向集中在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以实现更高效的ODHP过程。
