The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated. In terms of selectivity and conversion, the performance varies significantly across different catalyst systems. Notably, the performance under anaerobic conditions often surpasses that under co-feed conditions, especially with catalysts prepared through flame pyrolysis (FP). This is attributed to the higher concentration of isolated VOx sites in the FP-prepared samples, which effectively controls the availability of surface O2 sites, limiting consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions. 

Persistent challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties that can affect catalyst stability and longevity. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes are crucial for future research and development. Flame pyrolysis (FP) preparation methods offer advantages in hosting higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, enabling higher selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts.

Key areas for future research include refining the FP technique to further enhance V dispersion and selectivity, developing more robust catalyst supports, and exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple metal oxides or incorporating promoters to improve performance. Additionally, studies aiming to understand the precise mechanisms of C-H bond activation and the role of different catalyst components in controlling reaction pathways could provide valuable insights for designing more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

近年来，使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究主要集中在不同催化剂体系的发展上。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物被广泛研究。在选择性和转化率方面，不同催化剂体系的表现差异显著。值得注意的是，在厌氧条件下，使用火焰热解（FP）制备的催化剂的性能往往超过共供气条件下的性能，尤其是在FP预处理的硅胶上。这归因于FP预处理样品中较高的孤立VOx物种浓度，有效地控制了表面O2物种的可用性，限制了连续和并行的总燃烧反应。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括腐蚀性和固有的反应特性，这些因素可能影响催化剂的稳定性和寿命。提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程是未来研发的关键领域。火焰热解（FP）制备方法的优势在于能够承载更高的V浓度而不形成V2O5，从而实现与传统制备催化剂相比更高的选择性。

未来研究的关键领域包括进一步细化FP技术以增强V分散性和选择性、开发更耐用的催化剂支撑材料，并探索结合多种金属氧化物或引入促进剂以改善性能的可能性。此外，旨在理解C-H键活化精确机制以及不同催化剂成分在控制反应途径中的作用的研究，将为设计更高效和可持续的ODHP过程提供宝贵见解。

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalyst systems. The performance of these systems is evaluated in terms of selectivity and conversion. Notably, the FP (flame pyrolysis)-prepared catalysts exhibit higher selectivity to propylene, especially under anaerobic conditions. This improvement is attributed to the formation of highly dispersed V5+O groups incorporated into the silica matrix. The EPR characterization reveals that these active sites consist of V4+O groups pointing out from the catalyst surface, which helps in demonstrating the difference in catalytic behavior compared to the impregnated sample. The key areas for future research and development include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency. 

The persistent challenges in this field involve dealing with corrosiveness and the inherent properties of the reaction, which hinder the optimization of ODHP processes. Strategies for addressing these challenges might include modifying catalyst materials, improving reaction conditions, and developing more robust reaction systems that can withstand the harsh conditions while maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates.

The high surface hydroxyl concentrations detected on the FP samples, despite undergoing high calcination temperatures, contribute to stabilizing the dispersed V species, thereby facilitating better performance under anaerobic conditions. This finding opens up opportunities for further exploration into the role of surface functionalities in enhancing catalyst activity and selectivity for ODHP.

The key areas for future research could focus on refining the FP preparation technique to achieve even higher dispersion of active sites, developing novel catalyst materials that can withstand corrosive environments, and optimizing reaction parameters to achieve higher selectivity and conversion rates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

[16] "It is evident that the concomitant generation of the V and Si oxides achieved by the FP method led to a system that provides superior performance under anaerobic conditions due to the increased concentration of isolated VOx sites."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, because the overall reac- tion pathway is exothermic, and the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative routes are avoided [15]."
[2] "However, the yield of alkenes obtained on most catalysts is decreased by parallel or consecutive reactions, mainly the com- bustion of reactant and products to CO and CO2 and formation of oxygenated byproducts, such as acetic acid [6]."
[3] "On the other hand, selectivity problems also can be partly overcome by optimizing the catalyst formulation."
[4] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[5] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subse- quent reoxidation [6,12]."
[6] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active ox- idized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."
[7] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated [13,18,19]; it seems that V5+ is dis- persed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species,which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increas- ing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
[8] "High activity is as- cribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, whereas lower activity is usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5."
[9] "It has been shown [13] that samples supported on SiO2 mainly constitute isolated VOx species up to a surface density of ca. 2 V/nm2."
[10] "In contrast, alumina- or titania- supported samples showed higher surface density (78 V/nm2),corresponding to polymeric vanadyl species."
[11] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."

[15] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP- prepared silica by a traditional procedure."
[16] "The reaction under anaerobic conditions led to improved selectivity to propylene (around 2530% higher for a 3540% propane conversion) compared with that under co-feed conditions."
[17] "Remarkably, this property was specific to the V2O5SiO2 system. In fact, when vanadium oxide was sup- ported over either alumina or titania, no effective improvement in propylene selectivity was observed for the anaerobic opera- tion with respect to the co-feed mode [17]."
[18] "This is likely due to the peculiarity of the latter samples, which exhibited much higher-than-expected surface hydroxyl concentrations that decreased with increasing V loadings."
[19] "Furthermore, as evidenced by the spectroscopic characterization, the development of VOSi bonds confirms that a prerequisite for the formation of isolated VOx species was the presence of a high concentration of surface hydroxyl groups."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. The key findings include:

1. Transition metal oxides, specifically vanadium oxides (VOx), have been extensively explored for their potential in producing alkenes through the ODH of light alkanes. These catalysts often show promise in yields of ethylene, propylene, and butenes.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation pathway is typically exothermic, offering an attractive alternative to non-oxidative methods. However, the yield of alkenes can be reduced due to parallel or consecutive reactions, such as combustion and the formation of oxygenated byproducts like acetic acid.

3. Catalyst optimization is crucial in overcoming selectivity issues. Various factors influence catalyst performance, including the type of active phase, support material, and the specific reaction conditions.

4. Vanadium oxides (VOx) have been the most widely investigated active phases due to their ability to produce high yields of alkenes when loaded properly on suitable supports. This is attributed to the dispersed nature of the active sites, which can be isolated or polymerized depending on the loading and support characteristics.

5. The active sites on vanadium oxide catalysts often consist of isolated vanadate species, which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing loading until a monolayer is formed. Higher activity is associated with isolated or polymerized vanadate species, while bulk V2O5 shows lower activity.

6. The surface density of active sites is influenced by the support material. For instance, silica-supported samples typically exhibit isolated VOx species up to a surface density of around 2 V/nm², while alumina or titania-supported samples have higher surface densities, corresponding to polymeric vanadyl species.

7. Catalyst preparation methods play a significant role in achieving high dispersion and selectivity. Impregnation is a common method, leading to deposition of vanadium on the surface of the support. However, a new flame pyrolysis (FP) technique has been developed for preparing catalysts with dispersed active components inside the inert matrix.

8. Flame pyrolysis (FP) methods often result in poorly porous materials with limited surface areas, typically not exceeding 150 m²/g. This can offer advantages over conventional techniques in terms of better dispersion control and heat generation management.

9. The study aimed to develop nanostructured vanadium-based catalysts with varying vanadium loadings through flame pyrolysis. These catalysts were compared for their performance in the ODH of propane against a traditionally impregnated sample.

10. The FP-prepared catalysts showed improved selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions, compared to co-feed operations. This improvement was attributed to the enhanced isolation of active sites and the absence of oligomeric species, which are more prevalent in samples prepared by impregnation.

11. The catalysts prepared through flame pyrolysis demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene, especially under anaerobic conditions, due to the presence of a higher concentration of isolated VOx species. This is believed to be influenced by the surface hydroxyl groups that stabilize the dispersed V species.

12. Challenges in the field include the corrosiveness of the reaction medium and the inherent properties of the catalysts. Future research directions focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

Key areas for future research and development include:

- Strategies for improving C-H bond activation: Investigating new catalysts and modifying existing ones to more efficiently activate C-H bonds for the desired dehydrogenation reactions.
- Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that can withstand multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration without significant loss of activity or selectivity.
- Optimizing reaction systems: Designing reaction conditions and systems that can maximize the efficiency of the ODHP process, taking into account factors such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates.
- Improving selectivity and conversion: Continuously refining catalyst formulations and operating conditions to achieve higher yields of alkenes with minimal side reactions and waste products.
- Expanding catalyst applications: Exploring the use of ODHP in various industrial processes, such as petrochemical production, biofuels synthesis, and chemical manufacturing, to broaden its impact and versatility.

分析最近在使用温和氧化剂进行轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中催化剂系统的发展，特别是比较不同过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在选择性和转化率方面的性能。关键发现包括：

1. 过渡金属氧化物，尤其是钒氧化物（VOx），因其在适当负载下在合适支持物上的应用，显示出通过轻烷烃氧化脱氢产生烯烃的潜力。这些催化剂常用于乙烯、丙烯和丁二烯的高产率生产。

2. 脱氢反应通常为放热过程，提供了一种有吸引力的非氧化路径替代方案。然而，由于平行或连续反应，如反应物和产物的燃烧生成CO和CO2以及形成氧代副产品（如乙酸），烯烃的产量会降低。

3. 催化剂优化对于克服选择性问题至关重要。各种因素影响催化剂性能，包括活性相类型、支撑材料和特定反应条件。

4. 钒氧化物（VOx）由于其在适当负载下的分散性质而被广泛研究，这种分散的活性位点可以是孤立的或聚合的，具体取决于负载和支撑材料特性。

5. 钒氧化物催化剂上的活性位点通常由孤立的钒酸盐物种组成，这些物种随着负载增加而逐渐寡聚化并聚合，直到形成单层。较高活性与孤立或聚合的钒酸盐物种相关联，而纯二氧化钛显示较低活性。

6. 活性位点的表面密度受到支撑材料的影响。例如，硅基材料支持的样品通常具有孤立的VOx物种，表面密度约为每平方纳米2个钒原子，而铝基或二氧化钛支持的样品具有更高的表面密度，对应于聚合的钒酰基物种。

7. 催化剂制备方法对实现高分散性和选择性起着重要作用。浸渍是一种常见方法，导致将钒沉积到支撑物表面上。然而，一种新的火焰热解（FP）技术已被开发用于准备在惰性矩阵内部包含分散活性成分的催化剂。

8. 火焰热解（FP）方法往往导致孔隙度低的材料，表面面积不超过150平方米每克。这可能优于传统技术，在分散控制和热量生成管理方面提供优势。

9. 该研究旨在通过火焰热解开发具有不同钒负载的纳米结构的钒基催化剂，并与通过传统方法浸渍氟化硅的样本进行比较，以评估其在丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能。

10. 火焰热解制备的催化剂在无氧条件下表现出改善的丙烯选择性，与共供气操作相比。这种改进归因于活性位点的增强隔离以及与浸渍样本中更多存在的寡聚物种相比，存在更高的孤立VOx物种浓度。

11. 火焰热解制备的催化剂在无氧条件下显示出更高的丙烯选择性，特别是在存在表面羟基组分的情况下，这些羟基组分稳定了分散的V物种。

12. 在这个领域面临的挑战包括反应介质的腐蚀性和催化剂的内在属性。未来的研究方向集中在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以实现更高效的ODHP过程。

Recent studies on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the performance of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides have been extensively investigated for their ability to selectively convert propane to alkenes with high conversion efficiency. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, centered on the reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vanadium (V) species, has been widely used to model the kinetics of the reaction. Active sites in the form of isolated or polymerized vanadate species, leading to a VOx monolayer, are generally attributed to high activity. However, the presence of bulk V2O5 typically correlates with lower activity.

Despite the potential for increased yields of alkenes, the ODHP process often faces challenges such as the decrease in alkene yield due to parallel or consecutive reactions, including combustion of reactants and products to CO and CO2, and the formation of oxygenated byproducts like acetic acid. The stability of selectivity towards propylene and COx after a 30-minute time on stream (TOS) highlights the robustness of the catalyst systems employed.

In particular, the use of flame pyrolysis (FP) for the preparation of catalysts has shown promising results. FP allows for the dispersion of active components inside the inert matrix, leading to better control of the reaction heat and reduced formation of localized hot spots, which can be detrimental to the selectivity of the process. The FP method also offers advantages over conventional techniques in terms of better control of the preparation procedure and preferred formation of nanosized agglomerates.

Moreover, the FP preparation method has facilitated the incorporation of higher concentrations of metal oxides without the segregation of bulk V2O5, thereby enabling higher selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. The unexpected high surface hydroxyl concentrations detected on FP samples, despite high calcination temperatures, are crucial for stabilizing dispersed V species.

Future research directions in this field should focus on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and redesigning reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. This includes developing new catalyst materials with enhanced selectivity and stability, improving the understanding of reaction mechanisms, and exploring alternative reaction conditions to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.

最近，有关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究主要集中在不同催化剂体系的性能分析。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在选择性地将丙烷转化为烯烃方面进行了广泛研究，且具有高转化效率。火星范克雷文机制被广泛应用以模拟反应的动态学，该机制以还原和随后的氧化为V为中心。作为活性位点的孤立或聚合的vanadate物种，形成VOx单层，通常与高活性相关联。然而，大量V2O5的存在通常与较低的活性相关。

尽管有可能提高烯烃的产量，但ODHP过程常常面临挑战，包括由于平行或连续反应导致的烷基产物减少，如反应物和产物的燃烧生成CO和CO2，以及形成氧代副产品，如乙酸。在30分钟时间上的流（TOS）后，丙烯或COx的选择性保持稳定的事实表明，所使用的催化剂系统表现出良好的稳定性。

特别是，通过火焰汽化（FP）制备催化剂的方法显示出有前景的结果。FP允许活性成分在惰性矩阵内部分散，从而更好地控制反应热并减少局部热点的形成，这可能对过程的选择性产生不利影响。与传统技术相比，FP方法在准备程序的控制、更优选的纳米级聚集体形成以及更高的金属氧化物浓度方面提供了优势。

此外，FP制备方法使能够以高于传统方法的方式在不发生V2O5分离的情况下包含更高浓度的金属氧化物，从而实现比传统催化剂更高的选择性。FP样品中检测到的意外高的表面羟基浓度，即使在高温煅烧后，对于稳定分散的V物种至关重要。

未来研究的方向应集中在改进C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂再生能力以及重新设计反应系统以优化ODHP过程。这包括开发具有增强选择性和稳定性的新型催化剂材料、加深对反应机理的理解，并探索降低能耗和环境影响的替代反应条件。
