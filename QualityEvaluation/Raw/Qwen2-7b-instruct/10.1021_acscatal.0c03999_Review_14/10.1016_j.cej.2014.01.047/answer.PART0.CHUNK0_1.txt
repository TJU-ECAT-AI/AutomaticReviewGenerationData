[1] "In the commercial process of propane dehydrogenation, the reactor is still traditional fixed-bed, moving-bed or recycling fluid-bed, and the catalyst can be only selected from Cr-based catalysts and Pt-based catalysts."
[2] "For these catalysts, researchers are devoting to improving propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, for example, reducing coking reaction by adding alkali metals as promoters [47] or using new materials such as molecular sieve as supports [811]."
[3] "However, the severe pollution to environment of Cr-based catalysts and the high cost of Pt-based catalysts are problems that defy solution."
[4] "In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation [1219]."
[5] "Among the studied catalysts, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation [1517], exhibiting 20-65% propane conversion."
[6] "Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored the activation and cleavage of CH bonds, it also brought about much side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability."
[7] "Previous researchers have shown that sulfation of silica has beneficial effects on the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 in ethane dehydrogenation [24]."
[8] "Herein, in this paper, we evaluated the performance of sulfated alumina supported iron catalyst in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and correlated the contribution of sulfate species to the different behavior."
[9] "Meanwhile, the reasons for catalyst deactivation were also discussed."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, the literature showcases the performance of diverse catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Notably, Fe-based catalysts are highlighted as promising, offering superior selectivity and conversion rates compared to traditional Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. Challenges persist, such as environmental concerns with Cr-based catalysts and the high cost of Pt-based catalysts. The literature emphasizes the importance of improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Strategies for addressing these challenges include the utilization of soft oxidants and the incorporation of alkali metals as promoters to reduce coking reactions. Additionally, the use of molecular sieves as supports is proposed as a means to improve catalyst stability. The study of sulfated alumina-supported iron catalysts is also discussed, revealing that sulfate species contribute positively to the dehydrogenation performance by enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity, thereby facilitating efficient propane conversion to propylene. The evaluation of catalyst deactivation mechanisms, particularly the loss of sulfur species and the reduction of iron cations, is also addressed, highlighting their pivotal roles in the irreversible deactivation of the catalysts.
