[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an important route to produce propylene."
[2] "It was demonstrated that sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2 4 and interacted with Fe atoms via FeOS bond, leading to enhanced acidity especially the generation of Bronsted acids."
[3] "Meanwhile, propane is more likely to adsorb on Fe species at the electron-deficient state, resulting in higher activity."
[4] "Catalytic performance was measured under atmospheric pressure at 560 C in a fixed-bed reactor, where 2 g catalyst was loaded."
[5] "Significant differences were found in the MS signals of oxidation products. Fewer amount of COx were observed in the initial stage,which decreased much lower with TOS."
[6] "The different acidity and reducibility of 20Fe/5SAl catalyst was related to the introduction of sulfate species and the details were depicted in Scheme 1."
[7] "From aforementioned results, it could be concluded that sulfa- tion of alumina significantly changed the electronic property of the catalysts, leading to higher acidity and adsorption capacity of propane, which were responsible for the high activity and selectiv- ity in propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "However, with extended reaction or regeneration, sulfate species were released in the form of SO2."
[9] "It is important to note that after six cycles, surface molar ratio of Fe/Al also decreased."
[10] "Therefore, the challenge for future study is the preservation of sulfur species."

The study highlights recent advancements in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, particularly focusing on the use of iron-based catalysts supported on sulfated alumina. The catalysts show exceptional performance, yielding up to 20% propylene with a selectivity exceeding 80%. The sulfur species, existing predominantly as SO2 4, interact with iron atoms through a FeOS bond, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity. This interaction leads to better activation of propane, increasing the catalytic activity. However, the study identifies the release of sulfur species in the form of SO2 as a key factor in the irreversible deactivation of the catalysts over extended reaction times. Future research aims to preserve sulfur species on the catalyst surface to maintain optimal dehydrogenation performance.

该研究强调了丙烷催化脱氢的最新进展，特别是铁基催化剂在硫化氧化铝上的应用。这些催化剂表现出出色的性能，可产生高达20%的丙烯，选择性超过80%。硫物种主要以SO2 4的形式存在，并通过FeOS键与铁原子相互作用，增强酸性和吸附能力。这种相互作用导致更好的丙烷激活，提高催化活性。然而，研究发现，在长时间反应过程中，硫物种以SO2的形式释放，这是催化剂不可逆失活的关键因素。未来的研究目标是保持催化剂表面的硫物种，以维持最佳脱氢性能。
