[1] "Iron-based catalysts are a kind of pollution-free, cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Among the studied catalysts, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation, exhibiting 20-65% propane conversion."
[3] "Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored the activation and cleavage of CH, it also brought about much side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability."
[4] "Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron."
[5] "Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 exhibited high selectivity (85%) in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in spite of low conversion (less than 10%)."
[6] "Sulfation of alumina produced a notably positive effect on propane conversion and propylene yield."
[7] "The textural properties of supports and catalysts were also measured and tabulated in Table S1. After sulfation, the surface area of Al2O3 decreased from 181.6 m2/g to 156.5 m2/g, however, there was little change in the surface area and pore structure of catalysts, suggesting that the sulfated support is more favorable to the dispersion of iron oxide."
[8] "After six reaction-regeneration cycles, only the peak at 168.5 eV with much lower intensity was observed. Consequently, it could be speculated that the loss of sulfate made great contribution to the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5SAl."
[9] "As for catalyst deactivation, the loss of sulfate ion and the reduction of iron cations were believed to be the main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5SAl."

1. Iron-based catalysts are pollution-free, inexpensive, and readily available materials commonly utilized in alkane dehydrogenation. Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loadings demonstrate significant activity in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation, achieving conversion rates of 20-65%.

2. Zeolite ZSM-5, despite its strong acidity promoting activation and cleavage of CH bonds, leads to substantial side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability.

3. Compared to ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is considered an excellent support due to its lower acidity, which prevents the sintering of iron.

4. Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 exhibits high selectivity in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, achieving 85% selectivity despite low conversion rates below 10%.

5. Sulfation of alumina enhances the activity and selectivity of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

6. After sulfation, the surface area of Al2O3 decreases, but the surface area and pore structure of catalysts remain largely unchanged, indicating improved dispersion of iron oxide.

7. The loss of sulfate ions and reduction of iron cations are the primary causes of irreversible deactivation in 20Fe/5SAl catalysts.

1. 铁基催化剂是一种无污染、廉价且易于获取的材料，在烷烃脱氢反应中广泛应用。Fe/ZSM-5催化剂在N2O介导的丙烷脱氢中表现出低负载量，活性高，丙烷转化率可达20-65%。

2. 尽管ZSM-5的强酸性有利于激活和裂解CH键，但也带来了大量副反应，如裂解和多聚化，导致选择性和稳定性降低。

3. 相比于ZSM-5，c-Al2O3被认为是性能优秀的支持剂，其较低的酸性可防止铁的聚集。

4. Fe2O3/c-Al2O3在丙烷脱氢反应中的选择性高达85%，尽管其转化率低于10%。

5. 硫化铝显著提高了催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性和产率。

6. 经硫化处理后，Al2O3的表面积减少，但催化剂的表面积和孔结构变化不大，表明铁氧化物的分散得到了改善。

7. 硫酸盐离子的丢失和铁离子的还原是不可逆失活的主要原因20Fe/5SAl催化剂的主要原因。
