The document discusses recent advancements in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, specifically focusing on the use of iron oxide catalysts supported on sulfated alumina. It highlights that the introduction of sulfate species enhances the acidity of the catalyst, leading to better adsorption capacity for propane and consequently improved dehydrogenation performance. The study also points out that the loss of sulfate species, primarily in the form of SO2, is the primary cause of irreversible catalyst deactivation. This deactivation involves not only the removal of sulfur groups but also the reduction of iron cations.

The study highlights recent advancements in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, particularly focusing on the use of iron-based catalysts supported on sulfated alumina. The catalysts show exceptional performance, yielding up to 20% propylene with a selectivity exceeding 80%. The sulfur species, existing predominantly as SO2 4, interact with iron atoms through a FeOS bond, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity. This interaction leads to better activation of propane, increasing the catalytic activity. However, the study identifies the release of sulfur species in the form of SO2 as a key factor in the irreversible deactivation of the catalysts over extended reaction times. Future research aims to preserve sulfur species on the catalyst surface to maintain optimal dehydrogenation performance.
