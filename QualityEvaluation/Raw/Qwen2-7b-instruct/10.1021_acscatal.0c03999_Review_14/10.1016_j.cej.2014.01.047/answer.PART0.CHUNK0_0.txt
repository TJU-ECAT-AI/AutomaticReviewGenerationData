[1] "In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation [1219]."
[2] "Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron."
[3] "Sulfated alumina support was prepared as follows: firstly, pseudo boehmite, deionized water and hydrochloric acid with a mass ratio of 10:30:1 were mixed and placed in a water bath at 65 C until the pH value reached 34, meanwhile, the sol formed."
[4] "Sulfate species interacted with Fe via FeOS bonds."
[5] "The interaction leads to enhanced acidity and stronger adsorption capacity of C3H8."
[6] "XPS and on-line MS results indicated the loss of sulfur species in the form of SO2 was the main reason for the irreversible deactivation of catalysts."
[7] "Not only sulfate groups but also iron species played an important role in the reaction, and loss of sulfate groups was the main reason for the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5SAl."

The document discusses recent advancements in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, specifically focusing on the use of iron oxide catalysts supported on sulfated alumina. It highlights that the introduction of sulfate species enhances the acidity of the catalyst, leading to better adsorption capacity for propane and consequently improved dehydrogenation performance. The study also points out that the loss of sulfate species, primarily in the form of SO2, is the primary cause of irreversible catalyst deactivation. This deactivation involves not only the removal of sulfur groups but also the reduction of iron cations. The document emphasizes the importance of sulfur species in maintaining the catalyst's activity and suggests that future research should focus on strategies to preserve sulfur on the catalyst surface to improve catalyst stability and regenerability.
