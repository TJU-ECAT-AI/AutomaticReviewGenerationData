[1] "Although naphtha is the main feedstock for ethene production in Western Europe and Japan, natural-gas-derived feedstocks are mainly used in the United States and the Middle East."
[2] "The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in particular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, including the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane."
[3] "Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reactions.[610]"
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) is a promising route with potentially high selectivity."
[5] "The high energy barriers that are involved in the single-electron process have disadvantages compared to surface catalytic processes."
[6] "The cleavage of the first CH bond may occur homolytically or heterolytically."
[7] "Three options exist to accomplish this goal: The first option is to use oxides with low specific surface areas, thereby minimizing the concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites."
[8] "However, in this case, only the vanadia-related acid sites are responsi-ble for product degradation towards carbon oxides."
[9] "Moreover, olefin desorption is accelerated in the presence of basic sites on this class of catalysts, in contrast to redox-active catalysts, in which acid sites that are in spatial proximity to redox pairs favor olefin desorption."
[10] "The addition of halide anions (Cl, Br) further enhances ac- tivity and selectivity."
