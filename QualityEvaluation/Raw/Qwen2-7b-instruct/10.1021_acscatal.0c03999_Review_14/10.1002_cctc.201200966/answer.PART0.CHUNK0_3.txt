[1] "Although naphtha is the main feedstock for ethene production in Western Europe and Japan, natural-gas-derived feedstocks are mainly used in the United States and the Middle East."
[2] "The lack of suitable catalysts that combine high activity and selectivity has prevented their industrial realization so far."
[3] "Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reactions."
[4] "The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, including the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light-olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants."
[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) has not been implemented on a large scale yet."
[7] "The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods."
