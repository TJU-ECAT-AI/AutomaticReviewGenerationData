<p>The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, including the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane. This latter process offers conceptual advantages and,therefore, has been the subject of substantial research activi- ties.</p>
<p>Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reac- tions.[610] Because of the special role of the ODH of ethane and its potential process applications, we have decided to take a different approach. Therefore, this Review summarizes the current state of ethene production as a baseline for the poten- tial and challenges that face the development of new process- es. This Review also describes insight on the atomic and mo- lecular levels, as well as into the ongoing developments in cat- alytic processes and reactor engineering.</p>
<p>Steam cracking, that is, high-temperature pyrolysis in the presence of diluting steam, is the most established industrial process for the manufacture of ethene. Typical feedstocks for this reaction are various grades of naphtha and components of natural gas.</p>
<p>Although naphtha is the main feedstock for ethene production in Western Europe and Japan, natural-gas-derived feedstocks are mainly used in the United States and the Middle East.</p>

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this review compares the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. It highlights the persistent challenges, such as the corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and outlines key areas for future research and development. These areas include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

The review emphasizes the importance of alternative processes for ethene production due to the rising crude oil prices and the availability of ethane from shale gas. It contrasts steam cracking, the traditional industrial method, with newer alternatives like dehydration of ethanol and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The latter offers conceptual advantages and has garnered significant research interest.

Transition metal/metal oxide systems, particularly those based on vanadium and molybdenum, have been extensively studied for their potential in ODHP. These catalysts exhibit redox activity, capable of undergoing changes in oxidation state between +III, +IV, and +V. They can also form peroxo species, which are crucial for the activation of the first C-H bond.

Main group element metal oxides, such as those derived from niobium, tantalum, and cerium, have also shown promise in ODHP. These catalysts can alter their electronic properties, adjusting oxygen mobility to enhance selectivity. The inclusion of dopants or promoters, like niobium and tin, can improve performance by eliminating undesired reaction pathways or increasing the concentration of non-stoichiometric oxygen species.

The review also acknowledges the importance of addressing challenges, such as catalyst corrosion and the optimization of reaction conditions. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation aim to develop more selective and stable catalysts. Enhancing catalyst regenerability involves creating materials that can withstand multiple cycles without significant loss of activity or selectivity. Optimizing reaction systems focuses on tailoring the process parameters, including temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to achieve higher conversion and selectivity.

In summary, the review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in ODHP, highlighting the potential of various catalyst systems and outlining critical areas for future research to overcome existing challenges and advance the technology towards industrial implementation.

Future research should concentrate on developing more efficient and selective catalysts, improving catalyst stability and regenerability, and refining reaction systems to maximize the yield of desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This includes exploring novel catalyst architectures, modifying existing catalysts to enhance their performance, and investigating the underlying mechanisms that govern the reaction pathways and product selectivity. Addressing these challenges will be essential for realizing the full potential of ODHP as an alternative process for ethene production.
