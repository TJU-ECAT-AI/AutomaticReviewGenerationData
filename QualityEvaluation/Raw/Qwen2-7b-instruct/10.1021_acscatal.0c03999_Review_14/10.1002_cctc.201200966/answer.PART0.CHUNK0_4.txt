[1] "Although naphtha is the main feedstock for ethene production in Western Europe and Japan, natural-gas-derived feedstocks are mainly used in the United States and the Middle East."
[2] "For naphtha cracker, full-range naphtha (boiling point: 302008C) or C6C8 cuts are typically used as feedstocks."
[3] "The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in particular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, including the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane."
[4] "This latter process offers conceptual advantages and,therefore, has been the subject of substantial research activities."
[5] "Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reactions."
[6] "Because of the special role of the ODH of ethane and its potential process applications, we have decided to take a different approach."
[7] "Therefore, this Review summarizes the current state of ethene production as a baseline for the poten- tial and challenges that face the development of new process- es."

The document discusses the current state of ethylene production, focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) process as a potential alternative to traditional steam cracking. It highlights the advantages of ODHE, such as its conceptual simplicity and the potential for utilizing light alkanes, especially ethane, as feedstock. The review also addresses the challenges in developing ODHE processes, including the lack of suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity, and the need for further research to enhance catalyst regenerability and optimize the reaction systems. The document mentions that the interest in ODHE has increased due to the rising cost of crude oil and the availability of ethane in shale gas, which makes it an attractive feedstock for ethylene production.
