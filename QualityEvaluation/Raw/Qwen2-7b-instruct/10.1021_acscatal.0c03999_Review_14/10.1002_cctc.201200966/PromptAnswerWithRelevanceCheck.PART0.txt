<p>Despite the large number of contributions to this area, the nature of the active site that abstracts the H atom is still debated.</p>
<p>A likely model suggests that [Li+O] acts as the active site to generate the radicals by abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming an OH group.</p>
<p>Some examples of catalysts that generate radicals on the surface, with free-radical processes prevailing in the gas phase,include rare-earth oxides and alkali oxides.</p>
<p>Vanadium-based catalysts can follow the same type of paired-electron mechanism.</p>
<p>The cleavage of the first CH bond may occur homolytically or heterolytically.</p>
<p>Two questions, that is, which of the oxygen atoms participate in the critical first CH bond activation and what is the structure of the active site, have been vividly debated, without reaching an unequivocal conclusion.</p>
<p>One important parameter, especially for redox-active catalysts,is the strength of the metaloxygen bond in the active site.</p>
<p>As the strength of this bond varies, the activity and selectivity of an oxidation catalyst will pass through a maximum in terms of the formation rate of the partial oxidation product.</p>
<p>For this mechanism,two vanadia centers have to cooperate as shown in Figure 6.</p>
<p>Whereas only V5+ could be observed in freshly calcined catalysts, V4+ was also detected on used catalysts, especially after experiments with high conversion levels.</p>
<p>The influence of the oxidation state of the vanadia species becomes important if the ODH on vanadia-based systems is initiated by the transfer of paired electrons.</p>
<p>Another potential catalyst support for vanadate species is the inexpensive and relatively stable MgO and this catalyst has been the subject of several studies.</p>
<p>Chao et al. investigated MgO as a support by comparing two groups of mixed-metal oxides, that is, mesostructured Mg/ V oxide and a mixed oxide that was prepared by a solid-state reaction between MgO and V2O5.</p>
<p>As MgO is known to have basic sites and vanadate species,together with the fact that pure V2O5 des not show any basic sites,</p>
<p>Chao et al. studied MgO as a support by comparing two groups of mixed-metal oxides, that is, mesostructured Mg/ V oxide and a mixed oxide that was prepared by a solid-state reaction between MgO and V2O5.</p>
<p>However, the behavior of acidic sites must not be compared with the influence of acidic sites in vanadia species that are supported on bulk oxides, in which acidic centers on the support favor an unselective conversion of ethane.</p>
<p>Phosphorus is another known dopant. One example is (VO)2P2O7, both in bulk and supported on TiO2.</p>
<p>As with V oxides, Mo oxides are also active for the ODH of ethane.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the active site has been concluded to be a molybdenyl group, which activates the first CH bond, inducing a homolytic cleavage through a single-electron process.</p>
<p>However, different authors have studied Al-supported Mo systems, which have suggested that the anchoring of MoO-support bonds is critical for the ODH reactivity, thus suggesting that oxygen atoms between the support and the molybdenum species are responsible for the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>It has been reported that such a catalyst, with an ortho- rhombic Mo3VOx structure, is very active.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this case, the spatial proximity of acidic and redox sites within a molecular-sieve framework is especially positive for ODH reactions.</p>
<p>It has been speculated that dissolved O2 in the molten chlo-ride reacts to form positively charged Cl atoms.</p>
<p>However, the exact mechanism is still matter of debate.</p>

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, is compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this field include corrosiveness and the inherent reaction properties of ODHP processes. Key areas for future research and development include improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

1. The nature of the active site responsible for hydrogen abstraction in ODHP is still debated among researchers. A possible model suggests that [Li+O] acts as the active site to generate radicals by abstracting hydrogen atoms and forming OH groups.

2. Catalysts like rare-earth oxides and alkali oxides are capable of generating radicals on their surfaces, with the propagation of these radicals occurring in the gas phase. This process is often accompanied by free-radical reactions.

3. Vanadium-based catalysts can follow a paired-electron mechanism, involving the simultaneous transfer of two electrons for the cleavage of the first CH bond.

4. The cleavage of the first CH bond can occur either homolytically or heterolytically. The structure and participation of oxygen atoms in the activation of the first CH bond are subjects of ongoing debate.

5. The strength of the metal-oxygen bond in the active site of redox-active catalysts is a crucial factor affecting the activity and selectivity of oxidation catalysts. This bond's strength can influence the formation rate of the partial oxidation product.

6. In the case of vanadia catalysts, the terminal V=O bond or the VO-support bond is debated as the active site for the activation of the first CH bond. However, the bridging VOAl bond is often considered the only viable option.

7. The influence of the oxidation state of vanadia species becomes significant when initiating the ODH reaction via the transfer of paired electrons. Cooperation between two neighboring redox sites or materials is necessary for the ODH reaction.

8. Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a common support for vanadate species, but its acidic sites do not necessarily play a crucial role in the reaction. Instead, the acidic/basic properties of the support may affect reactivity.

9. Mixed-metal oxides, such as those composed of magnesium and vanadium, can exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in the ODHP of propane. The mesostructured magnesium/vanadium oxide is often more active than its solid-state counterpart.

10. The acidic/basic properties of the support material, such as magnesium oxide, can influence the reaction mechanism by affecting the desorption of the formed olefin intermediates.

11. The spatial proximity of acidic and redox sites within a molecular sieve framework is beneficial for ODHP reactions, as it promotes the desorption of olefin intermediates and reduces the risk of total oxidation.

12. The interaction of acidic sites with redox sites within a catalyst can lead to faster olefin desorption, resulting in higher olefin selectivity at the same conversion level.

13. The addition of halide anions, such as chloride (Cl), bromide (Br), and iodide (I), to catalysts can enhance activity and selectivity in ODHP. These halides can modify the base strength and suppress carbonate formation.

14. Pure lithium chloride (LiCl) is often associated with the most active catalysts for ODHP, but it is also the least selective. The selectivity towards ethene inversely depends on the melting point of the chloride.

15. The exact mechanism involving the interaction of dissolved oxygen in molten alkali chlorides with lithium cations to form hypochlorite species is still a matter of debate.

16. Challenges in ODHP include dealing with corrosiveness and managing the inherent reaction properties of the process. Future research aims to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

5. 红外活性催化剂中金属氧键的强度是影响氧化催化剂活性和选择性的重要因素。这种键的强度可以影响部分氧化产物的形成速率。

6. 对于范德华催化剂来说，终端V=O键或VO支持键是激活第一个CH键的活性位点。然而，桥接的VOAl键通常被认为是唯一可行的选择。

7. 当通过配对电子转移启动ODHP反应时，钒氧化物种的氧化态影响变得重要。需要两个相邻的红ox中心或材料之间的合作来执行ODHP反应。

8. 氧化镁（MgO）常用于范德华物种的支撑，但其酸性位点并不一定在反应中起关键作用。相反，支撑材料的酸碱性质可能会影响反应性。

9. 由镁和钒组成的混合金属氧化物可以在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出增强的活性和选择性。在相同的转化水平下，多孔镁/钒氧化物通常比其固态等效物更活跃。

13. 添加卤化物离子，如氯化物（Cl）、溴化物（Br）和碘化物（I），到催化剂中可以增强ODHP的活性和选择性。这些卤化物可以修改基本强度并抑制碳酸盐的形成。

14. 纯锂氯化物（LiCl）通常与ODHP中活性最高的催化剂相关联，但它也是选择性最低的。乙烯的选择性与氯化物的熔点成反比。

15. 液态卤化物中的溶解氧与锂离子相互作用形成过氧化物的精确机制仍然是一个争论的问题。

16. ODHP面临的挑战包括处理腐蚀性和管理反应过程本身的固有特性。未来的研究旨在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以最大化ODHP效率。

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, this review compares the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. It highlights the persistent challenges, such as the corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and outlines key areas for future research and development. These areas include strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency.

The review emphasizes the importance of alternative processes for ethene production due to the rising crude oil prices and the availability of ethane from shale gas. It contrasts steam cracking, the traditional industrial method, with newer alternatives like dehydration of ethanol and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The latter offers conceptual advantages and has garnered significant research interest.

Transition metal/metal oxide systems, particularly those based on vanadium and molybdenum, have been extensively studied for their potential in ODHP. These catalysts exhibit redox activity, capable of undergoing changes in oxidation state between +III, +IV, and +V. They can also form peroxo species, which are crucial for the activation of the first C-H bond.

Main group element metal oxides, such as those derived from niobium, tantalum, and cerium, have also shown promise in ODHP. These catalysts can alter their electronic properties, adjusting oxygen mobility to enhance selectivity. The inclusion of dopants or promoters, like niobium and tin, can improve performance by eliminating undesired reaction pathways or increasing the concentration of non-stoichiometric oxygen species.

The review also acknowledges the importance of addressing challenges, such as catalyst corrosion and the optimization of reaction conditions. Strategies for improving C-H bond activation aim to develop more selective and stable catalysts. Enhancing catalyst regenerability involves creating materials that can withstand multiple cycles without significant loss of activity or selectivity. Optimizing reaction systems focuses on tailoring the process parameters, including temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to achieve higher conversion and selectivity.

In summary, the review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in ODHP, highlighting the potential of various catalyst systems and outlining critical areas for future research to overcome existing challenges and advance the technology towards industrial implementation.

Future research should concentrate on developing more efficient and selective catalysts, improving catalyst stability and regenerability, and refining reaction systems to maximize the yield of desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This includes exploring novel catalyst architectures, modifying existing catalysts to enhance their performance, and investigating the underlying mechanisms that govern the reaction pathways and product selectivity. Addressing these challenges will be essential for realizing the full potential of ODHP as an alternative process for ethene production.
