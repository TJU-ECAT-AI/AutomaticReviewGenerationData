[1] "The catalytic properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy."
[2] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[3] "The results of the study of the acidity of the two different forms of silica gel indicate that the prevalence of weak acid sites was characteristic of KSKG, in contrast to Silica, where medium-strength acid sites were predominant."
[4] "It is likely that the acid hydroxyls of the support, which are weak acid sites, participate in the formation of the active surface to facilitate the dispersion of the active phase in the course of catalyst preparation."
[5] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[6] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[7] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[8] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[9] "In order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[10] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

1. The catalytic properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 were studied using various techniques, including TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
2. The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not thoroughly examined, as acid sites, particularly Lewis sites, are crucial for olefin adsorption, leading to polymerization and coke formation.
3. The silica gel forms of KSKG and Silica were found to have different acid site distributions, with KSKG predominantly featuring weak acid sites and Silica having more medium-strength acid sites.
4. The weak acid hydroxyls of the support contribute to the active surface formation, facilitating the dispersion of the active phase during catalyst preparation.
5. The supports' acid hydroxyls play a significant role in creating a dispersed active surface for the catalysts.
6. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation.
7. In chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to CO2-induced coke and hydrogen oxidation outweighs any negative effects.
8. CO2 complicates propylene formation and decreases its yield in gallium systems.
9. To enhance catalyst specificity and longevity, it is essential to not only disperse the active phase but also firmly adhere it to the silicate support surface, a challenge in current deposition methods.
10. CO2 functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation.
