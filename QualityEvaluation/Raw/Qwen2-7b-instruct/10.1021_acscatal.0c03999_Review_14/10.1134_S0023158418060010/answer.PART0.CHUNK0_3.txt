[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined."
[2] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[3] "It was found that the appearance and growth of catalytic activity with temperature was accompanied by the formation of the reduced forms of gallium oxide, the fraction of which was limited under the conditions of dehydrogenation (600C)."
[4] "This negative effect was more pronounced for the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield."
[5] "The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the comparison of various catalyst systems, such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of their selectivity and conversion. Different catalysts show varying performances. The study found that the insufficient dispersity of the active phase in GaOx/SiO2 catalysts leads to a low specific activity. At higher temperatures, the reduced forms of gallium oxide are formed, which affects the yield of propylene negatively. In contrast, the use of low-acidity silicate supports can decrease coke formation and increase the effective operation times of both Cr- and Ga-containing systems. The key challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and managing the inherent reaction properties. Future research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve better ODHP processes.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最近进展中，比较了各种催化剂系统，如过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，在选择性和转化率方面的性能。不同的催化剂表现出不同的表现。研究表明，GaOx/SiO2催化剂中活性相分布不足导致特定活性低。在高温下，形成减少的镓氧化物形式，这会负向影响丙烯产量。相反，使用低酸性硅酸盐支持可以减少焦炭形成并增加Cr-和Ga含系统的有效运行时间。该领域的关键挑战包括耐腐蚀性和管理固有反应特性。未来的研究集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以实现更好的ODHP过程。
