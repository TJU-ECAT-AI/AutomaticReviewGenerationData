The literature discusses the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems. The study focuses on chromium oxide (CrOx) and gallium oxide (GaOx) supported on silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The properties of these catalysts are evaluated through stationary and nonstationary techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy. The silica gels used have low acidity, which prevents intense coke deposition and positively affects the stability of the catalyst operation. Acid hydroxyls on the supports play a crucial role in forming a disperse active surface. However, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase in GaOx/SiO2 systems results in low specific activity. Chromium systems show improved stability and yield of propylene upon CO2 introduction, which overcomes negative effects. CO2 acts as an additive to avoid deep oxidation reactions and efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas. Despite numerous studies, questions regarding catalyst and carrier properties, as well as reaction mechanisms, remain open. The findings suggest that using low-acidity silicate supports can decrease coke formation and increase the operational times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems in dehydrogenation processes.

文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，比较了各种催化剂系统的性能。研究重点是铬氧化物（CrOx）和镓氧化物（GaOx）支持在硅胶上的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。通过静态和非静态技术、TPR-H2、TPD-NH3和紫外光谱对这些催化剂的性质进行了评估。所使用的硅胶具有低酸性，可以防止严重的焦炭沉积并积极影响催化剂操作的稳定性。支持物上的酸羟基在形成分散活性表面中起着关键作用。然而，GaOx/SiO2系统中活性相的不足分散性导致特定活动较低。铬系统在CO2引入后显示出提高的丙烯产量和稳定性，这克服了负面影响。CO2作为添加剂的作用避免了引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且有可能高效利用这种温室气体。尽管进行了大量研究，但有关催化剂和载体性质以及反应机制的问题仍然存在。研究结果表明，使用低酸性硅酸盐支持物可以减少焦炭形成并增加Cr-和Ga含系统在脱氢过程中的操作时间。

The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane resulted in reduced coke formation and extended operational effectiveness for chromium (Cr)- and gallium (Ga)-containing systems. The silicate supports' acid hydroxyls contribute to the formation of a dispersed active surface. However, to enhance the catalyst's specific activity and stability, a dual approach is needed: dispersing the active phase particles and strongly fixing them on the silicate support's surface. This dual strategy is challenging to implement with conventional deposition methods. In Cr-containing systems, the introduction of CO2 led to an increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to coke and hydrogen oxidation. Conversely, in Ga systems, CO2 significantly hindered propylene formation, reducing its yield.

在制备脱氢反应催化剂时，使用低酸性硅酸盐载体减少了焦炭生成并延长了Cr-和Ga-含系统的工作时间。这些硅酸盐载体上的酸羟基促进了活性表面的分散形成。然而，为了提高催化剂的特定活性和稳定性，需要同时实现活性相颗粒的分散和在硅酸盐支持物表面的强固定。这种双策略在常规沉积方法中实施起来颇具挑战性。对于Cr系统，引入CO2导致丙烯产率增加和操作稳定性提升，这是由于焦炭和氢的氧化作用。而对Ga系统而言，CO2显著阻碍了丙烯的形成，降低了其产率。

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the comparative performance of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The GaOx/SiO2 catalysts display low specific activity due to insufficient dispersity of the active phase. Conversely, chromium systems show an increase in propylene yield and stability upon CO2 introduction, outweighing negative effects. The literature underscores the importance of acid sites, particularly Lewis sites, in promoting olefin adsorption, polymerization, and coke deposition. Gallium catalysts face challenges with CO2's role in complicating propylene formation, leading to yield decreases. Chromium systems, on the other hand, benefit from CO2's ability to oxidize coke and hydrogen, enhancing propylene production and operational stability. Persistent challenges include corrosiveness and intrinsic reaction properties that affect catalyst longevity and efficiency.

Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Efforts to achieve better dispersion and strong fixation of active phases on silicate supports, while mitigating the negative impacts of acid sites, are crucial for advancing catalyst performance. Addressing corrosiveness and refining reaction mechanisms to better control coke formation are also essential for improving process efficiency and sustainability.

The recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants involve the comparison of various catalyst systems, such as transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of their selectivity and conversion. Different catalysts show varying performances. The study found that the insufficient dispersity of the active phase in GaOx/SiO2 catalysts leads to a low specific activity. At higher temperatures, the reduced forms of gallium oxide are formed, which affects the yield of propylene negatively. In contrast, the use of low-acidity silicate supports can decrease coke formation and increase the effective operation times of both Cr- and Ga-containing systems. The key challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and managing the inherent reaction properties. Future research focuses on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to achieve better ODHP processes.
