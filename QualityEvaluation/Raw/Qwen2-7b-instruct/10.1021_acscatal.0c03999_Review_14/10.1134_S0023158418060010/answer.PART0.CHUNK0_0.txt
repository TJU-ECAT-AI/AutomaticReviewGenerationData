[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy."

[4] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."

The literature discusses the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems. The study focuses on chromium oxide (CrOx) and gallium oxide (GaOx) supported on silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The properties of these catalysts are evaluated through stationary and nonstationary techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy. The silica gels used have low acidity, which prevents intense coke deposition and positively affects the stability of the catalyst operation. Acid hydroxyls on the supports play a crucial role in forming a disperse active surface. However, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase in GaOx/SiO2 systems results in low specific activity. Chromium systems show improved stability and yield of propylene upon CO2 introduction, which overcomes negative effects. CO2 acts as an additive to avoid deep oxidation reactions and efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas. Despite numerous studies, questions regarding catalyst and carrier properties, as well as reaction mechanisms, remain open. The findings suggest that using low-acidity silicate supports can decrease coke formation and increase the operational times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems in dehydrogenation processes.

文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，比较了各种催化剂系统的性能。研究重点是铬氧化物（CrOx）和镓氧化物（GaOx）支持在硅胶上的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。通过静态和非静态技术、TPR-H2、TPD-NH3和紫外光谱对这些催化剂的性质进行了评估。所使用的硅胶具有低酸性，可以防止严重的焦炭沉积并积极影响催化剂操作的稳定性。支持物上的酸羟基在形成分散活性表面中起着关键作用。然而，GaOx/SiO2系统中活性相的不足分散性导致特定活动较低。铬系统在CO2引入后显示出提高的丙烯产量和稳定性，这克服了负面影响。CO2作为添加剂的作用避免了引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且有可能高效利用这种温室气体。尽管进行了大量研究，但有关催化剂和载体性质以及反应机制的问题仍然存在。研究结果表明，使用低酸性硅酸盐支持物可以减少焦炭形成并增加Cr-和Ga含系统在脱氢过程中的操作时间。
