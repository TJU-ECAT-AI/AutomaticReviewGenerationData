[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined."
[2] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[3] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[4] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[5] "In the case of the gallium catalysts, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[6] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature highlights the comparative performance of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. The GaOx/SiO2 catalysts display low specific activity due to insufficient dispersity of the active phase. Conversely, chromium systems show an increase in propylene yield and stability upon CO2 introduction, outweighing negative effects. The literature underscores the importance of acid sites, particularly Lewis sites, in promoting olefin adsorption, polymerization, and coke deposition. Gallium catalysts face challenges with CO2's role in complicating propylene formation, leading to yield decreases. Chromium systems, on the other hand, benefit from CO2's ability to oxidize coke and hydrogen, enhancing propylene production and operational stability. Persistent challenges include corrosiveness and intrinsic reaction properties that affect catalyst longevity and efficiency.

Key areas for future research and development include strategies to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and refine reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. Efforts to achieve better dispersion and strong fixation of active phases on silicate supports, while mitigating the negative impacts of acid sites, are crucial for advancing catalyst performance. Addressing corrosiveness and refining reaction mechanisms to better control coke formation are also essential for improving process efficiency and sustainability.

分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，文献强调了过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的比较性能。GaOx/SiO2催化剂由于活性相分散性不足，表现出较低的特定活性。相比之下，铬系统在CO2引入后，丙烯产量和稳定性增加，抵消了负面效应。文献强调了酸位点，特别是路易斯位点，在促进烯烃吸附、聚合和焦炭沉积中的重要性。镓催化剂面临CO2在复杂丙烯形成过程中的挑战，导致产量下降。另一方面，铬系统得益于CO2对焦炭和氢的氧化能力，提高了丙烯产量和操作稳定性。持续的挑战包括腐蚀性和固有反应特性，这些影响催化剂寿命和效率。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括提高C-H键活化策略、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统以优化ODHP流程。努力实现活性相在硅酸盐支持物上的更好分散和牢固固定，同时减少酸位点的影响，对于提高催化剂性能至关重要。解决腐蚀性和改进反应机制以更好地控制焦炭形成也是提高过程效率和可持续性的关键。
