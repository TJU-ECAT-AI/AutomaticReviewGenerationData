[4] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."

The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane resulted in reduced coke formation and extended operational effectiveness for chromium (Cr)- and gallium (Ga)-containing systems. The silicate supports' acid hydroxyls contribute to the formation of a dispersed active surface. However, to enhance the catalyst's specific activity and stability, a dual approach is needed: dispersing the active phase particles and strongly fixing them on the silicate support's surface. This dual strategy is challenging to implement with conventional deposition methods. In Cr-containing systems, the introduction of CO2 led to an increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to coke and hydrogen oxidation. Conversely, in Ga systems, CO2 significantly hindered propylene formation, reducing its yield.

在制备脱氢反应催化剂时，使用低酸性硅酸盐载体减少了焦炭生成并延长了Cr-和Ga-含系统的工作时间。这些硅酸盐载体上的酸羟基促进了活性表面的分散形成。然而，为了提高催化剂的特定活性和稳定性，需要同时实现活性相颗粒的分散和在硅酸盐支持物表面的强固定。这种双策略在常规沉积方法中实施起来颇具挑战性。对于Cr系统，引入CO2导致丙烯产率增加和操作稳定性提升，这是由于焦炭和氢的氧化作用。而对Ga系统而言，CO2显著阻碍了丙烯的形成，降低了其产率。
