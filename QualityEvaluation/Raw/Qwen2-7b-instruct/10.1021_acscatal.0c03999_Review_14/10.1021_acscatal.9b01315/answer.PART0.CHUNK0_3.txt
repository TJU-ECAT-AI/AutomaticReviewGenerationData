[1] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%) FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%) TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[2] "In particular, CrPO, whose performance, crystal structure, and morphology are demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, enables to reach propylene yields up to 50%, rivalling the best systems among any existing propane-to-propylene technology."
[3] "The performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."
[4] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[5] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, exhibit differing performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. The oxychlorination activity of these catalysts follows a descending order, with copper phosphate (CuPO) being the most active, followed by vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO). Meanwhile, the selectivity to propylene is highest in chromium phosphate (CrPO) and iron phosphate (FePO), followed by manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), titanium phosphate (TiPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), copper phosphate (CuPO), and vanadium phosphate (VPO) at 5-20% propane conversion.

Crucial to this performance is the catalyst's ability to evolve chlorine from its surface. High selectivity towards propylene results from rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibition of molecular chlorine generation in the gas phase and a low propensity for propane cracking and combustion. 

Manganese phosphate (MnPO), despite having low chlorine evolution performance and comparable combustion tendency to chromium phosphate (CrPO), suffers from high propane cracking propensity and moderate C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination capabilities, limiting its propylene selectivity. Conversely, copper phosphate (CuPO) and vanadium phosphate (VPO) attain low C3H6 selectivity due to their hindered dehydrochlorination abilities and high Cl2 generation tendencies, leading to coke formation and a strong combustion propensity.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的表现存在差异。这些催化剂的氧化氯化活性按照递减顺序排列，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）最为活跃，随后是钒磷酸盐（VPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铬磷酸盐（CrPO）、铁磷酸盐（FePO）、锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）和钛磷酸盐（TiPO）。同时，丙烯选择性最高的是铬磷酸盐（CrPO）和铁磷酸盐（FePO），随后是锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）、钛磷酸盐（TiPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO），在5-20%丙烷转化率下。

关键在于催化剂表面释放氯的能力。高丙烯选择性源自快速脱氯化动力学结合抑制气相中分子氯生成以及对丙烷裂解和燃烧的低倾向性。

尽管锰磷酸盐（MnPO）具有较低的氯演化性能和与铬磷酸盐（CrPO）相当的燃烧倾向，但由于其高丙烷裂解倾向和适度的C3H7Cl脱氯化能力，限制了其丙烯选择性。相反，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO）由于其脱氯化能力受限和高Cl2生成倾向而获得低C3H6选择性，导致焦炭形成和强烈的燃烧倾向。
