[1] "An intense research effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively."
[2] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
[3] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides."
[4] "CrPO is found as the most selective system, reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
[5] "The high stability of CrPO was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[6] "Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature presents the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The study highlights the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, such as iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), achieving propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% respectively, at high selectivity. Despite these promising outcomes, the field still seeks new catalysts for propane oxychlorination, which holds great potential for further discoveries. Metal phosphates, with their unique properties derived from encapsulating metal oxide clusters within a phosphate matrix, are identified as effective alternatives. Specifically, chromium phosphate (CrPO) emerges as the most selective catalyst, capable of producing propylene yields rivaling those of the best catalysts reported, with its stability confirmed through extensive characterization methods. The study also elucidates that the phosphates' reactivity in ODHP is contingent upon their ability to evolve chlorine from the surface, leading to high selectivity towards propylene when combined with swift dehydrochlorination kinetics, hindered gas-phase chlorine generation, and reduced propane cracking and combustion tendencies.

Challenges persist in the field of ODHP, including the corrosiveness of the process and its inherent reaction properties. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. These advancements aim to address the existing challenges and push the boundaries of propane conversion technologies.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，文献对各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能进行了分析。研究强调了过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物的应用，如铁磷酸盐（FePO4）、铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）和镍氧化铈（NiO-CeO2），分别达到了15%、40%和55%的丙烯产率，且具有高选择性。尽管取得了这些有前景的结果，但该领域仍然寻求新的催化剂用于丙烷氧氯化，这为新发现提供了巨大的潜力。金属磷化物因其独特的性质而受到关注，这些性质来自于将金属氧化物簇封装在磷酸盐晶体单元中，从而改变了与块状金属氧化物相比的MO键长度，进而影响了电子性质。具体来说，铬磷酸盐（CrPO）被确定为最选择性的催化剂，其产生的丙烯产率与目前报道的最佳催化剂相匹敌，并通过广泛的表征方法证实了其稳定性。研究还揭示了磷化物在ODHP中的活性取决于其表面释放氯的能力，这导致了丙烯选择性，当结合快速脱氯化氢动力学、抑制气体相氯生成的能力以及减少丙烷裂解和燃烧倾向时，这一结果尤为重要。

ODHP领域面临的挑战包括过程的腐蚀性和固有的反应特性。未来研究和发展的重要领域包括增强C-H键活化策略、提高催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化ODHP过程的效率。这些进展旨在解决现有挑战并推动丙烷转换技术的边界。
