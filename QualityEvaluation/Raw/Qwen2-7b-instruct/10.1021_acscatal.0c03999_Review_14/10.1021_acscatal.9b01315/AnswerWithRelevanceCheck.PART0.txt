          [1] "An intense research effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively."
          [2] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
          [3] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides."
          [4] "CrPO is found as the most selective system, reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
          [5] "The high stability of CrPO was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
          [6] "Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

          A comprehensive research effort has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, with notable examples being iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2). These catalysts have achieved propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% respectively, with high selectivity ranging from 80% to 98%. However, the scarcity of disclosed systems for propane oxychlorination indicates vast potential for new discoveries. Metal phosphates are deemed a feasible solution because they encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, altering the bond lengths and electronic properties compared to bulk metal oxides. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) stands out as the most selective system, capable of yielding propylene with efficiency rivaling that of the best catalysts reported. Its remarkable stability was substantiated through extensive characterization methods, revealing no changes in structure and morphology post-long-term operation. The phosphates' reactivity is determined by their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while high propylene selectivity is a result of swift dehydrochlorination kinetics, coupled with an inhibited capability to produce molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced tendency towards propane cracking and combustion.

          在开发高效丙烷氧氯化催化剂方面，已经投入了大量的研究努力，其中包含铁磷酸盐（FePO4）、铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）和镍氧化铈（NiO-CeO2）等典型例子。这些催化剂分别实现了15%、40%和55%的丙烯产率，且具有80%至98%的高选择性。然而，当前披露的丙烷氧氯化催化剂系统数量有限，预示着巨大的新发现潜力。金属磷化物被视为可行的解决方案，因为它们将金属氧化物簇（MOx）封装在一个磷酸盐矩阵内，从而改变了与块状金属氧化物相比的键长和电子性质。铬磷酸盐（CrPO）以其极高的选择性脱颖而出，其丙烯产率与迄今为止报告的最佳催化剂相匹敌。其显著的稳定性通过深入的表征方法得到验证，结果显示经过长期运行后，结构和形态未发生变化。磷化物的活性取决于其从表面释放氯的能力，而高度的丙烯选择性则是快速脱氯化动力学、结合在气体相中生成分子氯的能力受限，以及丙烷裂解和燃烧倾向降低的综合结果。

          [1] "We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal."

          [3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."
          [4] "CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date."

          A thorough evaluation of transition metal phosphates (MPO, where M represents Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination has been conducted, highlighting significant variations in reactivity and product distribution dependent on the metal involved. The activity of the catalysts followed the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, with the selectivity for propylene ranking as CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion rate of 5-20%. Four distinct categories of catalysts have been discerned based on the preferred end product: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO). Among these, CrPO, demonstrating stability over 60 hours of continuous operation, was identified as the most selective system for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts reported so far. This stability was confirmed through detailed characterization employing X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which revealed no changes in structure and morphology after extended operation. The phosphates' reactivity is contingent on their ability to release chlorine from the surface, while a high propylene selectivity is the result of rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibited generation of molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a reduced likelihood of propane cracking and combustion.

          对于过渡金属磷酸盐（MPO，M代表Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Cu）作为丙烷氧氯化催化剂的全面评估揭示了反应活性和产物分布之间的显著差异，这些差异依赖于所涉及的金属。催化剂的活性按照以下顺序排列：CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO，在5-20%丙烷转化率下，丙烯选择性排名为CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%)。根据所偏好生成的最终产品，已识别出四种不同的催化剂类别：丙烯（CrPO）、裂解产物（MnPO、NiPO、TiPO、CoPO）、氯化烃（CuPO）或二氧化碳（VPO）。其中，CrPO在连续运行超过60小时的情况下表现出稳定性，被确认为最具选择性的丙烷氧氯化（POC）催化剂系统，能够达到高达50%的丙烯产率，与迄今为止报告的顶级催化剂相抗衡。这种稳定性通过采用X射线衍射、拉曼和X射线光电子能谱，以及扫描和高分辨率透射电子显微镜的详细表征得到证实，在长时间运行后结构和形态没有变化。磷化物的活性取决于其从表面释放氯的能力，而高度的丙烯选择性则归因于快速脱氯化动力学与抑制气体相中分子氯生成能力的结合，以及对丙烷裂解和燃烧倾向的减少。

          The performance of the catalysts in propane oxychlorination decreases in the sequence: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, with the selectivity towards propylene ranking as CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion level of 5-20%. To ensure accurate evaluation, the materials were stabilized for more than 5 hours under the reaction conditions to minimize any potential impact from catalyst restructuring. The selectivity profiles across the catalysts were analyzed at approximately 20% propane conversion. It was observed that the high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) remains stable across a wide temperature range (673-773 K) and varying alkane feed concentration (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl content (1.5-15 vol.). Furthermore, the catalyst's performance was tested over an extended period under moderate propane conversion, demonstrating its stable catalytic activity for over 60 hours in propane oxychlorination (POC). Notably, despite MnPO exhibited the lowest chlorine evolution efficiency and combustion tendency similar to CrPO, its high propensity for propane cracking and moderate C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination capability constrained the C3H6 selectivity in the POC process.

          在5-20%丙烷转化率下，丙烷氧氯化催化剂的性能按照以下顺序递减：CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO，丙烯选择性排名为CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%)。为了确保准确评估，材料在反应条件下稳定了超过5小时，以最小化催化剂重构可能带来的任何潜在影响。在约20%丙烷转化率下，对催化剂的选择性进行了分析。观察到，高于90%的C3H6选择性在整个温度范围（673-773 K）和不同烷烃进料浓度（1.5-6 vol.％）及HCl含量（1.5-15 vol.％）下保持稳定。此外，催化剂在适度丙烷转化率下的长期测试显示，其在丙烷氧氯化（POC）过程中的催化行为稳定超过60小时。值得注意的是，尽管MnPO的氯演化效率最低，且其燃烧倾向与CrPO相似，但由于其高丙烷裂解倾向和中等C3H7Cl脱氯化能力，限制了POC过程中的C3H6选择性。

          [3] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

          High C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be maintained over a wide range of temperatures (673-773 K) and alkane feed concentration (1.5-6 vol.%) along with HCl content (1.5-15 vol.). Despite MnPO displayed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency akin to CrPO, its high propensity for propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties constrained C3H6 selectivity in propane oxychlorination (POC). Lastly, the low C3H6 selectivity observed during POC over CuPO and VPO can be attributed to their similar hindrance in dehydrochlorination processes and their respective high Cl2 generation tendency, which explains the formation of coke and their strong inclination towards combustion.

          高C3H6选择性（> 90％）可以在较宽的温度范围（673-773 K）和烷烃进料浓度（1.5-6 vol.％）以及HCl含量（1.5-15 vol.％）下维持。尽管MnPO的氯演化效率最低，且其燃烧倾向类似于CrPO，但由于其高丙烷裂解倾向和中等C3H7Cl脱氯化能力，限制了丙烷氧氯化（POC）过程中的C3H6选择性。最后，CuPO和VPO在POC过程中观测到的低C3H6选择性可以归因于它们在脱氯化过程中的类似阻碍作用及其各自的高Cl2生成倾向，这解释了焦炭的形成以及它们强烈的燃烧倾向。
