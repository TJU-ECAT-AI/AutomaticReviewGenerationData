[1] "We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal."
[2] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."
[4] "CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date."
[5] "Its high stability was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alternations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[6] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, we find that phosphates of transition metals perform differently based on the metal involved. The activity of these catalysts varies in the following order: CuPO > VPO > CoPO > CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene is ranked as follows: CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion rate of 5-20%. Four categories of catalysts are distinguished based on the primary product they generate: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO).

CrPO stands out as the most selective catalyst for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts in the field. This stability is confirmed through extensive characterization methods, which show no changes in structure or morphology after a 60-hour operation period. The catalyst's selectivity is attributed to its ability to rapidly dechlorinate propyl chloride while inhibiting molecular chlorine generation and propane cracking, combined with a reduced propensity for combustion.

Future research directions in this area focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regeneration capabilities, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency. Key challenges include dealing with corrosiveness and the inherent properties of the reactions.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展分析中，我们发现过渡金属的磷酸盐催化剂根据所涉及的金属表现不同。这些催化剂的活性按照以下顺序变化：CuPO > VPO > CoPO > CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO，而选择性按如下顺序排名：CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) 在丙烷转化率为5-20%时。根据生成的主要产物，区分出四种催化剂类别：丙烯（CrPO），裂解产物（MnPO，NiPO，TiPO，CoPO），氯化烃（CuPO），或二氧化碳（VPO）。

CrPO 被认定为 POC 最具选择性的催化剂，能够达到高达 50% 的丙烯产率，与当前顶级催化剂相匹敌。这种稳定性通过广泛的表征方法得到证实，这些方法显示在长时间运行后结构和形态没有改变。催化剂的选择性归因于其快速脱氯化丙基氯的能力，同时抑制了气体中分子氯的产生，并减少了丙烷裂解和燃烧的倾向。

未来研究的方向集中在增强 C-H 键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及优化反应系统以最大化 ODHP 效率。主要挑战包括应对腐蚀性和反应的内在性质。

关键的研究领域包括改善催化剂的活性，开发可再生的催化剂体系，以及通过调整反应条件来优化 ODHP 过程。
