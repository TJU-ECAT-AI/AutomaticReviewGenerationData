[1] "An intense research effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient catalysts for propane oxychlorination, including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively."
[2] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
[3] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides."
[4] "CrPO is found as the most selective system, reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
[5] "The high stability of CrPO was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[6] "Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

Analyzing the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature presents the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion. The study highlights the use of transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, such as iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), achieving propylene yields of 15%, 40%, and 55% respectively, at high selectivity. Despite these promising outcomes, the field still seeks new catalysts for propane oxychlorination, which holds great potential for further discoveries. Metal phosphates, with their unique properties derived from encapsulating metal oxide clusters within a phosphate matrix, are identified as effective alternatives. Specifically, chromium phosphate (CrPO) emerges as the most selective catalyst, capable of producing propylene yields rivaling those of the best catalysts reported, with its stability confirmed through extensive characterization methods. The study also elucidates that the phosphates' reactivity in ODHP is contingent upon their ability to evolve chlorine from the surface, leading to high selectivity towards propylene when combined with swift dehydrochlorination kinetics, hindered gas-phase chlorine generation, and reduced propane cracking and combustion tendencies.

Challenges persist in the field of ODHP, including the corrosiveness of the process and its inherent reaction properties. Key areas for future research and development include strategies for enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize the efficiency of ODHP processes. These advancements aim to address the existing challenges and push the boundaries of propane conversion technologies.

[1] "We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal."
[2] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."
[4] "CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, we find that phosphates of transition metals perform differently based on the metal involved. The activity of these catalysts varies in the following order: CuPO > VPO > CoPO > CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene is ranked as follows: CrPO (95-98%) > FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) > NiPO (65-85%) > TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at a propane conversion rate of 5-20%. Four categories of catalysts are distinguished based on the primary product they generate: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO).

CrPO stands out as the most selective catalyst for propane oxychlorination (POC), achieving up to 50% propylene yield, which competes with the top-performing catalysts in the field. This stability is confirmed through extensive characterization methods, which show no changes in structure or morphology after a 60-hour operation period. The catalyst's selectivity is attributed to its ability to rapidly dechlorinate propyl chloride while inhibiting molecular chlorine generation and propane cracking, combined with a reduced propensity for combustion.

Future research directions in this area focus on enhancing C-H bond activation, improving catalyst regeneration capabilities, and optimizing reaction systems to maximize ODHP efficiency. Key challenges include dealing with corrosiveness and the inherent properties of the reactions.

[2] "The performance were evaluated over the materials that were equilibrated for over 5 h under the reaction environment in order to avoid any potential influence from catalyst restructuring."
[3] "The selectivity patterns obtained over the catalysts were compared at ca. 20% propane conversion."
[4] "The high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be preserved over a broad range of temperatures (673-773 K) and feed concentration of alkane (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl (1.5-15 vol.)."
[5] "Furthermore, this catalyst was assessed in a long-term test at moderate propane conversion, evidencing its stable catalytic behavior for over 60 h in POC."
[6] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[7] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

Analyzing recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) utilizing soft oxidants, various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, exhibit differing performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. The oxychlorination activity of these catalysts follows a descending order, with copper phosphate (CuPO) being the most active, followed by vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO). Meanwhile, the selectivity to propylene is highest in chromium phosphate (CrPO) and iron phosphate (FePO), followed by manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), titanium phosphate (TiPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), copper phosphate (CuPO), and vanadium phosphate (VPO) at 5-20% propane conversion.

Crucial to this performance is the catalyst's ability to evolve chlorine from its surface. High selectivity towards propylene results from rapid dehydrochlorination kinetics combined with the inhibition of molecular chlorine generation in the gas phase and a low propensity for propane cracking and combustion. 

Manganese phosphate (MnPO), despite having low chlorine evolution performance and comparable combustion tendency to chromium phosphate (CrPO), suffers from high propane cracking propensity and moderate C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination capabilities, limiting its propylene selectivity. Conversely, copper phosphate (CuPO) and vanadium phosphate (VPO) attain low C3H6 selectivity due to their hindered dehydrochlorination abilities and high Cl2 generation tendencies, leading to coke formation and a strong combustion propensity.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的表现存在差异。这些催化剂的氧化氯化活性按照递减顺序排列，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）最为活跃，随后是钒磷酸盐（VPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铬磷酸盐（CrPO）、铁磷酸盐（FePO）、锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）和钛磷酸盐（TiPO）。同时，丙烯选择性最高的是铬磷酸盐（CrPO）和铁磷酸盐（FePO），随后是锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）、钛磷酸盐（TiPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO），在5-20%丙烷转化率下。

关键在于催化剂表面释放氯的能力。高丙烯选择性源自快速脱氯化动力学结合抑制气相中分子氯生成以及对丙烷裂解和燃烧的低倾向性。

尽管锰磷酸盐（MnPO）具有较低的氯演化性能和与铬磷酸盐（CrPO）相当的燃烧倾向，但由于其高丙烷裂解倾向和适度的C3H7Cl脱氯化能力，限制了其丙烯选择性。相反，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO）由于其脱氯化能力受限和高Cl2生成倾向而获得低C3H6选择性，导致焦炭形成和强烈的燃烧倾向。
