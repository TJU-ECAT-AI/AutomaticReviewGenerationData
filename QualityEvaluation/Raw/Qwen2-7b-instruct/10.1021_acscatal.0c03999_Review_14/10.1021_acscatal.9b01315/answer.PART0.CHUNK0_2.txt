[1] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%) FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%) TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[2] "The performance were evaluated over the materials that were equilibrated for over 5 h under the reaction environment in order to avoid any potential influence from catalyst restructuring."
[3] "The selectivity patterns obtained over the catalysts were compared at ca. 20% propane conversion."
[4] "The high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be preserved over a broad range of temperatures (673-773 K) and feed concentration of alkane (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl (1.5-15 vol.)."
[5] "Furthermore, this catalyst was assessed in a long-term test at moderate propane conversion, evidencing its stable catalytic behavior for over 60 h in POC."
[6] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[7] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

The recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have been explored through the use of various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides, such as copper phosphate (CuPO), vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO), have shown differing performances in terms of selectivity and conversion. Chromium phosphate (CrPO) and iron phosphate (FePO) have demonstrated the highest selectivity towards propylene, reaching up to 95-98% selectivity. 

A significant challenge in this field includes the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and the inherent properties of the reaction itself. The persistent issues involve the activation of C-H bonds, enhancing the regenerability of catalysts, and optimizing the reaction systems. 

For future research and development, key areas include improving the activation of C-H bonds, developing catalysts that can regenerate after multiple uses, and refining the reaction systems to achieve better efficiency and selectivity. Strategies to address these challenges include the design of novel catalyst materials, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the integration of advanced analytical techniques to monitor and control the reaction dynamics in real-time.
