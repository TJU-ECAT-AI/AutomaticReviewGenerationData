[1] "In-depth characterization using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy enables to assess the structural and morphological stability of the phosphate samples."
[2] "The activity in this reaction was ranked in the order CuPO > VPO > CrPO > MnPO."
[3] "A recent mechanistic study over a FePO4(102) surface in EOC has shown that evolution of chlorine in the form of Cl2 requires considerably more energy compared to that of alkyl chloride."
[4] "Its high stability was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alternations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[5] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination."
