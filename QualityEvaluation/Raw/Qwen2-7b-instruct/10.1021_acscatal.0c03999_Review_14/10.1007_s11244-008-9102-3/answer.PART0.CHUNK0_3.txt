[1] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[2] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[3] "Catalysts having molten alkali metal chloride phases under reaction conditions show much higher olefin selectivities than solid chloride containing catalysts."
[4] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."
[5] "Three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts."
[6] "The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins."
[7] "The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."
[8] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. In terms of selectivity and conversion, the performance of these catalysts has been compared extensively. It has been found that catalysts containing molten alkali metal chlorides exhibit superior performance, showing much higher olefin selectivities than their solid counterparts. The selectivity to olefins increases with temperature, paralleling a decrease in the formation of COx. Three key factors contributing to this excellent selectivity are:

1. The low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts, which minimizes interactions with highly reactive products.
2. The high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with the olefins.
3. Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt.

These findings suggest that supported alkali metal chloride melts can serve as new catalysts for applications requiring minimized surface concentration of accessible metal cations. However, persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and understanding the inherent reaction properties of these systems. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to further advance ODHP processes.

近年来，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究取得了进展，重点是各种催化剂系统的应用，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。在选择性和转化率方面，对这些催化剂的性能进行了广泛比较。研究发现，含有熔融碱金属氯化物的催化剂表现出优于固体催化剂的性能，显示出更高的烯烃选择性。随着温度的升高，烯烃的选择性增加，同时COx的形成减少。三个关键因素贡献于这种优秀的烯烃选择性：

1. 支持催化剂中的Lewis酸位点的低可接近浓度，这减少了与高度反应性产物的相互作用。
2. 熔体中正离子和负离子的高流动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用。
3. 动态熔体内部和表面的氯酸氧化位点的空间隔离。

这些发现表明，支持的碱金属氯化物熔体可以作为需要降低表面可接近金属离子浓度的应用的新催化剂。然而，这一领域持续面临挑战包括耐腐蚀性以及理解这些系统的基本反应特性。未来的研究方向旨在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力并优化反应系统，以进一步推进ODHP过程的发展。
