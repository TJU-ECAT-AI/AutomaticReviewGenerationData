Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. The use of supported alkali metal chloride melts emerged as a novel group of catalysts, offering advantages in minimizing the surface concentration of accessible metal cations. These melts provide a dynamic surface, which reduces the saturation of cations and anions, thereby minimizing their interaction with highly reactive products. The selectivity to olefins was found to be highest for Li-K-MD, followed by Li-Na-MD, Li-MD, K-MD, and Na-MD, in that order. With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefins increased while the formation of COx decreased, indicating less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions. Future research and development in this field may focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，对各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的性能进行了比较，重点关注选择性和转化率。支持的碱金属氯化物熔体作为新的催化剂组出现，通过最小化可访问金属离子的表面浓度来实现优势。这些熔体提供了一个动态表面，可以减少阳离子和阴离子的饱和，从而减少它们与高度反应性产物的相互作用。选择性到烯烃的顺序是Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD，依此顺序。随着温度的升高，烯烃的选择性增加，而COx的形成减少，表明在这种条件下烯烃的再吸附减少。未来的研究和发展可能集中在提高C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。
