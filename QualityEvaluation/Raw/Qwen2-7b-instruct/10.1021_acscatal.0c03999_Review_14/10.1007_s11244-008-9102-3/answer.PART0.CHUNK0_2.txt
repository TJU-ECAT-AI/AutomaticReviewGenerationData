Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature showcases the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. The key findings are:

1. The highest activity in ODHP is observed with the Li-MD catalyst system at a rate of 5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K. This activity decreases significantly with the substitution of Li+ by higher alkali metal ions.

2. The selectivity to olefins across the catalyst systems follows the order: Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to olefins is achieved at temperatures above the melting point of the alkali metal chloride phase.

3. As the temperature increases, the selectivity to olefins improves, paralleling a reduction in COx formation. This suggests less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

4. The performance of the catalysts in ODHP is attributed to three key factors: 
   - Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, reducing interactions with highly reactive products.
   - High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, diminishing interactions with olefins.
   - Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites within the dynamic melt, enhancing selectivity.

Challenges persist in this field, such as the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and inherent reaction properties. Future research and development efforts should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

在软氧化剂的使用下，分析丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展，文献展示了各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的性能。主要发现如下：

1. 在853 K时，以5.7 lmol (g s)-1的最高活性，Li-MD催化剂系统的活动性被观察到。通过Li+替换为更高碱金属离子，催化活性显著降低。

2. 根据选择性排序，催化剂系统的顺序是：Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。在熔融碱金属氯化物相位以上温度时，获得最大选择性到烯烃。

3. 随着温度的升高，选择性增加到烯烃，同时COx形成减少。这表明在这些条件下，烯烃的再吸附程度较低。

4. 催化剂在ODHP中的性能归因于三个关键因素：
   - 低可用Lewis酸中心浓度，减少了与高度反应产物的相互作用。
   - 熔体中正离子和负离子的高流动性，降低了与烯烃的相互作用。
   - 动态熔体内的氯酸氧化位点的空间隔离，增强了选择性。

此领域面临的挑战包括反应条件的腐蚀性和固有反应特性。未来的研究和发展工作应集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统方面，以优化ODHP过程。
