Analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, was compared in terms of selectivity and conversion. The use of supported alkali metal chloride melts emerged as a novel group of catalysts, offering advantages in minimizing the surface concentration of accessible metal cations. These melts provide a dynamic surface, which reduces the saturation of cations and anions, thereby minimizing their interaction with highly reactive products. The selectivity to olefins was found to be highest for Li-K-MD, followed by Li-Na-MD, Li-MD, K-MD, and Na-MD, in that order. With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefins increased while the formation of COx decreased, indicating less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions. Future research and development in this field may focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

[1] "For oxidative dehydrogenation, the present systems relies on metal cations that do not change their oxidation state, but facilitate the redox cycle by allowing the formation of a sizable concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen."
[2] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[3] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[4] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel. This indicates less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions."
[5] "Three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above."
[6] "The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins."

1. The systems for oxidative dehydrogenation rely on metal cations that maintain their oxidation state but enable the formation of a substantial concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen, facilitating the redox cycle.

2. The ranking of the catalysts based on olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD, Li-Na-MD, Li-MD, K-MD, and Na-MD.

3. The highest selectivity for ethene (94%) is achieved during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene (70%) during propane oxidative dehydrogenation, occurring at the temperature where the alkali metal chloride phase melts, remaining constant afterward.

4. As temperature rises, olefin selectivity increases while COx formation decreases, suggesting less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

5. Three factors contribute to the superior olefin selectivity: the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, and the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites.

6. The second factor involves the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, which reduces interactions with olefins.

7. The third factor is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites within and on the dynamic melt.

Analyzing the recent advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, the literature showcases the performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, in terms of selectivity and conversion. The key findings are:

1. The highest activity in ODHP is observed with the Li-MD catalyst system at a rate of 5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K. This activity decreases significantly with the substitution of Li+ by higher alkali metal ions.

2. The selectivity to olefins across the catalyst systems follows the order: Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to olefins is achieved at temperatures above the melting point of the alkali metal chloride phase.

3. As the temperature increases, the selectivity to olefins improves, paralleling a reduction in COx formation. This suggests less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

4. The performance of the catalysts in ODHP is attributed to three key factors: 
   - Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, reducing interactions with highly reactive products.
   - High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, diminishing interactions with olefins.
   - Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites within the dynamic melt, enhancing selectivity.

Challenges persist in this field, such as the corrosiveness of the reaction conditions and inherent reaction properties. Future research and development efforts should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and refining reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

在软氧化剂的使用下，分析丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展，文献展示了各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）在选择性和转化率方面的性能。主要发现如下：

1. 在853 K时，以5.7 lmol (g s)-1的最高活性，Li-MD催化剂系统的活动性被观察到。通过Li+替换为更高碱金属离子，催化活性显著降低。

2. 根据选择性排序，催化剂系统的顺序是：Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。在熔融碱金属氯化物相位以上温度时，获得最大选择性到烯烃。

3. 随着温度的升高，选择性增加到烯烃，同时COx形成减少。这表明在这些条件下，烯烃的再吸附程度较低。

4. 催化剂在ODHP中的性能归因于三个关键因素：
   - 低可用Lewis酸中心浓度，减少了与高度反应产物的相互作用。
   - 熔体中正离子和负离子的高流动性，降低了与烯烃的相互作用。
   - 动态熔体内的氯酸氧化位点的空间隔离，增强了选择性。

此领域面临的挑战包括反应条件的腐蚀性和固有反应特性。未来的研究和发展工作应集中在改进C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统方面，以优化ODHP过程。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the use of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. In terms of selectivity and conversion, the performance of these catalysts has been compared extensively. It has been found that catalysts containing molten alkali metal chlorides exhibit superior performance, showing much higher olefin selectivities than their solid counterparts. The selectivity to olefins increases with temperature, paralleling a decrease in the formation of COx. Three key factors contributing to this excellent selectivity are:

1. The low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts, which minimizes interactions with highly reactive products.
2. The high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with the olefins.
3. Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt.

These findings suggest that supported alkali metal chloride melts can serve as new catalysts for applications requiring minimized surface concentration of accessible metal cations. However, persistent challenges in this field include corrosion resistance and understanding the inherent reaction properties of these systems. Future research directions aim to improve C-H bond activation, enhance catalyst regenerability, and optimize reaction systems to further advance ODHP processes.

近年来，使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的研究取得了进展，重点是各种催化剂系统的应用，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。在选择性和转化率方面，对这些催化剂的性能进行了广泛比较。研究发现，含有熔融碱金属氯化物的催化剂表现出优于固体催化剂的性能，显示出更高的烯烃选择性。随着温度的升高，烯烃的选择性增加，同时COx的形成减少。三个关键因素贡献于这种优秀的烯烃选择性：

1. 支持催化剂中的Lewis酸位点的低可接近浓度，这减少了与高度反应性产物的相互作用。
2. 熔体中正离子和负离子的高流动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用。
3. 动态熔体内部和表面的氯酸氧化位点的空间隔离。

这些发现表明，支持的碱金属氯化物熔体可以作为需要降低表面可接近金属离子浓度的应用的新催化剂。然而，这一领域持续面临挑战包括耐腐蚀性以及理解这些系统的基本反应特性。未来的研究方向旨在改进C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力并优化反应系统，以进一步推进ODHP过程的发展。
