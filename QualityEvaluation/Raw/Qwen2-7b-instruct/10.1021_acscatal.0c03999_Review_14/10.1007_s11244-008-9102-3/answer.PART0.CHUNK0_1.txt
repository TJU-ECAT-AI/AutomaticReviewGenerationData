[1] "For oxidative dehydrogenation, the present systems relies on metal cations that do not change their oxidation state, but facilitate the redox cycle by allowing the formation of a sizable concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[4] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel. This indicates less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions."
[5] "Three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above."
[6] "The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins."

1. The systems for oxidative dehydrogenation rely on metal cations that maintain their oxidation state but enable the formation of a substantial concentration of hypochlorite anions in the presence of oxygen, facilitating the redox cycle.

2. The ranking of the catalysts based on olefin selectivity is Li-K-MD, Li-Na-MD, Li-MD, K-MD, and Na-MD.

3. The highest selectivity for ethene (94%) is achieved during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene (70%) during propane oxidative dehydrogenation, occurring at the temperature where the alkali metal chloride phase melts, remaining constant afterward.

4. As temperature rises, olefin selectivity increases while COx formation decreases, suggesting less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions.

5. Three factors contribute to the superior olefin selectivity: the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, and the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites.

6. The second factor involves the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt, which reduces interactions with olefins.

7. The third factor is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites within and on the dynamic melt.

1. 氧化脱氢化系统依赖于保持氧化态不变但能够在氧存在下形成大量氯酸根离子的金属离子，以此来促进还原氧化循环。

2. 催化剂按照烯烃选择性排序为Li-K-MD、Li-Na-MD、Li-MD、K-MD和Na-MD。

3. 在熔点温度下，烷基氯化物相融化后保持恒定，实现了最高乙稀选择性（94%）用于乙烷氧化脱氢化和丙烯选择性（70%）用于丙烷氧化脱氢化。

4. 温度升高时，烯烃选择性增加，而COx生成减少，表明在这些条件下，对烯烃的再吸附不那么显著。

5. 三个因素有助于极高的烯烃选择性：可接近Lewis酸位点的低浓度，熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高流动性，以及动态熔体内部和表面的氯酸根氧化位点的空间隔离。

6. 第二个因素涉及到熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高流动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用。

7. 第三个因素是动态熔体内部和表面上的氯酸根氧化位点的空间隔离。
