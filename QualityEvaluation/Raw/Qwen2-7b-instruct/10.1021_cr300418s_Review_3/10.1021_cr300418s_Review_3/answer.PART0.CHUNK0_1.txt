[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[3] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

Coprecipitation is a method used to synthesize doped ceria catalysts. It involves dissolving the host cation, cerium (Ce), along with a dopant precursor in a solution. The dopant precursors vary depending on the dopant being used, such as nitrates for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr, chlorides for Nb, Ta, and oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 for Zr. After dissolving the components, the solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, forming a precipitate. This precipitate is then washed, dried, and calcined at high temperatures. Different preparation techniques, like using hydroxides instead of other forms, can influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the n-butane combustion rate and activation energy can vary between samples. A sample made from hydroxide had a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to 105 kJ/mol for another sample.

沉淀共混是一种合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法。它涉及溶解主体阳离子铈（Ce）与掺杂物前体在溶液中。掺杂物前体根据使用的掺杂物不同而变化，例如钆、钇、镧、钐、镱、镨使用硝酸盐，铌、钽使用氯化物，锆使用氧化氮酸盐ZrO(NO3)2。溶解成分后，蒸发溶剂以引起沉淀共混，形成沉淀物。然后对沉淀物进行洗涤、干燥和高温煅烧。不同的制备技术，如使用氢氧化物而非其他形式，可以影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，n-丁烷燃烧速率和活化能可以因样品而异。一个由氢氧化物制成的样品的n-丁烷燃烧速率比另一个样品高5%，有效活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品的有效活化能为105 kJ/mol。
