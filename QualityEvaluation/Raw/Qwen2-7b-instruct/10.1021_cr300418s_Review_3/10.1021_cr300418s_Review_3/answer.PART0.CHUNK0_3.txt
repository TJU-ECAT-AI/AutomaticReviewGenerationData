[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[3] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and the dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. The precipitate undergoes washing, drying, and calcination at high temperature. Different precursors are used for various dopants, such as nitrates for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr, chlorides for Nb, Ta, and oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 for Zr. Two Nb-doped ceria samples prepared through this method exhibit distinct n-butane combustion rates, with the hydroxide-based sample showing a 5% higher rate. Additionally, their effective activation energies differ, being 85 kJ/mol for the hydroxide sample and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

该沉淀化方法涉及通过将主离子盐和掺杂剂的溶液与同时沉淀两种离子的化学物质处理，来制备主离子和掺杂剂的沉淀物。沉淀物经过洗涤、干燥和在高温下煅烧。不同的前体用于不同类型的掺杂剂，如钆、钇、镧、钐、镱、镨等使用硝酸盐，铌、钽使用氯化物，而锆使用氧化氮盐ZrO(NO3)2。通过这种方法制得的两个铌掺杂的铈样品显示出不同的丁烷燃烧速率，其中基于氢氧化物的样品的速率高出5%。此外，它们的有效活化能也有所不同，分别为85 kJ/mol（基于氢氧化物的样品）和105 kJ/mol（其他样品）。

[1] "Bera et al. (104) synthesized 3 at. % Cu-doped ceria catalysts for NO reduction with NH3 or CO, using combustion synthesis from solutions of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, Cu(CO3)2, Cu(OH)2, and C2H6N4O2 (oxalyldihydrazide, as the fuel)."
[2] "The materials made by Raos team were characterized by XRD, EPR, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and, in contrast to the materials made using oxalyldihydrazide as the fuel, showed finely dispersed Cu2+ species on the surface at low copper content, but Cu2+ in the form of dimers and clusters at large Cu concentrations."

Bera et al. synthesized 3 atomic % copper-doped ceria catalysts for NO reduction with NH3 or CO, employing combustion synthesis from solutions containing (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, Cu(CO3)2, Cu(OH)2, and C2H6N4O2 (oxalyldihydrazide as the fuel). The materials produced by Rao's team were analyzed via XRD, EPR, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). These materials displayed finely dispersed Cu2+ species on the surface at low copper content, whereas at higher concentrations, Cu2+ was found in the form of dimers and clusters.
