[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[3] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Coprecipitation is a method used to synthesize doped ceria catalysts, involving the simultaneous precipitation of host cations and dopants from a solution. The choice of precursor depends on the dopant being used. For example, gadolinium, yttrium, lanthanum, samarium, ytterbium, and praseodymium dopants are used with nitrates, while niobium and tantalum dopants are used with chlorides. In the case of zirconium doping, an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 is utilized. Two different Nb-doped ceria samples were prepared using this method, showing differences in their n-butane combustion rates and effective activation energies. The sample made from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, whereas the other sample had an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.

共沉淀法是一种用于合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法，涉及从溶液中同时沉淀主阳离子和掺杂剂。所用的前体取决于掺杂剂的种类。例如，钆、钇、镧、钐、镱和镨掺杂剂使用硝酸盐，而铌和钽掺杂剂使用氯化物。对于锆掺杂，使用的是氧化氮锆酸盐ZrO(NO3)2。通过这种方法制备了两种不同的铌掺杂的铈样品，显示出它们在丁烷燃烧速率和有效活化能方面的差异。从水合物制备的样品燃烧速率高出5%，活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品的活化能为105 kJ/mol。

Coprecipitation is a method used to synthesize doped ceria catalysts. It involves dissolving the host cation, cerium (Ce), along with a dopant precursor in a solution. The dopant precursors vary depending on the dopant being used, such as nitrates for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr, chlorides for Nb, Ta, and oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 for Zr. After dissolving the components, the solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, forming a precipitate. This precipitate is then washed, dried, and calcined at high temperatures. Different preparation techniques, like using hydroxides instead of other forms, can influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the n-butane combustion rate and activation energy can vary between samples. A sample made from hydroxide had a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to 105 kJ/mol for another sample.

沉淀共混是一种合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法。它涉及溶解主体阳离子铈（Ce）与掺杂物前体在溶液中。掺杂物前体根据使用的掺杂物不同而变化，例如钆、钇、镧、钐、镱、镨使用硝酸盐，铌、钽使用氯化物，锆使用氧化氮酸盐ZrO(NO3)2。溶解成分后，蒸发溶剂以引起沉淀共混，形成沉淀物。然后对沉淀物进行洗涤、干燥和高温煅烧。不同的制备技术，如使用氢氧化物而非其他形式，可以影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，n-丁烷燃烧速率和活化能可以因样品而异。一个由氢氧化物制成的样品的n-丁烷燃烧速率比另一个样品高5%，有效活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品的有效活化能为105 kJ/mol。

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. The precipitate undergoes washing, drying, and calcination at high temperature. Zhao and Gorte utilized this technique to create numerous doped ceria catalysts, employing it for n-butane combustion. In their study, two distinct Nb-doped ceria samples were produced through coprecipitation, differing in their n-butane combustion rates. The sample derived from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate compared to the other sample. Moreover, the effective activation energies for the two samples were notably different, measured at 85 kJ/mol for the hydroxide-based sample and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. Different salts of the dopant are used depending on its nature (nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr; chloride for Nb, Ta; oxynitrate for Zr). This method leads to the formation of doped ceria catalysts, such as Nb-doped ceria, which can exhibit different n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. For instance, one Nb-doped ceria sample prepared from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to another sample with an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.
