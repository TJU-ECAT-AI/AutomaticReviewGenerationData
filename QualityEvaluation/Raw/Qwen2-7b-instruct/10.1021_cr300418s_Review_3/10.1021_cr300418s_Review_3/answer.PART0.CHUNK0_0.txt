[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[3] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

Coprecipitation is a method used to synthesize doped ceria catalysts, involving the simultaneous precipitation of host cations and dopants from a solution. The choice of precursor depends on the dopant being used. For example, gadolinium, yttrium, lanthanum, samarium, ytterbium, and praseodymium dopants are used with nitrates, while niobium and tantalum dopants are used with chlorides. In the case of zirconium doping, an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 is utilized. Two different Nb-doped ceria samples were prepared using this method, showing differences in their n-butane combustion rates and effective activation energies. The sample made from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, whereas the other sample had an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.

共沉淀法是一种用于合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法，涉及从溶液中同时沉淀主阳离子和掺杂剂。所用的前体取决于掺杂剂的种类。例如，钆、钇、镧、钐、镱和镨掺杂剂使用硝酸盐，而铌和钽掺杂剂使用氯化物。对于锆掺杂，使用的是氧化氮锆酸盐ZrO(NO3)2。通过这种方法制备了两种不同的铌掺杂的铈样品，显示出它们在丁烷燃烧速率和有效活化能方面的差异。从水合物制备的样品燃烧速率高出5%，活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品的活化能为105 kJ/mol。
