The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. The precipitate undergoes washing, drying, and calcination at high temperature. Zhao and Gorte utilized this technique to create numerous doped ceria catalysts, employing it for n-butane combustion. In their study, two distinct Nb-doped ceria samples were produced through coprecipitation, differing in their n-butane combustion rates. The sample derived from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate compared to the other sample. Moreover, the effective activation energies for the two samples were notably different, measured at 85 kJ/mol for the hydroxide-based sample and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.
