[1] "An interesting example of this method is provided by the work of Zhao and Gorte. (96) They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion."
[2] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[3] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[4] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. Different salts of the dopant are used depending on its nature (nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr; chloride for Nb, Ta; oxynitrate for Zr). This method leads to the formation of doped ceria catalysts, such as Nb-doped ceria, which can exhibit different n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. For instance, one Nb-doped ceria sample prepared from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to another sample with an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法是通过将宿主阳离子和掺杂物的盐溶液与一种同时沉淀两种阳离子的化学物质处理。根据掺杂物的性质，使用不同的掺杂物盐（例如，钆、钇、镧、钐、镱、镨为硝酸盐；铌、钽为氯化物；锆为氧氮酸盐）。这种方法可以产生掺杂氧化铈催化剂，如铌掺杂氧化铈，表现出不同的异丁烷燃烧速率和活化能。例如，从氢氧化物制备的一种铌掺杂氧化铈样品的燃烧速率比另一种样品高5%，其有效活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一种样品的活化能为105 kJ/mol。
