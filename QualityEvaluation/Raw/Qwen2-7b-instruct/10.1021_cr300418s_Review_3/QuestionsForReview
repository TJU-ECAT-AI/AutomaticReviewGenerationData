Explain the coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, including the process variations and types of dopants used, and analyze how different preparation techniques affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts, using the example of Nb-doped ceria to illustrate the impact on n-butane combustion rates and activation energies.
