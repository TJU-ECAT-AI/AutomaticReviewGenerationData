[1] "Generally speaking, nonisovalent substitutional doping helps to enhance the electronic conductivity of α-Fe2O3."
[2] "Results indicate that the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) for 0.45 at-% Al substitution increases by 2- to 3-fold over undoped samples."
[3] "The lattice parameters were obtained using the Scherrer equation on the near basal (104) reflection."
[4] "The UVvis spectra of the samples are shown in Figure 2(b) and show minimal differences in the absorbance of the undoped and Al doped films."
[5] "The observed increase in conductivity from group III dopants in Fe2O3 can be explained due to the strain introduced in the lattice due to the small size difference of the dopant."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing cerium nitrate, water, and the dopant salt in an aqueous solution. The mixture is then heated to a specific temperature, typically above 90°C, causing the cerium and dopant ions to precipitate as a ceria-cerium oxide solid. The type of dopant used can vary widely, including metals like niobium (Nb), yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), and others. Different preparation techniques, such as varying the concentration of the dopant salt or altering the pH of the solution, can affect the crystallinity, surface area, and pore size of the resulting catalyst, thereby impacting its structural properties and catalytic performance. In the context of Nb-doped ceria, the introduction of Nb ions into the ceria lattice can lead to an increase in the activation energy and n-butane combustion rates due to the creation of localized defects and changes in the electronic structure, which facilitate more efficient oxygen storage and release, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法涉及将铈硝酸盐、水和掺杂物盐混合在水中。然后将混合物加热到特定温度，通常高于90°C，导致铈和掺杂物离子以铈氧化铈固体的形式沉淀。所用的掺杂物类型可以非常广泛，包括诸如铌（Nb）、钇（Y）、镧（La）等金属。不同的制备技术，如改变掺杂物盐的浓度或溶液的pH值，可以影响催化剂的结晶性、表面积和孔隙率，从而影响其结构特性和催化性能。在Nb掺杂氧化铈的背景下，Nb离子进入铈的晶格中可以导致激活能和异丁烷燃烧速率的增加，由于在晶格中创建局部缺陷和电子结构的变化，这促进了更有效的氧存储和释放，从而增强催化活性。
