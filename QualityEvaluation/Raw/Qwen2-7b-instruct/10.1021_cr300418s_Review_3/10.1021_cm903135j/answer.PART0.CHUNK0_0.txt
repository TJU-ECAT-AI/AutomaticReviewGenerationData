[1] "In this work we combine experimental and theoretical work to explore the isovalent replacement of Fe3+ by Al3+."
[2] "The Al concentration in the sample can be controlled by modification of the dopant concentration in solution showing the best relative photoelectrochemical performance from a hematite film doped with 0.46 ± 0.02 atomic % Al deposited from an electrolyte with 10% dissolved Al."
[3] "We interpret the higher PEC performance to be due to the increase conductivity of the hematite associated with the strain introduced in the lattice due to the aluminum substitution for iron."

The document discusses the use of the coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts. This involves mixing ceria with the dopant material in a solution, then precipitating the mixture onto a support material. Variations in preparation techniques can affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For example, in the case of Nb-doped ceria, different preparation methods can lead to changes in the distribution and concentration of the Nb dopant, impacting the n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. The specific details of these effects depend on factors such as the type of dopant used, the concentration of the dopant in the solution, and the conditions under which the coprecipitation occurs.
