[1] "The requirements of such a material are well-known, and the phenomena are fundamentally understood."
[2] "Although any improvement in performance has been attributed to improved conductivity due to a preferential ordering of the crystallites or lattice distortions which change the structural symmetries and relax the constraint on spin-forbidden transitions from the undoped Mott Insulator."
[3] "We interpret the higher PEC performance to be due to the increase conductivity of the hematite associated with the strain introduced in the lattice due to the aluminum substitution for iron."

The document discusses the synthesis and properties of doped hematite photoelectrodes for solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications. It highlights that substitutional doping can improve the electronic properties of hematite, particularly through the introduction of strain in the lattice, which enhances electronic conductivity. The specific case of aluminum doping is analyzed, showing that it leads to a 2- to 3-fold increase in incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) compared to undoped samples. The theoretical explanation involves the contraction of the crystal lattice due to the isovalent replacement of Fe3+ by Al3+, which benefits the small polaron migration, thus improving conductivity.

本文讨论了用于太阳能光电化学（PEC）应用的掺杂磁铁矿光电极的合成和性质。它强调，通过替代掺杂可以改善磁铁矿的电子性质，特别是通过在晶格中引入应变来增强电子导电性。具体来说，铝掺杂被分析，显示这导致了与未掺杂样品相比IPCE提高了2到3倍。理论解释涉及由于将Fe3+替换为Al3+而在晶体结构中的晶格收缩，这有助于小极子迁移，从而提高导电性。
