[1] "Generally speaking, nonisovalent substitutional doping helps to enhance the electronic conductivity of α-Fe2O3."
[2] "However, we found that the introduction of strain in the lattice, which is achieved by isovalent substitutional doping of an Al, can also improve the electronic properties."
[3] "Results indicate that the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) for 0.45 at-% Al substitution increases by 2- to 3-fold over undoped samples."
[4] "Density-functional theory (DFT) was utilized to interpret the experimental findings."
[5] "It was shown that although no substantial change to the electronic structure, a contraction of the crystal lattice due to the isovalent replacement of Fe3+ by an Al3+ benefits the small polaron migration, resulting in an improvement in conductivity compared to the undoped samples."
[6] "For applications to magnetic materials, metal-doped α-Fe2O3 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga) has been investgated, (41) and Ti doped iron oxide was studied theoretically and experimentally by Droubay for its magnetism and conductivity properties. (42)"
[7] "We interpret the higher PEC performance to be due to the increase conductivity of the hematite associated with the strain introduced in the lattice due to the aluminum substitution for iron."

The literature discusses the synthesis of doped ceria catalysts through a coprecipitation method. The method involves mixing ceria with the desired dopant in solution and then precipitating the mixed compound. Different types of dopants, such as Nb, can be used to modify the structural properties of the catalyst. Preparation techniques can significantly affect the resulting catalyst's properties and performance. For instance, the study focuses on the impact of Nb doping on ceria catalysts, particularly in relation to n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. The text explains that Nb doping can enhance the catalyst's activity, possibly through changes in its electronic structure that improve the catalytic process. The density-functional theory (DFT) simulations support this notion by showing that while the electronic structure remains largely unchanged, the introduction of strain due to the dopant leads to improved conductivity and thus enhanced catalytic performance.

文献讨论了通过共沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂。该方法涉及将氧化铈与所需的掺杂剂混合在溶液中，然后沉淀混合物形成复合化合物。不同类型的掺杂剂，如Nb，可以用于修改催化剂的结构特性。不同的制备技术可以显著影响最终催化剂的性质和性能。例如，研究重点是Nb掺杂对氧化铈催化剂的影响，特别是在与丁烷燃烧速率和活化能有关的催化过程中。文本解释说，Nb掺杂可以通过改变其电子结构来增强催化剂的活性，从而改善催化过程。密度泛函理论（DFT）模拟支持这一观点，表明尽管电子结构保持基本不变，但由于掺杂引入的应变导致导电性提高，因此催化性能也得到了增强。
