          [1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
          [2] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
          [3] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

          The coprecipitation method involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. Different salts of the dopant are used depending on its nature (nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr; chloride for Nb, Ta; oxynitrate for Zr). This method leads to the formation of doped ceria catalysts, such as Nb-doped ceria, which can exhibit different n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. For instance, one Nb-doped ceria sample prepared from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to another sample with an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.

          沉淀共混法是通过将宿主阳离子和掺杂物的盐溶液与一种同时沉淀两种阳离子的化学物质处理来合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法。根据掺杂物的性质，使用不同的掺杂物盐（例如，钆、钇、镧、钐、镱、镨为硝酸盐；铌、钽为氯化物；锆为氧氮酸盐）。这种方法可以产生掺杂氧化铈催化剂，如铌掺杂氧化铈，表现出不同的异丁烷燃烧速率和活化能。例如，从氢氧化物制备的一种铌掺杂氧化铈样品的燃烧速率比另一种样品高5%，其有效活化能为85 kJ/mol，而另一种样品的活化能为105 kJ/mol。

          [1] "Liu et al. (99) have prepared Ce1xFexO2 (x = 0.10.5) by the citric acid solgel method."
          [2] "Segregation of Fe3O4 is observed for x > 0.1."
          [3] "The XRD measurements showed that the material with x = 0.1 has ceria structure."

          Liu et al. utilized the citric acid sol-gel method to synthesize Ce1xFexO2 (where x ranges from 0.1 to 0.5). For x values greater than 0.1, segregation of Fe3O4 is observed. The XRD measurements revealed that the material with x = 0.1 retains a ceria structure.

          刘等人利用柠檬酸酸溶胶法合成了Ce1xFexO2（其中x从0.1到0.5变化）。对于x大于0.1的情况，观察到了Fe3O4的分离。XRD测量显示，x=0.1的材料保持了铈结构。
