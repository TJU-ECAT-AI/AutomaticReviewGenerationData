Preparation techniques, such as ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, can significantly influence the structure and properties of the final product. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis involves spraying the precursor solution into a high-temperature environment, leading to rapid evaporation and the formation of solid particles. These catalysts have been found to enhance the combustion rates of n-butane, with the activation energy for n-butane combustion being lower compared to undoped ceria, indicating improved efficiency.", "Chinese": "合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及在温和条件下溶解铈(III)盐和掺杂剂盐。反应并沉淀形成的混合物形成了催化剂。例如，使用五价铌盐作为掺杂剂制备铌掺杂氧化铈催化剂。制备技术，如超声喷雾热解，可以显著影响最终产品的结构和性质。超声喷雾热解过程涉及将前体溶液喷入高温环境中，导致快速蒸发并形成固体颗粒。这些催化剂已被发现可以提高丁烷的燃烧速率，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比，丁烷的活化能更低，表明效率更高。", "Doi": "10.1021/ja064899h"},
