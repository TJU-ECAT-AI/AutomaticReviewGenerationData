The coprecipitation method involves treating a solution of salts of the host cation and dopant with a chemical that precipitates both cations simultaneously. Different salts of the dopant are used depending on its nature (nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr; chloride for Nb, Ta; oxynitrate for Zr). This method leads to the formation of doped ceria catalysts, such as Nb-doped ceria, which can exhibit different n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. For instance, one Nb-doped ceria sample prepared from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to another sample with an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol.

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron, vaporizing the solution at 80°C, drying it with a microwave, and calcining it at 700°C in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained using the same process. Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts are prepared through the citric acid sol-gel method and microwave technique. When the Fe content is below 0.2, it incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. These doped ceria catalysts demonstrate higher activity in methane combustion, particularly for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity. The specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides decreases with an increase in Fe content, suggesting that a small amount of Fe doping leads to a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution.

The coprecipitation method is utilized for synthesizing Nb-doped ceria catalysts, and various preparation techniques impact the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts.
