          [1] "Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by the citric acid sol-gel method."
          [2] "An appreciable amount of citric acid solid powder was added to the mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron."
          [3] "The mixed solution was then vaporized at 80°C under stirring, dried by microwave, and calcined at 700°C for 4 h in air."
          [4] "Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts were obtained by the same method."
          [5] "The pore sizes of mesoporous materials are usually 250 nm; they have high surface area and moderate pore structure, which are advantageous to the adsorption, diffusion, and reaction of organic molecules on surfaces of catalysts."
          [6] "When x 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporated into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions."
          [7] "Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions show higher activity for methane combustion than pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2."
          [8] "The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm indicating the texture uniformity of this sample."
          [9] "The specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides decreased from 38.4 to 5.1 m2/g with an increase in the Fe content, which indicates that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide has a higher specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution when a small amount of Fe was doped."

          The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron, vaporizing the solution at 80°C, drying it with a microwave, and calcining it at 700°C in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained using the same process. Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts are prepared through the citric acid sol-gel method and microwave technique. When the Fe content is below 0.2, it incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. These doped ceria catalysts demonstrate higher activity in methane combustion, particularly for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity. The specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides decreases with an increase in Fe content, suggesting that a small amount of Fe doping leads to a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution.

          合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法包括向铈和铁的混合硝酸盐溶液中添加柠檬酸，然后在80°C下蒸馏溶液，使用微波干燥，并在空气中于700°C下煅烧。单个CeO2和Fe2O3催化剂通过相同的过程获得。通过柠檬酸溶胶法和微波技术制备多孔Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物催化剂。当Fe含量低于0.2时，它会融入CeO2晶格中形成立方体Ce1  xFexO2固溶体。这些掺杂的氧化铈催化剂在甲烷燃烧中的活性更高，特别是Ce0.9Fe0.1O2。Ce0.9Fe0.1O2的孔径分布狭窄且集中在6.3nm，表明纹理均匀性。随着Fe含量的增加，Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物的特定表面积下降，表明少量Fe掺杂导致更高的特定表面积和更窄的孔径分布。

          The activities of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides in methane combustion were studied, and their structures and reductive characteristics were analyzed using XRD, BET, DRS, and TPR. When the Fe content is below 0.2, it integrates into the CeO2 lattice to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. At higher Fe contents, mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 coexist. These Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions exhibit greater activity in methane combustion than pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts were synthesized using the sol-gel method and microwave technique. An increase in Fe content leads to a decrease in the specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides, indicating that a small amount of Fe doping results in a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, signifying its uniform texture.
