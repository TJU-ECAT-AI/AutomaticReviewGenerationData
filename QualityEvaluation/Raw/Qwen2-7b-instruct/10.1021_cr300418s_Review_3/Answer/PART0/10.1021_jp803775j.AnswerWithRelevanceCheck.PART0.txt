          The coprecipitation method includes mixing metal salts in an aqueous solution under controlled conditions, followed by the precipitation of the desired compound. Subsequently, the solid product undergoes washing, drying, and calcination to produce the final catalyst. For Nb-doped ceria, variations in preparation techniques influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalyst, particularly affecting n-butane combustion rates and activation energies.
