          [1] "Porous carbon powders prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis were synthesized."
          [2] "The synthesis involved a mixture of glucose and urea as precursors."
          [3] "Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis was used to convert the mixture into porous carbon powders."
          [4] "The dopants, such as Nb, were introduced during the synthesis process."
          [5] "Different preparation techniques significantly affected the structural properties of the catalysts."
          [6] "The Nb-doped ceria catalyst showed enhanced performance in n-butane combustion rates."
          [7] "Activation energies for the combustion process were lower with the Nb-doped ceria catalyst."

          The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving cerium(III) salts and dopant salts in water under mild conditions. The resulting mixture reacts and precipitates, forming the catalyst. For example, niobium(V) salts are used as dopants in Nb-doped ceria catalysts. Preparation techniques, such as ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, can significantly influence the structure and properties of the final product. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis involves spraying the precursor solution into a high-temperature environment, leading to rapid evaporation and the formation of solid particles. These catalysts have been found to enhance the combustion rates of n-butane, with the activation energy for n-butane combustion being lower compared to undoped ceria, indicating improved efficiency.

          合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及在温和条件下溶解铈(III)盐和掺杂剂盐。反应并沉淀形成的混合物形成了催化剂。例如，使用五价铌盐作为掺杂剂制备铌掺杂氧化铈催化剂。制备技术，如超声喷雾热解，可以显著影响最终产品的结构和性质。超声喷雾热解过程涉及将前体溶液喷入高温环境中，导致快速蒸发并形成固体颗粒。这些催化剂已被发现可以提高丁烷的燃烧速率，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比，丁烷的活化能更低，表明效率更高。
