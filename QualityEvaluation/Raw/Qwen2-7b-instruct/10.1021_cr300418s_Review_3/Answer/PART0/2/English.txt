Liu et al. utilized the citric acid sol-gel method to synthesize Ce1xFexO2 (where x ranges from 0.1 to 0.5). For x values greater than 0.1, segregation of Fe3O4 is observed. The XRD measurements revealed that the material with x = 0.1 retains a ceria structure.

The activities of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides in methane combustion were studied, and their structures and reductive characteristics were analyzed using XRD, BET, DRS, and TPR. When the Fe content is below 0.2, it integrates into the CeO2 lattice to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. At higher Fe contents, mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 coexist. These Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions exhibit greater activity in methane combustion than pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts were synthesized using the sol-gel method and microwave technique. An increase in Fe content leads to a decrease in the specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides, indicating that a small amount of Fe doping results in a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, signifying its uniform texture.

The coprecipitation method includes mixing metal salts in an aqueous solution under controlled conditions, followed by the precipitation of the desired compound. Subsequently, the solid product undergoes washing, drying, and calcination to produce the final catalyst. For Nb-doped ceria, variations in preparation techniques influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalyst, particularly affecting n-butane combustion rates and activation energies.

To synthesize doped ceria catalysts, the coprecipitation method is employed. This process starts by dissolving metal salts in water. A dopant, like Nb, is then introduced into the solution. The mixture undergoes heating to produce the catalyst. Varying preparation methods may influence the catalyst's structure. For instance, Nb-doped ceria demonstrates altered n-butane combustion rates and activation energies due to these preparation techniques.

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving cerium(III) salts and dopant salts in water under mild conditions. The resulting mixture reacts and precipitates, forming the catalyst. For example, niobium(V) salts are used as dopants in Nb-doped ceria catalysts. Preparation techniques, such as ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, can significantly influence the structure and properties of the final product. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis involves spraying the precursor solution into a high-temperature environment, leading to rapid evaporation and the formation of solid particles. These catalysts have been found to enhance the combustion rates of n-butane, with the activation energy for n-butane combustion being lower compared to undoped ceria, indicating improved efficiency.
