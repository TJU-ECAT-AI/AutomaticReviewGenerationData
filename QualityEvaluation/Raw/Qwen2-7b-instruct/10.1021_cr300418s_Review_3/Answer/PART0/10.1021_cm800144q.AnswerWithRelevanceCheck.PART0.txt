      <English>
          To synthesize doped ceria catalysts, the coprecipitation method is employed. This process starts by dissolving metal salts in water. A dopant, like Nb, is then introduced into the solution. The mixture undergoes heating to produce the catalyst. Varying preparation methods may influence the catalyst's structure. For instance, Nb-doped ceria demonstrates altered n-butane combustion rates and activation energies due to these preparation techniques.
