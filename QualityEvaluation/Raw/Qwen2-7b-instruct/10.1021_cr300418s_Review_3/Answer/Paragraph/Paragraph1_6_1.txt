        The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves a series of steps that include dissolving cerium(III) salts and dopant salts in water under mild conditions, followed by precipitation. Different salts of the dopant are used based on its nature (nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr; chloride for Nb, Ta; oxynitrate for Zr). This method results in the formation of doped ceria catalysts, such as Nb-doped ceria, which can exhibit distinct n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. For example, one Nb-doped ceria sample prepared from hydroxide had a 5% higher combustion rate and an effective activation energy of 85 kJ/mol, compared to another sample with an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol. 

        The synthesis of mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts through the citric acid sol-gel method further illustrates the versatility of the coprecipitation method. By varying the preparation techniques, significant differences in the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts can be observed. Specifically, the type of dopant plays a crucial role in influencing both the structure and catalytic efficiency of the resulting catalysts. For instance, Nb doping enhances the activity of ceria catalysts in n-butane combustion reactions.

        The enhanced catalytic performance of Nb-doped ceria catalysts over undoped ceria is a testament to the effectiveness of the coprecipitation method. This improvement in performance can be attributed to several factors, including the precise control over the dopant concentration and the resulting structural properties of the catalyst. Moreover, the type of dopant can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts, as demonstrated by the comparison between Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr, and Nb doping.

Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the coprecipitation process for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, identifying new dopants with enhanced catalytic properties, and exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple dopants. Additionally, the development of more efficient and sustainable preparation techniques could lead to the creation of catalysts with superior performance and environmental compatibility.
