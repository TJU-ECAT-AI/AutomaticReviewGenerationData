        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cr300418s_3]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/jp803775j] and [10.1134/s0023158408050121]. The coprecipitation method, a versatile synthesis technique, allows for the incorporation of various dopants into ceria matrices, influencing the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. Nitrate, chloride, and oxynitrate salts are used for different dopants, enabling the creation of complex solid solutions. For instance, niobium (Nb) doping, as exemplified in Nb-doped ceria catalysts, can significantly enhance the catalytic performance, particularly in n-butane combustion reactions. The use of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis to synthesize doped ceria catalysts, as detailed in [10.1021/ja064899h], showcases the importance of preparation techniques in determining the structural properties and, consequently, the catalytic efficiency of these materials. The incorporation of dopants like Nb not only boosts the activity but also modifies the pore size distribution and specific surface area, crucial factors affecting the adsorption, diffusion, and reaction kinetics on the catalyst surfaces. This insight into the coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, along with the exploration of preparation techniques and dopant selection, paves the way for optimizing these materials for applications such as n-butane combustion, where enhancing combustion rates and reducing activation energies are paramount.
