The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing metal ions, such as niobium ions for Nb-doped ceria, with the precursor of ceria in an aqueous solution. The mixture is then heated, resulting in the formation of a solid precipitate. This precipitate is typically washed, dried, and calcined to produce the final catalyst. Different preparation techniques can affect the crystallinity, particle size, and surface area of the catalyst, which in turn can significantly impact its catalytic performance. For instance, in the case of Nb-doped ceria, these factors notably influence the rate of n-butane combustion and the activation energy involved.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法涉及将金属离子（例如，铌离子用于铌掺杂氧化铈）与氧化铈的前体混合在水溶液中。然后加热混合物，导致形成固体沉淀物。该沉淀物通常经过洗涤、干燥和煅烧以获得最终催化剂。不同的制备技术可以影响催化剂的结晶性、颗粒大小和表面积，进而显著影响其催化性能。例如，在铌掺杂氧化铈的情况下，这些因素特别影响丁烷燃烧速率和涉及的活化能。
