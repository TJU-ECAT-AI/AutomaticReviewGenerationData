The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing aqueous solutions of cerium nitrate and the dopant salt, followed by precipitation under acidic conditions. In this study, a coprecipitation method was employed to synthesize Nb-doped ceria, where cerium nitrate and niobium(V) oxide were dissolved in water. The resulting precipitate was processed to obtain the final Nb-doped ceria catalyst. The structural properties of the Nb-doped ceria catalyst were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while its catalytic performance was evaluated through n-butane combustion experiments. Compared to undoped ceria, the Nb-doped ceria catalyst demonstrated improved combustion rates and lower activation energies.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法涉及将铈硝酸盐和掺杂盐的水溶液混合，然后在酸性条件下沉淀。本研究采用沉淀法制备了掺铌氧化铈，其中铈硝酸盐和五价铌在水中溶解。生成的沉淀物经过处理后获得了最终的掺铌氧化铈催化剂。通过X射线衍射(XRD)分析了掺铌氧化铈催化剂的结构特性，而其催化性能则通过丁烷燃烧实验进行了评估。与未掺杂的氧化铈相比，掺铌氧化铈催化剂显示出更高的燃烧速率和更低的活化能。
