[1] "The coprecipitation method involves mixing the metal ions and the precursor of ceria together in an aqueous solution."
[2] "For example, in the case of Nb-doped ceria, niobium ions are introduced along with cerium(IV) nitrate."
[3] "The mixture is then heated, leading to the formation of a solid precipitate."
[4] "This precipitate is typically washed, dried, and calcined to obtain the final catalyst."
[5] "Different preparation techniques can influence the crystallinity, particle size, and surface area of the catalyst."
[6] "In the context of Nb-doped ceria, these factors can significantly impact the catalytic performance."
[7] "The impact is particularly evident in the rate of n-butane combustion and the activation energy involved."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing metal ions, such as niobium ions for Nb-doped ceria, with the precursor of ceria in an aqueous solution. The mixture is then heated, resulting in the formation of a solid precipitate. This precipitate is typically washed, dried, and calcined to produce the final catalyst. Different preparation techniques can affect the crystallinity, particle size, and surface area of the catalyst, which in turn can significantly impact its catalytic performance. For instance, in the case of Nb-doped ceria, these factors notably influence the rate of n-butane combustion and the activation energy involved.
