1. The coprecipitation method involves the simultaneous precipitation of the desired ceramic compound and dopant material. This technique was utilized to synthesize Nb-doped ceria catalysts. Different preparation methods can greatly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the catalysts. In the context of Nb-doped ceria, the addition of niobium ions modifies the electronic structure, thereby impacting the combustion rates of n-butane and the activation energies involved.
