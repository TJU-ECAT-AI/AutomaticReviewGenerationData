Coprecipitation is a method used in synthesizing doped ceria catalysts. This process creates a uniform mixture of the ceria matrix and dopant ions. Different preparation techniques can have significant effects on the resulting catalysts' structural properties and catalytic performance. For instance, the use of Nb-doped ceria demonstrates how such modifications can influence n-butane combustion rates and activation energies.
