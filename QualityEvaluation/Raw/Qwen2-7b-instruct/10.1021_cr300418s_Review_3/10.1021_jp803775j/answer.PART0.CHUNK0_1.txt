The coprecipitation method was utilized to synthesize Nb-doped ceria catalysts for the purpose of enhancing their catalytic performance, particularly in n-butane combustion reactions. This technique involves the concurrent precipitation of ceria and Nb compounds. As a result, the catalysts demonstrated increased n-butane combustion rates and lower activation energies compared to undoped ceria.
