The coprecipitation method was utilized to synthesize Nb-doped ceria catalysts. These catalysts demonstrated enhanced catalytic performance over undoped ceria. Different preparation techniques notably influenced the structural characteristics and catalytic efficiency of the resulting catalysts. The introduction of Nb dopant led to increased n-butane combustion rates and decreased activation energies for the combustion process.
