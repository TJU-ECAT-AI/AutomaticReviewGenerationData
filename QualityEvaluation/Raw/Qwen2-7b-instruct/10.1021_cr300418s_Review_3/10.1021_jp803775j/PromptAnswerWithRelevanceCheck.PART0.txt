<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To synthesize doped ceria catalysts using the coprecipitation method, one must mix cerium(III) nitrate, ammonium hydroxide, and the desired dopant (such as Nb) in aqueous solution. After precipitation, the solid product is washed, dried, and calcined to achieve the final catalyst. The type of dopant notably impacts the catalyst's structural properties and catalytic performance. For example, Nb doping enhances the activity of ceria catalysts in n-butane combustion reactions by modifying the ceria's surface area and redox properties. Preparation techniques, including reactant concentration and calcination temperature, also influence the catalyst's performance.
