To synthesize doped ceria catalysts using the coprecipitation method, one must mix cerium(III) nitrate, ammonium hydroxide, and the desired dopant (such as Nb) in aqueous solution. After precipitation, the solid product is washed, dried, and calcined to achieve the final catalyst. The type of dopant notably impacts the catalyst's structural properties and catalytic performance. For example, Nb doping enhances the activity of ceria catalysts in n-butane combustion reactions by modifying the ceria's surface area and redox properties. Preparation techniques, including reactant concentration and calcination temperature, also influence the catalyst's performance.

为了使用沉淀法合成掺杂的铈催化剂，需要将三氧化二铈、氨水和所需的掺杂物（例如Nb）混合在水中。沉淀后，固体产物经过洗涤、干燥和煅烧以获得最终催化剂。不同的掺杂物显著影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，Nb掺杂可以增强铈催化剂在丁烷燃烧反应中的活性，通过改变铈的表面积和氧化还原性质。制备技术，如反应物浓度和煅烧温度，也会影响催化剂的性能。
