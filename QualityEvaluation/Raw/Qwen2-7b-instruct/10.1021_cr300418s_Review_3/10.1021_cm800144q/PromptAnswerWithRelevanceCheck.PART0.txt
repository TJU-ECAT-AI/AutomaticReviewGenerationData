[1] "The synthesis of doped ceria catalysts involves a coprecipitation method where metal salts are dissolved in an aqueous solution."
[2] "The dopant, such as Nb, is added during this process."
[3] "The resulting mixture is then heated to form the desired catalyst."
[4] "Different preparation techniques can affect the structural properties of the catalyst."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To synthesize doped ceria catalysts, the coprecipitation method is employed. This process starts by dissolving metal salts in water. A dopant, like Nb, is then introduced into the solution. The mixture undergoes heating to produce the catalyst. Varying preparation methods can influence the catalyst's structure. For instance, Nb-doped ceria demonstrates altered n-butane combustion rates and activation energies due to these preparation techniques.
