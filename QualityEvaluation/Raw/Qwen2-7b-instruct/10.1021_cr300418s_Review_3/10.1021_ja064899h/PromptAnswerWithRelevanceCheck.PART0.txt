The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving cerium(III) salts and dopant salts in water under mild conditions. The resulting mixture reacts and precipitates, forming the catalyst. For example, niobium(V) salts are used as dopants in Nb-doped ceria catalysts. Preparation techniques, such as ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, can significantly influence the structure and properties of the final product. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis involves spraying the precursor solution into a high-temperature environment, leading to rapid evaporation and the formation of solid particles. These catalysts have been found to enhance the combustion rates of n-butane, with the activation energy for n-butane combustion being lower compared to undoped ceria, indicating improved efficiency.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及在温和条件下溶解铈(III)盐和掺杂剂盐。反应并沉淀形成的混合物形成了催化剂。例如，使用五价铌盐作为掺杂剂制备铌掺杂氧化铈催化剂。制备技术，如超声喷雾热解，可以显著影响最终产品的结构和性质。超声喷雾热解过程涉及将前体溶液喷入高温环境中，导致快速蒸发并形成固体颗粒。这些催化剂已被发现可以提高丁烷的燃烧速率，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比，丁烷的活化能更低，表明效率更高。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves the following steps: the ceria and dopant (in this case, Nb) are mixed together in an aqueous solution, which is then precipitated under specific conditions to form the desired catalyst. The process variations include the choice of dopant, its concentration, and the reaction parameters such as temperature and pH. The type of dopant used affects the structural properties of the ceria, leading to changes in the lattice structure and surface chemistry. These changes influence the catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts, particularly in terms of n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. Different preparation techniques, such as the method of mixing the reactants, the use of additives, and the post-synthesis treatment, can further impact the structural properties and catalytic activity of the catalysts.
