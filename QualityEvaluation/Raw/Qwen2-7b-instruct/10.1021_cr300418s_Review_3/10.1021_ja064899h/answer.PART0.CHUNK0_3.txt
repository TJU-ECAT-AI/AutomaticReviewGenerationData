The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves the following steps: the ceria and dopant (in this case, Nb) are mixed together in an aqueous solution, which is then precipitated under specific conditions to form the desired catalyst. The process variations include the choice of dopant, its concentration, and the reaction parameters such as temperature and pH. The type of dopant used affects the structural properties of the ceria, leading to changes in the lattice structure and surface chemistry. These changes influence the catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts, particularly in terms of n-butane combustion rates and activation energies. Different preparation techniques, such as the method of mixing the reactants, the use of additives, and the post-synthesis treatment, can further impact the structural properties and catalytic activity of the catalysts.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法涉及以下步骤：将铈和掺杂剂（本例为Nb）混合在水中，然后在特定条件下进行沉淀以形成所需的催化剂。过程的变化包括选择掺杂剂、其浓度以及反应参数如温度和pH值。所用掺杂剂的类型会影响铈的结构性质，导致晶格结构和表面化学的改变。这些变化影响了催化剂的催化性能，特别是在n-丁烷燃烧速率和活化能方面。不同的制备技术，如反应物混合方法、添加剂的使用和后合成处理，还可以进一步影响催化剂的结构特性和催化活性。
