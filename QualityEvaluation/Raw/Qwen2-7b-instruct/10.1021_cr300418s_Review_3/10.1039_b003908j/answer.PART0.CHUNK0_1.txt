1. The combustion technique involves creating an ionic dispersion of silver on a nano-crystalline surface to synthesize the catalyst. This method results in higher catalytic activities due to the ionic dispersion of silver on the surface. Compared to silver particles dispersed on alumina, the temperatures required for NO reduction, CO oxidation, and hydrocarbon combustion are notably lower on the synthesized catalyst.

2. The interaction between silver ions and ceria supports plays a crucial role in enabling relatively low-temperature reactions compared to the same silver particles dispersed on alumina.

3. The activation energies for the NO reduction with CO and the CO oxidation reactions over the synthesized catalyst are 67 kJ mol−1 and 71 kJ mol−1, respectively.

1. 燃烧法是一种合成方法，它将银离子分散在纳米级支撑上。这种方法导致了更高的催化活性，因为银离子被分散在表面上。与铝酸盐上的银粒子相比，该合成催化剂所需的NO还原、CO氧化和碳氢化合物燃烧温度明显较低。

2. 银离子和铈氧化物之间的相互作用对实现相对较低温度的反应起到了关键作用，与相同银粒子分散在铝酸盐相比。

3. 合成催化剂上进行的NO与CO反应的激活能为67 kJ mol−1，而CO氧化反应的激活能为71 kJ mol−1。
