The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing a redox mixture containing cerium nitrate, silver nitrate, and an organic fuel like oxalyldihydrazide (ODH) in aqueous solution. The mixture is heated in a muffle furnace to induce combustion, which produces a solid product containing ionically dispersed silver on the ceria surface. The resulting catalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Different preparation techniques can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts. For instance, in the case of silver-ceria catalysts, the ionically dispersed silver provides enhanced catalytic activity compared to silver-alumina catalysts. The activation energies for NO reduction, CO oxidation, and hydrocarbon combustion reactions are lower over silver-ceria catalysts, indicating improved efficiency. The interaction between the silver ions and the ceria support likely contributes to the relatively low reaction temperatures observed. The silver ions are stabilized by the ceria rather than forming metal particles, which is consistent with the theoretical expectations based on ionic radii considerations.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法涉及将铈硝酸盐、银硝酸盐和有机燃料（如氧化二氢腙）在水溶液中的混合物加热至引发燃烧，从而产生包含表面离子分散的银的固体产品。最终催化剂通过X射线衍射、透射电子显微镜和X射线光电子能谱进行表征。不同的制备技术可以显著影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，在银-氧化铈催化剂的情况下，表面离子分散的银提供了与银-氧化铝催化剂相比增强的催化活性。所得催化剂对NO还原、CO氧化和烃类燃烧反应的激活能较低，表明效率更高。银离子与氧化铈之间的相互作用很可能是观察到的较低反应温度的原因。银离子被氧化铈稳定而不是形成金属颗粒，这与基于离子半径考虑的理论预期一致。
