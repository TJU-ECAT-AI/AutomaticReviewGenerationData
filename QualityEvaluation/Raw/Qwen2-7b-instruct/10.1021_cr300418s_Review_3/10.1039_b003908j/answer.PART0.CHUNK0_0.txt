1. The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves producing a mixture of the desired dopant, such as Nb, with ceria in a liquid phase, typically through a chemical reaction. The process includes adjusting parameters like pH, temperature, and stirring speed to achieve optimal conditions for the formation of a homogeneous mixture. The dopant is usually introduced in the form of its salt, often nitrate or chloride, while ceria is provided as a precursor, commonly in the form of its oxide. The resulting mixture is then precipitated, often under controlled conditions, to form a solid product. The choice of dopant influences the crystal structure, acidity, and redox properties of the ceria, affecting the catalytic performance.

2. The type of dopant used significantly impacts the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting ceria catalysts. For instance, the addition of Nb to ceria can lead to changes in the lattice structure, promoting the formation of active sites that enhance the catalytic activity for specific reactions. The dopant's ionic radius and charge play crucial roles in determining the interactions with ceria, influencing the dispersion of metal ions on the surface and the overall surface chemistry.

3. Different preparation techniques, such as impregnation, ion exchange, or the combustion method, can lead to variations in the structural properties and catalytic performance of ceria catalysts. For example, the combustion technique allows for the formation of highly dispersed metal ions on the ceria surface, which might result in improved reactivity and selectivity compared to other methods. The combustion method involves a rapid exothermic reaction that can lead to the formation of fine particles and enhanced surface area, contributing to better catalytic activity.

4. The example of Nb-doped ceria illustrates how the introduction of a dopant can significantly influence the combustion rate of n-butane. The presence of Nb enhances the catalytic properties, leading to faster combustion rates and potentially lower activation energies required for the reaction. This improvement in catalytic performance is attributed to the altered electronic and structural properties of the ceria due to the doping, which facilitates more efficient adsorption and activation of reactants.

5. The activation energy values for NO reduction and CO oxidation over 1% Ag/CeO2 catalyst are 67 and 71 kJ/mol, respectively. These values indicate the energy barrier that needs to be overcome for these reactions to proceed at a certain temperature. Lower activation energies generally suggest higher reactivity and faster reaction kinetics, which are desirable properties in catalytic applications.

1. 某种掺杂方法用于合成掺杂铈氧化物催化剂，通过在液体相中生成所需的掺杂剂（如Nb）与铈氧化物的混合物，通常通过化学反应完成。调整参数，如pH值、温度和搅拌速度，以达到形成均一混合物的最佳条件。掺杂剂通常以盐的形式提供，通常是硝酸盐或氯化物，而铈氧化物作为前体提供，通常以氧化物形式存在。然后将此混合物沉淀，通常在控制条件下进行，以形成固体产品。所选掺杂剂对晶格结构、酸性和氧化还原性质产生影响，从而影响催化性能。

2. 所使用的掺杂剂类型显著影响了掺杂铈氧化物催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，向铈氧化物中添加Nb可以导致晶体结构的变化，促进活性位点的形成，从而增强特定反应的催化活性。掺杂剂的离子半径和电荷在确定与铈氧化物之间的相互作用方面起着关键作用，影响表面金属离子的分散和整体表面化学性质。

3. 不同的制备技术，如浸渍、离子交换或燃烧法，会导致铈氧化物催化剂的结构特性和催化性能的差异。例如，燃烧法允许在铈表面上形成高度分散的金属离子，这可能与其它方法相比，导致更好的反应活性和选择性。燃烧方法涉及快速放热反应，可能导致形成细颗粒和增加表面积，从而有助于提高催化性能。

4. 以Nb掺杂铈氧化物为例，说明引入掺杂剂如何显著影响n-丁烷的燃烧速率。Nb的存在增强了催化剂的特性，导致更快的燃烧速率，并可能降低所需反应的活化能。这种催化性能的改进归因于由于掺杂导致的铈氧化物的结构和电子性质的变化，这促进了更有效的吸附和激活反应物。

5. 1% Ag/CeO2 催化剂上NO还原和CO氧化的活化能分别为67 kJ/mol和71 kJ/mol。这些值表示需要克服的能量壁垒，以在一定温度下进行这些反应。较低的活化能通常意味着更高的反应活性和更快的反应动力学，这对于催化应用是可取的特性。
