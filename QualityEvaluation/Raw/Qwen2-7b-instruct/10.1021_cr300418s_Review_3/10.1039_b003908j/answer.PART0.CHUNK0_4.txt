The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves combining the metal salt (such as AgNO3), the dopant salt (like (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6), and the fuel (Oxalyldihydrazide, ODH) in a specific molar ratio, typically 0.99:0.01:2.381. The mixture is then heated in a muffle furnace at 350°C until it ignites, forming a solid product. The catalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ionically dispersed metal (Ag in this case) on the nano-crystalline ceria surface leads to enhanced catalytic properties compared to similarly prepared catalysts on alumina. The catalytic activities towards NO reduction, CO oxidation, and hydrocarbon combustion are higher at lower temperatures on the Ag/CeO2 catalysts compared to those prepared on alumina. The activation energies for NO reduction and CO oxidation are 67 and 71 kJ/mol, respectively, over the Ag/CeO2 catalyst.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法涉及将金属盐（如AgNO3）、掺杂剂盐（例如（NH4）2Ce(NO3)6）和燃料（Oxalyldihydrazide，ODH）按特定摩尔比混合，通常为0.99:0.01:2.381。然后将混合物放入马弗炉中加热至350°C，直到其点燃，形成固体产物。催化剂通过X射线衍射、透射电子显微镜和X射线光电子能谱进行表征。在纳米结晶氧化铈表面上离子分散的金属（本例为Ag）可以提高催化性能，与在氧化铝上制备的催化剂相比，在更低温度下表现出更高的催化活性。Ag/CeO2催化剂上对NO还原、CO氧化和烃类燃烧的催化作用高于相同技术制备的Al2O3催化剂。NO还原和CO氧化的活化能分别为71 kJ/mol和67 kJ/mol。
