The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing the metal salts of the dopant with cerium salts in aqueous solution, followed by precipitation under acidic conditions. This technique allows for the controlled incorporation of dopants into the ceria matrix. The process variations might include altering the pH, temperature, or the concentration of the reactants. Different preparation techniques, such as the co-precipitation method versus impregnation or ion-exchange, can significantly affect the structural properties of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the co-precipitation method tends to produce more uniform and smaller particles, which can enhance the surface area and improve catalytic performance.

In the context of the literature, the combustion technique was employed to synthesize an Ag/CeO2 catalyst. This method produced Ag ions dispersed on the nano-sized surface of CeO2, leading to higher catalytic activities compared to similarly prepared Ag particles on Al2O3. The structural properties of the catalyst, such as the surface concentration of Ag ions and the interaction between Ag and CeO2, played a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. The combustion synthesized Ag/CeO2 showed lower activation energies for NO reduction, CO oxidation, and hydrocarbon combustion compared to conventional methods. This was attributed to the unique dispersion of Ag ions on the CeO2 surface, which facilitated more efficient reactions at lower temperatures. The specific activation energies of 67 kJ mol−1 for NO reduction and 71 kJ mol−1 for CO oxidation over the 1% catalyst indicated the efficiency of the Ag/CeO2 system for these processes.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法涉及将掺杂物的金属盐与铈盐混合在水溶液中，随后在酸性条件下进行沉淀。这种方法允许对掺杂物在氧化铈基质中的可控整合。过程变体可能包括改变pH值、温度或反应物浓度。不同的制备技术，如共沉淀方法与浸渍法或离子交换法相比，可以显著影响最终催化剂的结构特性。例如，共沉淀方法倾向于产生更均匀且更小的颗粒，这可以提高表面积并改善催化性能。

在文献的背景下，采用燃烧技术合成了一个Ag/CeO2催化剂。这种方法在纳米级表面上产生了分散在CeO2上的Ag离子，导致与Al2O3上类似制备的Ag粒子相比具有更高的催化活性。催化剂的结构特性，如Ag离子的表面浓度和Ag与CeO2之间的相互作用，在决定催化性能方面发挥了关键作用。燃烧合成的Ag/CeO2显示出与常规方法相比，NO还原、CO氧化和烃燃烧的激活能更低。这归因于Ag离子在CeO2表面的独特分散，这使得这些过程在较低温度下更有效。该催化剂的特定激活能量分别为67 kJ mol−1用于NO还原和71 kJ mol−1用于CO氧化，表明Ag/CeO2系统在这两个过程中效率很高。
