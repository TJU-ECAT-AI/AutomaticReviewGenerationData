1. The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves incorporating dopants into the ceria matrix. Common dopants include noble metals like Rh, Ag, and Au. The type and amount of dopant used can vary, affecting the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. Different preparation techniques, such as hydrothermal, spray pyrolysis, solid-state reactions, microwave-assisted synthesis, and sol-gel methods, can lead to significant differences in material properties. In the study presented, silver doped lanthanum chromites were synthesized via a microwave combustion method, achieving partial doping at both the A and B sites with short reaction times.

2. The synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites by microwave combustion resulted in nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 78 nm to 2026 nm, depending on the site of doping. The increased saturation magnetization in the doped samples can be attributed to the non-magnetic nature of silver.

1. 铑、银和金等贵金属的掺杂是提高这些钙钛矿效率的方法之一。常用的合成方法包括水热法、喷雾热解法、固相反应、微波辅助合成、溶胶凝胶法等，这些方法对材料性能有显著影响。在当前工作中，首次报告了银掺杂镧系铬酸盐纳米粒子的合成。通过微波燃烧法实现了A位和B位的局部掺杂，短反应时间（几分钟）生成了La1xAgxCrO3和LaCr1xAgxO3类型的钙钛矿。

2. 使用微波燃烧法合成的银掺杂镧系铬酸盐纳米粒子的尺寸范围从78 nm到2026 nm不等，具体取决于掺杂位置。掺杂样品中饱和磁化率的增加可归因于银的非磁性性质。
