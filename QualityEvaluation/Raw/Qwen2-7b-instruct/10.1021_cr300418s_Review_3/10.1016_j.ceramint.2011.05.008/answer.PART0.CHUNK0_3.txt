The document discusses the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites using a microwave combustion method. This process allows for partial doping at both the A and B sites with a quick reaction time of a few minutes, producing perovskites of types La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3. The structural and physical chemical properties of these materials are explored through various characterization techniques. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum indicates characteristic metal-oxygen bonds for CrO stretching at 604 cm1, OCrO bending mode at 419 cm1, and AgO bonds at 561 cm1 and 443 cm1. The X-ray diffraction patterns reveal a hexagonal structure with additional peaks at 2u values corresponding to the dopants and lanthanum chromite. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates stable behavior of the synthesized product. Transmission electron microscopy shows nanosized particles ranging from 78 nm to 2026 nm. At room temperature, magnetic studies exhibit hysteresis loop formation during magnetization of the samples.
