The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves combining metal nitrates as precursors, urea as fuel, and a dopant in a solution. This reaction forms an exothermic process that leads to the formation of ceria-based compounds. The specific composition, such as LaCrO3, La1xAgxCrO3, and LaCr1xAgxO3, depends on the substitution of lanthanum (La) and chromium (Cr) by silver (Ag). The synthesis conditions, including microwave power, oxidizer to fuel ratio, and irradiation time, influence the purity of the final product. Optimal conditions for obtaining a pure phase product typically involve a microwave power of 0.56 kW, an irradiation time of 10 minutes, and a 1:1 oxidizer to fuel ratio.

FT-IR spectroscopy is used to confirm the formation of the desired product by identifying characteristic absorption bands related to the chemical bonds within the compound. X-ray diffraction analysis provides insights into the crystalline structure and phase purity of the sample, revealing the formation of hexagonal LaCrO3 with additional peaks corresponding to the dopant.

Morphological studies, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), offer visual evidence of the particle size distribution and shape of the synthesized catalysts. Thermal analysis, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA), helps understand the stability and composition changes during synthesis and subsequent heat treatment.

Magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization, retentivity, and coercivity, are evaluated to assess the suitability of the synthesized catalysts for specific applications, particularly in materials requiring magnetic functionality. The incorporation of silver as a dopant affects these properties, often leading to increased saturation magnetization due to the non-magnetic nature of silver.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法涉及将金属硝酸盐作为前体、尿素作为燃料和掺杂剂在溶液中混合。这个反应形成一个放热过程，导致形成基于氧化铈的化合物。特定组成，如LaCrO3、La1xAgxCrO3和LaCr1xAgxO3，取决于镧（La）和铬（Cr）被银（Ag）取代的程度。合成条件，包括微波功率、氧化剂与燃料的比例和照射时间，影响最终产品的纯度。获得纯相产品最佳条件通常涉及微波功率为0.56 kW、照射时间为10分钟以及氧化剂与燃料比为1:1。

傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）用于确认所需产物的形成，通过识别与化合物内化学键相关的特征吸收峰。X射线衍射分析提供有关样品结晶结构和相纯度的见解，揭示形成六方LaCrO3，并且存在额外的峰值对应于掺杂剂。

形态研究，如透射电子显微镜（TEM），提供了合成催化剂的颗粒大小分布和形状的可视化证据。热分析，包括热重分析（TGA）和差热分析（DTA），有助于理解合成过程及其后续热处理期间的稳定性和组分变化。

磁性性质，如饱和磁化率、剩磁和矫顽力，被评估以评估合成催化剂的适用性，特别是对于需要磁功能的材料。银作为掺杂剂的引入会影响这些性质，通常导致饱和磁化率增加，由于银是非磁性的。
