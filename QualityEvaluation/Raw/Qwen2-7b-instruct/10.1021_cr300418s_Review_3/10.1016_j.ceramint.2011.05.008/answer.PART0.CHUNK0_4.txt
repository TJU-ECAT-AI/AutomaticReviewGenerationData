The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves combining metal nitrates and urea as a fuel under controlled conditions. This process allows for partial doping at both A site and B site with noble metals such as Rh, Ag, and Au. The method of synthesis significantly affects the material properties of the resulting catalysts. In the context of this research, the authors successfully synthesized silver-doped lanthanum chromites using a microwave combustion method, achieving perovskites of types La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3 within a short reaction time. The use of different preparation techniques influenced the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts. For instance, the size of the particles decreased due to the introduction of dopant ions, altering the lattice parameters and theoretical densities. The synthesized materials exhibited soft chromites with low coercivity, indicating improved catalytic performance for processes like n-butane combustion. The detailed analysis of the structural properties, such as particle size, lattice parameters, and theoretical densities, provides insights into the effectiveness of the coprecipitation method for enhancing the catalytic properties of doped ceria catalysts.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及将金属硝酸盐和尿素作为燃料在控制条件下混合。这种方法允许在A位点和B位点对贵金属如Rh、Ag和Au进行部分掺杂。不同的合成方法显著影响催化剂的材料性质。在此研究中，作者成功地使用微波燃烧法合成了银掺杂镧石榴石，获得了类型为La1xAgxCrO3和LaCr1xAgxO3的珀尔克石，反应时间很短。合成技术的不同影响了催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，由于掺杂离子的影响，颗粒大小降低，改变了晶格参数和理论密度。所合成的材料显示出软铬石特性，具有较低的矫顽力，表明提高了催化性能，如n-丁烷燃烧过程。对结构特性的详细分析，如颗粒大小、晶格参数和理论密度，提供了增强掺杂氧化铈催化剂催化性能的方法的有效性见解。
