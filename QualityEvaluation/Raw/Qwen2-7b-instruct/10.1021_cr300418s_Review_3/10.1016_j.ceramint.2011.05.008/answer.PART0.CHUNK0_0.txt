<p>The present work reports the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites.</p>
<p>The method of synthesis adopted also influences the material properties significantly.</p>
<p>In the present work, we report the synthesis of nanoparticles of silver doped lanthanum chromite for the first time.</p>
<p>FTIR spectrum reveals the characteristic metal oxygen bands for CrO stretching at 604 cm1, OCrO bending mode at 419 cm1 and AgO bands at 561 cm1 and 443 cm1.</p>
<p>The powder X-ray diffraction patterns exhibit the formation of hexagonal structure with the dopant peaks at 2u values of 38.38, 44.18 and 64.48 apart from the peaks corresponding to lanthanum chromite.</p>
<p>The FTIR spectra of silver doped (both A site and B site) lanthanum chromite samples exhibit increment in band assignment of CrO stretching and OCrO deformation vibrations implying substitution of Ag+ ions at lanthanum and chromium sub lattice.</p>
<p>The peaks at 2u values of 38.3, 44.1 and 64.4 in addition to the characteristic peaks of lanthanum chromite are observed in X-ray diffractograms of Ag doped (both A site and B site) LaCrO3.</p>
<p>The crystallite size of the particles calculated using the Scherrer formula is given in Table 1.</p>
<p>EDAX data of samples with B site doping (Table 2) clearly shows the formation of silver rich phase of the perovskite at lower doping level (0.02 M) while at higher concentration of silver (i.e. 0.06 M) oxygen ion deficiency can be observed.</p>
<p>The micrograph (TEM) of lanthanum chromite powder synthesized by microwave combustion route is shown in Fig. 5(a).</p>
<p>The magnetograms obtained for LaCrO3 and doped samples show hysteresis loops with low coercivity indicating formation of soft chromites.</p>
<p>Table 3 gives the values of saturation magnetization (Ms), retentivity (Mr) and coercivity (HCi) evaluated from the figure.</p>

The literature describes the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites using the microwave combustion method. The synthesis process is influenced by factors such as microwave power, fuel-to-oxidizer ratio, and irradiation time, which determine the purity and composition of the products. The powders were characterized using FTIR, XRD, TEM, and magnetic measurements. The FTIR spectra revealed the presence of CrO and AgO bonds, while the XRD patterns showed the formation of a hexagonal structure with additional peaks due to the dopant. The TEM images indicated the formation of particles with sizes ranging from 78 to 2026 nm. The magnetic properties were analyzed, showing an increase in saturation magnetization due to the non-magnetic nature of silver. The synthesis method used affects the structural properties and magnetic performance of the resulting catalysts.

文献描述了使用微波燃烧法合成银掺杂镧钛酸盐。合成过程受到微波功率、燃料与氧化剂比例和照射时间等因素的影响，这些因素决定了产品的纯度和组成。粉末通过傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、X射线衍射分析（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和磁性测量进行了表征。FTIR光谱显示了CrO和AgO键的存在，而XRD图案则表明形成了六方结构，并且由于掺杂剂的存在出现了额外的峰。TEM图像显示了大小在78至2026 nm范围内的颗粒形成。通过分析磁性性质，发现由于银的非磁性性质，饱和磁化率有所增加。使用的合成方法影响了催化剂的结构特性和磁性能。
