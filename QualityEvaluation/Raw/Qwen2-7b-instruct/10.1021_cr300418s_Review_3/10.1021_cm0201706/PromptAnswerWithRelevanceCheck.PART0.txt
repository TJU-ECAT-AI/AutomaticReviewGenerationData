1. The combustion method utilizes a rapid heating of an aqueous solution that includes specific metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. The temperature spikes to approximately 1000°C for a brief duration, before rapidly cooling to 300°C within a minute. This contrasts with traditional methods such as coprecipitation and impregnation, where a precursor is heated over an extended period. This prolonged heating can lead to the separation of stable phases, CuO and CeO2, and only some of the Cu2+ ions might integrate into the CeO2 lattice.

2. The key outcomes of the current research are as follows. Firstly, catalytic processes reveal that the Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix exhibit greater reactivity compared to Cu2+ ions in CuO. Secondly, Rietveld refinement validates the creation of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ in Cu/CeO2 catalysts and confirms the absence of a CuO phase.

1. 燃烧法通过快速加热包含特定金属盐和基于肼的燃料的水溶液来进行。温度在大约1000°C的峰值持续短暂，然后在不到一分钟内迅速冷却至300°C。这与传统方法如共沉淀和浸渍形成对比，在这些方法中，前体需要长时间加热。长时间加热可能导致稳定相CuO和CeO2的分离，并且只有部分Cu2+离子可能进入CeO2晶格。

2. 当前研究的主要发现如下。首先，催化反应表明，CeO2矩阵中的Cu2+物种比CuO中的Cu2+更活跃。其次，里特维尔德精炼确认了Cu/CeO2催化剂中形成Ce1-xCuxO2-δ并证实了不存在CuO相。

Answer: The structure and chemical environment of copper (Cu) in copper/ceria (Cu/CeO2) catalysts synthesized through a solution combustion method were studied using various analytical techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 catalysts had a structure refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ, indicating the presence of a solid solution phase. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species within the ceria matrix. The extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that the coordination number around the Cu2+ ion was 3, with a distance of 1.96 Å, suggesting the presence of oxide ion vacancies around the Cu2+ ions. The second and third coordination shells were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at 3.15 Å, respectively, indicating the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages. This solid solution phase provides direct evidence for the stabilization of Cu2+ ions in the ceria lattice, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

答案：通过溶液燃烧法合成的铜/氧化铈（Cu/CeO2）催化剂的铜结构和化学环境，使用多种分析技术进行了研究。X射线衍射（XRD）分析显示，3和5原子%的Cu/CeO2催化剂具有Ce1-xCuxO2-δ组成的结构，表明存在固溶体相。电子顺磁共振（EPR）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）证实了铜2+物种存在于铈基质中。扩展X射线精细结构（EXAFS）光谱显示，Cu2+离子周围的协调数为3，距离为1.96 Å，表明周围存在氧离子空位。第二和第三协调壳层被归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+在2.92 Å处和Cu2+O2-Ce4+在3.15 Å处，这表明形成了Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体相，具有Cu2+OCe4+连接。这种固溶体相直接证明了铈基质中铜2+离子的稳定化，导致增强的催化活性。

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts typically involves mixing metal salts with a base or a precipitating agent in water. The mixture is then heated, causing the salts to react and form a precipitate. This precipitate is then usually washed, dried, and calcined to obtain the final doped ceria catalyst. The types of dopants commonly used include metals like lanthanum, samarium, and cerium, which can alter the electrical conductivity and redox properties of the ceria. Different preparation techniques, such as varying the temperature, pH, or the type of dopant, can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts.

For instance, in the example of Nb-doped ceria, the coprecipitation method might involve adding niobium nitrate to a ceria solution. By adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the ceria and niobium solutions, or the pH of the solution, the degree of Nb doping can be controlled, influencing the crystallinity, particle size, and redox behavior of the ceria. These factors in turn impact the n-butane combustion rates and activation energies of the catalyst. A higher Nb doping might lead to increased surface area and improved catalytic activity, while a lower doping might stabilize the structure and maintain a balance between reactivity and stability.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法通常涉及将金属盐与碱或沉淀剂混合在水中。然后加热混合物，导致盐类反应并形成沉淀物。通常，通过洗涤、干燥和煅烧来制备最终的掺杂氧化铈催化剂。常用的掺杂剂包括镧、钐和铈等金属，它们可以改变氧化铈的电导率和还原性。不同的制备技术，如改变温度、pH值或掺杂剂类型，会对最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能产生显著影响。

以铌掺杂氧化铈为例，沉淀法可能涉及向氧化铈溶液中添加铌硝酸盐。通过调整反应条件，如铈和铌溶液的浓度，或者溶液的pH值，可以控制铌掺杂的程度，从而影响氧化铈的结晶性、颗粒大小和还原行为。这些因素进而影响催化剂的正丁烷燃烧速率和活化能。较高的铌掺杂可能增加表面积并提高催化活性，而较低的掺杂可能稳定结构并维持活性与稳定性的平衡。

The combustion method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves rapidly heating an aqueous solution containing specific metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. This process leads to the formation of fine crystallites with a size range of 25-35 nm. In contrast to conventional methods like coprecipitation and impregnation, which may separate CuO and CeO2 phases and only incorporate some Cu2+ ions into the CeO2 lattice, the combustion method results in a more homogeneous distribution of Cu2+ ions. The formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution with oxide ion vacancies is evident from Rietveld refinement. Cu is found to be in the +2 oxidation state in the catalysts, and the presence of an oxide ion vacancy is confirmed. The H2 uptake and cyclic voltammetry studies indicate that the Cu/CeO2 catalysts exhibit a promoting effect, reducing the redox potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix. The direct Cu2+O2-Ce4+ correlation at 3.15 Å supports the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution. The synergistic involvement of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple is responsible for the decrease in the redox potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix.

燃烧法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂涉及快速加热包含特定金属盐和基于肼的燃料的水溶液。这个过程导致形成大小范围在25-35纳米的细晶粒。与传统的共沉淀和浸渍等方法相比，这些方法可能会分离出CuO和CeO2相，并仅将部分Cu2+离子引入到CeO2晶格中，燃烧法能够实现更均匀的Cu2+离子分布。从里特维尔德精炼可以看出，形成了Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体，其中含有氧离子空位。通过电子自旋共振和X射线光电子能谱研究发现，Cu在催化剂中的氧化态为+2价，并且存在氧离子空位。H2吸附和循环伏安法研究表明，Cu/CeO2催化剂表现出促进效应，降低了CeO2矩阵中Cu2+离子的还原电势。直接的Cu2+O2-Ce4+相关性在3.15 Å处支持Ce1-xCuxO2-δ类型固溶体的形成。Ce4+/Ce3+还原对的协同作用是导致CeO2矩阵中Cu2+离子还原电势降低的原因。
