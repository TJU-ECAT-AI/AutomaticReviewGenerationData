<p>The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels.</p>
<p>During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min.</p>
<p>In the conventional methods of Cu/CeO2 preparation such as coprecipitation and impregnation, a precursor is heated for a long period of time, which may lead to separation of the thermodynamically stable phases CuO and CeO2, and only some of the Cu2+ ions taken may get into the CeO2 lattice.</p>

The combustion method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves rapidly heating an aqueous solution containing specific metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. This process leads to the formation of fine crystallites with a size range of 25-35 nm. In contrast to conventional methods like coprecipitation and impregnation, which may separate CuO and CeO2 phases and only incorporate some Cu2+ ions into the CeO2 lattice, the combustion method results in a more homogeneous distribution of Cu2+ ions. The formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution with oxide ion vacancies is evident from Rietveld refinement. Cu is found to be in the +2 oxidation state in the catalysts, and the presence of an oxide ion vacancy is confirmed. The H2 uptake and cyclic voltammetry studies indicate that the Cu/CeO2 catalysts exhibit a promoting effect, reducing the redox potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix. The direct Cu2+O2-Ce4+ correlation at 3.15 Å supports the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution. The synergistic involvement of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple is responsible for the decrease in the redox potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix.

燃烧法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂涉及快速加热包含特定金属盐和基于肼的燃料的水溶液。这个过程导致形成大小范围在25-35纳米的细晶粒。与传统的共沉淀和浸渍等方法相比，这些方法可能会分离出CuO和CeO2相，并仅将部分Cu2+离子引入到CeO2晶格中，燃烧法能够实现更均匀的Cu2+离子分布。从里特维尔德精炼可以看出，形成了Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体，其中含有氧离子空位。通过电子自旋共振和X射线光电子能谱研究发现，Cu在催化剂中的氧化态为+2价，并且存在氧离子空位。H2吸附和循环伏安法研究表明，Cu/CeO2催化剂表现出促进效应，降低了CeO2矩阵中Cu2+离子的还原电势。直接的Cu2+O2-Ce4+相关性在3.15 Å处支持Ce1-xCuxO2-δ类型固溶体的形成。Ce4+/Ce3+还原对的协同作用是导致CeO2矩阵中Cu2+离子还原电势降低的原因。
