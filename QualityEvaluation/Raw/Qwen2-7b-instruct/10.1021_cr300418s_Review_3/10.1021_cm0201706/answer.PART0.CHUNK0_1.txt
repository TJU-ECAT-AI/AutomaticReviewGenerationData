[1] "The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels."
[2] "During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min."
[3] "In the conventional methods of Cu/CeO2 preparation such as coprecipitation and impregnation, a precursor is heated for a long period of time, which may lead to separation of the thermodynamically stable phases CuO and CeO2, and only some of the Cu2+ ions taken may get into the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "The salient findings in the present investigation are as follows. (1) Catalytic reactions show that the Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix is more active than Cu2+ in the CuO matrix. (2) Rietveld refinement confirms the formation of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ in Cu/CeO2 and the absence of a CuO phase."

1. The combustion method utilizes a rapid heating of an aqueous solution that includes specific metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. The temperature spikes to approximately 1000°C for a brief duration, before rapidly cooling to 300°C within a minute. This contrasts with traditional methods such as coprecipitation and impregnation, where a precursor is heated over an extended period. This prolonged heating can lead to the separation of stable phases, CuO and CeO2, and only some of the Cu2+ ions might integrate into the CeO2 lattice.

2. The key outcomes of the current research are as follows. Firstly, catalytic processes reveal that the Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix exhibit greater reactivity compared to Cu2+ ions in CuO. Secondly, Rietveld refinement validates the creation of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ in Cu/CeO2 catalysts and confirms the absence of a CuO phase.

1. 燃烧法通过快速加热包含特定金属盐和基于肼的燃料的水溶液来进行。温度在大约1000°C的峰值持续短暂，然后在不到一分钟内迅速冷却至300°C。这与传统方法如共沉淀和浸渍形成对比，在这些方法中，前体需要长时间加热。长时间加热可能导致稳定相CuO和CeO2的分离，并且只有部分Cu2+离子可能进入CeO2晶格。

2. 当前研究的主要发现如下。首先，催化反应表明，CeO2矩阵中的Cu2+物种比CuO中的Cu2+更活跃。其次，里特维尔德精炼确认了Cu/CeO2催化剂中形成Ce1-xCuxO2-δ并证实了不存在CuO相。
