Answer: The structure and chemical environment of copper (Cu) in copper/ceria (Cu/CeO2) catalysts synthesized through a solution combustion method were studied using various analytical techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 catalysts had a structure refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ, indicating the presence of a solid solution phase. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species within the ceria matrix. The extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that the coordination number around the Cu2+ ion was 3, with a distance of 1.96 Å, suggesting the presence of oxide ion vacancies around the Cu2+ ions. The second and third coordination shells were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at 3.15 Å, respectively, indicating the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages. This solid solution phase provides direct evidence for the stabilization of Cu2+ ions in the ceria lattice, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

答案：通过溶液燃烧法合成的铜/氧化铈（Cu/CeO2）催化剂的铜结构和化学环境，使用多种分析技术进行了研究。X射线衍射（XRD）分析显示，3和5原子%的Cu/CeO2催化剂具有Ce1-xCuxO2-δ组成的结构，表明存在固溶体相。电子顺磁共振（EPR）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）证实了铜2+物种存在于铈基质中。扩展X射线精细结构（EXAFS）光谱显示，Cu2+离子周围的协调数为3，距离为1.96 Å，表明周围存在氧离子空位。第二和第三协调壳层被归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+在2.92 Å处和Cu2+O2-Ce4+在3.15 Å处，这表明形成了Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体相，具有Cu2+OCe4+连接。这种固溶体相直接证明了铈基质中铜2+离子的稳定化，导致增强的催化活性。
