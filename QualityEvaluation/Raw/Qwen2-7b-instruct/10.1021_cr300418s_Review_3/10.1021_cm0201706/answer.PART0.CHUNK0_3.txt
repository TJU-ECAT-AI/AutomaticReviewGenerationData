[1] "The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels."
[2] "During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min."
[3] "In the conventional methods of Cu/CeO2 preparation such as coprecipitation and impregnation, a precursor is heated for a long period of time, which may lead to separation of the thermodynamically stable phases CuO and CeO2, and only some of the Cu2+ ions taken may get into the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "In combustion synthesized Cu/CeO2, either the Cu2+ ions should get separated into copper oxide species from the support or the Cu2+ ions should get incorporated into the ceria lattice."
[5] "For charge balancing, oxide ion vacancies are created."
[6] "The decrease of the redox potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix is due to synergistic involvement of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts typically involves mixing metal salts with a base or a precipitating agent in water. The mixture is then heated, causing the salts to react and form a precipitate. This precipitate is then usually washed, dried, and calcined to obtain the final doped ceria catalyst. The types of dopants commonly used include metals like lanthanum, samarium, and cerium, which can alter the electrical conductivity and redox properties of the ceria. Different preparation techniques, such as varying the temperature, pH, or the type of dopant, can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts.

For instance, in the example of Nb-doped ceria, the coprecipitation method might involve adding niobium nitrate to a ceria solution. By adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the ceria and niobium solutions, or the pH of the solution, the degree of Nb doping can be controlled, influencing the crystallinity, particle size, and redox behavior of the ceria. These factors in turn impact the n-butane combustion rates and activation energies of the catalyst. A higher Nb doping might lead to increased surface area and improved catalytic activity, while a lower doping might stabilize the structure and maintain a balance between reactivity and stability.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法通常涉及将金属盐与碱或沉淀剂混合在水中。然后加热混合物，导致盐类反应并形成沉淀物。通常，通过洗涤、干燥和煅烧来制备最终的掺杂氧化铈催化剂。常用的掺杂剂包括镧、钐和铈等金属，它们可以改变氧化铈的电导率和还原性。不同的制备技术，如改变温度、pH值或掺杂剂类型，会对最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能产生显著影响。

以铌掺杂氧化铈为例，沉淀法可能涉及向氧化铈溶液中添加铌硝酸盐。通过调整反应条件，如铈和铌溶液的浓度，或者溶液的pH值，可以控制铌掺杂的程度，从而影响氧化铈的结晶性、颗粒大小和还原行为。这些因素进而影响催化剂的正丁烷燃烧速率和活化能。较高的铌掺杂可能增加表面积并提高催化活性，而较低的掺杂可能稳定结构并维持活性与稳定性的平衡。
