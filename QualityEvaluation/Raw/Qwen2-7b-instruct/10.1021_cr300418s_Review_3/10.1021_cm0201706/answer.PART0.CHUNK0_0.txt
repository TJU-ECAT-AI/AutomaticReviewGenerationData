1. The combustion method utilizes an aqueous solution with stoichiometric metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. The process reaches temperatures up to 1000°C for about 30-60 seconds before cooling rapidly to 300°C within a minute. 

2. In the synthesis of Cu/CeO2 catalysts via combustion, Cu2+ ions can either separate into copper oxide species or incorporate into the ceria lattice.

3. Rietveld analysis reveals the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ structure with oxide ion vacancies in the catalysts.

4. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate that Cu is in the +2 oxidation state in the catalysts.

5. The XANES spectra of the catalysts exhibit a Cu2+ species similar to Cu2+ ions.

6. The stabilization of Cu2+ ions in the Ce4+ site results in the creation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution.

7. The reduction potential of Cu2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix decreases due to the synergy between the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple.
