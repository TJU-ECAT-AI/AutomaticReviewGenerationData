The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron. The solution is then vaporized, dried using microwave technology, and calcined at 700°C for four hours in air. Different molar ratios of Fe to Ce are used to create Ce1 xFe xO2 mixed oxide catalysts. These catalysts were evaluated for their catalytic activity in methane combustion and their structure and reductive properties were characterized using XRD, BET, DRS, and TPR. When a small amount of Fe is doped into CeO2, a solid solution forms. The catalytic activity of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is notably higher, with a lower conversion temperature for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2. The apparent activation energy for this system is slightly lower, indicating higher activity.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及向铈和铁的混合硝酸盐溶液中添加柠檬酸。溶液随后被蒸发，通过微波技术干燥，并在700°C下空气气氛中煅烧四小时。使用不同的铈铁摩尔比制备了Ce1 xFe xO2混合氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂用于甲烷燃烧催化反应的研究，并通过XRD、BET、DRS和TPR对其结构和还原性进行了表征。当少量Fe掺入到CeO2中时，会形成固溶体。Ce0.9Fe0.1O2的催化活性显著较高，与纯CeO2相比，其甲烷燃烧转化温度更低。该系统的显热活化能略低，表明活性更高。
