The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron, vaporizing the solution at 80°C under stirring, drying it by microwave, and then calcining it at 700°C for 4 hours in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained through the same process. The prepared Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides show higher catalytic activity in methane combustion, particularly for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The structure and reductive properties of these catalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The data reveals that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides are mesoporous materials. When the Fe content is below 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. Mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 exist when the Fe content exceeds 0.2. These solid solutions demonstrate higher activity for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The specific surface area decreases with an increase in Fe content, indicating that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide has a higher specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution when a small amount of Fe is doped. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity. The catalytic combustion performance of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts is shown in Figure 5, displaying improved activity compared to single Fe2O3 or CeO2 catalysts. The temperatures for 10% and 90% methane conversion over Ce0.9Fe0.12 are 388°C and 550°C, respectively.

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding a significant amount of citric acid solid powder to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron. This mixture is then vaporized at 80°C under stirring, dried by microwave, and calcined at 700°C for 4 hours in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained through the same process. Mesoporous materials with pore sizes typically around 250 nm, featuring high surface area and moderate pore structure, are advantageous for adsorption, diffusion, and reaction of organic molecules on catalyst surfaces. When x = 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1 x Fex O2 solid solutions. These solid solutions display higher activity for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2, particularly for Ce0.9 Fe0.1 O2. As the Fe content increases, the specific surface area of Ce1 x Fex O2 mixed oxides decreases from 38.4 to 5.1 m2/g, while the pore size distribution narrows and centers at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity.

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron. The solution is then vaporized, dried using microwave technology, and calcined at 700°C for four hours in air. Different molar ratios of Fe to Ce are used to create Ce1 xFe xO2 mixed oxide catalysts. These catalysts were evaluated for their catalytic activity in methane combustion and their structure and reductive properties were characterized using XRD, BET, DRS, and TPR. When a small amount of Fe is doped into CeO2, a solid solution forms. The catalytic activity of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is notably higher, with a lower conversion temperature for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2. The apparent activation energy for this system is slightly lower, indicating higher activity.
