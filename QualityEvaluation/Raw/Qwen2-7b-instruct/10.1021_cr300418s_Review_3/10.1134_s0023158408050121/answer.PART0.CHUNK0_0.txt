The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron, vaporizing the solution at 80°C under stirring, drying it by microwave, and then calcining it at 700°C for 4 hours in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained through the same process. The prepared Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides show higher catalytic activity in methane combustion, particularly for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The structure and reductive properties of these catalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The data reveals that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides are mesoporous materials. When the Fe content is below 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. Mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 exist when the Fe content exceeds 0.2. These solid solutions demonstrate higher activity for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The specific surface area decreases with an increase in Fe content, indicating that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide has a higher specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution when a small amount of Fe is doped. The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity. The catalytic combustion performance of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts is shown in Figure 5, displaying improved activity compared to single Fe2O3 or CeO2 catalysts. The temperatures for 10% and 90% methane conversion over Ce0.9Fe0.12 are 388°C and 550°C, respectively.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法包括将柠檬酸加入铈和铁的混合硝酸盐溶液中，然后在80°C下搅拌蒸发溶液，使用微波干燥，并在空气中进行4小时的煅烧。单个CeO2和Fe2O3催化剂通过同样的过程获得。准备的Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物在甲烷燃烧中的催化活性更高，特别是对于Ce0.9Fe0.1O2。这些催化剂的结构和还原性质通过X射线衍射(XRD)、布伦阿-埃姆特-泰勒(BET)表面积分析、漫反射光谱(DRS)和温度程序化还原(TPR)进行表征。数据显示，Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物是介孔材料。当Fe含量低于0.2时，过渡金属Fe会整合到CeO2晶格中形成立方Ce1  xFexO2固溶体。当Fe含量超过0.2时，存在立方Ce1  xFexO2固溶体和α-Fe2O3的混合相。这些固溶体在甲烷燃烧中的活性比纯CeO2高，尤其是Ce0.9Fe0.1O2。随着Fe含量的增加，特定表面积下降，表明当少量Fe被掺杂时，Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物具有更高的特定表面积和狭窄的孔径分布。Ce0.9Fe0.1O2的孔径分布窄且集中在6.3nm，表明纹理均匀性。图5展示了Ce1  xFexO2混合氧化物催化剂的催化燃烧性能，显示与单个Fe2O3或CeO2催化剂相比有改进的活性。Ce0.9Fe0.12的10%和90%甲烷转化温度分别为388°C和550°C。
