The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid solid powder to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron, vaporizing the solution at 80°C, drying it with a microwave, and then calcining it at 700°C in air. Single CeO

The specific surface area of the mixed oxides decreases with an increase in Fe content, suggesting that a small amount of Fe doping leads to a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution. The catalytic performance of these materials is confirmed by testing them in methane combustion reactions, where they show excellent activity with minimal CO formation and high CO2 selectivity.
