The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding a significant amount of citric acid solid powder to a mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron. This mixture is then vaporized at 80°C under stirring, dried by microwave, and calcined at 700°C for 4 hours in air. Single CeO2 and Fe2O3 catalysts are obtained through the same process. Mesoporous materials with pore sizes typically around 250 nm, featuring high surface area and moderate pore structure, are advantageous for adsorption, diffusion, and reaction of organic molecules on catalyst surfaces. When x = 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporates into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1 x Fex O2 solid solutions. These solid solutions display higher activity for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2, particularly for Ce0.9 Fe0.1 O2. As the Fe content increases, the specific surface area of Ce1 x Fex O2 mixed oxides decreases from 38.4 to 5.1 m2/g, while the pore size distribution narrows and centers at 6.3 nm, indicating texture uniformity. Ce1 x Fex O2 solid solutions demonstrate higher methane combustion activity than pure CeO2, and the slightly lower activation energy measured for Ce0.9 Fe0.1 O2 signifies its enhanced activity.

合成掺杂铈氧化物催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及向铈和铁混合硝酸盐溶液中添加大量柠檬酸固体粉末。然后将该混合物在80°C下蒸馏并搅拌，使用微波干燥，并在空气中于700°C下煅烧4小时。通过相同的过程可以得到单个CeO2和Fe2O3催化剂。孔径通常约为250nm的介孔材料，具有高表面积和适度孔结构，对于催化剂表面的有机分子吸附、扩散和反应具有优势。当x=0.2时，过渡金属Fe会融入CeO2晶格中形成立方Ce1 x Fex O2固溶体。这些固溶体在甲烷燃烧活性方面比纯CeO2更高，特别是Ce0.9 Fe0.1 O2。随着Fe含量的增加，Ce1 x Fex O2混合氧化物的表面积从38.4减少到5.1 m2/g，而孔径分布变窄且中心位于6.3 nm，表明纹理均匀性。Ce1 x Fex O2固溶体在甲烷燃烧活性方面比纯CeO2更高，并且测量到的Ce0.9 Fe0.1 O2的稍微较低活化能表明其活性更高。
