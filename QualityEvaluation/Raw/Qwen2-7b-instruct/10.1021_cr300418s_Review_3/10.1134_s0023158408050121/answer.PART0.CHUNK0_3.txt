[1] "Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by the citric acid sol-gel method."
[2] "An appreciable amount of citric acid solid powder was added to the mixed nitrate solution of cerium and iron."
[3] "The mixed solution was then vaporized at 80°C under stirring, dried by microwave, and calcined at 700°C for 4 h in air."
[4] "Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by the citric acid sol-gel method and the microwave technique."
[5] "The activities of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides on methane combustion were investigated, and the structure and reductive properties were characterized by XRD, BET, DRS, and TPR."
[6] "The pore sizes of mesoporous materials are usually 250 nm; they have high surface area and moderate pore structure, which are advantageous to the adsorption, diffusion, and reaction of organic molecules on surfaces of catalyst."
[7] "When x 0.2, the transition metal Fe incorporated into the lattice of CeO2 to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions, and mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 existed when x > 0.2."
[8] "Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions show higher activity for methane combustion than pure CeO2, especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2."
[9] "The pore size distribution of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm indicating the texture uniformity of this sample."
[10] "The specific surface area of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides decreased from 38.4 to 5.1 m2/g with an increase in the Fe content, which indicates that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide has a higher specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution when a small amount of Fe was doped."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves adding citric acid to a mixed nitrate solution containing cerium and iron. The solution is then vaporized at 80°C under stirring, dried using microwave technology, and calcined at 700°C for 4 hours in air. When the iron content is less than 0.2, it incorporates into the lattice of ceria to form cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. At higher iron contents, mixed phases of cubic Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions and α-Fe2O3 exist. These doped ceria catalysts show higher activity for methane combustion compared to pure CeO2, particularly in the case of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. The pore size distribution is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2, indicating a uniform texture. The specific surface area decreases with an increase in iron content, suggesting that a small amount of Fe doping leads to a higher specific surface area and narrower pore size distribution. The structure and reductive properties of these catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的方法是将柠檬酸添加到含有铈和铁的混合硝酸盐溶液中。溶液随后在80°C下蒸馏并搅拌，使用微波技术干燥，并在700°C下空气气氛中煅烧4小时。当铁含量小于0.2时，它会融入铈的晶格形成立方体Ce1  xFexO2固溶体。在更高的铁含量下，立方体Ce1  xFexO2固溶体与α-Fe2O3存在混合相。这些掺杂的铈催化剂对甲烷燃烧表现出比纯CeO2更高的活性，特别是对于Ce0.9Fe0.1O2。孔径分布狭窄且集中在6.3 nm，表明样品具有均匀的纹理。随着铁含量的增加，特定表面积降低，这表明少量Fe掺杂导致更高的特定表面积和更窄的孔径分布。这些催化剂的结构和还原性质通过X射线衍射(XRD)、布鲁厄特-埃姆特-塔勒(BET)分析、漫反射光谱(DRS)和温度程序还原(TPR)进行表征。
