<p>The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde on well-ordered thin V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place.</p>
<p>On reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed.</p>
<p>Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups since otherwise methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K.</p>
<p>Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime.</p>
<p>If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, which finally stabilizes a layer of methoxy.</p>

The coprecipitation method involves mixing metal salts in an aqueous solution at a specific pH to form a precipitate. This precipitate is then washed, dried, and煅烧 to obtain the desired doped ceria catalyst. Different dopants, such as Nb, can significantly alter the structural properties and catalytic performance. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the preparation technique affects the catalyst's structure, potentially influencing its combustion rate of n-butane and activation energy. Higher temperatures during the calcination process can lead to better dispersion of the dopant within the ceria matrix, improving the catalyst's efficiency.

沉淀法涉及将金属盐在特定pH值的水溶液中混合以形成沉淀物。然后对沉淀物进行洗涤、干燥和煅烧以获得所需的掺杂铈催化剂。不同的掺杂剂，如Nb，可以显著改变结构特性和催化性能。对于Nb掺杂的铈催化剂而言，制备技术影响催化剂的结构，可能会影响其n-丁烷燃烧速率和活化能。煅烧过程中的更高温度可以促进掺杂剂在铈基体内的更好分散，从而提高催化剂的效率。
