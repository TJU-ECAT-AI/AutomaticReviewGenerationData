[1] "The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated."
[2] "On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place."
[3] "On reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K."
[4] "Other reaction products were not observed."
[5] "Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups."
[6] "Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime."
[7] "If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, which finally stabilises a layer of methoxy."
[8] "STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage."

The research focused on the partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111). Methanol adsorbs only in molecular form on non-reduced surfaces, resulting in no formaldehyde production. However, on reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups which react to produce formaldehyde within the temperature range of 400 K to 550 K. No other reaction products were observed. Methoxy groups can be stabilized at room temperature if the surface lacks hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl groups can also combine to form water, which likely desorbs within the same temperature range. When substantial amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation eliminates all hydroxyl groups, stabilizing a layer of methoxy. STM images revealed that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows, which increase upon methanol dosage. Numerical simulations incorporating both the methoxy and hydroxyl group reactions to form methanol and the simultaneous combination of OH groups to form water were conducted. Density Functional Theory (DFT) supported the experimental outcomes.

研究集中在甲醇在V2O5(001)薄膜上的部分氧化，这些薄膜被支撑在Au(111)上。甲醇仅以分子形式吸附在未处理的表面上，因此没有形成甲醛。然而，在处理过的表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些甲氧基团在400 K到550 K的温度范围内反应生成甲醛。没有观察到其他产物。在室温下，如果表面缺少羟基团，甲氧基团可以稳定存在。羟基团也可以结合形成水，这可能在相同的温度范围内脱附。当大量甲醇在室温下给药时，水形成会消除所有羟基团，最终稳定一层甲氧基。STM图像显示，由于甲氧基的形成，表面缺陷的密度降低，除了垂直于二价钒双行的对缺陷，其密度在甲醇剂量增加后增加。进行了数值模拟，包括甲氧基和羟基团反应形成甲醛以及同时组合OH团形成水的过程。密度泛函理论（DFT）支持实验结果。

[4] "The most stable adsorption geometries of molecular water on a single defect and the hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociation of this water molecule are illustrated in Fig. 10A and 10B. The binding energies are 0.64 eV (molecular) and 0.44 eV (dissociated) which means that hydroxyl groups on the surface will react to form water as soon as the temperature is high enough to overcome the energy barriers associated with water formation."

1. The paper discusses the conduction pathway for protons in nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia, focusing on the physical chemistry of solid materials.

2. The study investigates the partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111). Reduced surfaces are shown to produce formaldehyde, whereas bulk-terminated surfaces are not reactive.

3. The adsorption process on the V2O5(001) surface is modeled through a set of differential equations that describe the changes in methoxy and hydroxyl coverage with time. These equations incorporate the sticking coefficient, the flux of methanol molecules, and the energy barriers for recombination and combination reactions.

4. The most stable configurations for water adsorption on a single defect and the resulting hydroxyl groups are depicted in Figures 10A and 10B. The binding energies for molecular water are 0.64 eV, while dissociated water has a lower binding energy of 0.44 eV. This indicates that hydroxyl groups on the surface react to form water at temperatures that overcome the energy barriers for water formation.

1. 该论文探讨了在钇稳定四方锆石纳米晶中的质子传导路径，重点在于固体材料的物理化学性质。

2. 研究对甲醇在Au(111)支持下的有序V2O5(001)薄膜上的部分氧化进行了研究。结果显示，还原表面能够产生甲醛，而本体终止表面则不反应。

3. 对于V2O5(001)表面的吸附过程通过一组描述了时间和覆盖度变化的微分方程进行建模。这些方程考虑了粘附系数、甲醇分子的通量以及重组和组合反应的能量壁垒。

4. 图10A和图10B展示了单缺陷上分子水的最稳定吸附构型及其产生的羟基团。分子水的结合能为0.64 eV，而解离水的结合能更低，为0.44 eV。这表明表面的羟基团在温度足够高以克服水形成能量壁垒时会反应形成水。

The coprecipitation method involves mixing metal salts in an aqueous solution at a specific pH to form a precipitate. This precipitate is then washed, dried, and煅烧 to obtain the desired doped ceria catalyst. Different dopants, such as Nb, can significantly alter the structural properties and catalytic performance. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the preparation technique affects the catalyst's structure, potentially influencing its combustion rate of n-butane and activation energy. Higher temperatures during the calcination process can lead to better dispersion of the dopant within the ceria matrix, improving the catalyst's efficiency.
