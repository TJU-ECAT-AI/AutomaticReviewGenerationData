The research focused on the partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111). Methanol adsorbs only in molecular form on non-reduced surfaces, resulting in no formaldehyde production. However, on reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups which react to produce formaldehyde within the temperature range of 400 K to 550 K. No other reaction products were observed. Methoxy groups can be stabilized at room temperature if the surface lacks hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl groups can also combine to form water, which likely desorbs within the same temperature range. When substantial amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation eliminates all hydroxyl groups, stabilizing a layer of methoxy. STM images revealed that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows, which increase upon methanol dosage. Numerical simulations incorporating both the methoxy and hydroxyl group reactions to form methanol and the simultaneous combination of OH groups to form water were conducted. Density Functional Theory (DFT) supported the experimental outcomes.

研究集中在甲醇在V2O5(001)薄膜上的部分氧化，这些薄膜被支撑在Au(111)上。甲醇仅以分子形式吸附在未处理的表面上，因此没有形成甲醛。然而，在处理过的表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些甲氧基团在400 K到550 K的温度范围内反应生成甲醛。没有观察到其他产物。在室温下，如果表面缺少羟基团，甲氧基团可以稳定存在。羟基团也可以结合形成水，这可能在相同的温度范围内脱附。当大量甲醇在室温下给药时，水形成会消除所有羟基团，最终稳定一层甲氧基。STM图像显示，由于甲氧基的形成，表面缺陷的密度降低，除了垂直于二价钒双行的对缺陷，其密度在甲醇剂量增加后增加。进行了数值模拟，包括甲氧基和羟基团反应形成甲醛以及同时组合OH团形成水的过程。密度泛函理论（DFT）支持实验结果。
