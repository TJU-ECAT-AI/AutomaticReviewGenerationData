[4] "The most stable adsorption geometries of molecular water on a single defect and the hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociation of this water molecule are illustrated in Fig. 10A and 10B. The binding energies are 0.64 eV (molecular) and 0.44 eV (dissociated) which means that hydroxyl groups on the surface will react to form water as soon as the temperature is high enough to overcome the energy barriers associated with water formation."

1. The paper discusses the conduction pathway for protons in nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia, focusing on the physical chemistry of solid materials.

2. The study investigates the partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111). Reduced surfaces are shown to produce formaldehyde, whereas bulk-terminated surfaces are not reactive.

3. The adsorption process on the V2O5(001) surface is modeled through a set of differential equations that describe the changes in methoxy and hydroxyl coverage with time. These equations incorporate the sticking coefficient, the flux of methanol molecules, and the energy barriers for recombination and combination reactions.

4. The most stable configurations for water adsorption on a single defect and the resulting hydroxyl groups are depicted in Figures 10A and 10B. The binding energies for molecular water are 0.64 eV, while dissociated water has a lower binding energy of 0.44 eV. This indicates that hydroxyl groups on the surface react to form water at temperatures that overcome the energy barriers for water formation.

1. 该论文探讨了在钇稳定四方锆石纳米晶中的质子传导路径，重点在于固体材料的物理化学性质。

2. 研究对甲醇在Au(111)支持下的有序V2O5(001)薄膜上的部分氧化进行了研究。结果显示，还原表面能够产生甲醛，而本体终止表面则不反应。

3. 对于V2O5(001)表面的吸附过程通过一组描述了时间和覆盖度变化的微分方程进行建模。这些方程考虑了粘附系数、甲醇分子的通量以及重组和组合反应的能量壁垒。

4. 图10A和图10B展示了单缺陷上分子水的最稳定吸附构型及其产生的羟基团。分子水的结合能为0.64 eV，而解离水的结合能更低，为0.44 eV。这表明表面的羟基团在温度足够高以克服水形成能量壁垒时会反应形成水。
