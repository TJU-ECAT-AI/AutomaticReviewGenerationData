[1] "Perhaps the most mentioned specific topic in the main part of the text is the Americans with Disabilities Act, mostly in the form of anecdotes about the politics of crafting and passing this legislation."
[2] "There are many other important issues for rehabilitation counseling that the book introduces, however, and these represent good opportunities for problem-based learning activities, class discussions, or research projects."
[3] "The book has no name or subject indexes. Appendix C is the only section of the book that has a reference list, and it consists of legal citations."
[4] "Although the text is generally well written and edited, there are some unfortunate errors. Ralf Hotchkiss, who is briefly mentioned only once, is listed (p. 51) as Ralph Hodgkins, a seemingly minuscule mistake that still could lead a student who is doing a Web-based or bibliographic name search to a dead end rather than to the available information about this trail-blazing rehabilitation engineer and disability change agent."
