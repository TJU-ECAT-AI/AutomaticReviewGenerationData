[1] "The coprecipitation method involves the simultaneous precipitation of the desired metal and the support material from a homogeneous solution. This process can be varied by adjusting parameters such as pH, temperature, and the concentration of the metal precursor."
[2] "Typical dopants used in this context include elements like Nb, La, Ce, and Ti. These dopants can alter the surface area, acidity, and basicity of the support material, affecting the catalyst's activity."
[3] "Different preparation techniques can significantly impact the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the synthesis of Nb-doped ceria might involve various routes, such as the sol-gel method or the incipient wetness method, each potentially leading to distinct microstructures."
[4] "The impact on n-butane combustion rates and activation energies can be profound. For example, the introduction of Nb doping into ceria can enhance the combustion efficiency by improving the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction, lowering the activation energy required for combustion."

The literature discusses the use of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis for probing the local structure and identifying active species of palladium (Pd) supported on various materials, including aluminum oxide (Al2O3), niobia, lanthanum aluminum oxide (LaAl2O3), zeolites, and carbon materials. This technique has been extensively applied in recent years to understand the properties and catalytic activities of Pd supported catalysts.

It is stated that in the past few years, EXAFS analysis has been used to extensively probe the local structure and identify the active species of Pd supported on various materials. The text highlights that this technique is crucial for understanding the behavior and performance of dispersed metal catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. It also mentions that Pd-based catalysts are active for reactions such as NO reduction and CO and hydrocarbon oxidation, and that the presence of Pd in the lattice of ceria-based catalysts has been shown to enhance methane combustion activity.

The study focuses on the structure, electronic structure, and chemical properties of a Pd/CeO2 catalyst prepared by the solution-combustion method. The catalyst is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and EXAFS spectroscopy. The XRD analysis reveals the absence of diffraction lines corresponding to Pd or PdO, suggesting the formation of a solid solution of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ. XPS studies confirm that Pd is in a highly ionic +2 state, while EXAFS analysis shows that Pd2+ ions are substituted for Ce4+ sites with oxide ion vacancies around Pd2+ ions. The authors propose that the Pd2+ ions stabilize in the Ce4+ site, leading to a strong PdCeO2 interaction, forming a Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages.

The EXAFS analysis further suggests that the Pd2+ ions are incorporated into the CeO2 lattice, creating oxide ion vacancies. This is supported by the fact that the coordination number of Pd is lower than in PdO, indicating the presence of oxide ion vacancies around Pd2+ ions. The authors conclude that the higher catalytic activity of the combustion-synthesized 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation is attributed to the interaction of Pd2+ ions with the CeO2 support, which can now serve as an oxygen-exchange site due to the oxide ion vacancies.

In summary, the EXAFS analysis plays a crucial role in elucidating the local structure, chemical state, and interactions of Pd in various supported catalysts, providing insights into their catalytic performance and enhancing the design of more efficient catalysts.

文献讨论了扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析在研究Pd在各种材料上的局部结构以及识别活性物种中的应用，包括铝氧化物（Al2O3）、niobia、镧铝氧化物（LaAl2O3）、沸石和碳材料。这种技术在近年来得到了广泛的应用，以理解分散金属催化剂的性质和催化性能。

文献提到，在过去的几年里，EXAFS分析被用来广泛地探查Pd在不同材料上的局部结构并识别活性物种。文中强调，这项技术对于了解异质催化中分散金属催化剂的行为和性能至关重要。它还指出，基于Pd在氧化铈基催化剂晶格中的存在能够增强甲烷燃烧活性的研究结果。

该研究聚焦于通过燃烧合成方法制备的Pd/CeO2催化剂的结构、电子结构和化学性质。催化剂通过X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和EXAFS光谱进行表征。XRD分析显示不存在Pd或PdO的衍射线，这表明形成了Ce1-xPdxO2-δ型固溶体。XPS研究表明，Pd处于高度离子化的+2状态，而EXAFS分析显示Pd2+离子取代了Ce4+位点，并且周围有氧离子空位。作者提出，Pd2+离子稳定在Ce4+位点，导致PdCeO2强相互作用，形成Ce1-xPdxO2-δ固溶体，具有Pd2+O2-Ce4+连接。

进一步的EXAFS分析表明，Pd2+离子被集成到CeO2晶格中，产生氧离子空位。这由Pd的配位数低于PdO的事实支持，表明Pd2+离子周围有氧离子空位。作者得出结论，燃烧合成的1 at. % Pd/CeO2催化剂的CO氧化活性较高是由于Pd2+离子与CeO2支持的相互作用，这导致由于氧离子空位而成为氧交换位点。

总之，EXAFS分析在揭示Pd在不同负载催化剂上的局部结构、化学状态和相互作用方面发挥着关键作用，提供了对它们催化性能的见解，并促进了更高效催化剂的设计。

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves combining cerium salts with dopants such as Nb in aqueous solutions to precipitate a ceramic material. The specific process variations can include the choice of dopant, the ratio of cerium salts to dopant, the pH of the solution, and the temperature and time of the precipitation. Different preparation techniques can significantly impact the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the use of Nb-doped ceria can enhance the catalytic performance in n-butane combustion due to the improved electronic and structural properties provided by the Nb dopant. The activation energies for the combustion process can be reduced, allowing for more efficient and faster reactions. This is because the Nb dopant modifies the surface area, porosity, and redox properties of the ceria, facilitating better oxygen storage and release capabilities, which are crucial for the combustion process.

Answer: The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts typically involves combining cerium salts with dopants such as Nb. This method allows for the precise control of the dopant concentration and the resulting structural properties of the ceria. Different preparation techniques, such as varying the pH of the solution or the temperature and time of precipitation, can lead to significant changes in the catalytic performance. For example, the use of Nb-doped ceria can improve the catalytic performance in n-butane combustion by enhancing the electronic and structural properties of the ceria. This leads to reduced activation energies for the combustion process, resulting in more efficient and faster reactions. The Nb dopant modifies the surface area, porosity, and redox properties of the ceria, improving its ability to store and release oxygen, which is essential for the combustion process.

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared by the solution-combustion method. The structure of the catalysts is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The high-resolution XRD pattern of the 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst does not show diffraction lines corresponding to Pd or PdO. Rietveld refinement suggests that the catalyst forms a solid solution of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ with 3 at. % Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+ sites, accompanied by oxide ion vacancies. XPS studies confirm that Pd is in a highly ionic +2 state in the CeO2 matrix. EXAFS analysis indicates that the average coordination number of Pd is 3 around the Pd2+ ion, and the second shell at 2.72 Å is due to PdPd correlation. The third shell at 3.31 Å is attributed to Pd2+Ce4+ correlation, suggesting the presence of PdOCe interactions. The document concludes that Pd2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix are the active sites for CO adsorption and leads to the higher catalytic activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst compared to Pd metal or PdO. The catalytic properties and structural characteristics of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts are influenced by the interaction between Pd2+ ions and the CeO2 support, leading to the formation of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages.

<p>In the past few years, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis has been used extensively for probing the local structure and identification of the active species of Pd supported on Al2O3, niobia, LaAl2O3, zeolite, and carbon materials. 25-31 It provides information on the local environment of Pd such as coordination number and the kind of neighboring atoms and their distances with respect to a particular atom.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that the structure and local chemical environment of Pd species in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst have been investigated. The main findings of our investigation are:</p>

The coprecipitation method involves the simultaneous precipitation of the desired metal and ceramic components from a solution, typically by adding a precipitating agent that causes the formation of a solid precipitate. The method allows for precise control over the stoichiometry and particle size of the resulting catalyst. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the coprecipitation process involves mixing cerium salts, sodium carbonate, and an appropriate molar ratio of niobium salt in aqueous solution. The pH is adjusted to induce precipitation, and the precipitate is then calcined to remove any remaining impurities and to obtain the desired chemical composition.

Different preparation techniques, such as coprecipitation versus sol-gel, have distinct impacts on the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. Coprecipitation tends to produce well-dispersed metal ions on the ceramic support, which can enhance the surface area and improve the interaction between the metal and support, leading to higher catalytic efficiency. The coprecipitated Nb-doped ceria would likely exhibit faster n-butane combustion rates and lower activation energies compared to sol-gel prepared samples due to the superior dispersion of Nb ions and better support-metal interaction.

The EXAFS analysis reveals that in the 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst, Pd2+ ions are substituted for Ce4+ sites with oxide ion vacancy around Pd2+ ion. This leads to a strong PdCeO2 interaction in the form of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages. The solid solution structure enhances the catalytic properties of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, particularly for CO oxidation and NO reduction reactions. The localized environment of Pd is characterized by a coordination number of 3 around the Pd2+ ion at a distance of 2.02 Å, which is distinct from the 4-coordinate structure in PdO. The presence of oxide ion vacancy around the Pd2+ ion facilitates the formation of an oxygen-exchange site, which is crucial for the catalytic activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst.

浸溶沉淀法是指将所需金属和陶瓷成分同时从溶液中沉淀出来，通常通过加入沉淀剂来诱导固体沉淀。这种方法允许对最终催化剂的组成和颗粒大小进行精确控制。对于铈铌掺杂氧化物，浸溶沉淀过程涉及混合铈盐、碳酸钠以及适当的铌盐水溶液。通过调整pH值来引发沉淀，然后通过煅烧去除任何残留杂质，以获得所需的化学组成。

不同的制备技术，如浸溶沉淀与溶胶法相比，对最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能产生显著影响。浸溶沉淀倾向于在陶瓷载体上均匀分散金属离子，这可以增加表面面积并改善金属与载体之间的相互作用，从而提高催化效率。与溶胶法制备的样品相比，浸溶沉淀法制备的铈铌掺杂氧化物可能表现出更快的丁烷燃烧速率和更低的活化能，这是由于更好的Nb离子分散和更好的支持-金属相互作用的结果。

EXAFS分析表明，在1 at. % Pd/CeO2催化剂中，Pd2+离子被Ce4+位点取代，并且周围存在氧离子空位。这导致在Ce1-xPdxO2-δ固溶体中形成强PdCeO2相互作用，具有Pd2+O2-Ce4+键合。这种固溶体结构增强了Pd/CeO2催化剂的催化性能，尤其是对于CO氧化和NO还原反应。Pd局部环境由Pd2+离子周围的协同数为3的原子组成，距离为2.02 Å，这与PdO中协同数为4的结构不同。周围存在的氧离子空位有助于形成一个氧交换位点，这是Pd/CeO2催化剂活性的关键因素。
