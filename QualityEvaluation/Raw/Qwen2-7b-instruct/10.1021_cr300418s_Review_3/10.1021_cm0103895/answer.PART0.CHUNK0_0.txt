[1] "The coprecipitation method involves the simultaneous precipitation of the desired metal and the support material from a homogeneous solution. This process can be varied by adjusting parameters such as pH, temperature, and the concentration of the metal precursor."
[2] "Typical dopants used in this context include elements like Nb, La, Ce, and Ti. These dopants can alter the surface area, acidity, and basicity of the support material, affecting the catalyst's activity."
[3] "Different preparation techniques can significantly impact the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the synthesis of Nb-doped ceria might involve various routes, such as the sol-gel method or the incipient wetness method, each potentially leading to distinct microstructures."
[4] "The impact on n-butane combustion rates and activation energies can be profound. For example, the introduction of Nb doping into ceria can enhance the combustion efficiency by improving the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction, lowering the activation energy required for combustion."

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的沉淀法是将所需金属和支撑材料同时从均相溶液中沉淀出来。可以通过调整pH、温度和金属前体浓度等参数来改变过程。常用的掺杂剂包括Nb、La、Ce和Ti，它们可以改变支撑材料的表面积、酸性和碱性，影响催化剂的性能。不同的制备技术，如溶胶-凝胶法或浸渍湿法，可能会导致截然不同的微观结构。例如，Nb掺杂的氧化铈可以增强丁烷燃烧效率，通过提高催化剂促进反应的能力并降低燃烧所需的活化能。
