<p>Recently, much attention has been focused on CeO2-based materials for their applications in automotive exhausts, oxygen storage capacity, and stabilization of dispersed metals.</p>
<p>Our recent study5 showed that Pd2+ ions are dispersed on CeO2, and catalytic activity of ionically dispersed Pd on CeO2 is much higher than dispersed Pd metal particles on Al2O3.</p>
<p>Substitution of Pd2+ ions for Ce4+ in nano CeO2 particles can lead to the highest possible dispersion for a given loading of Pd and higher chemical and structural stability of Pd2+ ions because of the oxygen bonded to Ce4+ ions in the CeO2 matrix.</p>
<p>The catalyst samples show three peaks in the FT spectra as can be seen from Figure 8. PdO has been used as the primary model for fitting of all the catalytic compounds.</p>
<p>The inverse transform of 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 is different from PdO phase especially in the k range of 1114 Å-1. The fitted curve assuming the Pd2+ ion in the CeO2 model agrees well with the experimental data.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared by the solution-combustion method. The structure of the catalysts is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The high-resolution XRD pattern of the 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst does not show diffraction lines corresponding to Pd or PdO. Rietveld refinement suggests that the catalyst forms a solid solution of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ with 3 at. % Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+ sites, accompanied by oxide ion vacancies. XPS studies confirm that Pd is in a highly ionic +2 state in the CeO2 matrix. EXAFS analysis indicates that the average coordination number of Pd is 3 around the Pd2+ ion, and the second shell at 2.72 Å is due to PdPd correlation. The third shell at 3.31 Å is attributed to Pd2+Ce4+ correlation, suggesting the presence of PdOCe interactions. The document concludes that Pd2+ ions in the CeO2 matrix are the active sites for CO adsorption and leads to the higher catalytic activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst compared to Pd metal or PdO. The catalytic properties and structural characteristics of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts are influenced by the interaction between Pd2+ ions and the CeO2 support, leading to the formation of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages.

文献讨论了通过燃烧合成法合成Pd/CeO2催化剂。使用X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱对催化剂的结构进行了研究。1 at. % Pd/CeO2催化剂的高分辨率XRD模式未显示Pd或PdO的衍射线。里特维尔德精修表明，催化剂形成了Ce1-xPdxO2-δ固溶体，其中Pd2+离子以3 at. %取代了Ce4+位点，并伴有氧离子空位。XPS研究表明，Pd在CeO2矩阵中以高度电离的+2状态存在。EXAFS分析表明，Pd周围平均配位数为3，第二壳层在2.72 Å处对应于Pd-Pd相关性。第三壳层在3.31 Å处归因于Pd2+Ce4+相关性，表明存在PdOCe相互作用。文献得出结论，CeO2矩阵中的Pd2+离子是CO吸附的活性位点，并导致Pd/CeO2催化剂的催化活性高于Pd金属或PdO。Pd/CeO2催化剂的催化特性和结构特性受到Pd2+离子与CeO2支持之间相互作用的影响，导致形成Ce1-xPdxO2-δ固溶体，具有Pd2+O2-Ce4+连接。
