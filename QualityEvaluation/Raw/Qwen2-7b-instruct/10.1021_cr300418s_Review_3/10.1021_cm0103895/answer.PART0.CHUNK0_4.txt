<p>The structure, active species, and properties of dispersed metal catalyst materials have been of great interest in heterogeneous catalysis for many years. The catalytic activity of the dispersed metals on the supports is influenced by many factors such as relative amount of metals present, extent of dispersion, chemical nature of the support, and strength of interaction between support and the metal.</p>
<p>Our recent study5 showed that Pd2+ ions are dispersed on CeO2, and catalytic activity of ionically dispersed Pd on CeO2 is much higher than dispersed Pd metal particles on Al2O3. Substitution of Pd2+ ions for Ce4+ in nano CeO2 particles can lead to the highest possible dispersion for a given loading of Pd and higher chemical and structural stability of Pd2+ ions because of the oxygen bonded to Ce4+ ions in the CeO2 matrix.</p>
<p>In the past few years, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis has been used extensively for probing the local structure and identification of the active species of Pd supported on Al2O3, niobia, LaAl2O3, zeolite, and carbon materials. 25-31 It provides information on the local environment of Pd such as coordination number and the kind of neighboring atoms and their distances with respect to a particular atom.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that the structure and local chemical environment of Pd species in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst have been investigated. The main findings of our investigation are:</p>

The coprecipitation method involves the simultaneous precipitation of the desired metal and ceramic components from a solution, typically by adding a precipitating agent that causes the formation of a solid precipitate. The method allows for precise control over the stoichiometry and particle size of the resulting catalyst. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the coprecipitation process involves mixing cerium salts, sodium carbonate, and an appropriate molar ratio of niobium salt in aqueous solution. The pH is adjusted to induce precipitation, and the precipitate is then calcined to remove any remaining impurities and to obtain the desired chemical composition.

Different preparation techniques, such as coprecipitation versus sol-gel, have distinct impacts on the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. Coprecipitation tends to produce well-dispersed metal ions on the ceramic support, which can enhance the surface area and improve the interaction between the metal and support, leading to higher catalytic efficiency. The coprecipitated Nb-doped ceria would likely exhibit faster n-butane combustion rates and lower activation energies compared to sol-gel prepared samples due to the superior dispersion of Nb ions and better support-metal interaction.

The EXAFS analysis reveals that in the 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 catalyst, Pd2+ ions are substituted for Ce4+ sites with oxide ion vacancy around Pd2+ ion. This leads to a strong PdCeO2 interaction in the form of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages. The solid solution structure enhances the catalytic properties of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, particularly for CO oxidation and NO reduction reactions. The localized environment of Pd is characterized by a coordination number of 3 around the Pd2+ ion at a distance of 2.02 Å, which is distinct from the 4-coordinate structure in PdO. The presence of oxide ion vacancy around the Pd2+ ion facilitates the formation of an oxygen-exchange site, which is crucial for the catalytic activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst.

浸溶沉淀法是指将所需金属和陶瓷成分同时从溶液中沉淀出来，通常通过加入沉淀剂来诱导固体沉淀。这种方法允许对最终催化剂的组成和颗粒大小进行精确控制。对于铈铌掺杂氧化物，浸溶沉淀过程涉及混合铈盐、碳酸钠以及适当的铌盐水溶液。通过调整pH值来引发沉淀，然后通过煅烧去除任何残留杂质，以获得所需的化学组成。

不同的制备技术，如浸溶沉淀与溶胶法相比，对最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能产生显著影响。浸溶沉淀倾向于在陶瓷载体上均匀分散金属离子，这可以增加表面面积并改善金属与载体之间的相互作用，从而提高催化效率。与溶胶法制备的样品相比，浸溶沉淀法制备的铈铌掺杂氧化物可能表现出更快的丁烷燃烧速率和更低的活化能，这是由于更好的Nb离子分散和更好的支持-金属相互作用的结果。

EXAFS分析表明，在1 at. % Pd/CeO2催化剂中，Pd2+离子被Ce4+位点取代，并且周围存在氧离子空位。这导致在Ce1-xPdxO2-δ固溶体中形成强PdCeO2相互作用，具有Pd2+O2-Ce4+键合。这种固溶体结构增强了Pd/CeO2催化剂的催化性能，尤其是对于CO氧化和NO还原反应。Pd局部环境由Pd2+离子周围的协同数为3的原子组成，距离为2.02 Å，这与PdO中协同数为4的结构不同。周围存在的氧离子空位有助于形成一个氧交换位点，这是Pd/CeO2催化剂活性的关键因素。
