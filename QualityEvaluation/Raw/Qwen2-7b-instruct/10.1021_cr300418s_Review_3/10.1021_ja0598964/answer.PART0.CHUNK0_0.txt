The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing aqueous solutions of cerium nitrate and dopant salts, typically niobium (Nb), under alkaline conditions. This process leads to the formation of cerium oxide (CeO2) particles that incorporate the dopant ions during precipitation. Different preparation techniques can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the type of dopant used (Nb in this case) impacts the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and reactivity of the ceria catalyst. The Nb doping enhances the oxygen storage capacity and conductivity of the ceria, which in turn improves its performance in catalytic processes such as n-butane combustion.

In the context of n-butane combustion, Nb-doped ceria catalysts exhibit altered reaction kinetics due to the changes in the catalyst's microstructure and surface properties. The dopant ions alter the lattice parameters and create additional sites for adsorption and reaction, influencing the activation energies required for combustion. Specifically, the Nb doping modifies the electronic structure of ceria, leading to improved oxygen migration pathways and enhanced reactivity towards n-butane. This results in faster combustion rates and lower activation energies compared to undoped ceria or other ceria-based catalysts.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法是通过在碱性条件下混合铈硝酸盐和掺杂物盐（通常为铌（Nb）），形成铈氧化物（CeO2）颗粒，同时掺杂物离子被沉淀。不同的制备技术可以显著影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，所用的掺杂物类型（如Nb）会影响氧化铈的晶体结构、表面化学性质和反应活性。Nb掺杂提高了氧化铈的氧存储能力和导电性，进而改善其在催化过程中的性能，如丁烷燃烧。

在丁烷燃烧的背景下，Nb掺杂的氧化铈催化剂表现出改变的反应动力学，这是由于催化剂微结构和表面性质的变化。掺杂物离子改变了晶格参数，并创建了吸附和反应所需的额外位点，从而影响燃烧所需的活化能。具体来说，Nb掺杂修改了氧化铈的电子结构，导致更优的氧迁移路径和增强的活性，针对丁烷燃烧。这导致了比未掺杂的氧化铈或其它氧化铈基催化剂更快的燃烧速率和更低的活化能。
