1. The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing cerium ions with dopant ions in an aqueous solution under controlled conditions. The process allows for the formation of a homogeneous mixture, which then precipitates as a solid. Different dopants, such as Nb, can alter the crystal structure, surface properties, and electronic characteristics of ceria. This impacts the catalytic performance, specifically affecting the activity and selectivity in alkane reactions like n-butane combustion.

2. In the context of n-butane combustion, Nb-doped ceria catalysts exhibit improved combustion rates and reduced activation energies compared to undoped ceria. The Nb dopant introduces new active sites and modifies the electronic structure, enhancing the catalytic efficiency in the combustion process.

3. For total combustion of volatile organic compounds, catalysts based on metal oxides are employed. These catalysts facilitate the decomposition of organic molecules into simpler compounds through oxidative reactions, achieving complete combustion.

4. Photocatalysis for splitting water is carried out using metal oxides like TiO2 and RuO2. These materials absorb light energy, which triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The presence of dopants, such as p-block (d10) metal oxides, enhances the photocatalytic activity by improving light absorption and charge separation.

5. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using metal oxides, particularly ceria-based catalysts, enables the removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from exhaust gases. This process selectively reduces NOx using ammonia or hydrocarbons, while minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts. Ceria's ability to act as a support for noble metals in SCR systems contributes to its effectiveness in NOx abatement.

1. 合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法是通过在水溶液中混合铈离子和掺杂物离子，在控制条件下形成均一混合物。然后，该混合物沉淀为固体。不同的掺杂物，如Nb，可以改变铈的晶体结构、表面特性和电子特性。这影响了催化性能，特别是对烷烃反应，如正丁烷燃烧的影响。

2. 在正丁烷燃烧的背景下，掺Nb的铈催化剂显示出比未掺杂的铈更高的燃烧速率和更低的活化能。Nb掺杂引入新的活性位点并改变了电子结构，从而提高了燃烧过程的催化效率。

3. 对于挥发性有机化合物的完全燃烧，基于金属氧化物的催化剂被使用。这些催化剂通过氧化反应分解有机分子，实现完全燃烧。

4. 利用TiO2和RuO2等金属氧化物进行水分解的光催化作用。这些材料吸收光能，触发生成活性氧物种，将水分子分解为氢和氧气。掺杂p-族(d10)金属氧化物的存在通过改善光吸收和电荷分离，增强了光催化活性。

5. 选择性催化还原（SCR）使用金属氧化物，尤其是铈基催化剂，能够从排气中去除氮氧化物（NOx）。该过程通过氨或碳氢化合物选择性地减少NOx，同时最小化副产品的产生。铈作为贵金属在SCR系统中的支持，对NOx减排的有效性有贡献。
