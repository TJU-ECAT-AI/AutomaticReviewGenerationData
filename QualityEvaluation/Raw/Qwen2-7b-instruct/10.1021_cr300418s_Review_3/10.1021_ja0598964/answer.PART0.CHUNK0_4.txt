[1] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[2] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides."
[3] "This volume comprises 23 chapters, 15 of which are focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides."
[4] "While the content should be of significant interest to anyone seeking introductory and reference material on catalytic transition-metal oxides, it is less likely to appeal to those seeking general coverage of metal oxides."
[5] "Chapters 811 survey redox and acid-base properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[6] "Chapters 1315 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[7] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves mixing cerium ions with dopant ions in an aqueous solution. The mixture is then adjusted to create a precipitate, which is subsequently filtered, washed, and dried to obtain the desired catalyst. The type of dopant used can significantly vary, including elements like niobium (Nb), which impacts the material's properties and performance. For instance, Nb-doped ceria affects its structure and catalytic activity in the combustion of n-butane. Different preparation techniques, such as the choice of dopant concentration, pH level, and reaction temperature, can influence the catalyst's structural properties and catalytic performance. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the impact on n-butane combustion rates and activation energies demonstrates how these factors can be crucial in determining the catalyst's efficiency.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及将铈离子与掺杂离子混合在水溶液中。然后调整混合物以产生沉淀，之后进行过滤、洗涤和干燥以获得所需的催化剂。掺杂物的类型可以有很大变化，包括诸如铌（Nb）之类的元素，这会影响材料的性质和性能。例如，Nb掺杂的氧化铈影响其结构和催化活性。n-丁烷的燃烧速率和活化能受到Nb掺杂的影响，表明不同制备技术，如掺杂剂浓度、pH值和反应温度的选择，如何影响催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。在这种情况下，Nb掺杂的氧化铈说明了这些因素如何决定催化剂的效率。
