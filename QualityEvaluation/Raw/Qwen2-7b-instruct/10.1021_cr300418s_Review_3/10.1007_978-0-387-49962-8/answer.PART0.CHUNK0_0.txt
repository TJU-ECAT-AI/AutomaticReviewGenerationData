[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[4] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[5] "In view of this situation, we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis"

The Handbook of Industrial Catalysts aims to provide comprehensive knowledge on catalysis at an advanced level through monographs that focus on specific topics. This collection is designed to address the growing body of published material and the industrial importance of catalysis in various manufacturing processes and environmental control applications. The handbook covers a wide range of topics, including physical techniques for catalyst characterization, ammonia synthesis fundamentals and practice, chemical kinetics and catalysis, dynamic processes on solid surfaces, elementary physicochemical processes on solid surfaces, and selective oxidation by heterogeneous catalysis. The text also highlights the role of catalysis in controlling pollution and its potential growth in environmental control.
