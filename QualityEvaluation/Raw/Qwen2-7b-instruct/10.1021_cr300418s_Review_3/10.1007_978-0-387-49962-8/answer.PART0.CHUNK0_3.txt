The Handbook of Industrial Catalysts is a series of monographs that aim to provide in-depth knowledge on various topics within catalysis. These monographs cover subjects such as physical techniques for solid materials, ammonia synthesis, chemical kinetics and catalysis, dynamic processes on solid surfaces, elementary physicochemical processes on solid surfaces, metal-catalysed reactions of hydrocarbons, metaloxygen clusters, selective oxidation by heterogeneous catalysis, and surface chemistry and catalysis. This series addresses the academic and industrial significance of catalysis, which plays a crucial role in the production of numerous chemical and oil-based materials. The increasing research in this field has led to a vast amount of published material, necessitating the compilation of specialized monographs to consolidate and advance the understanding of catalytic phenomena.
