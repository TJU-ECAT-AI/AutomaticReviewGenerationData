[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[2] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[3] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[4] "In view of this situation, we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis"

The Handbook of Industrial Catalysts provides a comprehensive collection of monographs aimed at addressing the academic and industrial significance of catalysis. It emphasizes the role of catalysis in various industries, particularly in the production of essential materials like gasoline, plastics, fertilizers, and herbicides, which might otherwise be unattainable or excessively costly. The handbook also highlights the expanding applications of catalysis in controlling pollution and environmental management. With the growth in research activities, the amount of published material related to catalysis continues to increase, reflecting a deepening understanding of the subject. Each monograph within the handbook focuses on an advanced level of a specific topic to construct a holistic understanding of catalysis.
