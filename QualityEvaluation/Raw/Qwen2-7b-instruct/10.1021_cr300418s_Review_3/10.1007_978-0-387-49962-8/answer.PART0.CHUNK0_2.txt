[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[4] "There are few chemical- or oil-based material items in modern society that do not depend in some way on a catalytic stage in their manufacture."
[5] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."

The Handbook of Industrial Catalysts provides a comprehensive overview of catalysis, emphasizing its importance both academically and industrially. Catalysis plays a crucial role in the production of various materials such as gasoline, plastics, fertilizers, and herbicides, which would otherwise be inaccessible or too costly. Beyond traditional manufacturing processes, catalysis is increasingly being utilized in environmental control, particularly in pollution management. This growing field is driven by extensive research, leading to a steady increase in the publication of material related to catalysis.
