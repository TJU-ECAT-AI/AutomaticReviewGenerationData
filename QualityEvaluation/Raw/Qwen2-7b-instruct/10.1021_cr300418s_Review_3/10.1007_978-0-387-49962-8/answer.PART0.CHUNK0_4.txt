[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[2] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[3] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[4] "As recently as sixty years ago, Rideal and Taylor could still treat the subject comprehensively in a single volume, but by the 1950s, Emmett required six volumes, and no conventional multivolume text could now cover the whole of catalysis in any depth."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves combining the cerium precursor and dopant precursor in an aqueous solution under controlled conditions. This results in the formation of a precipitate containing both cerium and dopant ions. The choice of dopant, such as niobium (Nb), influences the structure and properties of the final product. Different preparation techniques can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the catalyst. In the case of Nb-doped ceria, the incorporation of niobium modifies the surface properties, leading to changes in the combustion rates of n-butane and the activation energies involved in the reaction. These variations are crucial for optimizing the catalyst's efficiency in specific applications, such as improving combustion processes or enhancing environmental control mechanisms.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法是将铈前体和掺杂剂前体在可控条件下混合在水中，从而形成包含铈和掺杂离子的沉淀物。选择掺杂剂，如铌（Nb），会直接影响最终产品的结构和性质。不同的制备技术对催化剂的结构特性和催化性能产生显著影响。对于Nb掺杂氧化铈而言，铌的引入改变了表面特性，导致n-丁烷燃烧速率和反应涉及的活化能发生变化。这些变化对于优化催化剂在特定应用中的效率至关重要，例如改进燃烧过程或增强环境控制机制。
