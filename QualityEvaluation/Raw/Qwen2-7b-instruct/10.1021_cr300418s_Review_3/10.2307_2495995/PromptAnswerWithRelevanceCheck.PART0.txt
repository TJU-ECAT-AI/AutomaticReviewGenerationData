</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Soviet Russian State by Robert G. Wesson is a comprehensive textbook designed for undergraduate courses on Soviet politics. It covers various aspects of the Soviet system, including history, ideology, party, state, economy, law, military, nationalities, and international relations. The author discusses the strain towards autocratic structures due to the functional need to prevent disintegration in a vast Russian-dominated multinational empire. The book also explores the historical tension between the need for Western technology and maintaining political control within the empire. Wesson's approach is historically descriptive, comparing the Soviet and tsarist regimes, as well as earlier "imperial orders." While the book provides balanced coverage and depth, it may lack attention to the complexity of organizational relationships within the party, as noted by some critics.
