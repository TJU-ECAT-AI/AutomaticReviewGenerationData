[1] "In consequence,the reader is left with only a few disjointed insights into the dynamics of Soviet society and almost no coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research."
[2] "Wesson's combines balanced coverage of most aspects of the system with commendable depth."
[3] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."
[4] "The chapter on "The Party," for example,repeats too much of -the conventional wisdom and pays insufficient attention to the complexity of inter- and intra-organizational relationships (documented,in particular,in the writings of Jerry Hough)."

The Soviet Russian State by Robert G. Wesson is a comprehensive textbook designed for undergraduate courses on Soviet politics. It covers various aspects of the Soviet system, including history, ideology, party, state, economy, law, military, nationalities, and international relations. The author discusses the strain towards autocratic structures due to the functional need to prevent disintegration in a vast Russian-dominated multinational empire. The book also explores the historical tension between the need for Western technology and maintaining political control within the empire. Wesson's approach is historically descriptive, comparing the Soviet and tsarist regimes, as well as earlier "imperial orders." While the book provides balanced coverage and depth, it may lack attention to the complexity of organizational relationships within the party, as noted by some critics.

《苏联俄罗斯国家》由罗伯特·G·韦森撰写，是为政治学课程设计的本科教材。它涵盖了苏联系统的各个方面，包括历史、意识形态、政党、国家、经济、法律、军队、民族和国际关系。作者讨论了由于防止帝国崩溃的功能需求而存在的向集权制度的压力。该书还探讨了对西方技术的需求与保持帝国内部政治控制之间的历史紧张关系。韦森的方法是历史描述性的，比较了苏联和沙皇制度以及早期“帝国秩序”。虽然这本书提供了平衡的覆盖和深度，但它可能忽略了党内的复杂组织关系，这在一些批评者中被指出。
