        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.mcat.2022.112580], [10.1039/a906550d], and [10.1016/j.ces.2023.118450]. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily use impregnation synthesis methods, with MFI and BEA zeolites dominating due to their high surface area, large pore volumes, and well-defined frameworks. These features enable even metal dispersion, crucial for catalytic activity. Al sites in the zeolite framework facilitate metal interaction, but balancing Al content ensures optimal acidity, avoiding side reactions. Future developments aim to optimize synthesis for precise metal dispersion, zeolite acidity, and Al site presence, potentially introducing novel metal-zeolite combinations or zeolite topologies. Key insights come from quotes highlighting the role of Zn species distribution, acidity, and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in enhancing catalytic performance.
