Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those featuring MFI (Mesofermor) and BEA (Bovine Endothelium Alumina) zeolite structures, are pivotal in the synthesis of propylene from propane through the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. The choice of zeolite type significantly influences the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, which are critical for efficient PDH processes. MFI zeolites, known for their hexagonal channel system, offer an optimal balance between surface area and pore size, making them highly effective for the conversion of propane to propylene. BEA zeolites, characterized by their cubic structure, provide a distinct pore architecture that can also enhance the PDH process under certain conditions.

The synthesis methods of these metal-zeolite catalysts typically involve impregnation or co-precipitation techniques, where metals such as copper, molybdenum, or tungsten are introduced into the zeolite framework. The precise control over the metal loading and the post-synthesis treatments, including calcination and activation, are crucial for achieving the desired catalytic properties.

Structurally, both MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to the performance of metal-zeolite catalysts by providing a highly ordered environment that facilitates the adsorption and subsequent dehydrogenation of propane molecules. The zeolite's microporous nature ensures that reactants are confined within the active sites, enhancing the reaction efficiency. The surface acidity and basicity, which are influenced by the type of metal and its coordination state within the zeolite framework, play significant roles in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene formation.

Performance factors, such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time, are also critical in optimizing the PDH process. Higher temperatures generally increase the rate of dehydrogenation but may lead to coke formation, reducing catalyst lifetime. Pressure affects the diffusivity of gases within the zeolite pores, impacting the reaction kinetics. The development of advanced synthesis methods and the continuous optimization of operational parameters aim to improve the overall performance of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH, aiming for higher propylene yields with minimal byproduct formation and extended catalyst life.
