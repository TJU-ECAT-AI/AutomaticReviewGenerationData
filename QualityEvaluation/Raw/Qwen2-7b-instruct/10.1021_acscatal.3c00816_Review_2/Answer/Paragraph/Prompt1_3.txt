{"Quotes": "The synthesis of PtCe cluster catalysts involves the utilization of high-silica Beta zeolite as support to improve catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. Appropriate Al sites play an indispensable role in regulating the metal-support interaction by further stabilizing the active site structure. The closely associated Pt and Ce species are critical to embodying the outstanding catalytic activity and stability at 550°C. To address the difficulties of synthesizing Pt-REE nanoalloy catalysts, a combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests is proposed as an efficient way to regulate metal-support interactions. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance due to the well-dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. The role of Al sites in stabilizing active sites is balanced with their potential to act as side-reaction sites, depending on the amount and location on the zeolite surface. High-silica zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which benefits the high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance, robust structure of catalytic sites, low deactivation constant, and good redispersion capability after multiple regenerations. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal dispersion, support functionality, and metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity.", "English": "Metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions often utilize high-silica Beta zeolites to enhance stability and propylene selectivity.
