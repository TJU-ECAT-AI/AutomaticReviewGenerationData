These zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA types, are effective in PDH due to their high surface area and pore volume which facilitate efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants. The regular pore structure of MFI zeolites enables uniform distribution of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, with their larger cages, offer improved selectivity towards desired products. Their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures further contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that hydrothermal synthesis is employed to produce Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites with varying zinc content. These zeolites are then utilized as supports for platinum catalysts in PDH reactions. The effectiveness of ZSM-5 zeolites in PDH applications is attributed to their unique physical properties, including their special three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, making them an interesting material for use as a catalyst carrier in PDH reactions. The relatively large surface area and distinctive channel character of ZSM-5 zeolites contribute to their ability to accommodate coke formation, which is crucial in PDH reactions. Metal promoters, particularly zinc, are introduced to enhance the catalytic properties of platinum catalysts in PDH processes. Zinc can improve the selectivity of the catalysts towards dehydrogenated products, such as iso-butene, reaching up to 100%. However, the deposition of zinc typically occurs through impregnation with aqueous zinc precursor solutions. The study highlights the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst, which demonstrates the highest initial activity (40.60%) and lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after 10 hours of reaction.

The literature does not provide specific details on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. It also lacks information on how their structural characteristics and other factors contribute to their effectiveness and the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1. Commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts can undergo up to 80,000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles before the surface chromium species change. 
          2. With proper conditions, the highest selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation can surpass 99 mol%.
          3. The high temperature reduction of hydrogen prior to reaction helps form active Zrcus sites, thus shortening the induction period.
          4. Metal sulfide catalysts, when introduced to isobutane dehydrogenation, show isobutylene selectivities exceeding 80%.
          5. CrOx catalysts deplete rapidly due to coke deposition, necessitating frequent regeneration, whereas PtSn catalysts degrade through coke deposition and sintering, requiring oxychlorination regeneration.
          6. The ADHO process uses a reactor and regenerator with similar structures to handle alkane dehydrogenation.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structure and properties.

Recent studies have shown that Dai et al. [13] reported the isolation of Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix through a one-step hydrothermal method, demonstrating anti-reduction properties and outstanding PDH catalytic performance. Altering the calcination atmosphere appears to be an effective approach. Dai and Peeters et al. highlighted the pivotal role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in Sn-based zeolite catalysts, where inert gas or vacuum calcination environments facilitated the incorporation of Sn sites into the dealuminization Beta framework, whereas air calcination resulted in extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst. In this research, a Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor was synthesized through solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat treatment at 550°C under oxidative (air) or oxygen-free (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum) atmospheres to yield Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts.
