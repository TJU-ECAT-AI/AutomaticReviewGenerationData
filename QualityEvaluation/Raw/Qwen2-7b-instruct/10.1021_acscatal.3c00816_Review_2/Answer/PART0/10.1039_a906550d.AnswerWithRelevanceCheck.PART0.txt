          These zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA types, are effective in PDH due to their high surface area and pore volume which facilitate efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants. The regular pore structure of MFI zeolites enables uniform distribution of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, with their larger cages, offer improved selectivity towards desired products. Their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures further contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.
