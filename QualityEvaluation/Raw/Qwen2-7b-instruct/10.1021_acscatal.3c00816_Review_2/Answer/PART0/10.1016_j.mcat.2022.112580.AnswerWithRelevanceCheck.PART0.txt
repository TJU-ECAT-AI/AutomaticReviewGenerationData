          "The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve modifying the heat-treatment atmosphere. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their specific structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, such as Silicalite-1, have a cubic structure with channels and cages that can accommodate metal ions. These zeolites provide a suitable framework for metal incorporation, enhancing the dispersion and stability of metal species. BEA zeolites, with a larger pore size, can also accommodate metal ions effectively, facilitating their use in PDH catalysts. Their Lewis acid sites are crucial for the adsorption of reactants and products, contributing to the high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions."
          "The states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] and SiO2 [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke."

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法涉及修改热处理气氛。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，这是因为它们具有特定的结构特性，能够高效地整合金属离子，并增强金属物种的分散性和稳定性。例如，Silicalite-1这样的MFI沸石具有立方结构，包含通道和笼子，适合容纳金属离子。而具有更大孔径的BEA沸石也能有效地容纳金属离子，使它们适用于PDH催化剂。这些沸石上的Lewis酸位点对于吸附反应物和产物至关重要，促进了PDH反应的高活性和选择性。活性位点电荷状态和金属分布对催化性能和产品选择性影响巨大。四面体配合的Co2+物种在Al2O3和SiO2上表现出高丙烯选择性和催化活性，而CoOx簇和Co3O4颗粒会导致严重的副反应，如丙烷裂解和焦炭生成。

          "Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance."
          "Catalyst synthesized via changing the calcination atmosphere seems to be an effective way. Recently, Dai and Peeters et al. reported the fundamental role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in the Sn-based zeolite catalysts, in which the inert gas or vacuum calcination atmosphere promoted the Sn sites into the framework of dealuminzation Beta, while the air calcination atmosphere resulted in the generation of extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst."
          "In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively."

          Recent studies have shown that Dai et al. [13] reported the isolation of Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix through a one-step hydrothermal method, demonstrating anti-reduction properties and outstanding PDH catalytic performance. Altering the calcination atmosphere appears to be an effective approach. Dai and Peeters et al. highlighted the pivotal role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in Sn-based zeolite catalysts, where inert gas or vacuum calcination environments facilitated the incorporation of Sn sites into the dealuminization Beta framework, whereas air calcination resulted in extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst. In this research, a Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor was synthesized through solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat treatment at 550°C under oxidative (air) or oxygen-free (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum) atmospheres to yield Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts.

          最近的研究表明，Dai et al. [13] 报道了一种通过一步水热法将γ-Al2O3矩阵稳定化的隔离Co2+物种，这种物种表现出抗还原性并具有出色的PDH催化性能。改变煅烧气氛似乎是一种有效的方法。Dai和Peeters等人的研究表明，在Sn基沸石催化剂中，惰性气体或真空煅烧环境促进了Sn位点向去铝化Beta骨架的整合，而空气煅烧则导致催化剂表面产生额外的框架SnOx物种。在本研究中，通过固体相研磨（SPG）将Co前体和Silicalite-1混合，随后在氧化（空气）或无氧（Ar、5%H2/Ar和真空）气氛下进一步热处理至550°C，分别获得了Co/S-1-Air、Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum催化剂。

          "The oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere in terms of TOFCo."
          "According to the systematic characterizations, it is found that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum, which shows high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for PDH."
          "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

          Oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum demonstrate exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, showing a TOFCo performance nine times higher than that of Co/S-1-Air, which was prepared using an air calcination atmosphere. Systematic characterizations indicate that the predominant tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species within the Silicalite-1 framework are responsible for the high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, thereby showcasing superior catalytic activity for PDH. The in-situ FT-IR analysis elucidates the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, revealing that Co precursors are propelled by Ar to reach the highly dispersed silanol nests at high temperatures, and Co species are subsequently anchored by silanol nests and integrated into the Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species.
