          <p>Typically, the commercial fixed-bed CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergo 6000080000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles,138 and thus, the surface Cr species probably change during the continuous cycles.</p>
          <p>As stated above, MCM-41 with a large surface area and low acidity, is also an appropriate carrier for VOx-based catalysts.158 Research has indicated that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, possesses higher intrinsic activity and lower selectivity to isobutylene compared with oligomerized vanadium species for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the increased possibility for isomerization of isobutylene and cracking reactions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the addition of B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst can further enhance the dispersion of vanadium species and improve the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to olefins.159 Porous VSiO2 catalysts, demonstrating a mesoporous structure with high specific surface area, have also been synthesized, and vanadium species are highly dispersed in the channels of the mesoporous silica.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly, the conventional carrier ZrO2145 or Al2O358 with surface defects has been demonstrated to exhibit relatively good dehydrogenation performance. Al2O3 itself can catalyze the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, while having a long induction period and relatively high coke formation rate. The coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are generally regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation.</p>
          <p>Actually, both the commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation while the high cost of Pt and the harmful effect of CrOx drive the researchers to develop a novel inexpensive and environmental-friendly catalyst. At present, a lot of innovative research studies are opening up new directions, and many catalytic systems demonstrate comparable dehydrogenation performance with the commercial catalysts.</p>
          <p>The WO3-containing catalyst, highly active and selective, has been applied in the ADHO process. For the dehydrogenation of pure propane at 600 C and 0.13 MPa, the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene reach about 43% and 90% (see the product distribution listed in Table 2), respectively.</p>

          Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. These zeolites are favored due to their structural characteristics, specifically their high surface area, regular pore structure, and tunable acidity. This allows for the creation of isolated metal sites that can effectively catalyze the activation and cleavage of alkane bonds without promoting unwanted side reactions. Their effectiveness stems from their ability to facilitate the selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds, enabling the production of mono-olefins from alkanes. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could benefit from further optimizing the synthesis methods to improve the stability and longevity of these catalysts, particularly in terms of maintaining their structural integrity and catalytic activity over extended operational periods. This includes exploring new synthesis routes that might enable the creation of even more robust zeolite supports or the incorporation of advanced metal functionalities that enhance both the dehydrogenation efficiency and the selectivity towards desired products.

          Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we see that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate this application due to their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and a strong acid functionality that promotes the dehydrogenation process. Their high surface area facilitates more active sites for the reaction, while the well-defined pore structures allow for better control over the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. The strong acid functionality aids in the activation of the alkane molecules, enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalyst design is influenced by factors such as the type of metal loading, the presence of promoters, and the preparation method. For instance, the introduction of metal species into the zeolite framework can alter the acidity and redox properties, which in turn affects the dehydrogenation performance. Promoters can improve the stability and selectivity of the catalyst by modifying the surface chemistry. The synthesis method also plays a crucial role, as it determines the uniformity and dispersion of the metal species on the zeolite surface.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve better dispersion of metal species, improving the stability against sintering and coking, and exploring the use of alternative metal and non-metal additives to further enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Additionally, in situ characterization techniques could aid in gaining deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active sites, leading to more rational catalyst design.

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH催化剂设计中的有效性受多种因素影响，如金属负载类型、促动剂的存在以及制备方法。例如，将金属物种引入沸石框架中可以改变酸性和氧化还原性质，进而影响脱氢性能。促动剂可以通过修改表面化学来改善催化剂的稳定性和选择性。合成方法也起着关键作用，因为它决定了沸石表面金属物种的均匀性和分散性。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成条件以实现更好的金属物种分散、提高对抗烧结和积碳的稳定性，并探索使用替代金属和非金属添加剂进一步增强催化活性和选择性。此外，在位表征技术可以帮助深入理解反应机制和活性位点的性质，从而实现更理性的催化剂设计。

          The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to mono-olefins In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application. Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Many metal complexes, such as Ir, Rh, Ru and Ti, are active for the dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes in the presence or absence of a H2 acceptor.1216 There are also several reports on the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over Ti complexes at room temperature; however, ethylene and propylene can only be liberated from the complexes by the use of N2O, organic azides or ketones.17,18 The research in this aspect is still far from application. Therefore, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes should still depend on the supported metal or metal oxide catalysts.

An overview of the representative dehydrogenation catalysts, including reaction conditions, key results, and references, is given in Table 1.

          从轻烷烃到单烯烃的脱氢在过去几十年中，轻烷烃到单烯烃的转化，尤其是丙烷脱氢到丙烯，已经在研究和商业应用领域获得了广泛关注和大量发展。在适当的条件下，广泛应用于工业的负载式PtSn和CrOx催化剂表现出令人满意的脱氢活性和选择性。然而，Pt的高昂成本和CrOx潜在的环境问题促使研究人员改进Pt催化剂的结焦和烧结抗性，并寻找新的非贵金属和环保催化剂。

烷烃的脱氢可以通过金属配合物催化剂和负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化。许多金属配合物，如Ir、Rh、Ru和Ti，在有或无H2接受体的情况下，对线性或环状烷烃的脱氢活性很高。1216也有关于室温下Ti配合物对乙烷和丙烷的脱氢报告；然而，乙烯和丙烯只能从配合物中释放出来，使用N2O、有机偶氮化合物或酮类。17,18在这方面进行的研究距离实际应用还很远。因此，轻烷烃的脱氢仍应依赖于负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂。

          The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is also affected by the introduced P content. For isobutane dehydrogenation over the NiP/SiO2 catalyst, with the increase of P loading amount, various NiP compounds (Ni3P, Ni12P5, Ni2P) are formed on the catalyst surface, leading to different dehydrogenation performances.
          In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed.

          尼磷催化剂的脱氢性能也受引入的P含量的影响。对于异丁烷在NiP/SiO2催化剂上的脱氢，随着P装载量的增加，在催化剂表面上形成了各种NiP化合物（Ni3P、Ni12P5、Ni2P），导致不同的脱氢性能。
          在恒定的空间时间下，线速度的增加不利于形成烯烃在催化剂表面的吸附，并减少了油蒸汽的回混程度，因此即使线速度不能大幅度提高，由于催化剂床压力降的相应增加，烯烃的二次反应，包括聚合生成焦炭，仍可以被抑制。
