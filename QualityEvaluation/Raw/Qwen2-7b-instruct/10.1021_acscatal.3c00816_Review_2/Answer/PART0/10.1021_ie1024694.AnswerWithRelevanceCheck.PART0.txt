          Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their exceptional properties. These zeolites feature high surface area and optimized pore size distribution, which significantly enhance reaction kinetics. Their stability and selectivity are also paramount for industrial success. Looking ahead, advancements in PDH catalyst design strive to refine and improve these attributes.
