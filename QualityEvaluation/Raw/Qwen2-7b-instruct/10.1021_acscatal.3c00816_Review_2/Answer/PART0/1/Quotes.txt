The synthesis of PtCe cluster catalysts involves the utilization of high-silica Beta zeolite as support to improve catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. Appropriate Al sites play an indispensable role in regulating the metal-support interaction by further stabilizing the active site structure. The closely associated Pt and Ce species are critical to embodying the outstanding catalytic activity and stability at 550°C. To address the difficulties of synthesizing Pt-REE nanoalloy catalysts, a combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests is proposed as an efficient way to regulate metal-support interactions. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance due to the well-dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. The role of Al sites in stabilizing active sites is balanced with their potential to act as side-reaction sites, depending on the amount and location on the zeolite surface. High-silica zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which benefits the high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance, robust structure of catalytic sites, low deactivation constant, and good redispersion capability after multiple regenerations. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal dispersion, support functionality, and metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity.

<p>Typically, the commercial fixed-bed CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergo 6000080000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles,138 and thus, the surface Cr species probably change during the continuous cycles.</p>
          <p>As stated above, MCM-41 with a large surface area and low acidity, is also an appropriate carrier for VOx-based catalysts.158 Research has indicated that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, possesses higher intrinsic activity and lower selectivity to isobutylene compared with oligomerized vanadium species for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the increased possibility for isomerization of isobutylene and cracking reactions.</p>

          <p>Surprisingly, the conventional carrier ZrO2145 or Al2O358 with surface defects has been demonstrated to exhibit relatively good dehydrogenation performance. Al2O3 itself can catalyze the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, while having a long induction period and relatively high coke formation rate. The coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are generally regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation.</p>
          <p>Actually, both the commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation while the high cost of Pt and the harmful effect of CrOx drive the researchers to develop a novel inexpensive and environmental-friendly catalyst. At present, a lot of innovative research studies are opening up new directions, and many catalytic systems demonstrate comparable dehydrogenation performance with the commercial catalysts.</p>

          <p>As stated above, MCM-41 with a large surface area and low acidity, is also an appropriate carrier for VOx-based catalysts.158 Research has indicated that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, possesses higher intrinsic activity and lower selectivity to isobutylene compared with oligomerized vanadium species for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the increased possibility for isomerization of isobutylene and cracking reactions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the addition of B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst can further enhance the dispersion of vanadium species and improve the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to olefins.159 Porous VSiO2 catalysts, demonstrating a mesoporous structure with high specific surface area, have also been synthesized, and vanadium species are highly dispersed in the channels of the mesoporous silica.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly, the conventional carrier ZrO2145 or Al2O358 with surface defects has been demonstrated to exhibit relatively good dehydrogenation performance. Al2O3 itself can catalyze the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, while having a long induction period and relatively high coke formation rate. The coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are generally regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation.</p>
          <p>Actually, both the commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation while the high cost of Pt and the harmful effect of CrOx drive the researchers to develop a novel inexpensive and environmental-friendly catalyst. At present, a lot of innovative research studies are opening up new directions, and many catalytic systems demonstrate comparable dehydrogenation performance with the commercial catalysts.</p>
          <p>The WO3-containing catalyst, highly active and selective, has been applied in the ADHO process.

The synthesis of PtCe cluster catalysts involves the utilization of high-silica Beta zeolite as support to improve catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. Appropriate Al sites play an indispensable role in regulating the metal-support interaction by further stabilizing the active site structure. The closely associated Pt and Ce species are critical to embodying the outstanding catalytic activity and stability at 550°C. To address the difficulties of synthesizing Pt-REE nanoalloy catalysts, a combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests is proposed as an efficient way to regulate metal-support interactions. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance due to the well-dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. The role of Al sites in stabilizing active sites is balanced with their potential to act as side-reaction sites, depending on the amount and location on the zeolite surface. High-silica zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which benefits the high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance, robust structure of catalytic sites, low deactivation constant, and good redispersion capability after multiple regenerations. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal dispersion, support functionality, and metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity.

          [16] "Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."
          [17] "In addition to the Zn species distribution, the acidity of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is equally crucial to the catalytic behavior for PDH."
          [18] "Also, the DR UVvis and Zn 2p XPS results evidenced that high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite accommodate more Zn species inside the zeolite channel and result in less ZnO aggregates existing on the external surface."
          [19] "The activity test results show that the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio."

          [2] "The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) applications due to their unique structural characteristics."
          [3] "Their high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and ordered mesopores facilitate the efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules."
          [4] "These features enable the catalysts to promote the desired chemical transformations with high selectivity and activity."
          [5] "Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to enhance stability and efficiency."

"The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve modifying the heat-treatment atmosphere. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their specific structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, such as Silicalite-1, have a cubic structure with channels and cages that can accommodate metal ions. These zeolites provide a suitable framework for metal incorporation, enhancing the dispersion and stability of metal species. BEA zeolites, with a larger pore size, can also accommodate metal ions effectively, facilitating their use in PDH catalysts. Their Lewis acid sites are crucial for the adsorption of reactants and products, contributing to the high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions."
          "The states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] and SiO2 [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke."
