Future developments in PDH catalyst design may involve modifying zeolite structures or incorporating additional metal promoters to enhance their performance and efficiency.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is evident that hydrothermal synthesis is employed to produce Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites with varying zinc content. These zeolites are then utilized as supports for platinum catalysts in PDH reactions. The substitution of zinc in the support material leads to significant morphological changes. Previously reported [24], the crystal structure consists of hexagonal-shaped crystal rods, which are uniformly sized at 68 μm in length and approximately 3.2 μm in width (Fig. 2 (1)). The substitution of zinc in the support may affect the material acidity. Nitrogen adsorption and thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) results for different samples are presented in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 2. It is known that strong acid sites play a crucial role in catalyzing side reactions (cracking, isomerization, and polymerization) in dehydrogenation reactions. Meanwhile, for catalysts where zinc is loaded by the impregnation method, the existing competitive adsorption behavior during the catalyst preparation process may also reduce the metal dispersion.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we see that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate this application due to their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and a strong acid functionality that promotes the dehydrogenation process. Their high surface area facilitates more active sites for the reaction, while the well-defined pore structures allow for better control over the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. The strong acid functionality aids in the activation of the alkane molecules, enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalyst design is influenced by factors such as the type of metal loading, the presence of promoters, and the preparation method. For instance, the introduction of metal species into the zeolite framework can alter the acidity and redox properties, which in turn affects the dehydrogenation performance. Promoters can improve the stability and selectivity of the catalyst by modifying the surface chemistry. The synthesis method also plays a crucial role, as it determines the uniformity and dispersion of the metal species on the zeolite surface.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve better dispersion of metal species, improving the stability against sintering and coking, and exploring the use of alternative metal and non-metal additives to further enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Additionally, in situ characterization techniques could aid in gaining deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active sites, leading to more rational catalyst design.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the preparation of zeolites through vapor-phase exchange of hydrogen (H)-modified MFI zeolites with gallium chloride (GaCl3). MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their well-defined pore structures, high surface area, and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to optimize these factors, including the composition and structure of these zeolites, and explore new materials with similar properties.

Oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum demonstrate exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, showing a TOFCo performance nine times higher than that of Co/S-1-Air, which was prepared using an air calcination atmosphere. Systematic characterizations indicate that the predominant tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species within the Silicalite-1 framework are responsible for the high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, thereby showcasing superior catalytic activity for PDH. The in-situ FT-IR analysis elucidates the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, revealing that Co precursors are propelled by Ar to reach the highly dispersed silanol nests at high temperatures, and Co species are subsequently anchored by silanol nests and integrated into the Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species.
