The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to mono-olefins In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application. Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Many metal complexes, such as Ir, Rh, Ru and Ti, are active for the dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes in the presence or absence of a H2 acceptor.1216 There are also several reports on the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over Ti complexes at room temperature; however, ethylene and propylene can only be liberated from the complexes by the use of N2O, organic azides or ketones.17,18 The research in this aspect is still far from application. Therefore, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes should still depend on the supported metal or metal oxide catalysts.

An overview of the representative dehydrogenation catalysts, including reaction conditions, key results, and references, is given in Table 1.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the preparation of zeolites through vapor-phase exchange of hydrogen (H)-modified MFI zeolites with gallium chloride (GaCl3). MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application because of their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined pore structures, which are essential for efficient catalytic activity. Gallium (Ga) as a promoter in these materials enhances their selectivity and activity for PDH reactions. Their effectiveness is also attributed to the ability to control the size and shape of the active sites, influencing the reaction pathways. Future developments in PDH catalyst design will likely focus on optimizing these factors to achieve higher conversion rates and better product distributions.
