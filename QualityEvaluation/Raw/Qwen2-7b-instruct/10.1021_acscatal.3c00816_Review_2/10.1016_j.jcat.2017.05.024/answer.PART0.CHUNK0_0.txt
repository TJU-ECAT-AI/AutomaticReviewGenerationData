Answer: Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic properties. MFI zeolites, with their cubic structure and 5 Å channel diameter, enable efficient molecule separation, while BEA zeolites, featuring a cubic framework with 7 Å channels, are adept at accommodating larger molecules. Their high surface area, regular pore size distribution, and stability under high temperatures and pressures enhance their efficiency in PDH reactions. Furthermore, the ability to control reaction pathways contributes to their effectiveness as PDH catalysts. These factors, along with the flexibility in tailoring their properties through synthesis methods, make MFI and BEA zeolites the preferred choice in PDH catalyst design.

答案：在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的金属-沸石催化剂因其独特的结构特性和催化性质而占据主导地位。MFI沸石具有立方结构和约5 Å的通道直径，能够实现高效分子分离，而BEA沸石则具有立方框架和约7 Å的通道，能够有效容纳较大分子。它们的高比表面积、规则孔径分布以及在高温高压下的稳定性增强了其在PDH反应中的效率。此外，控制反应途径的能力也促进了它们作为PDH催化剂的有效性。这些因素，再加上通过合成方法调整其属性的灵活性，使得MFI和BEA沸石成为PDH催化剂设计中的首选。
