Answer: Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic properties. MFI zeolites, with their cubic structure and 5 Å channel diameter, enable efficient molecule separation, while BEA zeolites, featuring a cubic framework with 7 Å channels, are adept at accommodating larger molecules. Their high surface area, regular pore size distribution, and stability under high temperatures and pressures enhance their efficiency in PDH reactions. Furthermore, the ability to control reaction pathways contributes to their effectiveness as PDH catalysts. These factors, along with the flexibility in tailoring their properties through synthesis methods, make MFI and BEA zeolites the preferred choice in PDH catalyst design.

Answer: Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, are predominant in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their exceptional properties. The cubic structure of MFI zeolites facilitates efficient reactant and product diffusion through its regular three-dimensional pore system. Conversely, BEA zeolites, characterized by their tetrahedral pore structure with smaller pores, exhibit greater resistance to coke formation. These zeolites' stability under reaction conditions, along with their high surface area and pore volume, significantly enhances their adsorption capacity, boosting conversion rates of propane to propylene. Future PDH catalyst design innovations might involve integrating additional functionalities, such as Lewis acid sites, to further optimize catalytic performance.
