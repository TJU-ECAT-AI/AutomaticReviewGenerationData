The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metals into MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These topologies dominate because they offer a combination of high surface area, numerous acid sites in MFI zeolites, and a stable framework in BEA zeolites. Their structural characteristics enable efficient facilitation of the PDH reactions, resulting in enhanced conversion efficiency and stability under high temperatures. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might explore the integration of additional metals or modifications to the zeolite structure to further improve performance.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中扮演着关键角色，主要合成方法涉及将金属引入MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石中。这些拓扑结构之所以占主导地位，是因为它们提供高比表面积、MFI沸石中的大量酸性位点以及BEA沸石的稳定框架。其结构特征能够高效促进所需的化学反应，从而提高转化效率和高温稳定性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能侧重于整合额外的金属或对沸石结构进行修改，以进一步提升性能。
