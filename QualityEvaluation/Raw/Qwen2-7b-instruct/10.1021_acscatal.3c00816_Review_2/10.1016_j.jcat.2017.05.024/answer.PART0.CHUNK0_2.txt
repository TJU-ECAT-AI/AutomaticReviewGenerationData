[1] "Metal-zeolite catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their high activity and selectivity."
[2] "MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application because of their unique pore structures and high surface area."
[3] "The MFI zeolite has a cubic structure with a regular three-dimensional pore system, which allows efficient diffusion of reactants and products."
[4] "BEA zeolites, on the other hand, have a tetrahedral pore system with smaller pores compared to MFI, offering higher resistance to coke formation."
[5] "The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their ability to maintain a stable structure under reaction conditions, thus preserving their catalytic activity."
[6] "Furthermore, the high surface area and pore volume of MFI and BEA zeolites enhance the adsorption capacity, leading to improved conversion rates of propane to propylene."
[7] "Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on incorporating additional functionalities, such as Lewis acid sites, to further enhance the catalytic performance."

Answer: Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, are predominant in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their exceptional properties. The cubic structure of MFI zeolites facilitates efficient reactant and product diffusion through its regular three-dimensional pore system. Conversely, BEA zeolites, characterized by their tetrahedral pore structure with smaller pores, exhibit greater resistance to coke formation. These zeolites' stability under reaction conditions, along with their high surface area and pore volume, significantly enhances their adsorption capacity, boosting conversion rates of propane to propylene. Future PDH catalyst design innovations might involve integrating additional functionalities, such as Lewis acid sites, to further optimize catalytic performance.

答案：金属沸石催化剂，尤其是具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的催化剂，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中占据主导地位，这是由于它们的卓越性能。MFI沸石的立方结构通过其规则的三维孔隙系统促进有效扩散反应物和产物。相比之下，BEA沸石以其四面体孔结构和较小的孔径而闻名，展现出更高的焦炭形成抵抗力。在反应条件下保持稳定性和高表面积以及孔体积的这些沸石显著提高了其吸附能力，从而提高丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。未来PDH催化剂设计的创新可能涉及集成额外的功能性，如Lewis酸中心，以进一步优化催化性能。
