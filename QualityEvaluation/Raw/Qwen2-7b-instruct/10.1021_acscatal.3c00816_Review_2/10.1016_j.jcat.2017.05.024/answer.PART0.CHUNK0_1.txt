Metal-zeolite catalysts are commonly employed in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with MFI and BEA topological zeolites being predominant. MFI zeolites possess a high surface area and uniform pore size, which promotes efficient propane conversion. Meanwhile, BEA zeolites have a larger pore volume, enhancing gas diffusion properties. Their effectiveness in PDH is associated with improved activity, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions. Future advancements seek to refine these properties through optimized synthesis techniques.
