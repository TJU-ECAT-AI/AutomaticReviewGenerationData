Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it is mentioned that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their structural characteristics and other factors contributing to their effectiveness. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design could involve exploring new synthesis methods to improve the properties of these zeolites or developing alternative catalyst materials.
