[3] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[4] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."
[5] "Gongs group [ 18 ] employed the Pt-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, wherein the ZnO serving as Lewis acid sites (LAS) were the active phases while Pt only acted as promoter, which showed promising catalytic activity."

[7] "Our group [ 20 ] recently found that the ZnO nanoclusters in Al-free SiBeta support showed great catalytic activity in PDH, confirming that the Lewis acidic ZnO clusters possessed admirable catalytic ability."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that molecular sieves, particularly those with MFI (beta) and BEA (chabazite) topologies, dominate in this application. Their effectiveness stems from their unique structural characteristics, such as high surface area, large pore volumes, and well-defined frameworks. These features enable the even distribution of metal species, which is critical for the catalytic activity in PDH reactions. The presence of Al sites in the zeolite framework also plays a role in facilitating the interaction of metal species. However, the balance between the number of Al atoms and the dispersion of metal species is crucial; too many Al atoms can lead to increased acidity, which can inhibit the desired PDH reaction pathways.

The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design is that there is a need to optimize the synthesis methods to achieve a precise balance between the metal dispersion, the zeolite framework's acidity, and the presence of Al sites. This balance can be achieved by modifying the synthesis conditions, such as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the choice of metal precursors, and the post-synthesis treatments. Additionally, exploring the use of novel metal-zeolite combinations or developing new zeolite topologies with improved properties for metal dispersion might lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH reactions. The key lies in understanding how these structural and compositional factors affect the catalytic performance and then tailoring the catalysts to meet the specific requirements of PDH processes.

Answer: Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI (beta) and BEA (chabazite) topologies, are dominant in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural characteristics that facilitate the even distribution of metal species. High surface area, large pore volumes, and well-defined frameworks of these zeolites enable effective interactions between metal species and the zeolite structure, enhancing catalytic activity. Balancing the number of Al atoms and metal dispersion is crucial for optimal performance. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing synthesis methods to achieve this balance, potentially through the use of novel metal-zeolite combinations or new zeolite topologies. Understanding the impact of structural and compositional factors on catalytic performance is essential for tailoring catalysts to meet PDH process requirements.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法表明，MFI（β）和BEA（查巴兹特）拓扑结构的分子筛在这一应用中占主导地位。它们的有效性源于其独特的结构特性，如高比表面积、大孔体积和明确的框架。这些特征使得金属物种均匀分布，这对于PDH反应中的催化活性至关重要。沸石框架中的Al位点的存在也有助于促进金属物种的相互作用。然而，金属物种与框架酸性的平衡以及Al位点的存在对于催化性能至关重要；过多的Al原子可能导致增加酸性，从而抑制所需的PDH反应途径。

未来PDH催化剂设计的含义在于需要优化合成方法以实现金属分散、沸石框架的酸性和Al位点之间精确的平衡。这可以通过修改合成条件，如SiO2/Al2O3比例、金属前体的选择和后处理来实现。此外，探索新的金属-沸石组合或开发具有改进性质的新型沸石拓扑结构可能有助于更有效地分散金属物种，并提高PDH反应的效率和选择性。关键在于理解这些结构和组成因素如何影响催化性能，然后根据PDH过程的具体要求定制催化剂。
