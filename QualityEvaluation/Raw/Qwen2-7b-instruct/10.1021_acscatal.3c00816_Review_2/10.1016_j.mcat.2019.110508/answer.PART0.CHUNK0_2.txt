[1] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[2] "The preparation method of Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loadings as follows: The Zn/250HZSM-5 with different Zn loadings named as yZn/250HZSM-5 (y represents the nominal Zn loading amount) were also prepared by conventional impregnation method."
[3] "The catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio."
[4] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity."
[5] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the use of impregnation methods to prepare ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites. These methods involve the use of different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios to tailor the catalyst's properties. The structural characteristics of zeolites, specifically their MFI and BEA topologies, are critical as they offer high surface areas and well-defined pore structures, which are essential for the dispersion of metal species. High-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, with their specific surface area and large pore volume, allow for the effective distribution of Zn species, enhancing the catalytic activity. The well-adjusted acidity of these zeolites plays a significant role in improving propylene selectivity and reaction stability by facilitating propylene desorption and reducing side reactions. Furthermore, the literature suggests that small ZnO clusters bonded within the zeolite framework exhibit catalytic activity in PDH reactions. These findings imply that future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the structure and composition of zeolite supports to achieve improved catalytic performance and stability.

在分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的合成方法时，文献强调了使用浸渍法制备ZnO催化剂支持在HZSM-5沸石上。这些方法涉及使用不同的SiO2/Al2O3比率来调整催化剂的性质。沸石的结构特征，特别是它们的MFI和BEA拓扑结构，至关重要，因为它们提供了高比表面积和明确的孔结构，这对于金属物种的分散至关重要。高硅HZSM-5沸石，其特定表面面积和大孔体积，允许Zn物种的有效分布，从而增强催化活性。这些沸石的适中酸性在提高丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性方面起着重要作用，通过促进丙烯脱附并减少副反应。此外，文献表明，与框架内键合的小ZnO簇在PDH反应中表现出催化活性。这些发现暗示，未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在优化沸石载体的结构和组成，以实现改善的催化性能和稳定性。
