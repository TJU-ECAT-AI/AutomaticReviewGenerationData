<p>It is widely known that the catalytic activity of transition metal catalyst is greatly determined by the properties of supports, while the researches on ZnO catalysts supported on various materials in PDH are not enough.</p>
<p>In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH. As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios.</p>
<p>The preparation method of Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loadings as follows: The Zn/250HZSM-5 with different Zn loadings named as yZn/250HZSM-5 (y represents the nominal Zn loading amount) were also prepared by conventional impregnation method.</p>
<p>Comprehensive techniques including N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD and TGA jointly evidence that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites.</p>
<p>This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation methods. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate due to their structural characteristics such as high surface area, large pore volume, well-defined structure, and sparse Al sites. These factors contribute to their effectiveness in PDH by facilitating the dispersion of metal species, reducing side reactions, and enhancing propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. High-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, in particular, are found to be efficient PDH catalysts due to their textural properties, well-defined structure, and adjusted acidity, which help in dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. The small ZnO clusters directly connected to the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are proposed as active phases, contributing to the catalytic activity and stability. The design of highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reactions can benefit from the insights gained from the use of these zeolites and metal loading strategies.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法包括浸渍法。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石由于其结构特征，如高比表面积、大孔体积、明确的结构和稀疏的Al位点，因此在PDH中占据主导地位。这些因素有助于催化性能，通过促进金属物种的分散、减少副反应并增强丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。高硅含量的HZSM-5沸石被发现是高效的PDH催化剂，由于它们的纹理特性、明确的结构和调整的酸性，这有助于分散Zn物种并减少副反应。直接连接到HZSM-5沸石框架的小ZnO簇被提议作为活性相，对催化活性和稳定性有贡献。PDH反应中高效过渡金属催化剂的设计可以从使用这些沸石和负载策略中受益。
