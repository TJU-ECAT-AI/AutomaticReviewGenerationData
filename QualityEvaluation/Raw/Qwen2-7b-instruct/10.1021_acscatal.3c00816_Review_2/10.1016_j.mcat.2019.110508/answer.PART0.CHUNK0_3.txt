[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[3] "Up to now, PtSn [ [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ] and CrOx [ [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ] catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process."
[4] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[5] "Gongs group [ 18 ] employed the Pt-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, wherein the ZnO serving as Lewis acid sites (LAS) were the active phases while Pt only acted as promoter, which showed promising catalytic activity."
[6] "Our group [ 20 ] recently found that the ZnO nanoclusters in Al-free SiBeta support showed great catalytic activity in PDH, confirming that the Lewis acidic ZnO clusters possessed admirable catalytic ability."
[7] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[8] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[9] "The catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
[10] "In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond [ [21] ,[22] ,[23] ]."
[11] "In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the BAS in HZSM-5 are counterproductive by promoting the occurrence of side reactions [ 18 ,26 ,30 ,31 ]."
[12] "They also demonstrated the superiority of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in OPDH [ 33 ], while they just put attention on the acid sites distributions of HZSM-5 and lacked analysis to Zn species."
[13] "Herein, we put forward that this catalyst may similarly be of potential for PDH under oxygen-free condition [ 34 ,35 ], and focus on the comprehensive analysis of the ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in terms of active Zn species and the properties of HZSM-5."
[14] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[15] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."
[16] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."
[17] "Moreover, the catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters in the PDH reaction is proposed."
[18] "This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction."

1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation methods. Zeolites, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, are favored due to their structural characteristics. These zeolites have high specific surface areas, large pore volumes, well-defined structures, and low aluminum content, which promote the dispersion of metal species throughout the support. The effectiveness of these catalysts stems from their ability to provide appropriate acidic conditions, facilitate the interaction of metal species with the zeolite framework, and minimize the aggregation of metal oxides into bulk particles on the zeolite surface. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions.

2. Metal-zeolite catalysts with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH reactions due to their unique structural features. MFI zeolites, with their cubic structure and large pores, allow for the dispersion of metal species, leading to increased catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, featuring tetrahedral and octahedral cavities, offer a versatile platform for metal incorporation, enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Their well-defined structures and controlled pore sizes enable better control over the metal loading and dispersion, optimizing the catalytic performance for PDH. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the exploration of zeolite frameworks with tailored topologies that can further enhance the dispersion of metal species, reduce aggregation, and improve the overall stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

1. PDH反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括浸渍法。特别是具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，由于其独特的结构特性而被青睐。这些沸石具有高比表面积、大孔体积、明确的结构以及低铝含量，这有助于金属物种在整个支撑材料中的均匀分布。这些催化剂的有效性源于它们能够提供合适的酸性条件、促进金属物种与沸石骨架的相互作用，并最小化金属氧化物在沸石表面聚集成大块的趋势。这导致了PDH反应中增强的催化活性和稳定性。

2. 在PDH反应中，具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石催化剂占据主导地位，主要是由于它们独特的结构特征。MFI沸石，其立方结构和大孔，允许金属物种的分散，从而提高了催化活性。BEA沸石，拥有四面体和八面体腔室，为金属的整合提供了灵活的平台，增强了催化剂的选择性和稳定性。它们明确的结构和可控的孔尺寸使对金属负载和分散进行更好的控制成为可能，优化了催化剂的整体性能。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展趋势而言，探索具有定制拓扑结构的沸石，以进一步提高金属物种的分散、减少聚集并改善催化剂的整体稳定性和选择性具有重要意义。
