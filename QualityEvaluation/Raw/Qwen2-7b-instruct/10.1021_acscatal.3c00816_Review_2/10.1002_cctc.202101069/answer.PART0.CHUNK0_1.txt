The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in this application due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, like silicalite-1 (S-1), offer a framework without strong acidity, facilitating the dispersion and stabilization of active metal species. BEA zeolites, with their higher surface area and more accessible metal sites, can also enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions. The interaction between silanol nests in the zeolite support and metal species plays a crucial role in maintaining their dispersion and preventing aggregation under reaction conditions, which contributes to the catalyst's high activity and stability. This synergy between the zeolite structure and metal species allows for the development of highly efficient PDH catalysts that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional Pt and CrOx-based catalysts.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法采用浸渍技术。具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在该应用中占据主导地位，这是由于它们的独特结构特性。MFI沸石，如硅铝沸石（S-1），提供了一个无强酸性的框架，有利于活性金属物种的分散和稳定化。BEA沸石，其比表面积更高且更易于访问的金属位点，也可以增强PDH反应的效率。沸石支持上的硅醇巢与金属物种之间的相互作用对维持其分散和防止聚合起着关键作用，这有助于催化剂的高活性和稳定性。这种由沸石结构和金属物种之间的协同作用允许开发高效、成本低廉且环境友好的PDH催化剂，作为传统铂和CrOx基催化剂的有效替代品。
