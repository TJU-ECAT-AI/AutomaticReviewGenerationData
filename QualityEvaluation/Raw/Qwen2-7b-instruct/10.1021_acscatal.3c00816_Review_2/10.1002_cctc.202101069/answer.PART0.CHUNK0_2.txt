Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in this application. Zeolites with MFI topology, like silicalite-1 (S-1), and BEA topology are favored due to their unique structure and properties. MFI zeolites, such as S-1, have a framework without strong acidity, which contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. The BEA topology zeolites, like Beta zeolite, are known for anchoring well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters, showing high activity and propylene selectivity. The synthesis methods for these catalysts vary, including in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for constructing Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1, where partially reduced zinc cations are identified as the active sites. The use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH catalysts is advantageous because they can effectively disperse and stabilize active metal species, enhancing the catalytic performance. The structural characteristics, such as the presence of abundant defects in S-1 zeolite, and the interaction between silanol nests and metal species, play crucial roles in maintaining the stability and efficiency of the catalysts. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to better control the dispersion and stabilization of active metal species, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance and selectivity in PDH reactions.
