[1] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface."
[2] "The important roles of TS-1 as the support could be ascribed to the framework titanium, which localizes Pt and Zn together, increasing the dispersion degree of Pt and improving its modification by Zn, as indicated by CO adsorption IR spectra as well as C3H6-TPD."
[3] "On the other hand, non-framework titanium species have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst."
[4] "The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst is not only very highly active, selective, and catalytically durable, but also economically applicable for industrial DHP applications, as the catalyst could be obtained via a simple impregnation process and TS-1 zeolite synthesis is easy and low-cost."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is evident that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics and the advantageous properties they confer on the catalysts. MFI zeolites, with their medium pore size, facilitate efficient mass transfer and provide optimal accessibility for reactants and products, while BEA zeolites, characterized by their larger pore size, enhance the diffusion of reactants and products through the zeolite framework. The presence of titanium in the zeolite framework plays a pivotal role in enhancing the dispersion of metals like platinum (Pt) and zinc (Zn) on the catalyst surface. This results in improved activity, selectivity, and durability of the catalyst, as demonstrated by CO adsorption IR spectroscopy and C3H6-TPD. The localized Pt and Zn together, thanks to the strong interaction with the framework titanium, leads to an increased dispersion degree of Pt, which is crucial for the activation of paraffinic CH bonds and the prevention of coke deposition. However, the presence of non-framework titanium species negatively impacts the catalyst's activity. The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst showcases remarkable activity, selectivity, and durability, making it suitable for industrial applications in PDH processes. Its synthesis involves a simple impregnation process, and the preparation of TS-1 zeolite is straightforward and cost-effective, further enhancing its practicality in industrial settings.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，用于合成金属-沸石催化剂的主要方法分析显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这得益于它们的独特结构特性和对催化剂的有利属性。MFI沸石的中等孔径有助于高效的物质传输，并提供了理想的反应物和产物的可接近性，而BEA沸石的较大孔径则增强了通过沸石框架的反应物和产物的扩散。沸石中的钛的存在在增强铂（Pt）和锌（Zn）在催化剂表面的分散方面起着关键作用。这导致了活性、选择性和耐久性显著提高的催化剂，正如由CO吸附红外光谱和C3H6-TPD所证明的那样。框架钛与Pt和Zn的局部化一起，导致Pt的分散度增加，这对于激活paraffinic CH键和防止焦炭沉积至关重要。然而，非框架钛物种的存在会负面影响催化剂的活性。0.02TS-170催化剂的PtZn展现了出色的活性、选择性和耐久性，使其适用于PDH过程的工业应用。其合成涉及简单的浸渍过程，而TS-1沸石的制备既简单又成本效益高，进一步提高了其在工业环境中的实用性。
