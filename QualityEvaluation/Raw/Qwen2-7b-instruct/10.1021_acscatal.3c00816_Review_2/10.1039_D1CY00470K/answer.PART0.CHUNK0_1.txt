[1] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface."
[2] "As a result, it greatly enhanced the activity and the catalytic durability of the catalyst."
[3] "On the other hand, non-framework titanium species have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst."
[4] "The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst is not only very highly active, selective, and catalytically durable, but also economically applicable for industrial DHP applications, as the catalyst could be obtained via a simple impregnation process and TS-1 zeolite synthesis is easy and low-cost."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation processes, typically utilizing solutions of metal salts. Metal-zeolite catalysts are favored for PDH reactions due to their unique structural characteristics. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies are dominant in this application because they offer high surface areas, well-defined pore structures, and a high number of acid sites, which are crucial for efficient PDH reactions. The MFI topology, with its octagonal channels, and the BEA topology, with its cubic cages, facilitate the separation of products and reactants, minimizing unwanted side reactions. The presence of silanol groups on the zeolite surface can affect catalyst durability, and thus, strategies are employed to minimize their presence, such as using zeolites with lower levels of isolated silanol groups. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to improve metal dispersion, enhance metal-support interactions, and further reduce undesirable surface functionalities to prolong catalyst life and improve efficiency.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法通常采用溶液浸渍法，利用金属盐溶液。由于其独特的结构特征，金属-沸石催化剂被首选用于PDH反应。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，因为它们提供高表面积、明确的孔结构和大量的酸性位点，这对于高效的PDH反应至关重要。MFI拓扑结构具有八边形通道，而BEA拓扑结构具有立方笼，有助于产物和反应物的分离，减少不必要的副反应。沸石表面的硅醇基团可能会影响催化剂的耐用性，因此可以采取策略来减少这些基团的存在，例如使用具有较低孤立硅醇基团水平的沸石。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成方法以提高金属分散度、增强金属-支撑相互作用，并进一步减少不希望的表面功能，以延长催化剂寿命并提高效率。
