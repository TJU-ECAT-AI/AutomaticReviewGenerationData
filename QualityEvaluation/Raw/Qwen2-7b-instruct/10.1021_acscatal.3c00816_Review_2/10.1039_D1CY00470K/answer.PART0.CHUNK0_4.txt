The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of zeolites with MFI and BEA topological structures. Zeolites are favored due to their high surface area, regular pore structure, and ability to control metal dispersion. MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred because they offer optimal conditions for metal loading and dispersion, which are crucial for PDH reactions. Their microporous nature ensures efficient mass transfer, while the regular pore size facilitates the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Additionally, the zeolite framework can interact with metal ions, influencing their electronic structure and promoting catalytic activity. Non-framework titanium species negatively affect the catalyst's activity, while framework titanium plays a crucial role in enhancing dispersion, modifying the metal's electronic structure, and reducing undesirable residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. This leads to improved activity and durability of the catalyst. The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst demonstrates high activity, selectivity, durability, and economic feasibility for industrial PDH applications, showcasing the benefits of using zeolites with specific topologies in catalysis.
