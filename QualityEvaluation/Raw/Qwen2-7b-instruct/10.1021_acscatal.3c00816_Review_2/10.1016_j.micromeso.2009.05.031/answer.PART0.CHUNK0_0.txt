[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
[3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[4] "The amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[5] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the document highlights that micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials are employed. The synthesis involves incipient wetness impregnation, leading to the incorporation of Pt nanoparticles within the zeolite structures. These catalysts exhibit distinct pore geometries, with ZSM-5 and Beta having smaller pore sizes compared to SBA-15. The activity of these catalysts for PDH decreases with an increase in pore size, as evidenced by the propane conversion rates (ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15). Additionally, the coke formation during PDH is highest on ZSM-5 and lowest on Beta, indicating better catalytic stability for Beta compared to ZSM-5 and SBA-15. The study concludes that three-dimensional microporous materials are superior for PDH due to their ability to induce optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites, outperforming the mesoporous SBA-15 in terms of activity and stability.

对用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法进行分析，文献指出使用微孔（Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta）和介孔（Pt-SBA-15）多孔材料。合成方法采用浸渍湿法，导致铂纳米颗粒嵌入沸石结构中。这些催化剂具有不同的孔几何形状，其中ZSM-5和Beta的孔径较小，与SBA-15相比。随着支撑体孔径的增加，PDH的活性降低，从ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15的丙烷转化率可以看出。此外，在PDH过程中形成的焦炭量在ZSM-5最高，在Beta最低，表明Beta相对于ZSM-5和SBA-15具有更好的催化稳定性。研究得出结论，三维微孔材料对于PDH而言更为优越，因为它们能够诱导铂位点的最佳催化性能，优于介孔SBA-15在活动性和稳定性方面。
