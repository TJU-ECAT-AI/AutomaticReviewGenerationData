[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[3] "Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selectivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their distinct structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, exemplified by Pt-ZSM-5, offer a high surface area and a well-defined pore structure, which are crucial for efficient PDH reactions. Similarly, BEA zeolites, like Pt-Beta, also possess unique pore geometries that facilitate the desired catalytic properties. The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design lies in optimizing these structural characteristics to enhance activity, selectivity, and stability, particularly in reducing coke formation. This approach ensures more efficient propane conversion to propylene while maintaining catalytic stability.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，文献指出MFI和BEA拓扑沸石占主导地位，这是由于它们独特的结构特征。MFI沸石，以Pt-ZSM-5为例，提供了高比表面积和清晰的孔隙结构，这对于高效的PDH反应至关重要。同样，BEA沸石，如Pt-Beta，也具有独特的孔隙几何形状，有助于实现所需催化性能。对于未来PDH催化剂设计的启示在于优化这些结构特性，以提高活性、选择性和稳定性，特别是减少焦炭形成。这确保了丙烷更高效地转化为丙烯，同时保持催化剂稳定性。
