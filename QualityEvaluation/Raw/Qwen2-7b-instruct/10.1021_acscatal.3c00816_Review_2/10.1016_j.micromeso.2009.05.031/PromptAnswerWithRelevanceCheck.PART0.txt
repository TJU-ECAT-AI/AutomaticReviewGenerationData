[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size)."
[3] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."
[4] "The amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[5] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the document highlights that micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials are employed. The synthesis involves incipient wetness impregnation, leading to the incorporation of Pt nanoparticles within the zeolite structures. These catalysts exhibit distinct pore geometries, with ZSM-5 and Beta having smaller pore sizes compared to SBA-15. The activity of these catalysts for PDH decreases with an increase in pore size, as evidenced by the propane conversion rates (ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15). Additionally, the coke formation during PDH is highest on ZSM-5 and lowest on Beta, indicating better catalytic stability for Beta compared to ZSM-5 and SBA-15. The study concludes that three-dimensional microporous materials are superior for PDH due to their ability to induce optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites, outperforming the mesoporous SBA-15 in terms of activity and stability.

对用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法进行分析，文献指出使用微孔（Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta）和介孔（Pt-SBA-15）多孔材料。合成方法采用浸渍湿法，导致铂纳米颗粒嵌入沸石结构中。这些催化剂具有不同的孔几何形状，其中ZSM-5和Beta的孔径较小，与SBA-15相比。随着支撑体孔径的增加，PDH的活性降低，从ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15的丙烷转化率可以看出。此外，在PDH过程中形成的焦炭量在ZSM-5最高，在Beta最低，表明Beta相对于ZSM-5和SBA-15具有更好的催化稳定性。研究得出结论，三维微孔材料对于PDH而言更为优越，因为它们能够诱导铂位点的最佳催化性能，优于介孔SBA-15在活动性和稳定性方面。

1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques, specifically incipient wetness impregnation. These methods are used to incorporate the metal (in this case, platinum) into the zeolite framework.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas, which are crucial for efficient catalysis. MFI zeolites have cylindrical pores that allow for better control of the size of reactants and products, enhancing selectivity to propylene. BEA zeolites, with their cubic cages, offer an environment that stabilizes the active metal sites, improving both activity and stability.

3. The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites, including their pore sizes and shapes, significantly contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Their three-dimensional microporous structure enables optimal interaction between the metal sites and the reactants, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity. The high surface area and controlled pore size distribution facilitate more effective adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, minimizing unwanted side reactions such as coking.

4. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the pore geometry and metal loading to achieve a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability. This could involve creating novel zeolite frameworks with tailored pore architectures or developing new metal-support interactions that exploit the unique properties of zeolite materials.

5. The use of three-dimensional microporous materials as opposed to mesoporous materials like SBA-15 is advantageous in PDH applications due to their intrinsic ability to induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The intrinsic nature of these materials facilitates better control over the reaction pathways, leading to higher propane conversion rates, improved selectivity to propylene, and better stability against coke formation.

1. 金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法是浸渍技术，特别是湿浸渍法。这些方法用于将金属（在此情况下为铂）整合到沸石骨架中。

2. MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，这是由于它们独特的孔结构和高表面积，这对于高效的催化作用至关重要。MFI沸石具有柱状孔，可以更好地控制反应物和产物的大小，增强丙烯选择性。而BEA沸石的立方笼则能够稳定活性金属位点，提高活性和稳定性。

3. MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征，包括其孔径大小和形状，显著促进了PDH反应的有效性。其三维微孔结构允许更有效的吸附和脱附反应物和产物，从而减少了非期望的副反应，如焦碳形成。高表面面积和可控的孔径分布使得更有效地控制反应路径成为可能，进而提高了丙烷转化率、选择性到丙烯以及稳定性。

4. 在PDH催化剂设计的未来发展中，应侧重于优化孔几何形状和金属负载，以实现活性、选择性和稳定性的平衡。这可能涉及创建具有定制孔结构的新沸石框架或开发利用沸石材料独特性质的新金属-支持相互作用。

5. 相比于介孔材料如SBA-15，使用三维微孔材料作为PDH应用的催化剂是有优势的，因为它们固有的能力能够诱导铂位点的最优催化特性。这些材料的内在特性有助于更好地控制反应途径，导致更高的丙烷转化率、更好的丙烯选择性以及更好的稳定性。

The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is incipient wetness impregnation. This technique allows the metal (in this case, Pt) to be evenly distributed within the zeolite framework. The study highlights that MFI and BEA topological zeolites are dominant in PDH applications due to their intrinsic nature which induces optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The structural characteristics of these zeolites, particularly their pore geometry, play a crucial role in their effectiveness. The MFI and BEA zeolites, being three-dimensional microporous materials, offer superior catalytic performance compared to the mesoporous SBA-15 material. This superiority is attributed to their ability to provide an optimal environment for Pt sites, enhancing the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while minimizing coke formation.

The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves incipient wetness impregnation. This process allows the incorporation of metal species, such as platinum (Pt), into the zeolite framework. The characterization of these catalysts includes nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and hydrogen chemisorption. These techniques reveal that the catalysts contain Pt nanoparticles within the zeolite pores, with similar sizes but different stabilization due to the distinct pore geometries (structure and size) of the different zeolites.

Among the catalysts tested—Pt-ZSM-5, Pt-Beta, and Pt-SBA-15—the three-dimensional microporous materials, specifically Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, outperform the mesoporous material, Pt-SBA-15. This superiority is attributed to their intrinsic nature, which facilitates optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites. Specifically, Pt-ZSM-5 demonstrates the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and then Pt-SBA-15, with an activity decrease correlating with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15).

Regarding the formation of coke during PDH, Pt-ZSM-5 generates the highest amount, while Pt-Beta produces the least, indicating that Pt-Beta exhibits better catalytic stability compared to Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15. Despite the higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 still shows superior selectivity and stability compared to Pt-SBA-15, highlighting the importance of pore geometry in determining the effectiveness of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on leveraging the unique properties of three-dimensional microporous materials, such as ZSM-5 and Beta, to enhance selectivity, stability, and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation processes.

主要合成方法是利用浸渍湿法将金属，如铂（Pt），引入沸石框架中。这些催化剂的表征包括氮物理吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）和氢化物化学吸附。这些技术显示催化剂在沸石孔内含有大小相似但稳定在明显不同的孔几何结构（结构和尺寸）的Pt纳米颗粒。

在测试的催化剂中——Pt-ZSM-5、Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15，三维微孔材料，尤其是Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta，优于微孔材料Pt-SBA-15。这种优越性归因于它们内在的性质，这促进了Pt位点的最佳催化性能。具体来说，Pt-ZSM-5表现出最高的丙烷转化率，然后是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15，活动度随支撑体孔径的增大而降低（ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15）。

关于PDH过程中焦炭的形成，在Pt-ZSM-5中生成最多，在Pt-Beta中生成最少，表明Pt-Beta具有更好的催化稳定性，与Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-SBA-15相比。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5仍然显示出与Pt-SBA-15相比的更高选择性和稳定性，强调了孔几何结构在确定金属-沸石催化剂PDH反应效能中的重要性。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在利用ZSM-5和Beta等三维微孔材料的独特性质，以增强丙烷脱氢过程的选择性、稳定性和效率。
