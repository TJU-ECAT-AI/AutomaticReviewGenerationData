The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves incipient wetness impregnation. This process allows the incorporation of metal species, such as platinum (Pt), into the zeolite framework. The characterization of these catalysts includes nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and hydrogen chemisorption. These techniques reveal that the catalysts contain Pt nanoparticles within the zeolite pores, with similar sizes but different stabilization due to the distinct pore geometries (structure and size) of the different zeolites.

Among the catalysts tested—Pt-ZSM-5, Pt-Beta, and Pt-SBA-15—the three-dimensional microporous materials, specifically Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, outperform the mesoporous material, Pt-SBA-15. This superiority is attributed to their intrinsic nature, which facilitates optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites. Specifically, Pt-ZSM-5 demonstrates the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and then Pt-SBA-15, with an activity decrease correlating with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15).

Regarding the formation of coke during PDH, Pt-ZSM-5 generates the highest amount, while Pt-Beta produces the least, indicating that Pt-Beta exhibits better catalytic stability compared to Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15. Despite the higher coke content, Pt-ZSM-5 still shows superior selectivity and stability compared to Pt-SBA-15, highlighting the importance of pore geometry in determining the effectiveness of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on leveraging the unique properties of three-dimensional microporous materials, such as ZSM-5 and Beta, to enhance selectivity, stability, and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation processes.

主要合成方法是利用浸渍湿法将金属，如铂（Pt），引入沸石框架中。这些催化剂的表征包括氮物理吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）和氢化物化学吸附。这些技术显示催化剂在沸石孔内含有大小相似但稳定在明显不同的孔几何结构（结构和尺寸）的Pt纳米颗粒。

在测试的催化剂中——Pt-ZSM-5、Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15，三维微孔材料，尤其是Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-Beta，优于微孔材料Pt-SBA-15。这种优越性归因于它们内在的性质，这促进了Pt位点的最佳催化性能。具体来说，Pt-ZSM-5表现出最高的丙烷转化率，然后是Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15，活动度随支撑体孔径的增大而降低（ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15）。

关于PDH过程中焦炭的形成，在Pt-ZSM-5中生成最多，在Pt-Beta中生成最少，表明Pt-Beta具有更好的催化稳定性，与Pt-ZSM-5和Pt-SBA-15相比。尽管焦炭含量较高，但Pt-ZSM-5仍然显示出与Pt-SBA-15相比的更高选择性和稳定性，强调了孔几何结构在确定金属-沸石催化剂PDH反应效能中的重要性。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在利用ZSM-5和Beta等三维微孔材料的独特性质，以增强丙烷脱氢过程的选择性、稳定性和效率。
