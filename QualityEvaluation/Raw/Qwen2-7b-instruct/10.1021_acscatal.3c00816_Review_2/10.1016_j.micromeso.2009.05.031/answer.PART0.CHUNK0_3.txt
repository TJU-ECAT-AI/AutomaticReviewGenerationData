The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is incipient wetness impregnation. This technique allows the metal (in this case, Pt) to be evenly distributed within the zeolite framework. The study highlights that MFI and BEA topological zeolites are dominant in PDH applications due to their intrinsic nature which induces optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites. The structural characteristics of these zeolites, particularly their pore geometry, play a crucial role in their effectiveness. The MFI and BEA zeolites, being three-dimensional microporous materials, offer superior catalytic performance compared to the mesoporous SBA-15 material. This superiority is attributed to their ability to provide an optimal environment for Pt sites, enhancing the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while minimizing coke formation.

主要合成方法是浸渍湿法，这种技术允许将金属（在此情况下为Pt）均匀分布于沸石骨架中。研究表明，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在应用中占主导地位，这主要是由于它们内在的性质，能够诱导Pt位点的最佳催化性能。这些沸石的结构特征，特别是孔隙几何形状，对它们的有效性起着关键作用。MFI和BEA沸石作为三维微孔材料，相比介孔SBA-15材料提供了更优的催化性能。这种优越性归因于它们为Pt位点提供了一个优化的环境，从而促进丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少焦炭形成。
