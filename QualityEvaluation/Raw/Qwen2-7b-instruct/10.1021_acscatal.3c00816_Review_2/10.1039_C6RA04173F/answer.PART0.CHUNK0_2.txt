[1] "Recently, catalytic propane dehydrogenation has received more and more attention because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Meanwhile, it is known that the equilibrium conversion limited by thermodynamics can increase with the temperature."
[3] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The substitution of Ce reduces the intensity of weak acid sites of the catalyst and increases the catalytic capacity to resist coke."
[5] "In addition, appropriate content of Ce in the support can not only stabilize the Pt nanoparticles, but also strengthen the interaction between tin species and the support."
[6] "In this way, homogeneous dispersion of metallic particles and the reduction hindrance of tin species can be observed, which is beneficial to promote the migration of the coke from active sites to the support."

The synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily employs hydrothermal methods, which involve the synthesis of zeolites under high-pressure conditions in an autoclave. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are favored in PDH due to their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. Their cubic or tetragonal frameworks provide uniform and regular pore sizes, ideal for PDH reactions. The high porosity and surface area allow for an efficient distribution of metal particles, enhancing the catalytic activity. The structural characteristics of these zeolites, combined with the incorporation of metal species, enable them to efficiently convert propane into propene with high selectivity and stability. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on refining the synthesis methods to achieve more precise control over the zeolite framework and metal loading, optimizing the catalyst for improved activity, selectivity, and durability. The use of rare earth elements like cerium in the zeolite framework can further improve the catalyst's resistance to coke formation, contributing to enhanced stability and longevity of the catalyst.

金属-沸石催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的合成主要采用高压水热法，即在压力容器中对沸石进行合成。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石因其明确的孔结构和高表面积而受到青睐，在PDH过程中被广泛使用。它们的立方或四方框架提供了均匀和规则的孔径大小，非常适合PDH反应。高孔隙率和表面积使得金属粒子分布更为均匀，从而增强催化活性。这些沸石的结构特征，结合金属物种的整合，使它们能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，并保持高选择性和稳定性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在细化合成方法，以实现对沸石框架和金属负载更精确的控制，优化催化剂以提高活性、选择性和耐久性。在沸石基质中引入稀土元素如铈可以进一步提高催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力，从而增加其稳定性和寿命。
