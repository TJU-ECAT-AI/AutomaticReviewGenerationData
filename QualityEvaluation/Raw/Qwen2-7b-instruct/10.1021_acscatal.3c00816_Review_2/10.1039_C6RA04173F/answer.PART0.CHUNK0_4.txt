The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve hydrothermal synthesis and impregnation. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique physical properties. MFI zeolites, specifically, have hexagonal mesoporous structures with high surface areas and pore volumes, which enhance the accessibility of reactants and products. The BEA topology offers additional flexibility in pore size and shape. These zeolites can incorporate metal species into their frameworks, creating active sites for PDH reactions. The incorporation of metals like platinum and tin into the zeolite structure modifies the electronic properties and catalytic performance, making them highly effective for PDH. The use of cerium in the synthesis of these zeolites further enhances the catalysts' performance by improving dispersion of metal particles, reducing acidity, and promoting the migration of coke from metal sites to the support, thus improving stability and selectivity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing metal loading, enhancing metal-support interactions, and exploring new zeolite topologies or metal combinations to further improve performance and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括水热合成和浸渍法。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，这归功于它们独特的物理性质。MFI沸石具有六边形介孔结构、高比表面积和孔体积，这增强了反应物和产物的可接近性。而BEA拓扑结构则提供了孔径大小和形状的额外灵活性。这些沸石可以将铂和锡等金属物种引入其骨架中，形成活性位点以促进PDH反应。在沸石中引入金属，如铂和锡，修改了电子特性和催化性能，使其非常有效。在合成这些沸石时加入铈进一步提高了催化剂的性能，通过改善金属粒子的分散度、降低酸性并促进碳沉积从金属位点向支撑迁移，从而提高稳定性和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化金属负载、增强金属-支撑相互作用以及探索新的沸石拓扑结构或金属组合，以进一步提高性能和选择性。
