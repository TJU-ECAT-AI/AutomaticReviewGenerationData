[1] "Recently, catalytic propane dehydrogenation has received more and more attention because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Meanwhile, it is known that the equilibrium conversion limited by thermodynamics can increase with the temperature."
[3] "However, such severe conditions result in major challenges of hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease the catalyst stability and reaction selectivity."
[4] "Therefore, much effort has been done to develop catalysts with improved reaction performance."
[5] "ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The presence of Sn can not only decrease the size of platinum ensembles (geometric effect), but also modify the electronic density of Pt (electronic effect)."
[7] "Our previous work studied the synthesis methods, characterization and reaction properties of the tin and zinc modified ZSM-5 supported platinum catalysts."
[8] "However, conventional preparation method (ion-exchange or impregnation) may lead to the possible loss in the degree of crystallinity of Ce-containing zeolite."
[9] "The substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
[10] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."
[11] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
[12] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce reduces the intensity of weak acid sites of the catalyst and increases the catalytic capacity to resist coke."
[13] "In this way, homogeneous dispersion of metallic particles and the reduction hindrance of tin species can be observed, which is beneficial to promote the migration of the coke from active sites to the support."
[14] "In the current study, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the highest reaction activity and stability."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involve hydrothermal synthesis and impregnation. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate due to their unique physical properties that facilitate catalysis. Their structures allow for efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants, enhancing PDH efficiency. The incorporation of metals like tin (Sn) and cerium (Ce) into the zeolite framework modifies their electronic and geometric properties, improving catalyst performance. The Ce incorporation specifically reduces the catalyst's weak acidity, aiding in coke migration and enhancing resistance to coke formation. The optimal Ce content of 0.76 wt% in the support maximizes PDH activity and stability, achieving high propene selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括水热合成和浸渍法。具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石因其独特的物理特性而主导这一应用领域，这些特性有助于催化作用。它们的结构允许有效吸附和脱附反应物，从而提高PDH效率。将金属如锡（Sn）和铈（Ce）引入沸石骨架中修改了其电子和几何性质，改善了催化剂性能。Ce的引入特别降低了催化剂的弱酸性，有助于焦炭迁移并增强对焦炭形成的抵抗力。支持中Ce含量为0.76 wt%，可最大化PDH活性和稳定性，实现高丙烯选择性。
