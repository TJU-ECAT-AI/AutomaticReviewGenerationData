[1] "Recently, catalytic propane dehydrogenation has received more and more attention because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Meanwhile, it is known that the equilibrium conversion limited by thermodynamics can increase with the temperature."
[3] "However, such severe conditions result in major challenges of hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease the catalyst stability and reaction selectivity."
[4] "Among the several reported catalysts, bimetallic PtSn ones exhibit relatively high reaction activities,2,8,9 which have been commercialized by UOP."
[5] "Furthermore, over the PtSn catalyst, the addition of a third metal has been reported to be effective to improve the catalytic properties, and examples of enhanced trimetallic catalysts for dehydrogenation can be easily found (PtSnM based catalyst, M = Na, K, Ca and La)."
[6] "Our previous work17,22 studied the synthesis methods, characterization and reaction properties of the tin and zinc modified ZSM-5 supported platinum catalysts."
[7] "In the present work, series of Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
[9] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
[10] "Our previous work17,22 studied the synthesis methods, characterization and reaction properties of the tin and zinc modified ZSM-5 supported platinum catalysts."
[11] "Based on the obtained results, the superior catalytic performance of the Ce-ZSM-5 supported catalyst was theoretically explained."

Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites are particularly effective due to their structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, with their channel and cage structures, facilitate the transport of reactants and products, improving the reaction kinetics. BEA zeolites, known for their large micropores, offer high surface areas for adsorption and desorption processes, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. Their high thermal stability, resistance to coke formation, and ability to tune acidity levels through modification make them valuable in PDH applications. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing these structural features, incorporating advanced materials, and exploring novel synthesis techniques to achieve higher activity, selectivity, and durability.
