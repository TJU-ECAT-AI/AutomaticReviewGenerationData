Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural characteristics. Zeolites with MFI topology, such as Beta and ZSM-5, and those with BEA topology, like Beta and MCM-22, are extensively used because of their high surface area, pore size, and regular pore structure, which facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. 

MFI topology zeolites, like Beta, are characterized by their cubic channels and square-ring pore openings, allowing for efficient adsorption of alkane molecules. BEA topology zeolites, such as MCM-22, have cylindrical pores, which enhance the separation of different reaction products.

These zeolites, when loaded with metals like Pt, Cr, Ga, In, etc., enable the dehydrogenation of paraffins into olefins by providing active sites for the reaction. The metal loading and the specific interaction between the metal and the zeolite framework play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The zeolite's ability to stabilize the metal species, prevent agglomeration, and control the reaction pathways contributes to their effectiveness in PDH.

For future developments, researchers aim to optimize the metal loading, support materials, and synthesis methods to enhance the catalyst's performance. The goal is to achieve higher conversion rates, longer catalyst lifetimes, and improved selectivity to desired products. This includes exploring new metal-zeolite combinations, modifying zeolite structures, and developing novel synthesis techniques to tailor the catalyst's properties.

In terms of implications for PDH catalyst design, there is a growing interest in creating catalysts with tailored pore structures and compositions to match specific reaction conditions. The integration of promoters, additives, and support materials is also being explored to boost the catalyst's activity and stability. Advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, are enabling a deeper understanding of the catalyst's behavior during the reaction, guiding the development of more efficient catalysts.

金属-沸石催化剂，特别是具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中占据主导地位，这归功于它们的独特结构特性。具有MFI拓扑结构的沸石，如Beta和ZSM-5，以及具有BEA拓扑结构的沸石，如Beta和MCM-22，被广泛使用，因为它们具有高表面积、孔径和规则的孔结构，能够促进反应物和产物的吸附和扩散。

MFI拓扑结构的沸石，如Beta，以其立方通道和正方形环孔开口为特征，这使得烷烃分子的有效吸附成为可能。BEA拓扑结构的沸石，如MCM-22，具有圆柱形孔道，这增强了不同反应产物的分离。

当这些沸石负载金属，如Pt、Cr、Ga、In等时，它们能够通过提供反应所需的活性位点来实现烷烃向烯烃的脱氢。金属负载量和金属与沸石框架之间的特定相互作用在决定催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。沸石稳定金属物种的能力、防止聚集并控制反应途径的能力，是它们在PDH中有效性的关键因素。

对于未来的开发，研究人员致力于优化金属负载量、支持材料和合成方法，以提高催化剂性能。目标是实现更高的转化率、更长的催化剂寿命和更优的产品选择性。这包括探索新的金属-沸石组合、修改沸石结构以及开发新型合成技术，以定制催化剂的性质。

关于PDH催化剂设计的影响，对具有特定反应条件相匹配的定制孔结构和组成的催化剂的兴趣正在增加。对催化剂性能的理解正在通过操作原位光谱等先进表征技术得到深化，这正在指导开发更高效的催化剂。
