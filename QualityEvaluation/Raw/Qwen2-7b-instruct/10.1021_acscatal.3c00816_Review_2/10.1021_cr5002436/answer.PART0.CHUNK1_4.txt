[1] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[2] "The presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site."
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation (vide supra)."

1. Strategies to control coke formation include using supports with low Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites. A small amount of coke can enhance catalytic activity by aiding alkane adsorption near active sites.

2. Surface carbon deposits can sometimes positively impact catalyst performance. A slight coke layer might boost activity by promoting alkane adsorption near active sites.

3. Metal oxide catalysts deactivate more rapidly than Pt catalysts at higher space velocities. This indicates the exceptional stability of Pt catalysts.

4. Despite considerable research on alternatives like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, a viable substitute for PtSn and CrOx systems has not been discovered.

5. Operando spectroscopy techniques can optimize dehydrogenation and regeneration phases, maintaining catalyst activity. Moderate coke layers aid dehydrogenation, but excessive amounts lead to deactivation.

1. 控制焦炭形成的策略包括使用酸性位点含量低或无的支撑材料，或者毒化酸性位点。表面少量焦炭层可能会通过促进烷烃在活性脱氢位点附近的吸附来增强催化活性。

2. 表面碳沉积物有时可以对催化剂性能产生正面影响。轻微的焦炭层可能通过促进烷烃吸附到活性位点附近来提升活性。

3. 在更高空间速度下，金属氧化物催化剂比铂催化剂更快失活。这表明铂催化剂具有卓越的稳定性。

4. 尽管过去几十年对替代品如GaOx、MoOx和VOx进行了大量研究，但尚未找到一种可行的PtSn和CrOx系统的替代品。

5. 运行态光谱技术可以动态调整脱氢和再生阶段，保持催化剂处于最活跃状态。适度的焦炭层有助于脱氢，但过量的焦炭会导致催化剂失活。
