<p>In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.</p>
<p>Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation onto zeolite supports. Metal-zeolite catalysts are favored for their high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structures. MFI zeolites feature a cubic unit cell with channels and cages that are ideal for accommodating metal ions, providing a high surface area and pore volume. This structure allows for the effective dispersion of metal ions, enhancing their catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, on the other hand, possess a tetrahedral framework with larger cages, offering even more space for metal ions. Their structure enables the formation of more active sites, contributing to higher catalytic performance. The combination of zeolite supports with metal ions creates a heterogeneous catalyst that exhibits both high stability and efficiency in PDH reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include exploring new metal-zeolite combinations, optimizing zeolite topologies, and enhancing the stability and durability of the catalysts to withstand the harsh conditions of the PDH process. These advancements aim to increase the yield of propylene while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法是通过浸渍到沸石载体上。金属-沸石催化剂因其在PDH反应中表现出的高活性和选择性而受到青睐。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，主要是因为它们独特的结构。MFI沸石具有立方单元格，其中包含通道和笼子，适合容纳金属离子，提供高比表面积和孔体积。这种结构允许有效分散金属离子，增强其催化活性。而BEA沸石则拥有四面体骨架和更大的笼子，提供了更多的空间来容纳金属离子。其结构允许形成更多活性位点，从而提高催化性能。金属与沸石的组合形成一种异质催化剂，既具有高稳定性，又在PDH反应中表现出高效性。未来PDH催化剂设计的前景包括探索新的金属-沸石组合、优化沸石拓扑结构以及提高催化剂的稳定性和耐用性，以应对PDH过程的苛刻条件。这些进步旨在增加丙烯产量的同时，减少能耗并降低环境影响。
