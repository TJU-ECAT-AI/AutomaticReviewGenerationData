1. The most common methods for obtaining light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. Propane dehydrogenation is profitable due to the significant price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable. Butadiene prices have sharply increased due to increased demand from the automotive industry and decreased supply due to high naphtha cracking costs. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for most of the propylene production. Ethane from shale gas deposits has led to a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking in the US, with new PDH installations being constructed in China, Japan, and the US using technologies like Catofin and Oleflex. 

2. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, making current market conditions advantageous. The majority of new PDH facilities will be established in China or the US, utilizing Catofin or Oleflex technologies.

3. A schematic of a Catofin dehydrogenation unit is depicted in Figure 3. The process involves multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, with a typical operating temperature of 575°C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, with the catalyst remaining in use for 23 years. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed.

4. The Oleflex process uses fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. It employs a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705°C. The catalyst flows through the system continuously, with the last reactor connected to a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit that regenerates the catalyst by burning carbon deposits. The entire system operates continuously to provide an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.

5. The STAR process developed by Uhde uses a fixed bed reactor system with two separate reactors placed in series. The first is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, externally heated by an oven. The second, the oxyreactor, uses an oxygen-steam mixture to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium towards higher olefin yields. The olefins are separated from residual hydrogen and other side products, which are combusted to heat the dehydrogenation reactor oven.

6. The Fluidized Bed Dehydrogenation (FBD) process licensed by Snamprogetti and Yarsintez uses a staged fluidized bed reactor system for dehydrogenating propane. An alkane is flowed through the reactor at pressures between 1.1 and 1.5 bar and temperatures between 550 and 600°C. The catalyst deactivates over time and is continuously transported to a regenerator to combust carbon deposits. Heat for the dehydrogenation reaction is provided by heating the catalyst material in the regenerator. A fuel gas is added during regeneration as the combustion of carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat.

7. The Linde-BASF PDH process uses a PtSn catalyst supported on ZrO2 for dehydrogenating light paraffins at a temperature of 590°C. Three parallel reactors operate in dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge modes, ensuring a continuous flow of reaction products. Air and steam are used to regenerate the catalyst, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step.

8. The chemical perspective of dehydrogenation involves light paraffins being converted into olefins and hydrogen. However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring higher reaction temperatures and/or lower paraffin partial pressures to achieve high conversions. Temperatures of 550-750°C are typically needed for the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions of 50% at 1 bar. The pressure dependence is also shown, with lower pressures resulting in higher olefin yields at a given temperature.

9. Catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions. The balance between dehydrogenation and side reactions is complex, involving hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization. Crackers are efficiently catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, while large Pt ensembles display activity for hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization. Catalysts are designed to avoid these side reactions by minimizing the active sites for these reactions.

10. Strategies to lower paraffin partial pressure include reducing pressure below atmospheric levels (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process). Hydrogen can be removed from the reaction medium by selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) or by using a solid oxygen carrier that serves as a source of oxygen for oxidizing the hydrogen formed. A membrane permeable to hydrogen can also be used to withdraw the hydrogen from the system.

11. Platinum-based catalysts are the only precious metals used for commercial dehydrogenation due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. Alumina is the classical support due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain platinum nanoparticles dispersed. Promoters like tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) modify the catalytic properties of platinum, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing support acidity, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species. Sn promotion modifies the electronic properties of platinum, altering adsorptive and catalytic properties. The addition of promoters like zinc also prevents undesired side reactions such as coke formation and isomerization.

12. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been actively investigated due to their industrial relevance. Chromium oxide species on the catalyst surface are reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction. The optimal nuclearity of active Cr3+ sites remains a topic of debate, with factors such as the origin of Cr3+ species influencing activity. The presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant improves activity by removing evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Operating conditions, such as reaction temperature and partial pressure of the alkane, also affect activity and selectivity.

13. Cr-based catalysts lose activity due to the deposition of coke, which needs to be periodically regenerated. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this point. However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, indicating that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental to catalytic activity over time. The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromium into the alumina framework, causing a decrease in the amount of catalytically active chromium species.

14. The nature of the support is important for mechanical properties and the interaction of the carrier with the active phase, affecting activity and selectivity. Alumina is the most common support, but other materials like zirconia and silica can also be used. Zirconia is a viable substitute for alumina due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a relatively high surface area to stabilize chromium(6+) sites, while titania does not constitute a good support due to the weak interaction between chromium oxide and titanium dioxide. Porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials offer insights into the influence of acidity on catalytic behavior, with strong and medium strength acid sites affecting cracking and alkene production differently.

15. Alkali metals like potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) promote both activity and selectivity in chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the structure of the support, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. However, doping with potassium in certain materials like chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, gallium-chromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. This indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or the desorption of hydrogen.

16. An artist's impression of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction is shown in Figure 20. The partially reduced CrOx species are formed on the surface of the catalyst, and the Cr is partially dissolved in the alumina support. The reaction mechanism is depicted in the inset.

17. An overview of the different CrOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is provided in Table 4. The activity of the catalysts is compared using their specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of Cr per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of TOF was precluded due to the wide array of active species with different degrees of catalytic activity and accessibility in oxide-based catalysts.

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解（FCC）是获取轻烯烃最常用的方法。丙烷脱氢的盈利性很大程度上取决于丙烷与丙烯的价格差距，使得当前市场条件有利。由于汽车行业的增加需求和轻柴油等油品副产品的高成本，丁二烯价格显著上涨。在2007年，仅3%的丙烯通过特定技术生产，而蒸汽裂解和FCC占据了大部分的丙烯生产。乙烷从页岩气沉积中分离出来，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩气的乙烷进行蒸汽裂解，新建的PDH装置正在中国、日本和美国建立，使用如Catofin或Oleflex等技术。

2. 丙烷脱氢的盈利能力主要受丙烷和丙烯价格差异的影响，当前市场条件非常有利。大多数新PDH设施将在中国或美国建立，使用Catofin或Oleflex技术。

3. 图3展示了Catofin脱氢单元的示意图。该过程涉及多个并行固定床反应器，典型操作温度为575°C，压力范围在0.2至0.5巴之间。每个反应器交替进行脱氢、再生和冲洗步骤，催化剂在使用23年后仍能继续使用。脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热能含量。

4. Oleflex过程采用了一种由流化床反应器、催化剂再生单元和产品回收部分组成的非常不同的设计系统。它使用基于铂锡的催化剂，在1至3巴的压力下运行，并在525至705°C的温度范围内。三个并联的反应器由预热器连接在一起，预热器代表了反应系统的主热源。在再生步骤期间，催化剂床中的燃料气体被添加以产生补充热量，并且惰性材料被添加到催化剂床中以增加其热存储能力。

5. Uhde开发的STAR过程使用了一个固定的床反应器系统，包括两个串联的反应器。第一个是顶部点火的管式重整器型反应器，通过炉子外部加热。第二个称为氧化反应器，使用氧气蒸汽混合物选择性地燃烧部分生成的氢气，使平衡向更高烯烃产率的方向移动。产生的气体混合物中的烯烃与残留氢和其他副产品分离，这些残余物被燃烧来加热脱氢反应炉的炉子。

6. Snamprogetti和Yarsintez授权的Fluidized Bed Dehydrogenation (FBD)过程使用了一个分阶段的流化床反应器系统来脱氢丙烷。一种烷基以1.1至1.5巴的压力和550至600°C的温度流动通过反应器。催化剂随着时间的推移而失效，并连续运输到再生器中，以燃烧碳沉积物。脱氢反应所需的热量由再生器中催化剂材料的加热提供。在返回反应器之前，催化剂冷却到低于560°C。

7. Linde-BASF PDH过程使用ZrO2支持的铂锡催化剂在590°C的温度下对轻烷烃进行脱氢。三个平行的反应器以脱氢、再生和冲洗模式运行，确保反应产品连续流动。空气和蒸汽用于再生催化剂，反应器在再生步骤前后被吹扫。

8. 从化学角度来看，脱氢涉及轻烷烃转化为烯烃和氢气。然而，反应从热力学角度看是有限的并且高度吸热的，需要更高的反应温度和/或更低的烷烃分压来实现高转化率。通常需要550至750°C的温度来将C2-C4烷烃脱氢成50%的烷基转化率，在1巴的压力下。压力依赖关系也显示出来，较低的压力导致在给定温度下较高的烯烃产率。

9. 需要催化CH而非CC键断裂的催化剂以避免副反应。脱氢和副反应之间的平衡非常复杂，涉及到氢化裂解、裂解和异构化。裂解器由Brnsted酸位点有效催化，而大型Pt团簇也显示出氢化裂解、裂解和异构化反应的能力。催化剂的设计旨在避免这些副反应，通过减少参与这些反应的活性位点数量。

10. 降低烷烃分压的策略包括将压力降至大气压以下（Catofin）或用石脑油稀释烷烃（STAR过程）。可以通过选择性氢燃烧（SHC）或使用充当氢氧化物来源的固体氧载体来去除反应介质中的氢。具有渗透氢的膜也可以用来从系统中抽走氢。

11. 铂基催化剂是唯一用于商业脱氢的贵重金属，因为它们对烷基CH键的激活效果优于CC断裂。高稳定性、机械强度以及能够维持铂纳米颗粒分散的氧化铝是经典的支撑材料。促进剂如锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）修改铂的催化性质，抑制氢化裂解和异构化反应，最小化金属聚集，中和支撑材料的酸性，并促进焦炭物种从金属表面扩散。Sn促进修改了铂的电子性质，改变了吸附性和催化性质。添加锌等促进剂也能防止诸如焦炭形成和异构化的不利副反应。

12. 铬氧化物基催化剂由于工业相关性一直受到积极研究。铬氧化物物种在催化剂表面上被还原为具有较低氧化状态的活性铬物种。活动Cr3+离子的最佳核数仍然存在争议，原因在于Cr3+物种的起源影响活性。CO2作为温和氧化剂可以改善活性，通过逆水煤气转换反应去除释放的氢。操作条件，如反应温度和烷烃的分压，也会影响活性和选择性。

13. Cr基催化剂因焦炭沉积而失去活性，需要定期再生。催化剂的重量在反应的初期阶段增加，但在这一点之后不再增加额外的碳。然而，转化率在这一点之后继续下降，表明最初沉积的碳对催化活性的影响越来越大。在再生过程中释放的焦炭的热量被用来为脱氢反应提供动力，这使得焦炭沉积并非完全无益。氧化铬在脱氢条件下也会发生聚集，导致活性铬物种的数量减少。

14. 支撑材料对于机械性能和活性位点与载体的相互作用至关重要，影响活性和选择性。氧化铝是最常用的支撑材料，但锆化物和硅化物也可以使用。由于低表面酸性，锆化物是氧化铝的可行替代品。使用钾、铷和铯等碱金属作为促进剂，通过稳定支撑结构、减少表面酸性并增加活性铬物种的数量来促进铂的活性和选择性。然而，在某些材料中，如氧化铬-α-锆磷酸材料，钾的掺杂会导致活性急剧下降。这表明氧离子在丙烷的离散吸附和/或氢的脱附中起着活跃的作用。

15. 一个CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表面形成协调不饱和Cr3+物种催化脱氢反应的艺术家的印象图在图20中展示。表面形成部分还原的CrOx物种，Cr部分溶解在氧化铝支持中。反应机制在插图中描绘。

16. 不同的CrOx催化剂用于脱氢轻烷烃的概述提供在表4中。催化剂的活性使用特定活性进行比较，定义为每秒开始脱氢反应时每摩尔Cr形成的烯烃摩尔数。由于氧化物基催化剂中活性物种的不同程度的催化活性和可接近性，TOF的使用被排除。
