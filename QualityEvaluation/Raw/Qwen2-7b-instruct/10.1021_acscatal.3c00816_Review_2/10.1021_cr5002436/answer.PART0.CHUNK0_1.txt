[1] "Dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
[2] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[3] "For example, Wachowski et al. observed that when a small amount of La2O3 is added to Al2O3, the transition of θ-alumina to α-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added."
[4] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. Their effectiveness stems from their unique structures and properties, which allow for optimal adsorption and catalysis of light paraffins. MFI zeolites, with their 12-membered ring channels, offer high selectivity for olefin formation, while BEA zeolites, featuring 10-membered rings, provide a larger surface area for adsorption and reactions. Their structure contributes to efficient hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes, enhancing the yield of desired products. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on refining these zeolite structures, optimizing their surface chemistry, and improving their stability to extend their operational lifetimes and efficiency.
