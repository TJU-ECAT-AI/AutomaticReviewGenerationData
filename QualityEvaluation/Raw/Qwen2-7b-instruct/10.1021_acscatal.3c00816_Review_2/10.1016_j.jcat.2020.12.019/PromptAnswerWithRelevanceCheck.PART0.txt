Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that metal species loaded onto metal oxides like SiO2 and Al2O3 and incorporated into zeolite lattices or frameworks are key strategies. Metal oxides obtained through these methods demonstrate high performance in PDH reactions. Specifically, the Sn-Beta zeolite was initially used as a support and promoter for Pt components in PDH, showing limited activity. However, the study discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can effectively activate the C-H bond at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH. In contrast, SnO2/Al-Beta samples, synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution, showed different performance characteristics.

<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas.</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Note that an evident increase of propylene selectivity is observed in Sn-Beta-60 sample, which is due to a decrease of Bronsted acid for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>The amount of coke deposition in these two catalysts can be quantified by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>These tetracoordinated Sn single atoms are intensively bonded to the zeolite framework, which enables these Sn atoms to be highly stable under the harsh reaction condition.</p>
<p>According to the suggested direct reaction pathway for the propane dehydrogenation, we now in the position to elucidate the catalytic activity of open Sn-Beta sites.</p>
<p>The adsorption enthalpies of propane in three open Sn-Beta structures are around 48 kJ/mol, similar to that in closed structure as a result of the contribution from non-bond vdW interaction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the formed intermediate M2 in open structure is more stable over 40 kJ/mol than that in closed one; this may be attributed to the flexibility of open active sites and the hydrogen bond with adjacent silanol nests.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involve incorporating metal species into zeolite lattice or framework to create single-site catalysts. This approach allows for easy elucidation of the reaction pathway. The incorporation of metals into zeolite structures provides a stable environment for the active sites, contributing to the effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with its open pore system and Lewis acid sites, is particularly effective in PDH, offering high stability and selectivity. Theoretical calculations support the role of Lewis acid sites in the PDH reaction mechanism, indicating the importance of the zeolite framework in stabilizing the active sites. The dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH applications is due to their well-defined structures, which facilitate the creation of active sites with specific functionalities. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the local structure of Lewis acid sites and enhancing their reactivity through fine-tuning of the zeolite framework.

Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that metal species incorporated into zeolite lattice or framework, particularly in zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies, are key. These zeolites' well-defined structures allow for elucidating the reaction pathways clearly. The isolated metal species within zeolite frameworks demonstrate enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with its single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework and an open pore system, has proven effective in various catalytic processes such as biomass conversion, C-C bond coupling, and C-O bond breakage. However, it initially showed limited activity in PDH reactions. This study reveals that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate propane's C-H bond at high temperatures, displaying high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH. The Lewis acid sites, arising from the single-site Sn, are identified as the active sites for dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites facilitate cracking. A high Lewis acid to Brnsted acid ratio (L/B) enhances PDH efficiency. The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites offer a promising avenue for developing next-generation PDH catalysts for propylene production.

<p>A high level of both Brnsted and Lewis acidity is found in the H-Beta sample. However, the Brnsted acid largely decreases (241.4 μmol.g1 in H-Beta, 36.0 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) and the Lewis acid (163.8 in H-Beta, 170.9 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) is well kept, when the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite.</p>

<p>To further prove this hypothesized structureactivity relationship, the Na-Sn-Beta which was obtained by a simple Na+ exchange with Sn-Beta zeolite, was also evaluated in propane dehydrogenation reaction. In comparison to the parent Sn-Beta zeolite, the amount of Lewis acid in the Na-Sn-Beta is kept almost unchanged but the Brnsted acid is significantly reduced, which leads to a large decrease of B/L ratio.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas. These zeolites allow for the creation of single-site metal catalysts, which enhance stability by being anchored within the zeolite framework. The isolated metal species in zeolite form single-site catalysts that offer superior stability compared to conventional bulk metal catalysts.

In the context of PDH, the incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has proven to be an effective strategy for constructing single-site catalysts. This approach ensures that the metal is immobilized, increasing its stability under high-temperature conditions typically encountered during PDH reactions. The strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework contributes to the stability of these isolated metal species.

However, the initial use of Sn-Beta zeolite as a PDH catalyst showed negligible activity. Contrary to expectations, it functioned primarily as a support and promoter for Pt components. This changed when researchers discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite could activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and exceptional stability in PDH. The theoretical calculations confirm that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites originating from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

The utilization of Sn-Beta zeolite in PDH is not a novel discovery; it was mentioned in a previous report [32]. Nonetheless, this finding represents a significant advancement in the development of PDH catalysts, particularly in the realm of environmentally friendly and cost-effective options. The Sn-Beta zeolites, with their enhanced stability and catalytic activity, offer a new possibility for the next generation of PDH catalysts aimed at the production of propylene.

In conclusion, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH relies on the use of MFI and BEA zeolites, which facilitate the creation of single-site metal catalysts. These catalysts benefit from the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework, enhancing their stability. The discovery of Sn-Beta zeolite's catalytic potential for PDH represents a significant breakthrough, offering a promising avenue for the development of efficient and environmentally friendly PDH catalysts.
