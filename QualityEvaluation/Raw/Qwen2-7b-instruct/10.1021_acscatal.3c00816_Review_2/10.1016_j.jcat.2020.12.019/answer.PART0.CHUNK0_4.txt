Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas. These zeolites allow for the creation of single-site metal catalysts, which enhance stability by being anchored within the zeolite framework. The isolated metal species in zeolite form single-site catalysts that offer superior stability compared to conventional bulk metal catalysts.

In the context of PDH, the incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has proven to be an effective strategy for constructing single-site catalysts. This approach ensures that the metal is immobilized, increasing its stability under high-temperature conditions typically encountered during PDH reactions. The strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework contributes to the stability of these isolated metal species.

However, the initial use of Sn-Beta zeolite as a PDH catalyst showed negligible activity. Contrary to expectations, it functioned primarily as a support and promoter for Pt components. This changed when researchers discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite could activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and exceptional stability in PDH. The theoretical calculations confirm that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites originating from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

The utilization of Sn-Beta zeolite in PDH is not a novel discovery; it was mentioned in a previous report [32]. Nonetheless, this finding represents a significant advancement in the development of PDH catalysts, particularly in the realm of environmentally friendly and cost-effective options. The Sn-Beta zeolites, with their enhanced stability and catalytic activity, offer a new possibility for the next generation of PDH catalysts aimed at the production of propylene.

In conclusion, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH relies on the use of MFI and BEA zeolites, which facilitate the creation of single-site metal catalysts. These catalysts benefit from the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework, enhancing their stability. The discovery of Sn-Beta zeolite's catalytic potential for PDH represents a significant breakthrough, offering a promising avenue for the development of efficient and environmentally friendly PDH catalysts.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法表明，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，这得益于它们独特的孔隙结构和高比表面积。这些沸石允许形成单原子催化剂，这种催化剂通过框架结构的强锚定作用提高了稳定性。在沸石中的孤立金属物种形成了单原子催化剂，与常规的块状金属催化剂相比，其稳定性更高。

在PDH背景下，将金属物种引入沸石晶格或框架中已被证明是构建单原子催化剂的有效策略。这种方法确保了金属被固定化，提高了其在PDH反应中通常遇到的高温条件下的稳定性。框架结构的强锚定作用对这些孤立金属物种的稳定性贡献很大。

然而，最初使用Sn-Beta沸石作为PDH催化剂时显示出了微不足道的活性。出乎意料的是，它主要作为Pt组分的支持和促进剂发挥作用。相反，研究人员发现Sn-Beta沸石能够激活丙烷中的C-H键，在高温下表现出高选择性、良好的活性和出色的稳定性。理论计算证实，丙烷脱氢发生在起源于Zeolitic框架中单原子Sn的Lewis酸位点上。

实际上，Sn-Beta沸石在PDH反应中的应用并非新发现，它在先前的报告中有所提及[32]。然而，这一发现代表了PDH催化剂发展的重大突破，特别是对于环保和成本效益高的选项而言。Sn-Beta沸石因其增强的稳定性和催化活性，为PDH催化剂的下一代提供了新的可能性。

总之，金属-沸石催化剂的合成依赖于MFI和BEA沸石的使用，这些沸石促进了单原子金属催化剂的形成。这些催化剂从框架结构的强锚定作用中受益，提高了其稳定性。Sn-Beta沸石在PDH方面的催化潜力的发现标志着一个重要的突破，为高效和环境友好的PDH催化剂的发展开辟了前景。
