<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure.</p>
<p>The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] .</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The Sn species are incorporated into zeolite framework and exist as isolated Sn single atoms. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene.</p>

Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that metal species incorporated into zeolite lattice or framework, particularly in zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies, are key. These zeolites' well-defined structures allow for elucidating the reaction pathways clearly. The isolated metal species within zeolite frameworks demonstrate enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with its single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework and an open pore system, has proven effective in various catalytic processes such as biomass conversion, C-C bond coupling, and C-O bond breakage. However, it initially showed limited activity in PDH reactions. This study reveals that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate propane's C-H bond at high temperatures, displaying high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH. The Lewis acid sites, arising from the single-site Sn, are identified as the active sites for dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites facilitate cracking. A high Lewis acid to Brnsted acid ratio (L/B) enhances PDH efficiency. The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites offer a promising avenue for developing next-generation PDH catalysts for propylene production.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的合成方法，文献指出，在MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石中，将金属物种引入到框架或晶格中是关键。这些沸石的明确结构使得能够清楚地阐明反应途径。在沸石框架内的孤立金属物种显示出由于框架结构的强锚定效应而具有增强的稳定性。Sn-Beta沸石，其单个Sn原子位于BEA框架内，并且具有三维十二元环通道的开放孔系统，在生物转化、C-C键耦合和C-O键断裂等催化过程中具有广泛应用。然而，它最初在PDH反应中的活性有限。这项研究揭示了Sn-Beta沸石可以在高温下激活丙烷的C-H键，并在PDH中表现出高选择性、活性和稳定性。单个Sn产生的Lewis酸位点被确认为脱氢的活性位点，而Brnsted酸位点则促进裂解。Lewis酸与Brnsted酸的比例（L/B）越高，PDH效率就越高。Na-Sn-Beta沸石为开发下一代PDH催化剂以生产丙烯提供了新的可能性。
