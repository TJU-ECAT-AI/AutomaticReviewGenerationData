<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] .</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>For comparison, SnO2/Al-Beta samples (nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60) were synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that metal species loaded onto metal oxides like SiO2 and Al2O3 and incorporated into zeolite lattices or frameworks are key strategies. Metal oxides obtained through these methods demonstrate high performance in PDH reactions. Specifically, the Sn-Beta zeolite was initially used as a support and promoter for Pt components in PDH, showing limited activity. However, the study discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can effectively activate the C-H bond at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH. In contrast, SnO2/Al-Beta samples, synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution, showed different performance characteristics.

在分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法时，文献强调了将金属物种加载到金属氧化物如SiO2和Al2O3上以及将其融入沸石晶格或框架中是关键策略。通过这些方法获得的金属氧化物在PDH反应中表现出高性能。具体来说，Sn-Beta沸石最初用作Pt成分的支持和促进剂，在PDH中显示出有限的活性。然而，研究发现Sn-Beta沸石能够有效地在高温下激活C-H键，并且在PDH中表现出高选择性、活性和稳定性。相比之下，通过直接浸渍Al-Beta与SnCl2溶液制备的SnO2/Al-Beta样品显示出不同的性能特征。
