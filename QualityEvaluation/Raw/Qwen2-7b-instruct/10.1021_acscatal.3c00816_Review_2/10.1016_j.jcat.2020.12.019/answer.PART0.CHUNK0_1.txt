<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas.</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Note that an evident increase of propylene selectivity is observed in Sn-Beta-60 sample, which is due to a decrease of Bronsted acid for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>The amount of coke deposition in these two catalysts can be quantified by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>These tetracoordinated Sn single atoms are intensively bonded to the zeolite framework, which enables these Sn atoms to be highly stable under the harsh reaction condition.</p>
<p>According to the suggested direct reaction pathway for the propane dehydrogenation, we now in the position to elucidate the catalytic activity of open Sn-Beta sites.</p>
<p>The adsorption enthalpies of propane in three open Sn-Beta structures are around 48 kJ/mol, similar to that in closed structure as a result of the contribution from non-bond vdW interaction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the formed intermediate M2 in open structure is more stable over 40 kJ/mol than that in closed one; this may be attributed to the flexibility of open active sites and the hydrogen bond with adjacent silanol nests.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involve incorporating metal species into zeolite lattice or framework to create single-site catalysts. This approach allows for easy elucidation of the reaction pathway. The incorporation of metals into zeolite structures provides a stable environment for the active sites, contributing to the effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with its open pore system and Lewis acid sites, is particularly effective in PDH, offering high stability and selectivity. Theoretical calculations support the role of Lewis acid sites in the PDH reaction mechanism, indicating the importance of the zeolite framework in stabilizing the active sites. The dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH applications is due to their well-defined structures, which facilitate the creation of active sites with specific functionalities. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the local structure of Lewis acid sites and enhancing their reactivity through fine-tuning of the zeolite framework.
