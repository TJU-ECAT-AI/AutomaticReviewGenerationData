<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1] .</p>
<p>In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been commercialized with the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively [3] ,[10] .</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] .</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>

<p>A high level of both Brnsted and Lewis acidity is found in the H-Beta sample. However, the Brnsted acid largely decreases (241.4 μmol.g1 in H-Beta, 36.0 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) and the Lewis acid (163.8 in H-Beta, 170.9 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) is well kept, when the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite.</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction [65] .</p>
<p>To further prove this hypothesized structureactivity relationship, the Na-Sn-Beta which was obtained by a simple Na+ exchange with Sn-Beta zeolite, was also evaluated in propane dehydrogenation reaction. In comparison to the parent Sn-Beta zeolite, the amount of Lewis acid in the Na-Sn-Beta is kept almost unchanged but the Brnsted acid is significantly reduced, which leads to a large decrease of B/L ratio. It is quite interesting that the Na-Sn-Beta shows an enhanced catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, especially for Na-Sn-Beta-30 and Na-Sn-Beta-60 samples.</p>
<p>It was previously proposed that both closed and open sites in zeolites may act as the active center for the reactions [66] . Herein the periodic DFT calculations were performed in Sn-Beta to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism and catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Regarding the structure of M3 intermediate, Bader charge analysis revealed that the H atom bonded with Sn is hydride with 0.98 e. Finally, the enthalpy barrier for H-H coupling is 116 kJ/mol, and the forming H-H distance is 1.08 Å with the breaking Sn-H and O-H distances are respectively 1.97 and 1.21 Å (TS4).</p>

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are synthesized through various methods, including direct impregnation of metal species onto zeolite surfaces and incorporation of metal species into the zeolite lattice or framework. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Their open pore systems and regular 3D channel structures allow for efficient diffusion of reactants and products, contributing to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

2. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, including the presence of Lewis acid sites created by the incorporation of metal species. These sites enable the activation of C-H bonds, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the Brnsted acid sites present in the zeolites assist in cracking reactions, which occur concurrently with dehydrogenation. The balance between Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, as well as the presence of specific metal sites, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of these zeolite-based catalysts.

3. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the structure of the zeolites and the metal species incorporated within them. This includes refining the synthesis methods to enhance the stability and reactivity of the catalysts, as well as exploring the use of different zeolite frameworks and metal types that can offer improved performance in PDH reactions. Additionally, understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reactions at the molecular level, as elucidated through computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can guide the rational design of new catalysts with tailored properties for enhanced PDH performance.

1. 金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的合成方法包括直接浸渍金属物种到沸石表面和将金属物种融入沸石骨架或框架中。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，因为它们具有明确的孔结构和高比表面积，有利于脱氢过程。其开放的孔系统和三维通道结构允许有效扩散反应物和产物，从而贡献了它们在PDH反应中的有效性。

2. MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性受到其结构特征的影响，包括通过将金属物种融入其中创建的Lewis酸位点。这些位点使C-H键的激活成为可能，促进了脱氢过程。此外，沸石中存在的Brnsted酸位有助于裂解反应，该反应与脱氢反应同时发生。Lewis酸位与Brnsted酸位之间的平衡以及特定金属位的存在对确定这些沸石基催化剂的催化活性和选择性起着关键作用。

3. 在PDH催化剂设计的未来发展中，应专注于优化沸石的结构和嵌入的金属物种。这包括改进合成方法以增强催化剂的稳定性和反应性，以及探索不同的沸石框架和金属类型，它们可以提供改进的PDH性能。此外，通过计算方法如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算等，理解反应的分子水平机制，可以指导新的催化剂设计，以实现定制的特性，以提高PDH性能。
