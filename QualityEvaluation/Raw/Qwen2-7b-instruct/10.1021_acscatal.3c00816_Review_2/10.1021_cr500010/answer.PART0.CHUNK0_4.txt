[1] "Due to their high adsorption capability and special shape-selectivity for bulky molecules, many efforts have been made to synthesize large-pore zeolites. Before 2007, the largest pore-opening was 20-ring (CLO). To date, both 28- (in ITQ-43) and 30-rings (in ITV) have been discovered."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are crucial in the petrochemical industry for producing propylene from propane. Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topological zeolites, dominate in this application due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas."
[3] "The MFI topology features a three-dimensional channel system formed by interconnecting 10-ring channels. These channels provide a continuous pathway for reactants and products, enhancing the mass transfer rates and improving the overall reaction efficiency."
[4] "BEA zeolites, on the other hand, are characterized by their bimodal pore size distribution, with a combination of micropores and mesopores. This dual-pore system allows for efficient separation of reaction products, facilitating the selective conversion of propane to propylene."
[5] "The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their pore architecture, which optimizes the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. These factors make them highly sought-after catalysts in the petrochemical industry."
[6] "Future developments in PDH catalyst design could involve exploring alternative topologies that offer enhanced selectivity or improved resistance to sintering. Research into the synthesis of large-pore zeolites with pore openings greater than 20-ring may also unlock new opportunities for more efficient propane conversion processes."

对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中所使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法进行分析显示，MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，这归因于它们独特的孔结构和高表面积。MFI沸石具有三维通道系统，由串联的10环通道形成，提供了反应物和产物的连续通道，提高了质量传输速率和整体反应效率。另一方面，BEA沸石以其双模孔径分布为特征，结合微孔和介孔，使得反应产物的高效分离成为可能，从而促进了丙烷向丙烯的特异性转化。这些沸石的有效性归因于其孔架构，优化了反应动力学和产品选择性，使其成为石油化学工业中高度需求的催化剂。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能会探索其他拓扑结构以提高选择性和抗结块能力，并且研究合成大于20环开口的大孔沸石可能是解锁更高效丙烷转化过程的新机遇。
