1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions primarily utilize MFI and BEA topological zeolites because of their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, characterized by their 12-membered ring channels, and BEA zeolites, featuring 10-membered ring channels, offer optimal conditions for PDH processes. These zeolites provide the necessary pore size and shape for efficient separation of the products, enhancing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. The high surface area and well-defined pore structure of these zeolites facilitate better interaction between the reactants and the catalyst, leading to improved conversion rates and yield of propylene.

2. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalysts is further bolstered by their stability under high-temperature and harsh reaction conditions. These zeolites maintain their structural integrity, ensuring prolonged catalyst life and consistent performance. Additionally, the ability of MFI and BEA zeolites to adsorb and desorb molecules effectively contributes to their efficiency in PDH reactions.

3. The dominance of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalyst design is also attributed to their compatibility with a variety of metals, particularly noble metals like palladium and rhodium, which are commonly used as promoters. These metals enhance the catalytic properties of the zeolites, enabling them to operate at lower temperatures and pressures, which reduces energy consumption and lowers production costs.

4. Looking ahead, future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on exploring alternative topologies and structures beyond MFI and BEA. Researchers are investigating the potential of other zeolite types, such as ZSM-5 and Y-type zeolites, to broaden the range of catalysts available for PDH reactions. Additionally, advancements in metal-support interactions and the development of new metal species are expected to optimize the performance of these catalysts, potentially leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly PDH processes.

1.MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中占据主导地位，因为它们独特的结构特性。MFI沸石以其12个成员环通道为特征，而BEA沸石则具有10个成员环通道，为PDH过程提供了理想条件。这些沸石提供必要的孔径大小和形状，以实现高效的产品分离，从而提高整体催化活性和丙烯产率。这些沸石高表面积和定义明确的孔结构使它们能够更有效地与催化剂相互作用，从而提高转化率和产品产率。

2.MFI和BEA沸石在PDH催化剂中的有效性进一步得益于它们在高温和苛刻反应条件下的稳定性。这些沸石保持其结构完整性，确保催化剂寿命延长和持续性能。此外，MFI和BEA沸石吸附和脱附分子的能力也有助于它们在PDH反应中的效率。

3.MFI和BEA沸石在PDH催化剂设计中占据主导地位的原因还包括它们与各种金属的兼容性，尤其是钯和铑等贵金属，通常用作促进剂。这些金属增强了沸石的催化性质，使它们能够在较低温度和压力下工作，这降低了能源消耗并降低了生产成本。

4.展望未来，PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在探索MFI和BEA之外的其他拓扑结构。研究人员正在研究其他类型沸石的潜力，如ZSM-5和Y型沸石，以扩大可用于PDH反应的催化剂范围。此外，金属支持相互作用的改进和发展新的金属物种有望优化这些催化剂的性能，可能导致更高效和环境友好的PDH过程。
