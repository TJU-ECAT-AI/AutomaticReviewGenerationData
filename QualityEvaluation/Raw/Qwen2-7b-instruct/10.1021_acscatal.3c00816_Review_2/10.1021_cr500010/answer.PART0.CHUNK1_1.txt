<p>The MFI and BEA topological zeolites are the most commonly used catalyst supports in PDH processes due to their unique properties. These zeolites are characterized by their high acidity, well-defined pore structures, and high surface areas, which are favorable for the dehydrogenation reactions of propane. The MFI and BEA zeolites offer excellent stability and activity in PDH processes, which are critical factors for industrial applications.</p>
<p>The structural characteristics of these zeolites play a significant role in their effectiveness. The MFI zeolite, with its 12-membered ring channels, facilitates the adsorption and desorption of propane molecules. The BEA zeolite, featuring 10-membered rings, allows for better heat transfer, which is beneficial for the exothermic PDH reaction. Additionally, the high acidity of these zeolites aids in breaking the hydrogen bonds between propane molecules, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Other factors that contribute to their effectiveness include their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures encountered in industrial PDH reactors, as well as their resistance to sintering and coke formation, which can reduce catalyst activity over time. The well-defined pore structures of MFI and BEA zeolites also prevent the formation of large aggregates, ensuring uniform and efficient conversion rates.</p>
<p>For future developments in PDH catalyst design, researchers are exploring the use of modified zeolites with tailored acidity profiles, improved thermal stabilities, and enhanced selectivities towards desirable products. Additionally, the integration of metal promoters into zeolite supports is being investigated to further boost the catalytic activity and lifetime of PDH catalysts.</p>
