1. The field of zeolite structural chemistry has seen rapid advancements over the past few years.
2. Numerous new zeolite structures were identified post the 2007 Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types.
3. Zeolites made from elements beyond the conventional ones, like Ge, Be, and transition metals, are termed unconventional zeolites.
4. The interaction modes of various framework elements differ, affecting their energy profiles significantly.
5. Treacy and colleagues determined that 994 low-energy hypothetical structures could potentially be realized as pure silica, and 48 as pure germania, based on the distinct SiOSi and GeOGe ranges.
6. The advent of chalcogenide zeolites created opportunities to realize frameworks that are impractical as oxides, particularly those featuring supertetrahedral units.
