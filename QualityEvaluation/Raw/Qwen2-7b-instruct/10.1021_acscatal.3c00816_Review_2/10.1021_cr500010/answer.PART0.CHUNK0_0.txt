[1] "In 2010, Sholl and co-workers introduced a grid-based approach to identify the diameters of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere in a zeolite framework."
[2] "This approach begins by dividing the unit cell of a zeolite framework into equally spaced discrete grid points."
[3] "To further calculate the diameter of the largest free sphere, the connectivity of pores within the zeolite framework must be determined."
[4] "Zeolite frameworks are flexible; the framework atoms oscillate around their average positions all the time, especially at a high temperature."
[5] "This dynamic effect may significantly change the geometrical features of zeolites, as well as their physical and chemical properties."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve using zeolites with specific topologies like MFI and BEA. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics that facilitate the PDH reaction. The MFI topology, with its 10-ring channels, provides optimal conditions for the dehydrogenation process. The BEA topology, featuring a combination of 10-ring and 12-ring channels, offers enhanced selectivity and stability. The effectiveness of these zeolites is attributed to their high surface area, controlled pore size, and uniform pore structure. These factors enable efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, facilitating the PDH reaction. The stability and robustness of MFI and BEA zeolites under reaction conditions make them superior choices for PDH catalysts.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on incorporating metal nanoparticles into the zeolite framework. This strategy enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst by promoting localized metal oxidation states, which are crucial for PDH reactions. Additionally, exploring the use of novel zeolite structures with larger pore openings or unique topologies could expand the range of catalysts capable of performing PDH reactions. The goal is to optimize the zeolite structure to match the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, thereby increasing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

主要的金属-沸石催化剂合成方法在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及使用特定拓扑结构的沸石，如MFI和BEA。这些沸石之所以主导这一应用，是由于它们独特的结构特征可以促进PDH反应。MFI拓扑结构，具有10环通道，提供了最优的脱氢条件。而BEA拓扑结构，结合了10环和12环通道，提供了增强的选择性和稳定性。这些沸石的有效性归因于其高的比表面积、可控的孔径大小和均匀的孔结构。这些因素使得反应物和产物的吸附和脱附得以有效进行，从而促进PDH反应。MFI和BEA沸石的稳定性和耐受性使它们成为PDH催化剂的优秀选择。

PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向可能包括将金属纳米颗粒整合到沸石框架中。这种策略通过促进局部金属氧化态来提高催化剂的活性和稳定性，这对PDH反应至关重要。此外，探索使用具有更大孔开口或独特拓扑结构的新沸石，可以扩展能够执行PDH反应的催化剂范围。目标是优化沸石结构以匹配反应动力学和热力学特性，从而提高PDH过程的效率和选择性。
