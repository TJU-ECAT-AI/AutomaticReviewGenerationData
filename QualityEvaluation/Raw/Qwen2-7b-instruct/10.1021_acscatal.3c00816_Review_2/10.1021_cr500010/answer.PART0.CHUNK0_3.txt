[1] "Many efforts have been made to synthesize large-pore zeolites. Before 2007, the largest pore-opening was 20-ring (CLO). To date, both 28- (in ITQ-43) and 30-rings (in ITV) have been discovered. However, it is worth noting that all of these record-holding rings can only be found in interrupted frameworks."
[2] "Among fully four-connected frameworks, the largest pore-opening is still 18-ring (in ETR, IRR, ITT, and VFI)."

Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions typically utilize zeolites with frameworks that allow for the passage of large molecules, thereby enabling selective conversion of propane to propylene. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structural characteristics and the efficiency they offer in PDH processes. MFI zeolites are characterized by their cubic symmetry and a three-dimensional channel system that allows for the passage of molecules of a specific size. BEA zeolites, on the other hand, are known for their chiral nature, which can lead to enantioselective catalytic activity, enhancing the yield of desired products. 

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their pore sizes, which match the size of propane molecules, facilitating their conversion while minimizing the interference of smaller molecules. Their high adsorption capacity and shape-selectivity make them particularly suited for PDH applications. Moreover, the stability and regeneration capabilities of these zeolites contribute to their widespread use in industrial settings.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could involve exploring new zeolite structures with even larger pore openings, possibly in uninterrupted frameworks, to enhance the efficiency of the process. Additionally, incorporating metal components into the zeolite framework could further improve the catalyst's performance by tuning its acidity and basicity, thus optimizing the conversion rates and selectivities for propylene production.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂通常利用允许大型分子通过的沸石结构，从而实现丙烷向丙烯的选择性转化。MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，这归因于它们独特的结构特性和PDH过程中的高效率。MFI沸石以其立方对称性和三维通道系统而闻名，允许特定大小的分子通过。而BEA沸石因其手性性质而著称，这可能导致选择性催化活性，增强所需产品的产率。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性归因于其孔径大小与丙烷分子相匹配，从而促进其转换并最小化较小分子的干扰。它们的高吸附能力和形状选择性使它们特别适合PDH应用。此外，这些沸石的稳定性和再生能力有助于它们在工业领域广泛应用。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能包括探索具有更大孔开口的新沸石结构，特别是未中断的框架结构，以提高过程的效率。此外，将金属成分引入沸石框架中，通过调整其酸性和碱性来进一步改善催化剂性能，从而优化丙烯生产速率和选择性。
