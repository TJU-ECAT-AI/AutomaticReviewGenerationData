<p>The emerging pre-transition metal elements (e.g., Ce, La, Y, etc.) as co-catalysts are also investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and a simple regeneration process (Park et al., 2021, Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020, Li et al., 2018, Zhu Chen et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts.</p>
<p>The typical way is to introduce the post-transition metal elements (e.g., Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc.) for synthesizing co-catalysts (Li and Wang, 2021, Chen et al., 2021, Shi et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The high-silica Beta zeolite (Zhejiang Twrd New Material Co., Ltd., denoted as Beta-557) of actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 557, the value is acquired from ICP-OES analysis.</p>
<p>The bulk phase structure of all fresh samples was investigated by the XRD. As shown in Fig. S1 A, the typical characteristic diffraction peaks of the parent Beta-39, Beta-557 and Beta- samples, identify the structure are well-crystalline BEA topology (Wang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The dispersion of the PtCe particles on the fresh 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalysts was examined by TEM. As given in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 , no visible PtCe particles can be observed, presuming that maybe most of the metal species are highly dispersed at inside the channels of the zeolite.</p>
<p>It is favorable to expose more catalytic sites on the catalyst surface via the strong metal-support interactions that readily existed between metal species and Al sites.</p>
<p>The 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses were applied to further verify the state of the metal species of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the bands around 103.0 ppm are associated with the framework Si-OH groups (Si(OSi)3(OH), Q3) of defect sites (Xie et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2017).</p>
<p>The structure of active metals of the spent catalysts was identified by TEM characterization.</p>
<p>For comparison, the significantly aggregating of Pt/Ce species existed on the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 catalyst, which shows that pure siliceous S-1 zeolite is difficult to anchor PtCe particles.</p>
<p>The accessibility of the active sites is studied by C3H8-TPD.</p>
<p>To explore the influence of metal-support interactions on the structures of Pt catalytic sites, in situ DRIFT-CO using CO as a probe molecule was conducted for the adsorption on Pt site surfaces.</p>
<p>The surface acidic properties of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by NH3-TPD.</p>
<p>The adsorption/desorption behavior of products upon the catalyst surface commonly plays a key factor in affecting selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>To identify the capability against the coke deposition under realistic reaction conditions, the spent samples were conducted by TGA and Raman analysis.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics and other factors that contribute to their effectiveness. MFI zeolites, particularly the Beta-557 type, are characterized by high silica content and rich defect sites, which are crucial for anchoring and dispersing active metal species. BEA topology zeolites, like Beta-557, are known for their high-silica content, which facilitates the formation of stable PtCe alloy particles. The high dispersion of Al sites on these zeolites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and the support, providing a synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction. This approach allows for the construction of highly dispersed PtCe cluster catalysts with excellent catalytic performance, robust structure, and longer catalytic longevity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal loading, support type, and the specific topologies of MFI and BEA zeolites to maximize propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The use of pre-transition metal elements as co-catalysts, like cerium (Ce), can further enhance the catalytic activity and regeneration efficiency of PDH catalysts, contributing to their broader potential in industrial applications.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions stems from their structural features that facilitate the dispersion of active metal species, the formation of stable metal-support interactions, and the provision of catalytically active sites. These factors, combined with the optimization of co-catalyst usage, enable the design of high-performance PDH catalysts with improved propylene selectivity and longevity.

在分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法时，我们发现MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这归功于它们的结构特征和其他因素对有效性的贡献。MFI沸石，尤其是Beta-557类型，具有高硅含量和丰富的缺陷位点，对于锚定和分散活性金属物种至关重要。BEA拓扑结构的沸石，如Beta-557，以其高硅含量而闻名，有助于形成稳定的PtCe合金颗粒。这些沸石上的高分散铝位点增强了PtCe簇与支撑物之间的相互作用，提供了金属-支撑相互作用的协同调节。这种方法允许构建高度分散的PtCe簇催化剂，具有出色的催化性能、坚固的结构和更长的催化寿命。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在优化金属负载、支持类型和MFI和BEA沸石的特定拓扑结构之间的平衡，以最大化丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。

此外，使用前过渡金属元素作为共催化剂，如铈（Ce），可以进一步提高PDH催化剂的催化活性和再生效率，从而扩大其在工业应用中的潜力。

综上所述，MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石在PDH反应中的有效性源于它们促进活性金属物种的分散、稳定金属-支撑相互作用以及提供催化活性位点的结构特征。结合共催化剂使用的优化，这些因素使设计高性能PDH催化剂成为可能，这些催化剂具有改进的丙烯选择性和持久性。
