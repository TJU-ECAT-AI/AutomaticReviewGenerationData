<p>The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite, while the trace Al sites play an important role in further stabilizing the active site structure by regulating the metal-support interaction.</p>
<p>This work proposed an efficient strategy for designing stable PtCe bimetallic clusters by utilizing silanol nests and Al sites to regulate the metal-support interaction synergistically.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio zeolite of H-type Beta (nominal SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) was calcined at 550 C for 12 h to completely remove the organic template agent before using.</p>
<p>The data of the actual metal loading of the catalysts before and after the PDH reaction were obtained by iCAP 7000 instrumentation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>The high-silica Beta zeolite (Zhejiang Twrd New Material Co., Ltd., denoted as Beta-557) of actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 557, the value is acquired from ICP-OES analysis.</p>
<p>The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite.</p>
<p>Combined with the EDS mapping and line scan results, the Pt and Ce species are uniform dispersed on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst.</p>

<p>Moreover, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows an excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity without obvious deactivation.</p>
<p>The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst retains the strong interaction between Al sites and metallic species.</p>
<p>For comparison, the end yield of propylene of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst is 33.0%, which is lower than that of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (end yield of propylene: 35.7%).</p>
<p>The introduction of Ce species well changed the structure of the Pt sites.</p>
<p>Thus, an appropriate increase of the amount of Ce might be beneficial for improving the dispersion of Pt sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, the amount of surface acid sites on PtCe-based catalysts increases with the number of added Ce species.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve utilizing zeolites with specific topologies such as MFI and BEA. These zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics, including high silica content, dense defect sites, and the presence of Al sites. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are crucial for anchoring and dispersing PtCe clusters within the zeolite channels. The trace Al sites play a significant role in stabilizing the active site structure by modulating the metal-support interaction. The synergy between the Al sites and defect sites allows for the construction of highly dispersed PtCe clusters, enhancing the catalytic performance in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could leverage these insights by optimizing the use of zeolite topologies, adjusting metal loadings, and fine-tuning metal-support interactions to achieve better dispersion, stability, and selectivity in PDH catalysts.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of post-transition metal elements like tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), iron (Fe), and others to create co-catalysts. These elements help in forming alloy structures with the active metals during the reduction process. The effectiveness of these catalysts relies heavily on their ability to achieve high dispersion of active sites and adjustable metal-support interactions due to their unique pore structures. The silicoaluminophosphate (BEA) and mesoporous silicalite (MFI) topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their capacity to facilitate atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside their channels. This migration is crucial for enhancing the dispersion of REE, which in turn reduces the required reduction temperature for alloy formation. The study provides insights into the design of high-performance and stable high-silica bimetal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. However, the development faces synthetic challenges, particularly in improving the dispersion of REE while maintaining a low reduction temperature for alloy formation. Strategies are being explored to overcome these challenges, focusing on enhancing the reduction potential energy to facilitate better dispersion of REE species within the zeolite framework.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics and other factors that contribute to their effectiveness. MFI zeolites, particularly the Beta-557 type, are characterized by high silica content and rich defect sites, which are crucial for anchoring and dispersing active metal species. BEA topology zeolites, like Beta-557, are known for their high-silica content, which facilitates the formation of stable PtCe alloy particles. The high dispersion of Al sites on these zeolites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and the support, providing a synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction. This approach allows for the construction of highly dispersed PtCe cluster catalysts with excellent catalytic performance, robust structure, and longer catalytic longevity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal loading, support type, and the specific topologies of MFI and BEA zeolites to maximize propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The use of pre-transition metal elements as co-catalysts, like cerium (Ce), can further enhance the catalytic activity and regeneration efficiency of PDH catalysts, contributing to their broader potential in industrial applications.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions stems from their structural features that facilitate the dispersion of active metal species, the formation of stable metal-support interactions, and the provision of catalytically active sites. These factors, combined with the optimization of co-catalyst usage, enable the design of high-performance PDH catalysts with improved propylene selectivity and longevity.
