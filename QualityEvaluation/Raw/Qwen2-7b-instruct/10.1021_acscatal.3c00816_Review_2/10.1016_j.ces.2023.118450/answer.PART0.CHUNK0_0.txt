1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in PDH reactions involve utilizing high-silica Beta zeolite as a support to improve stability and propylene selectivity. The defect sites from silanol nests facilitate the dispersion of PtCe clusters within the zeolite channels. Appropriate Al sites regulate the metal-support interaction, stabilizing the active site structure. The synergy between Pt and Ce species enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability at 550°C. Future developments should aim to optimize the balance between metal dispersion, support functionality, and metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic performance.

2. High-silica zeolite catalysts, specifically those with Beta topology, are favored in PDH applications due to their unique pore structure that facilitates high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interactions. The combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests effectively regulates the metal-support interactions, contributing to the catalyst's performance and stability.

3. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst demonstrates outstanding catalytic performance, including a 42.2% propane conversion, 91.9% propylene selectivity, and a low deactivation constant of 0.013 h1. The catalyst's ability to maintain high activity after multiple regenerations highlights its robust structure and redispersion capability.

4. The balance between Al sites acting as stabilizers for active sites and potential side-reaction sites depends on the amount and location on the zeolite surface. The strategic use of Al sites ensures that they contribute positively to the catalyst's performance by enhancing metal-support interactions without compromising selectivity or stability.

5. Future research should focus on refining the synthesis methods to better control metal dispersion, support characteristics, and metal-support interactions. This optimization is crucial for achieving higher catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity in PDH reactions, ultimately expanding the potential scope of industrial catalysts.
