The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of post-transition metal elements like tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), iron (Fe), and others to create co-catalysts. These elements help in forming alloy structures with the active metals during the reduction process. The effectiveness of these catalysts relies heavily on their ability to achieve high dispersion of active sites and adjustable metal-support interactions due to their unique pore structures. The silicoaluminophosphate (BEA) and mesoporous silicalite (MFI) topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their capacity to facilitate atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside their channels. This migration is crucial for enhancing the dispersion of REE, which in turn reduces the required reduction temperature for alloy formation. The study provides insights into the design of high-performance and stable high-silica bimetal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. However, the development faces synthetic challenges, particularly in improving the dispersion of REE while maintaining a low reduction temperature for alloy formation. Strategies are being explored to overcome these challenges, focusing on enhancing the reduction potential energy to facilitate better dispersion of REE species within the zeolite framework.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及使用后过渡金属元素，如锡（Sn）、锌（Zn）、镓（Ga）、铟（In）、铁（Fe）等来形成协同催化剂。这些元素有助于在还原过程中与活性金属形成合金结构。这些催化剂的有效性很大程度上依赖于它们实现活性位点高度分散和可调节的金属-支持相互作用的能力，这归功于它们独特的孔结构。BEA和微孔硅铝磷酸盐（MFI）拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，因为它们能够促进稀有地球元素（REE）通过其通道内的硅醇基团的原子迁移。这种迁移对于增强REE的分散至关重要，从而降低形成合金所需的还原温度。研究提供了设计高性能和稳定高硅双金属-沸石催化剂用于PDH反应的见解。然而，发展面临合成挑战，特别是在提高REE的分散度的同时维持较低的还原温度以形成合金。正在探索策略以克服这些挑战，重点关注通过增强还原势能来促进REE物种在沸石骨架内的更好分散。
