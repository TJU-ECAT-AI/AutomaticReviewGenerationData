          The synthesis of PtCe cluster catalysts involves the utilization of high-silica Beta zeolite as support to improve catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. Appropriate Al sites play an indispensable role in regulating the metal-support interaction by further stabilizing the active site structure. The closely associated Pt and Ce species are critical to embodying the outstanding catalytic activity and stability at 550°C. To address the difficulties of synthesizing Pt-REE nanoalloy catalysts, a combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests is proposed as an efficient way to regulate metal-support interactions. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance due to the well-dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. The role of Al sites in stabilizing active sites is balanced with their potential to act as side-reaction sites, depending on the amount and location on the zeolite surface. High-silica zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which benefits the high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance, robust structure of catalytic sites, low deactivation constant, and good redispersion capability after multiple regenerations. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the balance between metal dispersion, support functionality, and metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity.

          The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in PDH reactions often utilize high-silica Beta zeolites as supports to enhance catalytic stability and propylene selectivity. Defect sites resulting from silanol nests facilitate the dispersion of PtCe clusters within the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite channels. Appropriate Al sites are essential in controlling the metal-support interaction, thereby stabilizing the active site structure. The synergy between Pt and Ce species contributes to the catalyst's remarkable activity and stability at 550°C. For Pt-REE nanoalloy catalyst synthesis challenges, a strategy combining framework Al sites and silanol nests is proposed to effectively regulate metal-support interactions. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, thanks to the well-dispersed PtCe species forming stable PtCe nanoalloys. This is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. The role of Al sites in stabilizing active sites is balanced with their potential to act as secondary reaction sites, depending on their amount and location on the zeolite surface. High-silica zeolite catalysts are considered among the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure that facilitates high dispersion of active sites and adjustable metal-support interactions. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showcases outstanding catalytic performance, a resilient structure, a low deactivation constant, and the ability to maintain high activity after numerous regenerations. Future PDH catalyst design efforts should concentrate on refining the balance between metal dispersion, support characteristics, and metal-support interactions to boost catalytic performance, stability, and selectivity.
