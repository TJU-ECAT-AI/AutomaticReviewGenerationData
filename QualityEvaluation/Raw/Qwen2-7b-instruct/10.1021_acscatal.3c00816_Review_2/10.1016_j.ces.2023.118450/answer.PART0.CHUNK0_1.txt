<p>The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite, while the trace Al sites play an important role in further stabilizing the active site structure by regulating the metal-support interaction.</p>
<p>This work proposed an efficient strategy for designing stable PtCe bimetallic clusters by utilizing silanol nests and Al sites to regulate the metal-support interaction synergistically.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio zeolite of H-type Beta (nominal SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) was calcined at 550 C for 12 h to completely remove the organic template agent before using.</p>
<p>The data of the actual metal loading of the catalysts before and after the PDH reaction were obtained by iCAP 7000 instrumentation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>The high-silica Beta zeolite (Zhejiang Twrd New Material Co., Ltd., denoted as Beta-557) of actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 557, the value is acquired from ICP-OES analysis.</p>
<p>The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite.</p>
<p>Combined with the EDS mapping and line scan results, the Pt and Ce species are uniform dispersed on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst.</p>
<p>The bulk phase structure of all fresh samples was investigated by the XRD. As shown in Fig. S1 A, the typical characteristic diffraction peaks of the parent Beta-39, Beta-557 and Beta samples, identify the structure are well-crystalline BEA topology.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows an excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity without obvious deactivation.</p>
<p>The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst retains the strong interaction between Al sites and metallic species.</p>
<p>For comparison, the end yield of propylene of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst is 33.0%, which is lower than that of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (end yield of propylene: 35.7%).</p>
<p>The introduction of Ce species well changed the structure of the Pt sites.</p>
<p>Thus, an appropriate increase of the amount of Ce might be beneficial for improving the dispersion of Pt sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, the amount of surface acid sites on PtCe-based catalysts increases with the number of added Ce species.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts are beneficial to achieving high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve utilizing zeolites with specific topologies such as MFI and BEA. These zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics, including high silica content, dense defect sites, and the presence of Al sites. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are crucial for anchoring and dispersing PtCe clusters within the zeolite channels. The trace Al sites play a significant role in stabilizing the active site structure by modulating the metal-support interaction. The synergy between the Al sites and defect sites allows for the construction of highly dispersed PtCe clusters, enhancing the catalytic performance in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could leverage these insights by optimizing the use of zeolite topologies, adjusting metal loadings, and fine-tuning metal-support interactions to achieve better dispersion, stability, and selectivity in PDH catalysts.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及使用特定拓扑结构的沸石，如MFI和BEA。这些沸石之所以占主导地位，是因为它们的结构特性，包括高硅含量、密集缺陷位点以及Al位点的存在。表面缺陷位点来源于硅醇基团的分解，对于锚定和分散PtCe簇在沸石通道内至关重要。痕量的Al位点在稳定活性位点结构方面起着重要作用，通过调节金属-支持相互作用。Al位点和缺陷位点之间的协同作用允许构建高度分散的PtCe簇，从而增强PDH反应的催化性能。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以利用这些见解，通过优化沸石拓扑结构、调整金属负载量和精细调整治金-支撑相互作用来实现更好的分散性、稳定性和选择性。
