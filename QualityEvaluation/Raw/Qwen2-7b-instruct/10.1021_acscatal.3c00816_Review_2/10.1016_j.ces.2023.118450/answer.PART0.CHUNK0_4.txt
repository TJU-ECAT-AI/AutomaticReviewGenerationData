<p>The typical way is to introduce the post-transition metal elements (e.g., Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc.) for synthesizing co-catalysts.</p>
<p>The emerging pre-transition metal elements (e.g., Ce, La, Y, etc.) as co-catalysts are also investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and a simple regeneration process.</p>
<p>To date, only limited quantity of strategies has been proposed to improve the dispersion of rare-earth species, in anticipation of reducing the reduction temperature via enhanced reduction potential energy.</p>
<p>Ryoo et al. ( Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020 ) develop a method for synthesis of the mesoporous Si-MFI zeolite topological structure rich in silanol nests through eliminating the framework Ga from Ga-MFI zeolite.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite.</p>
<p>This study gives a guidance for the design of high-performance and stable high-silica bimetal-zeolite catalyst in PDH reaction.</p>
<p>For comparison, the end yield of propylene of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst is 33.0%, which is lower than that of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (end yield of propylene: 35.7%).</p>
<p>However, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows an excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity without obvious deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.013 h1).</p>
<p>It reveals that the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite.</p>
<p>The defect sites on the surface of the high-silica Beta-557 are responsible for anchoring highly dispersed Ce sites, and furtherly alloying with neighboring Pt atoms to form stable PtCe alloys.</p>
<p>The high dispersion of Al sites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and support.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is noted that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics and other factors contributing to their effectiveness. MFI zeolites, particularly those with mesoporous structures, offer high dispersion of active metal species, which is crucial for PDH reactions. The BEA topological zeolites, especially high-silica versions, are favored for their dense silanol nests and trace Al sites. These features facilitate the anchoring of highly dispersed rare-earth elements (REE) like cerium (Ce), enabling alloy formation with the neighboring platinum (Pt) atoms to create stable PtCe nanoalloys. The dispersion of Al sites on the zeolite surface enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and the support, improving the overall catalytic performance. The effectiveness of these zeolites is further supported by their ability to maintain high catalytic stability and regenerability, as demonstrated by the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst, which exhibits excellent performance with a low deactivation constant of 0.013 h−1 and superior propylene selectivity. The strategy of using MFI and BEA topological zeolites with appropriate metal-loading and careful control of the reduction process offers a valuable reference for future developments in PDH catalyst design, aiming to enhance performance, stability, and recyclability.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，可以看出MFI和BEA拓扑沸石占据主导地位，这主要归功于它们的结构特性和其他因素对其实用性的贡献。MFI沸石，特别是具有介孔结构的那些，为活性金属物种提供了高分散性，这对于PDH反应至关重要。而BEA拓扑沸石，尤其是高硅版本，因其密集的硅醇基团和痕量Al位点而受到青睐。这些特性有助于锚定高度分散的稀土元素（REE）如铈（Ce），使其能够与相邻的铂（Pt）原子形成稳定的PtCe纳米合金。沸石表面的Al位点的高分散性增强了PtCe簇与支持物之间的相互作用，从而提高了整体催化性能。这种沸石的有效性进一步得到了维持高催化稳定性和再生能力的证明，正如0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557催化剂所展示的那样，其表现出出色的性能和极低的失活常数0.013 h−1以及优秀的丙烯选择性。利用MFI和BEA拓扑沸石进行适当的金属负载和仔细控制还原过程的战略为PDH催化剂设计的未来开发提供了宝贵的参考，旨在提高性能、稳定性和可回收性。
