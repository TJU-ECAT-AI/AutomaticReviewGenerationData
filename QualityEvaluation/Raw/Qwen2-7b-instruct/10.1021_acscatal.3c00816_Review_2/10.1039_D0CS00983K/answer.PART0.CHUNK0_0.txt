<p>Typically, the commercial fixed-bed CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergo 6000080000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles,138 and thus, the surface Cr species probably change during the continuous cycles.</p>
<p>As stated above, MCM-41 with a large surface area and low acidity, is also an appropriate carrier for VOx-based catalysts.158 Research has indicated that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, possesses higher intrinsic activity and lower selectivity to isobutylene compared with oligomerized vanadium species for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the increased possibility for isomerization of isobutylene and cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the addition of B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst can further enhance the dispersion of vanadium species and improve the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to olefins.159 Porous VSiO2 catalysts, demonstrating a mesoporous structure with high specific surface area, have also been synthesized, and vanadium species are highly dispersed in the channels of the mesoporous silica.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the conventional carrier ZrO2145 or Al2O358 with surface defects has been demonstrated to exhibit relatively good dehydrogenation performance. Al2O3 itself can catalyze the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, while having a long induction period and relatively high coke formation rate. The coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are generally regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Actually, both the commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation while the high cost of Pt and the harmful effect of CrOx drive the researchers to develop a novel inexpensive and environmental-friendly catalyst. At present, a lot of innovative research studies are opening up new directions, and many catalytic systems demonstrate comparable dehydrogenation performance with the commercial catalysts.</p>
<p>The WO3-containing catalyst, highly active and selective, has been applied in the ADHO process. For the dehydrogenation of pure propane at 600 C and 0.13 MPa, the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene reach about 43% and 90% (see the product distribution listed in Table 2), respectively.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. These zeolites are favored due to their structural characteristics, specifically their high surface area, regular pore structure, and tunable acidity. This allows for the creation of isolated metal sites that can effectively catalyze the activation and cleavage of alkane bonds without promoting unwanted side reactions. Their effectiveness stems from their ability to facilitate the selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds, enabling the production of mono-olefins from alkanes. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could benefit from further optimizing the synthesis methods to improve the stability and longevity of these catalysts, particularly in terms of maintaining their structural integrity and catalytic activity over extended operational periods. This includes exploring new synthesis routes that might enable the creation of even more robust zeolite supports or the incorporation of advanced metal functionalities that enhance both the dehydrogenation efficiency and the selectivity towards desired products.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。这些沸石因其结构特征而受到青睐，特别是它们的高比表面积、规则孔结构和可调酸性。这允许创建孤立的金属位点，可以有效地催化烷烃键的活化和断裂，同时避免不希望的副反应。它们的有效性源于它们能够选择性地激活CH键而不是CC键，从而从烷烃产生单烯烃。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以从进一步优化合成方法开始，以提高这些催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命，特别是在保持其结构完整性和催化活性方面。这包括探索新的合成途径，可能使更坚固的沸石支撑材料的创造成为可能，或者整合先进的金属功能，从而增强脱氢效率和目标产物的选择性。
