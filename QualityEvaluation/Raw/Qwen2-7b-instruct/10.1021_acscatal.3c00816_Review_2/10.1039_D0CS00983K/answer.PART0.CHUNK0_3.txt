[1] "Among the surface species, V3+ is regarded as the most active site for propane dehydrogenation, while V4+ species are less active, but more stable against coke formation."
[2] "The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is also affected by the introduced P content. For isobutane dehydrogenation over the NiP/SiO2 catalyst, with the increase of P loading amount, various NiP compounds (Ni3P, Ni12P5, Ni2P) are formed on the catalyst surface, leading to different dehydrogenation performances."
[3] "For propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts, Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3 (0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn) with the highest Pt dispersion possessed the highest yield and selectivity to propylene."
[4] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed."

1. V3+ is considered the most active site for propane dehydrogenation, whereas V4+ species are less active but more stable against coke formation.
2. The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is influenced by the P content. For isobutane dehydrogenation, as the P loading amount increases, various NiP compounds (Ni3P, Ni12P5, Ni2P) form on the catalyst surface, resulting in different dehydrogenation performances.
3. In the case of a supported Pt catalyst, Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3 (with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn) has the highest Pt dispersion, yielding the highest propylene yield and selectivity.
4. The increase of linear velocity in a constant space time is unfavorable for the adsorption of formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing of oil vapor, thus inhibiting secondary reactions such as polycondensation to coke, despite the consequent increase in catalyst bed pressure drop.

1.V3+被认为是丙烷脱氢化反应中最活跃的位点，而V4+物种活性较低，但对焦炭形成更稳定。
2.NiP催化剂的脱氢性能受P含量影响。对于异丁烷脱氢化，随着P装载量的增加，在催化剂表面形成各种NiP化合物（Ni3P、Ni12P5、Ni2P），导致不同的脱氢性能。
3.在负载Pt催化剂的情况下，Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3（含0.5 wt% Pt和0.75 wt% Sn）具有最高的Pt分散度，产生最高的丙烯产率和选择性。
4.在恒定空间时间的情况下，线速度的增加不利于形成烯烃在催化剂表面的吸附，并减少了油蒸汽的回混程度，从而抑制了烯烃聚合成焦炭等二次反应，尽管这会导致催化剂床压力降的增加。
