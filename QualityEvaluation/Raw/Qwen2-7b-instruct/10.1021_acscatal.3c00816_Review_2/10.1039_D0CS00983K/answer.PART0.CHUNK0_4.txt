1. Commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts typically undergo 60,000 to 80,000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The surface Cr species may change during these continuous cycles.
2. MCM-41, with its large surface area and low acidity, serves as a suitable carrier for VOx-based catalysts. Isolated vanadium shows higher intrinsic activity but lower selectivity to isobutylene compared to oligomerized vanadium species.
3. Sn addition reduces the energy barriers for olefin desorption and increases the activation energy for deep dehydrogenation, thereby improving olefin selectivity.
4. The introduction of Sn into the catalyst can effectively reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability, albeit without resolving the issue of Sn loss.
5. New environment-friendly catalysts require long-term stability in both dehydrogenation performance and structural properties for industrial application.
6. In-depth research on reaction mechanisms and catalyst active sites is a significant challenge.
7. Improving reactor efficiency with reduced pressure drop is crucial for enhancing single-pass conversion and minimizing energy consumption.

1. 商业CrOx/Al2O3催化剂通常经历60,000到80,000次脱氢再生循环。表面Cr物种可能在这些连续循环中发生变化。
2. MCM-41，以其大表面积和低酸性，作为VOx基催化剂的理想载体。孤立的钒比聚集体显示出更高的内在活性但更低的选择性异丁烯。
3. 添加Sn可以降低烯烃脱附的能量壁垒并增加深度脱氢的激活能，从而显著提高烯烃选择性。
4. 添加Sn到催化剂中可以有效地抑制焦炭形成并增强催化剂稳定性，尽管无法解决Sn损失的问题。
5. 新的环境友好型催化剂需要在脱氢性能和结构特性上具有长期稳定性以供工业应用。
6. 在位表征技术对于深入研究反应机制以及催化剂活性位点是巨大的挑战。
7. 提高反应器效率并减少压降是增强单次通过转化率并最小化能源消耗的关键。
