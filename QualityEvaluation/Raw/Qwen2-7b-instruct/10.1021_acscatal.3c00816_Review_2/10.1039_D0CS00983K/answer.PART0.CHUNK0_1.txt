<p>Typically, the commercial fixed-bed CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergo 6000080000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles,138 and thus, the surface Cr species probably change during the continuous cycles.</p>
<p>For propane dehydrogenation over the catalyst with excellent performance under appropriate conditions, the highest selectivity to propylene is above 99 mol%.</p>
<p>The induction period can also be detected since the coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus sites are active for dehydrogenation, and thus the high temperature reduction by hydrogen prior to reaction can facilitate the formation of the active Zrcus sites,146 and shorten the induction period effectively.</p>
<p>For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the selectivity to isobutylene exceeds 80% for isobutane dehydrogenation over all these catalysts.</p>
<p>In the process of dehydrogenation, CrOx catalyst deactivates by coking in a short time and requires to be regenerated by coke-burning frequently, while the PtSn catalyst deactivates due to coking and sintering, and needs to be regenerated by oxychlorination with air and chloride.</p>
<p>For the ADHO process, the reaction/regeneration system consists of a reactor and a regenerator, and they have similar structures.</p>

1. Commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts can undergo up to 80,000 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles before the surface chromium species change. 
2. With proper conditions, the highest selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation can surpass 99 mol%.
3. The high temperature reduction of hydrogen prior to reaction helps form active Zrcus sites, thus shortening the induction period.
4. Metal sulfide catalysts, when introduced to isobutane dehydrogenation, show isobutylene selectivities exceeding 80%.
5. CrOx catalysts deplete rapidly due to coke deposition, necessitating frequent regeneration, whereas PtSn catalysts degrade through coke deposition and sintering, requiring oxychlorination regeneration.
6. The ADHO process employs a reactor and regenerator with similar structures to handle alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 商用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂在经历多达80,000次加氢-再生循环后，表面铬物种可能会发生变化。
2. 在适当条件下，丙烷脱氢的最大丙烯选择性可以超过99摩尔%。
3. 高温氢化前的高温还原有助于形成活性Zrcus位点，从而缩短诱导期。
4. 当引入金属硫化物到异丁烷脱氢时，异丁烯的选择性可超过80%。
5. CrOx催化剂由于焦炭沉积迅速耗尽，需要频繁再生，而PtSn催化剂则因焦炭沉积和烧结而降解，需要通过空气和氯化物的氧氯化再生。
6. ADHO过程使用具有相似结构的反应器和再生器来处理烷烃脱氢。
