[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is observed that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, characterized by their medium pore size, facilitate the separation of products, while BEA zeolites, known for their large micropores, are effective in adsorbing reactants and intermediates. The modification of Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports enhances the PDH performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts. This improvement is attributed to the tuned state of active Co species and the surface acid property, which are influenced by the titanium species within the zeolite structure. As the Si/Ti ratio decreases, the titanium species evolve from the framework and extra-framework forms to smaller anatase TiO2 species, altering the dispersion and chemical state of the cobalt sites. This modification leads to a reduction in surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, in Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios. This reduction facilitates the desorption of propylene (C3H6), thereby enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability of the catalysts. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the balance between the zeolite structure, metal loading, and support properties to achieve higher efficiency and stability in propane dehydrogenation processes.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，可以发现MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这归功于它们的独特结构特性。MFI沸石以其中等孔径而闻名，有利于产物的分离，而BEA沸石因其大微孔而有效吸附反应物和中间体。通过修改Ti-ZSM-5沸石作为支撑，提高了非贵金属钴基催化剂的PDH性能。这种改进归因于活性钴物种的状态和表面酸性性质的调整，这些性质受沸石结构中的钛物种的影响。随着Si/Ti比的降低，钛物种从框架和额外框架形式转变为较小的金红石TiO2物种，改变了钴位点的分散性和化学状态。这种修改导致高Si/Ti比的Ti-ZSM-5沸石中表面酸性的显著减少，尤其是Brnsted酸性。这促进了丙烯（C3H6）的脱附，从而增强了催化剂的选择性和抗结焦稳定性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化沸石结构、金属负载和支撑性质之间的平衡，以实现更高效率和稳定性的丙烷脱氢过程。
