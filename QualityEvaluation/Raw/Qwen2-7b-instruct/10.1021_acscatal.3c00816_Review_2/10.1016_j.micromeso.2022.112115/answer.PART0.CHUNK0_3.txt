[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the importance of modifying Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports. These modifications enhance the performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts through tuning the state of active Co species and the surface acidity of the catalysts. The use of Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites leads to improved propane dehydrogenation efficiency, specifically in terms of propylene selectivity and stability during recycling reactions. The structural evolution of Ti species within these zeolites, influenced by the Si/Ti ratio, affects the dispersion and chemical state of Co sites, impacting the catalyst's performance. High Si/Ti ratios in Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites result in reduced surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, which facilitates the desorption of C3H6. This reduction in acidity contributes to higher selectivity and anti-coke stability in PDH reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include further refinement of zeolite structures and composition to optimize catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and stability.
