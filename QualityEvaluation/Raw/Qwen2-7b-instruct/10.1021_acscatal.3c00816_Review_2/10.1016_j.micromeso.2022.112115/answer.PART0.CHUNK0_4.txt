[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their specific structural characteristics. MFI zeolites have a cubic structure with channels and cages that facilitate the formation of active metal sites and control the diffusion of reactants and products. BEA zeolites, with a hexagonal framework, offer additional flexibility in pore size and shape, which can be tailored for optimized catalytic activity. These zeolites' microporous and mesoporous nature enables the precise control of surface properties such as acidity, which is crucial for the selective conversion of propane to propylene in PDH reactions.

The effectiveness of these catalysts is further enhanced by tuning the dispersion and chemical state of the active metal species (Co in this case) through the modification of the zeolite support. The introduction of Ti species into the zeolite structure changes its acidity profile, particularly reducing Brnsted acidity, which promotes the efficient desorption of propylene and minimizes coke formation. This reduction in surface acidity leads to higher selectivity and improved anti-coke stability.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on refining the synthesis methods to better control the distribution and reactivity of metal species within the zeolite framework. This includes exploring new metal-zeolite combinations, optimizing the synthesis conditions, and modifying the zeolite structure to achieve even greater control over surface properties and catalyst performance. Additionally, incorporating advanced analytical techniques for real-time monitoring of reaction conditions and product distributions could enable more dynamic and responsive catalyst optimization strategies.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法显示，MFI和BEA拓扑沸石占据主导地位，这是由于它们特定的结构特性。MFI沸石具有立方结构，含有通道和笼子，可以促进活性金属位点的形成并控制反应物和产物的扩散。BEA沸石具有六边形骨架，提供了额外的灵活性来调整孔径大小和形状，这可以进行优化以获得最佳的催化活性。这些沸石的微孔和介孔性质允许精确控制表面性质，如酸性，这对于丙烷选择性转化为丙烯的PDH反应至关重要。

这些催化剂的有效性进一步通过调节活性金属物种（本例中为Co）在沸石支持材料中的分布和化学状态得到增强。通过向沸石结构中引入Ti物种改变其酸性轮廓，特别是减少了Brnsted酸性，从而促进了丙烯的高效脱附并最小化了焦炭形成。这种减少表面酸性的结果导致更高的选择性和改进的抗焦炭稳定性。

PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向可以集中在精炼合成方法，以更好地控制沸石框架内金属物种的分布和活性。这包括探索新的金属-沸石组合，优化合成条件，并修改沸石结构以实现对表面性质和催化剂性能的更精细控制。此外，集成先进的分析技术进行实时监测反应条件和产品分布可以启用更加动态和响应式的催化剂优化策略。
