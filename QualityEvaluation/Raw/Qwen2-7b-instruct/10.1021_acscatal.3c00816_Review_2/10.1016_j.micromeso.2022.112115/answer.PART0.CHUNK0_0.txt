• "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
• "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
• "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
• "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve incorporating metals like cobalt (Co) onto zeolite supports such as Ti-ZSM-5. The effectiveness of these catalysts is influenced by the tuning of the titanium (Ti) species and the dispersion and chemical state of the Co species on the surface. The structure of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolite, characterized by its Si/Ti ratio, plays a crucial role in determining the state of the Ti species, which in turn affects the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites. High Si/Ti ratios result in reduced surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, which facilitates the desorption of propylene (C3H6), enhancing selectivity and anti-coke stability. This approach allows for the selective catalysis of propane dehydrogenation, leading to high propylene yields and improved catalyst stability during recycling PDH reactions.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法包括将金属如钴（Co）整合到支持物如Ti-ZSM-5沸石上。这些催化剂的有效性受到钛（Ti）物种的调谐以及活性钴物种在表面的分散和化学状态的影响。Ti-ZSM-5沸石的结构，由其Si/Ti比决定，对Ti物种的状态起着关键作用，进而影响钴位点的分散和化学状态。高Si/Ti比导致表面酸度显著降低，特别是Brnsted酸度，这有利于丙烯（C3H6）的脱附，从而提高选择性和抗结焦稳定性。这种方法允许选择性催化丙烷脱氢，导致高丙烯产率和循环PDH反应过程中的改进催化剂稳定性。
