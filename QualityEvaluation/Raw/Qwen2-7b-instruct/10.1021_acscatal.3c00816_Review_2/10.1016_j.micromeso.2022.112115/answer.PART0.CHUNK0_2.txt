[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, known for their high surface area and pore size suitable for hydrocarbon conversion, and BEA zeolites, which offer a larger pore diameter for easier diffusion of reactants and products, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. These zeolites facilitate efficient conversion of propane to propylene, a critical product in petrochemical industries.

The structural evolution of titanium species within the zeolites, influenced by varying Si/Ti ratios, plays a crucial role in tuning the dispersion and chemical state of the active cobalt (Co) species. This optimization ensures better catalyst performance, specifically in terms of selectivity towards propylene and resistance against coke formation. By modifying the zeolite structure, researchers can tailor the surface properties, such as acidity, which directly impacts the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

Incorporating titanium (Ti)-modified zeolites as supports for Co catalysts enhances PDH performance through several mechanisms. First, the tuned state of active Co species allows for selective conversion of propane, leading to high propylene yield. Second, the controlled surface acidity, particularly the reduction in Brønsted acidity in zeolites with higher Si/Ti ratios, facilitates the efficient desorption of propylene, thereby improving selectivity and stability during cyclic PDH reactions. This strategy not only optimizes the catalyst's performance but also contributes to its longevity and efficiency in industrial applications.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on further refining the synthesis methods to achieve even more precise control over the zeolite structure, catalyst dispersion, and surface properties. Tailored catalysts with optimized activity, selectivity, and stability could lead to significant improvements in PDH processes, enhancing the economic viability and environmental impact of petrochemical production.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，用于金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的分析显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这得益于它们的独特结构特征。MFI沸石因其高比表面积和适合烃类转化的孔径而闻名，而BEA沸石则提供较大的孔径，便于反应物和产物的扩散，这些特性使其在PDH反应中非常有效。这些沸石通过促进丙烷转化为丙烯来促进高效转化，这是石油化工行业至关重要的产品。

沸石中的钛物种的结构演变，受Si/Ti比例变化的影响，对于调节活性钴（Co）物种的分散性和化学状态至关重要。这种优化确保了催化剂性能的提高，特别是选择性向丙烯以及抵抗结焦的能力。通过调整沸石结构，研究人员可以定制表面性质，如酸度，这直接影响反应动力学和产物分布。

将钛（Ti）修改的沸石作为Co催化剂的支持物，能够增强PDH性能通过几种机制。首先，调整活性Co物种的状态允许选择性地转化丙烷，从而实现高丙烯产率。其次，通过控制Si/Ti比例更高的沸石的表面酸度，尤其是减少Brønsted酸度，促进丙烯的高效脱附，从而改善选择性和稳定性，尤其是在循环PDH反应期间。这一策略不仅优化了催化剂的性能，而且有助于其在工业应用中的长期性和效率。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在进一步精炼合成方法，以实现对沸石结构、催化剂分散性和表面性质更精确的控制。定制的催化剂，具有优化的活性、选择性和稳定性，可能在PDH过程中带来显著改进，从而增强石油化工生产的经济性和环境影响。
