[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "Earlier reports by Ovsitser et al. described a silica supported VOx catalyst which exhibited high propene yield (86%), high stability and minimal deactivation over a 20 h DDH reaction.144"
[3] "Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[4] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[5] "As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date."
[6] "It was shown that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[7] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[8] "For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported."
[9] "Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C)."
[10] "The increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively."

Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is evident that mesoporous MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, characterized by their 12-membered ring channels and square planar framework, and BEA zeolites, with their 10-membered ring channels and cubic structure, are particularly effective in PDH reactions.

Their effectiveness stems from several factors. Firstly, the high surface area and ordered pore structure of these zeolites facilitate efficient mass and diffusion transfer, which is crucial for the PDH reaction. Secondly, the zeolite framework allows for precise control over the dispersion of metal species, enabling the creation of active sites with optimal geometry and electronic properties. This is exemplified by the use of V-DMSNs, which combine the advantages of vanadium nanoparticles within mesoporous silica, enhancing the interaction between the metal species and the support. The absence of V2O5 crystallites contributes to high catalytic activity and stability.

The synthesis methods themselves are also critical. Wet impregnation, co-assembly, and direct co-assembly processes have been utilized to prepare metal-zeolite catalysts. Each method impacts the dispersion and speciation of metal species on the zeolite surface. For instance, the direct co-assembly process between vanadium and silica nanoparticles facilitates enhanced interaction between the metal species and the support, leading to the formation of highly dispersed and stable VOx species. This results in high catalytic activity and stability, as seen in the V-DMSNs catalysts.

Furthermore, the incorporation of dopants such as Mg, Zr, and Cu has been shown to enhance the catalytic performance of metal-zeolite catalysts. Mg modification, for example, reduces the amount of coke deposits by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing the concentration of active V3+ species. This is a testament to the role of structural characteristics and synthesis methods in tailoring the catalytic behavior of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions.

Looking ahead, future developments in PDH catalyst design will likely focus on refining synthesis methods to achieve better control over metal dispersion, speciation, and support interaction. This will involve exploring novel synthesis techniques, optimizing reaction conditions, and employing advanced characterization methods to probe the structure-property relationships. The goal is to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability, while minimizing the formation of coke and other byproducts. Such advancements will not only enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions but also pave the way for more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes.

分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的合成方法，可以看出MFI和BEA拓扑沸石因其独特的结构特性而占据主导地位。MFI沸石具有12元环通道和正方形框架，而BEA沸石具有10元环通道和立方结构，这在PDH反应中特别有效。

它们的有效性源自几个因素。首先，这些沸石的高比表面积和有序孔结构促进了有效的质量转移和扩散，这对于PDH反应至关重要。其次，沸石框架允许对金属物种的精确控制，从而创建具有最佳几何形状和电子性质的活性位点。例如，V-DMSNs的使用结合了纳米颗粒状的钒与多孔二氧化硅的优点，增强了金属物种与支持物之间的相互作用，导致高度分散和稳定的VOx物种的形成。多孔结构的存在有助于保持高催化活性和稳定性。

合成方法本身也至关重要。湿浸渍、共组装和直接共组装过程已被用于制备金属-沸石催化剂。每种方法都会影响金属物种在沸石表面的分散性和组分。例如，直接共组装过程在范德华之间形成了金属物种和支撑物之间的增强相互作用，促进了高度分散和稳定的VOx物种的形成。这种结果导致高催化活性和稳定性，正如V-DMSNs催化剂所展示的那样。

此外，镁、锆和铜等掺杂剂的引入已证明可以增强金属-沸石催化剂的催化性能。镁改性通过分散V2O5晶粒并增加活性V3+物种的浓度来减少焦炭沉积物的数量。这表明结构特性和合成方法在调整金属-沸石催化剂的PDH反应行为方面的作用。

展望未来，PDH催化剂设计的发展将集中在进一步细化合成方法，以实现对金属分散、组分和支撑物相互作用的更好控制。这将涉及探索新的合成技术、优化反应条件，并采用先进的表征方法来探究结构-性能关系。目标是创建具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂，同时最大限度地减少焦炭和其他副产品的生成。这样的进步不仅会提高PDH反应的效率，而且还将开辟更可持续和环境友好的工艺途径。
