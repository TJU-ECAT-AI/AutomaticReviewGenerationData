Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is clear that zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA topological zeolites, dominate in this application. Their unique framework and channel structure, along with high surface areas and tunable acid properties, contribute significantly to their effectiveness. The specific surface area and low acidity of zeolites like SBA-15 enhance the stability of the catalysts, enabling longer reaction times without significant loss of performance. The interactions between metal species and the zeolite support, which determine the catalyst performance, are also a crucial factor in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should continue to leverage the benefits of zeolite supports, while also exploring ways to optimize metal loading, promoter incorporation, and synthesis methods to improve activity and selectivity.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，可以发现，特别是MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。它们独特的框架和通道结构、高表面积和可调酸性特性，对提高催化剂性能至关重要。SBA-15等沸石的特定表面积和低酸性提高了催化剂的稳定性，使得在长时间反应后仍能保持良好的性能。金属物种与沸石支持之间的相互作用，决定了催化剂的性能，在PDH反应中也起着关键作用。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应继续利用沸石支撑的优势，同时探索优化金属负载、促进剂掺入和合成方法以提高活性和选择性。
