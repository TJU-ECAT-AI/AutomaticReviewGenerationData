<p>The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. After an induction time of 1 h, the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (crystallized at 100 C) achieved the best performance giving a propene yield of 60%, equivalent to a STY of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 10).</p>

The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation reactions involves the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). This approach enables the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase. The crystallization temperature plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. As the crystallization temperature increases up to 100°C, the number of Lewis acid sites on the support increases, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. At a crystallization temperature of 100°C, the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst achieved the best performance with a propene yield of 60%, equivalent to a space-time yield (STY) of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的主要合成方法是阳离子-阴离子双水解法（CADH）。这种方法能够合成具有高比表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3。结晶温度直接影响了VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能。随着结晶温度增加至100°C，支持体上的路易斯酸中心数量增加，进而影响表面V物种的分布。在100°C的结晶温度下，VOx/Al2O3催化剂达到了最佳性能，丙烯产率为60%，相当于空间时间产率（STY）为15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。
