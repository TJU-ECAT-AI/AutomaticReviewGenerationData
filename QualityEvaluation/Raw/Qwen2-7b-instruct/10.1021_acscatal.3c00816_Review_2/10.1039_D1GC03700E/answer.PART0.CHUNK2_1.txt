[1] "In the above sections, the literature on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has been critically reviewed. Each sub-reaction of propane dehydrogenation has specific kinetic and thermodynamic requirements, and this is reflected in the diverse variety of catalysts that have been developed in recent decades."
[2] "For the DDH reaction, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts dominate the highest space time yield measurements. This is expected given their widespread use in industrial processes."
[3] "Beyond this, ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts perform strongly, and their low cost and low toxicity make them well-suited for commercial application."
[4] "In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application."
[5] "In ODH-CO2, the performance of the most active catalysts is still well below what would be considered for commercialisation, but the research community should look to the successes of the abovementioned abundant elements for inspiration in designing novel ODH-CO2 catalysts."
[6] "While the current focus of government policy is based on net zero carbon, it is clear that society will still need a wide range of products based on carbon-containing molecules."
[7] "An analysis of the sustainability of current C3H6 production methods, namely steam cracking and methanol-to-olefins, reveals that direct dehydrogenation has several advantages in efficiency when a selective catalyst is applied."
[8] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."
[9] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
[10] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
[11] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years. This may be due to the unfavourable economic costs associated with using N2O as an oxidant."
