[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield."
[3] "The most active catalyst, with 3 wt% V loading, displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[4] "The formation of V2O5 was shown to occur at lower V loadings for more acidic supports, such as SiO2, whilst using a high surface area silicate, MCM-41, was found to maintain a high STY due to a larger area for dispersion."
[5] "In contrast to supported VOx catalysts that produce COx, the major by-product is typically ethene, which is of course more valuable than carbon oxides."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics and properties that facilitate PDH processes. MFI zeolites, characterized by their cubic structure and high surface area, offer a large number of Lewis acid sites that are crucial for the activation of propane molecules. BEA zeolites, on the other hand, have a higher density of Brønsted acid sites, which contribute to the selectivity of propene formation. The acidic sites in both MFI and BEA zeolites enable efficient proton transfer and coordination, promoting the PDH reaction pathway.

These zeolites' structural features, such as the regular pore networks and the high surface area, provide a suitable environment for the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. The Lewis acid sites, particularly in MFI zeolites, are instrumental in facilitating the dehydrogenation process, while the Brønsted acid sites in BEA zeolites aid in the selectivity of propene formation. The high dispersion of metal species within the zeolite framework ensures a more uniform and efficient conversion of propane to propene.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions is further enhanced by the ability to tailor the synthesis conditions, such as the type and amount of metal incorporated, the synthesis temperature, and the presence of dopants or promoters. These factors influence the metal distribution, acidity, and reactivity of the catalyst, leading to improved performance in terms of conversion, selectivity, and stability.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to better control the metal loading, the metal-support interactions, and the overall framework structure of MFI and BEA zeolites. This could involve exploring the use of novel synthesis routes, such as sol-gel processes or microwave-assisted synthesis, to achieve higher dispersion and more uniform metal distribution. Additionally, incorporating new metal species or modifying the zeolite framework with functional groups could potentially lead to the creation of more active and selective catalysts for PDH reactions.

The implication of MFI and BEA zeolites' effectiveness in PDH reactions is significant for the petrochemical industry, as they offer a robust platform for the production of propene from propane. The ability to efficiently convert propane into propene with high selectivity and stability can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective processes in the production of propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, and other valuable chemical intermediates derived from propene.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法揭示，MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH过程中占据主导地位，这是由于它们独特的结构特性和属性。MFI沸石以其立方结构和高表面积为特征，提供了大量Lewis酸位点，对于丙烷分子的活化至关重要。BEA沸石则具有更高的布隆斯特酸位点密度，有助于丙烯选择性形成。MFI和BEA沸石中的酸位点不仅促进了丙烷的活化过程，而且有助于丙烯的选择性形成。

这两种沸石的独特结构特性，如规则的孔网络和高表面积，为丙烷分子的吸附和激活提供了一个适宜的环境。MFI沸石中的Lewis酸位点特别对促进PDH反应途径起着关键作用，而BEA沸石中的Brønsted酸位点有助于丙烯的选择性形成。高分散的金属物种在沸石框架内的分布确保了更均匀且高效的丙烷到丙烯的转化。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性进一步得益于调节合成条件以更好地控制金属负载、金属-支持相互作用以及整体框架结构的能力。这些因素影响金属分布、酸性和活性，从而导致性能的改进，包括转化率、选择性和稳定性。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成方法以更好地控制金属负载、金属-支持相互作用以及沸石框架的整体结构。这可能涉及探索新的合成路线，如溶胶-凝胶过程或微波辅助合成，以实现更高分散度和更均匀的金属分布。此外，引入新金属物种或通过功能性基团修饰沸石框架可以潜在地导致PDH反应中更活跃和选择性更强的催化剂的创造。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性对石油化工行业具有重要意义，因为它们提供了一个强大的平台用于从丙烷生产丙烯。高效且选择性高的丙烷转化为丙烯，并保持稳定性的能力，可以导致丙二醇、丙二醇碳酸酯等有价值的化学中间体的生产更加可持续和成本效益。
