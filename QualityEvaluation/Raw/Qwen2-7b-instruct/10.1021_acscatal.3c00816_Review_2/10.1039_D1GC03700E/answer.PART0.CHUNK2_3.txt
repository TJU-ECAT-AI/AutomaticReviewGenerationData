[1] "Bulk and supported iron oxides have been investigated by Michorczyk et al.277 Unsupported Fe2O3 exhibited reasonable activity at 600 C when using a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, with a propene yield of 7.5%."
[2] "A 5 wt% ZnO/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was investigated by Ren et al. using a broad range of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (60, 120, 160, 201 and 242) at 600 C.278 While all of the prepared catalysts exhibited some activity (with conversion ranging from 4086%), the highest propene yield was observed over ZnO/H-ZSM-5 (160), which was 46.8%."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst is very resistant to deactivation and its use for the ODH-N2O reaction is contingent on several factors. The oxidation of extra-framework Fe2+ sites to Fe3+O sites is a crucial step in the mechanism, and therefore producing a material with a large number of these sites would increase the yield of propene."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve incorporating metal oxides into zeolite frameworks. Zeolites, with their microporous and well-defined structures, provide a suitable environment for metal dispersion and stabilization. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their high surface area, uniform pore sizes, and well-defined pore networks, which facilitate the adsorption and desorption of hydrocarbons and reactants. Their structural characteristics, including the presence of strong Brönsted acid sites and weak Lewis acid sites, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by activating the hydrocarbons and promoting the dehydrogenation process. The high activity and selectivity of MFI and BEA zeolites are attributed to their ability to control the adsorption and reaction pathways of the feedstock. For future developments in PDH catalyst design, focusing on enhancing metal dispersion, optimizing zeolite pore structures, and improving the coordination of metal sites with zeolite frameworks will likely lead to more efficient and selective catalysts. The integration of advanced synthesis techniques, such as sol-gel, co-precipitation, and ion exchange, may also enable the creation of tailored catalysts with improved performance for PDH reactions.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法是将金属氧化物引入沸石框架中。沸石，以其微孔结构和明确的结构而闻名，为金属分散和稳定提供了合适的环境。MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，这归功于它们的高比表面积、均匀孔径和明确的孔网络，这些特性有利于烃类和反应物的吸附与脱附。它们的结构特征，包括强Brönsted酸位点和弱Lewis酸位点的存在，促进了对烃类的激活以及脱氢过程的推进。MFI和BEA沸石的高活性和选择性归因于它们能够控制进料的吸附和反应途径。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在提高金属分散度、优化沸石孔结构和改善金属位点与沸石框架的协调上，从而实现更高效的催化剂。先进的合成技术，如溶胶-凝胶法、共沉淀法和离子交换法的集成，也可能使定制化催化剂的创建成为可能，以提高PDH反应的性能。
