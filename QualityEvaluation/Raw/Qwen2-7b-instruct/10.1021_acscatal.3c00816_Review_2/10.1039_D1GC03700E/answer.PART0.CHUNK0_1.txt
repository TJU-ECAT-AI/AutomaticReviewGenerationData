[1] "Zeolites have been studied as potential supports for Pt-based catalysts due to their high surface areas, well-defined pore architectures and tuneable acid properties."
[2] "Wannapakdee et al. explored silicate-1 and Al2O3 based monometallic Pt catalysts.59 The performance over 10 h on-stream differed between the Pt/silicalite-1 and Pt/Al2O3 materials, shown by >99% and 60% propene selectivity, respectively."
[3] "The most common deactivation pathway is coking, which can cause sintering in both the support and Cr."
[4] "Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."
[5] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature a cubic structure with channels that are 9 Å in length and 6 Å in width, allowing for efficient mass transport and minimizing the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, which enhances stability. BEA zeolites, on the other hand, have channels with dimensions of 10 Å x 10 Å x 10 Å, providing a more open framework for better access of reactants and products. Their tunable acidity, due to the adjustable SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, also contributes to their effectiveness. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include optimizing the synthesis methods to create zeolites with more precise channel sizes and improved acidity regulation. This would lead to more selective and stable catalysts with higher productivity.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据了主导地位，这归因于它们独特的结构特性。MFI沸石具有立方结构，通道长度为9Å，宽度为6Å，这有助于高效地进行物质传输，并最大限度地减少大型烃分子的形成，从而提高稳定性。BEA沸石的通道尺寸为10Å×10Å×10Å，提供了更开放的框架，有利于更好地访问反应物和产物。其可调的酸性，由于SiO2/Al2O3比例的调整，也对它们的有效性做出了贡献。未来PDH催化剂设计的含义包括优化合成方法以创建具有更精确通道尺寸和更好的酸度调节的沸石。这将导致选择性更高、稳定性更好、生产力更高的催化剂。
