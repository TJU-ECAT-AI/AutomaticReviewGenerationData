[1] "The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include co-precipitation, sol-gel, and ion-exchange. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas."
[2] "Their structural characteristics, such as the size and connectivity of the pores, facilitate the adsorption and desorption of hydrocarbons, which is crucial for PDH reactions."
[3] "Additionally, the high surface areas of MFI and BEA zeolites provide ample sites for the active metal species, enhancing the catalytic activity."
[4] "The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include exploring the use of novel zeolite frameworks and incorporating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to tailor the surface chemistry and improve the selectivity and stability of the catalysts."
[5] "Research is ongoing to optimize the synthesis conditions and tailor the properties of the metal-zeolite catalysts to maximize their performance in PDH reactions."
