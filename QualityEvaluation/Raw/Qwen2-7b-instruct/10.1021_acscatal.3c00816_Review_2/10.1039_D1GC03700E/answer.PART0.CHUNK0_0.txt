Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. Their high surface areas, well-defined pore architectures, and tuneable acid properties contribute to their effectiveness. The hierarchical pore structure and presence of weak acid sites on MFI zeolites enhance activity and selectivity. BEA zeolites also offer advantageous properties for PDH reactions, which can be optimized to enhance stability and selectivity. Efforts to improve catalyst design include using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity, promoting elements causing beneficial geometric and electronic effects, and recent advances in unsupported, binary metal oxides. However, significant environmental and safety concerns still exist for CrOx-based catalysts, and compared to Pt catalysts, CrOx catalysts generally exhibit lower space-time yields (STYs).

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，这是由于它们独特的结构特征。它们的高比表面积、清晰的孔结构以及可调酸性特性有助于提高其效率。MFI沸石的分级孔结构和弱酸位点的存在可以增强活性和选择性。BEA沸石也提供了PDH反应有利的性质，这些性质可以通过优化来提高稳定性和选择性。为了改进催化剂设计，使用具有有序介孔结构和支持物的中等表面酸度、促进元素导致有益的几何和电子效应以及最近在无支持的二元金属氧化物中的成功。然而，对于CrOx基催化剂仍然存在重大的环境和安全问题，与Pt催化剂相比，CrOx催化剂通常表现出较低的空间时间产率（STY）。
