3. Metal-Zeolite Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network. (129)
The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization).
Ion exchange procedure relies on the negative charge of zeolite framework (arising from Al substitution) to stabilize exchanged metal ions, which limits the metal loadings and metal types, as well as propylene selectivity. (130)
Therefore, the preparation of metal-zeolite PDH catalysts employ impregnation and direct synthesis method.
Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are impregnation and direct synthesis. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. These structural characteristics enable better control over metal loadings, metal types, and propylene selectivity, contributing to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法是浸渍法和直接合成法。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在该应用中占据主导地位，原因在于它们易于合成、酸度可调以及孔径适中。这些结构特征使得对金属负载量、金属类型和丙烯选择性的控制更加有效，从而提升了它们在PDH反应中的性能。
