Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that postsynthesis methods such as ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis, are commonly applied. Ion exchange, which stabilizes metal ions using the negative charge of the zeolite framework, limits metal loadings and types, leading to the use of impregnation and direct synthesis methods in PDH catalyst development. The dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH applications can be attributed to their facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. Their small 3D pores facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants, enhancing performance. The synthesis methods and structural characteristics of these zeolites, along with the incorporation of metals like Pt, Sn, Zn, Cr, and Ga, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods, tuning the metal loading, and improving the stability and selectivity of these catalysts by utilizing the unique properties of MFI and BEA zeolites.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，我们发现后合成方法如离子交换和浸渍以及直接合成被广泛使用。离子交换通过利用沸石框架的负电荷稳定金属离子，限制了金属负载量和类型，因此在PDH催化剂开发中采用了浸渍和直接合成方法。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中的主导地位可以归因于它们简便的合成过程、可调的酸性以及适度的孔径大小。它们的小三维孔径能够促进活性位点与反应物之间的相互作用，从而提高性能。这些沸石的合成方法及其结构特性和对Pt、Sn、Zn、Cr和Ga等金属的整合，共同促进了PDH反应的有效性。未来在PDH催化剂设计方面的进展可能集中在优化合成方法、调整金属负载以及通过利用MFI和BEA沸石的独特性质来改善催化性能和选择性上。
