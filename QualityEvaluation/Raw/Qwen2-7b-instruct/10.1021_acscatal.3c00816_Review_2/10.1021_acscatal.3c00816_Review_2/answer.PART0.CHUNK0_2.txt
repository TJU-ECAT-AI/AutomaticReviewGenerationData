[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."
[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."
[3] "The developed zeolite materials were assigned to 235 framework types based on International Zeolite Association. Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12)."
[4] "The superior catalytic stability of PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 is due to the stronger antireduction capacity of incorporated SnOx species, which is favorable for the stabilization of metallic Pt sites on Sn oxides."
[5] "Such a Lewis-Bronsted synergy effect in catalyzing PDH reactions was more carefully analyzed in the Ga/ZSM-5 system."
[6] "In comparison, the samples with Ga/Al > 0.042 contain certain oxidizable Ga sites."
[7] "Specifically, Co-normalized propane TOF over the Ar calcinated catalysts is nine times that over air calcinated catalyst."
[8] "Moreover, the framework Ti species can consume certain SiOH groups, which would reduce the acidity of catalysts to facilitate propylene desorption, as indicated by C3H6-TPD measurements."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that both postsynthesis and direct synthesis methods are employed. Postsynthesis methods include ion exchange and impregnation, while direct synthesis involves introducing metal sites simultaneously with zeolite crystallization. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their facile synthesis procedures, tunable acidity, and moderate pore sizes. These characteristics enable better control over the catalyst's properties, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions. The incorporation of SnOx species in PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts enhances stability by offering stronger antireduction capacity, stabilizing metallic Pt sites on Sn oxides. In Ga/ZSM-5 systems, a Lewis-Bronsted synergy effect is observed, enhancing PDH reaction rates. The presence of oxidizable Ga sites in samples with a specific Ga/Al ratio suggests a role in catalytic activity. Co calcination atmospheres significantly impact the PDH activity by influencing Co site structures and facilitating the formation of Td Co2+ species, which exhibit superior propane adsorption capabilities. Framework Ti species in TS-1 zeolites contribute to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species, increasing electron density on Pt, and reducing acidity to facilitate propylene desorption. Lastly, the use of MOF-assisted impregnation strategies enhances ZnO dispersion, leading to higher PDH activity and stability, as well as the formation of reactive binuclear Zn-O-Zn sites that offer lower activation barriers, contributing to superior catalytic performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括后合成（如离子交换和浸渍）和直接合成（在沸石结晶时同时引入金属位点）。这两种方法都得到了应用。后合成方法包括离子交换和浸渍，而直接合成则涉及同时引入金属位点和沸石结晶。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH研究中占据主导地位，这可能归因于它们易于合成的过程、可调的酸性和适中的孔径大小。这些特性使得对催化剂的属性有较好的控制，从而在PDH反应中表现出更优性能。在PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂中掺入SnOx物种通过增强其抗还原能力来稳定金属Pt位点在Sn氧化物上，从而提高了稳定性。在Ga/ZSM-5系统中，观察到一种Lewis-Bronsted协同效应，这有助于提高PDH反应速率。样品中特定Ga/Al比例下存在可氧化Ga位点表明其在催化活性中的作用。Co热解气氛对PDH活性产生显著影响，通过影响Co位点结构并促进Td Co2+物种的形成，这种物种展现出优越的丙烷吸附能力。框架Ti物种在TS-1沸石中的存在有助于分散浸渍的PtZn物种，增加Pt上的电子密度，并降低酸性以促进丙烯脱吸。最后，采用MOF辅助浸渍策略增强了ZnO的分散，导致更高的PDH活性和稳定性，以及形成立体二核Zn-O-Zn位点，提供较低的活化壁垒，从而贡献于优异的催化性能。
