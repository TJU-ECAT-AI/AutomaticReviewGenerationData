Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are typically synthesized using post-synthesis methods such as ion exchange and impregnation, or through direct synthesis where metal sites are introduced simultaneously with zeolite crystallization. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites are prevalent in PDH studies due to their easy synthesis, adjustable acidity, and moderate pore size. These characteristics make them particularly effective for PDH reactions. The dominance of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH research is partly attributed to their straightforward synthesis processes, tunable acidity levels, and moderate pore dimensions, which contribute to their effectiveness in PDH applications.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的合成主要采用后合成方法，如离子交换和浸渍，或者直接合成，在其中同时引入金属位点与沸石晶体化。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH研究中占据主导地位，这主要是由于它们易于合成、可调酸性和适中的孔径尺寸。这些特性使得它们特别适合PDH反应。MFI和BEA沸石在PDH研究中占主导地位的部分原因是它们简便的合成过程、可调节的酸性水平和适中的孔径大小，这些特性有助于它们在PDH应用中的有效性。
