[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."
[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."
[3] "The MFI and BEA topological zeolites have small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."
[4] "This ZnO/S-1_3 catalyst also displays outstanding catalytic stability during a 400 h reaction."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include post-synthesis techniques such as ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis where metal sites are introduced simultaneously with zeolite crystallization. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their facile synthesis, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. Their small 3D pores enhance the interaction between active sites and reactants. Furthermore, the ZnO/S-1_3 catalyst demonstrates remarkable stability during a 400-hour reaction.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法包括后合成技术，如离子交换和浸渍，以及直接合成，其中金属位点与沸石晶化同时引入。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH研究中占据主导地位，这可能归因于它们易于合成、可调酸性和适度孔径。它们的小三维孔隙可以增强活性位点与反应物之间的相互作用。此外，ZnO/S-1_3催化剂在长达400小时的反应中表现出卓越的稳定性。
