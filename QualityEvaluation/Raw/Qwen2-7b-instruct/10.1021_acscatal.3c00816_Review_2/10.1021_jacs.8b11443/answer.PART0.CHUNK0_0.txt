Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. These include high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and ordered mesopores, which facilitate efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. This enables the catalysts to promote desired chemical transformations with high selectivity and activity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing synthesis methods to enhance stability and efficiency.
