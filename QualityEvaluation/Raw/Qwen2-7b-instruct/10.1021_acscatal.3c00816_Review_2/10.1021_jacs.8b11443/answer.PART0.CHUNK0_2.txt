The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the vapor-phase exchange of hydrogen-modified MFI (MFI) zeolites with gallium chloride (GaCl3) to produce Ga/H-MFI catalysts. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their well-defined pore structures, high surface area, and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to optimize the composition and structure of these zeolites and explore new materials with similar properties.

主要的合成方法是通过氢化改性的MFI（MFI）沸石与氯化镓（GaCl3）的气相交换来制备金属-沸石催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，因为它们具有明确的孔结构、高表面积和路易斯酸中心，这些因素有助于这些沸石在PDH反应中的有效性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化这些沸石的组成和结构上，并探索具有类似特性的新材料。
