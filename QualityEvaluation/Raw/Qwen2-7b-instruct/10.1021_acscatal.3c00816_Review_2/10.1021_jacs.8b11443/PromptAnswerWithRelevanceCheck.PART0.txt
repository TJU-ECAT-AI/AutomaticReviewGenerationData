Answer: The literature does not provide specific information on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it discusses the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH applications. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics which enable efficient separation of products and reactants, as well as their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures typical in PDH processes. Their effectiveness contributes to the stability and efficiency of the catalytic process. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design could involve enhancing the selectivity and activity of these materials, potentially through modifications in synthesis methods or by incorporating different metal species that might offer improved performance under PDH conditions.
