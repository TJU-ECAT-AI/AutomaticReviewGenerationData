The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the preparation of zeolites through vapor-phase exchange of hydrogen (H)-modified MFI zeolites with gallium chloride (GaCl3). MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application because of their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined pore structures, which are essential for efficient catalytic activity. Gallium (Ga) as a promoter in these materials enhances their selectivity and activity for PDH reactions. Their effectiveness is also attributed to the ability to control the size and shape of the active sites, influencing the reaction pathways. Future developments in PDH catalyst design will likely focus on optimizing these factors to achieve higher conversion rates and better product distributions.

主要的合成方法是通过氢（H）改性的MFI沸石与氯化镓（GaCl3）的气相交换来制备金属-沸石催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。由于其独特的结构特性，MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。这些沸石具有高比表面积和明确的孔结构，这是高效催化活性所必需的。作为促进剂的镓（Ga）在这些材料中的存在提高了它们对PDH反应的选择性和活性。其有效性还归因于能够控制活性位点的大小和形状，影响反应途径的能力。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展很可能会集中在优化这些因素上，以实现更高的转化率和更好的产品分布。
