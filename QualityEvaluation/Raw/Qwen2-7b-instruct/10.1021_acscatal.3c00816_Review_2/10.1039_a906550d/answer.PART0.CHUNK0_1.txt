The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include co-precipitation, impregnation, and ion-exchange. Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topological zeolites, dominate in PDH due to their unique properties. These zeolites have high surface area and pore volume, which facilitates efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants. The regular pore structure of MFI zeolites allows for uniform distribution of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, with their larger cages, offer improved selectivity towards desired products. Their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on modifying zeolite structures or incorporating additional metal promoters.

主要的金属-沸石催化剂合成方法包括共沉淀、浸渍和离子交换。在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，以具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石为主的金属-沸石催化剂占主导地位。这些沸石具有高表面积和孔体积，能够有效吸附和脱附反应物。MFI沸石的规则孔结构允许金属物种均匀分布，增强催化活性。而BEA沸石的大笼子提供了对所需产品的改善选择性。它们能够承受高温和高压的能力，有助于PDH反应的有效性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在修改沸石结构或引入额外的金属促进剂上。
