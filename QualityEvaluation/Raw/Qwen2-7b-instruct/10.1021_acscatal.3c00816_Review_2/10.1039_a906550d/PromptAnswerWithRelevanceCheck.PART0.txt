<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating zeolites with specific topologies such as MFI and BEA. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics which include efficient mass transfer and reactant diffusion facilitated by their pore structures, high surface area, and well-defined pore size distribution. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to enhance these structural features through modifications such as adjusting metal loading, altering the zeolite structure, or combining different materials.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include co-precipitation, impregnation, and ion-exchange. Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topological zeolites, dominate in PDH due to their unique properties. These zeolites have high surface area and pore volume, which facilitates efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants. The regular pore structure of MFI zeolites allows for uniform distribution of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity. BEA zeolites, with their larger cages, offer improved selectivity towards desired products. Their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on modifying zeolite structures or incorporating additional metal promoters.
