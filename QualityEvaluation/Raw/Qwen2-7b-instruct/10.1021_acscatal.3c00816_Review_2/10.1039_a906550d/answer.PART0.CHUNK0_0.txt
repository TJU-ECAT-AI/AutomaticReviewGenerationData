The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating zeolites with specific topologies such as MFI and BEA. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics which include efficient mass transfer and reactant diffusion facilitated by their pore structures, high surface area, and well-defined pore size distribution. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to enhance these structural features through modifications such as adjusting metal loading, altering the zeolite structure, or combining different materials.
