[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves encapsulating metal nanoparticles (in this case, ZnO) within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer on a Silicalite-1 support. This method is chosen to control the size of the metal nanoparticles and prevent their loss at high temperatures, thereby enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas. These characteristics facilitate efficient C-H activation, which is crucial for the PDH process. Additionally, the use of these zeolites as supports allows for the stabilization of metal nanoparticles, improving the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include further optimization of metal loading, support materials, and synthesis methods to achieve higher activity, selectivity, and stability, potentially leading to the development of more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，用于金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是将金属纳米颗粒（本例为ZnO）包覆在硅铝酸盐骨架8上生长的氮掺杂碳（NC）层内，位于Si-Al沸石支持材料上。这种方法被选择来控制金属纳米颗粒的大小，并在高温下最大程度地防止其损失，从而提高催化剂的稳定性与效率。

2. MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，这是由于它们独特的孔结构和高比表面积。这些特性有利于有效促进C-H活化，这对于PDH过程至关重要。此外，使用这些沸石作为支撑物可以稳定金属纳米颗粒，提高催化剂的活性和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的含义包括进一步优化金属负载、支撑材料和合成方法，以实现更高的活性、选择性和稳定性，可能引领开发出更加环保和成本效益高的催化剂。
