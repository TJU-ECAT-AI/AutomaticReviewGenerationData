Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites have a three-dimensional framework with a cubic symmetry, which allows for efficient molecular sieving and provides an ideal environment for the PDH reaction. BEA zeolites, on the other hand, have a cubic symmetry with a larger pore size compared to MFI, facilitating easier diffusion of reactants and products, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. The high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability observed in these zeolite-supported catalysts are attributed to their ability to maintain the integrity of the metal nanoparticles, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), within the zeolite matrix. This is crucial for preventing sintering and volatilization of the active sites at high temperatures, ensuring long-term operational efficiency. The encapsulation of ZnO nanoparticles within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer, grown in situ on a Silicalite-1 support, serves as a protective barrier against thermal degradation, thereby preserving the active sites and improving the overall stability of the catalysts during PDH reactions. The resulting catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in PDH, achieving high propene selectivity even under challenging conditions, highlighting the importance of optimized catalyst design in overcoming the technological hurdles associated with PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，用于金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法分析显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这归功于它们的独特结构特性。MFI沸石具有三维框架，呈立方对称性，这为分子筛提供了理想环境，并且适合PDH反应。而BEA沸石则具有与MFI相比更大的孔径，有利于反应物和产物的扩散，从而增强催化性能。这些沸石支持的催化剂表现出的高活性、选择性和在线稳定性，归因于它们能够保持金属纳米颗粒（如氧化锌（ZnO））在沸石矩阵内的完整性，防止高温下的烧结和挥发，从而确保长期操作效率。在硅酸铝（Silicalite-1）支撑上原位生长氮掺杂碳（NC）层对ZnO纳米颗粒的封装，作为保护屏障，防止热降解，从而保持活性位点并提高催化剂的整体稳定性，在PDH反应期间。由此得到的催化剂在PDH中表现出卓越的性能，即使在具有挑战性的条件下也能实现高丙烯选择性，突出了优化催化剂设计在克服PDH反应技术障碍中的重要性。
