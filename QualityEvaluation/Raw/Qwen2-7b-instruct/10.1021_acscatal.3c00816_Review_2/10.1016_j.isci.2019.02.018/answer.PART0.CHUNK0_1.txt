The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve encapsulating metal nanoparticles within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer grown on a Silicalite-1 support. This method helps control the size of the metal nanoparticles and prevents their loss at high temperatures, contributing to the catalysts' high activity, selectivity, and stability. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is utilized in situ to grow the NC layer, which aids in maintaining the ultrasmall size of the ZnO nanoparticles. The resulting catalysts exhibit excellent performance in PDH, achieving propene selectivity of around 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation. The effectiveness of these catalysts suggests that the combination of controlled nanoparticle size, NC layer protection, and efficient zeolite support play crucial roles in achieving high activity and stability in PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括将金属纳米颗粒包覆在生长于硅铝酸盐框架-8（Silicalite-1）支持上的氮掺杂碳（NC）层内。这种方法有助于控制金属纳米颗粒的大小，并防止它们在高温下损失，从而促进催化剂的高活性、选择性和稳定性。利用原位生长方式使用锌酞菁酸框架-8（ZIF-8）来生成NC层，这有助于保持ZnO纳米颗粒的超小尺寸。设计的催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的性能，实现了约90%的丙烯选择性，在44.4%丙烷转化率时，温度为600°C，操作近6小时后。这些催化剂的有效性表明，控制纳米颗粒尺寸、NC层保护和高效沸石支持的结合在实现PDH反应中的高活性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。
