<p>Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively.</p>
<p>The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals.</p>
<p>Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications.</p>
<p>The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support.</p>
<p>The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures.</p>
<p>The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600°C after nearly 6 h on stream.</p>

The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves encapsulating metal nanoparticles (in this case, ZnO) into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer on a Silicalite-1 support. This NC layer helps to control the size of the metal nanoparticles and prevent their loss at high temperatures, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in this application due to their porous structure, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Their high surface area and well-defined pore size distribution enable efficient catalytic reactions, particularly in PDH, where they allow for direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on improving the stability and activity of these materials, potentially through modifications of the zeolite framework or the metal loading process, while maintaining environmental friendliness and cost efficiency.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及将金属纳米颗粒（本例为ZnO）包覆在硅酸铝沸石支持体上的氮掺杂碳（NC）层中。该NC层有助于控制金属纳米颗粒的大小，并在高温下极大地防止其损失，从而增强催化剂的活性、选择性和在线稳定性。具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位，由于它们的孔结构能够促进反应物和产物的吸附与脱附。它们的高比表面积和定义明确的孔径分布使这些材料能够有效地催化反应，尤其是在PDH中，它们允许直接进行大规模生产丙烯并进行C-H激活的基本分析。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在提高这些材料的稳定性和活性上，同时保持环境友好性和成本效益，可能通过修改沸石骨架或金属负载过程来进行改进。
