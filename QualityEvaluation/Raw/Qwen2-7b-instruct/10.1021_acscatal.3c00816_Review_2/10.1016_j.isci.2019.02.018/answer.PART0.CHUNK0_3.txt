[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are synthesized primarily through a method involving encapsulation of metal nanoparticles (in this case, ZnO) within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer grown on a zeolitic support (Silicalite-1). This method allows for the stabilization of the metal nanoparticles, which is crucial for maintaining their activity and selectivity during high-temperature PDH processes. The choice of zeolites, specifically those with MFI and BEA topologies, is favored due to their pore structures and surface properties that enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the metal catalysts.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications because of their unique structural characteristics. Zeolites with MFI topology feature channels and pores that are suitable for the efficient separation and diffusion of hydrocarbon molecules, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Similarly, BEA zeolites, with their larger pore sizes and specific channel configurations, can accommodate larger molecules and reactants, promoting better access and reaction rates. Their high surface area and well-defined pore networks also contribute to the high activity and selectivity of these materials as PDH catalysts. These factors collectively make MFI and BEA zeolites advantageous for achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH reactions, while also being cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared to noble metal-based catalysts.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the continued optimization of zeolite structures and metal loading to further enhance catalyst performance. Research might focus on developing novel zeolite frameworks with improved pore accessibility and stability, as well as exploring the use of alternative metal nanoparticles that can offer higher activity or selectivity than traditional ZnO. Additionally, the integration of advanced synthesis techniques, such as in situ growth of metal particles within zeolite matrices, could lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH catalysts. The ultimate goal is to achieve high-yield propene production with minimal byproducts and enhanced operational stability over prolonged periods.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂主要通过将金属纳米颗粒（本例为ZnO）封装在生长在硅铝酸盐支持物上的氮掺杂碳（NC）层中的方法进行合成。这种方法允许稳定金属纳米颗粒，这对于保持其高温PDH过程中的活性和选择性至关重要。选择MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石主要是因为它们的独特结构特征。具有MFI拓扑结构的沸石具有适合高效分离和扩散烃分子的通道和孔隙，从而促进脱氢过程。同样，具有较大孔径和特定通道配置的BEA沸石可以容纳更大分子和反应物，促进更好的接触和反应速率。它们高表面积和明确的孔网络也使这些材料作为PDH催化剂时具有高活性和选择性。这些因素共同使MFI和BEA沸石成为PDH反应中实现高活性、选择性和在线稳定性的关键材料，同时与贵金属基催化剂相比更经济且环保。

未来PDH催化剂设计的含义包括继续优化沸石结构和金属负载，以进一步提高催化剂性能。研究可能集中在开发具有改进孔可接近性和稳定性的新型沸石框架，以及探索提供更高活性或选择性的替代金属纳米颗粒。此外，集成先进的合成技术，如在沸石矩阵内原位生长金属粒子，可以导致更高效的PDH催化剂。最终目标是实现高产丙烯生产，同时减少副产品并增强长期操作稳定性。
