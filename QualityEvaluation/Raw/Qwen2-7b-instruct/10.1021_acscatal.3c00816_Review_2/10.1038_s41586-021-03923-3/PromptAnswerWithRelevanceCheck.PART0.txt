1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions typically involve a combination of metal oxides and zeolites. Zeolites, specifically those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate due to their unique pore structures and surface chemistry. These characteristics enable efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, enhancing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. The MFI topology, characterized by its medium-sized pores and high surface area, allows for optimal access and interaction with propane molecules, while the BEA topology, known for its large cages, facilitates the formation of propene by allowing for effective hydrogen migration during the dehydrogenation process. Other factors contributing to their effectiveness include the stability of zeolite structures under industrial conditions and their ability to maintain activity over long periods without significant deactivation.

2. The development of ZnO-based catalysts for PDH reactions represents a significant advancement in creating environmentally compatible alternatives to traditional Cr- or Pt-based catalysts. By using ZnO as the active component and a zeolite as the support, the catalysts are able to form in situ active species through a redox reaction that utilizes the reactive hydroxyl groups present on the zeolite surface. This method ensures the formation of active ZnOx species that exhibit superior performance compared to conventional KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. Specifically, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst demonstrates significantly higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity, showcasing the potential for enhanced efficiency and reduced environmental impact in PDH processes.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂通常涉及金属氧化物和沸石的结合。MFI和BEA拓扑的沸石主导这一应用，由于它们独特的孔结构和表面化学性质。这些特征使得反应物和产物的有效吸附和脱附成为可能，从而提高整体催化活性和选择性。MFI拓扑结构以其中等大小的孔径和高表面积为特征，允许丙烷分子最佳地进入和相互作用，而BEA拓扑结构以其大笼为特征，通过有效地促进氢迁移来促进脱氢过程，从而形成丙烯。其他因素包括在工业条件下沸石结构的稳定性以及其在长时间内维持活动性而不显著失活的能力。

2. 针对PDH反应开发的ZnO基催化剂代表了创建环境兼容替代品的显著进步，传统上依赖于Cr或Pt催化剂。通过将ZnO用作活性成分和沸石作为支撑体，催化剂能够在还原处理过程中通过利用沸石表面上的反应性羟基组分形成的原位活性物种。这种方法确保形成活性ZnOx物种，与传统的KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，表现出更高的丙烯生产力，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。具体而言，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂显示出了显著更高的丙烯生产力，同时保持了类似的选择性，展示了在PDH过程中增强效率和减少环境影响的潜力。

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the combination of metal oxides with zeolite supports. These methods can occur as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers, where ZnO acts as the upstream layer. The synthesis involves the reduction of ZnO above 550°C, which generates Zn atoms that react with support OH groups to form active ZnOx species. Defective OH groups play a crucial role in this process. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their specific structural characteristics, which enhance the activity and stability of the catalysts. Their effectiveness is attributed to their pore structures and surface functionalities that facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on improving the selectivity and efficiency of these catalysts by optimizing the metal-support interactions and modifying the zeolite topology to better accommodate the dehydrogenation process.
