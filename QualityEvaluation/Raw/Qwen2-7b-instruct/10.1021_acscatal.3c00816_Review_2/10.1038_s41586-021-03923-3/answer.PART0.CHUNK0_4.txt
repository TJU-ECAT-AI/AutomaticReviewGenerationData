The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the combination of metal oxides with zeolite supports. These methods can occur as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers, where ZnO acts as the upstream layer. The synthesis involves the reduction of ZnO above 550°C, which generates Zn atoms that react with support OH groups to form active ZnOx species. Defective OH groups play a crucial role in this process. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their specific structural characteristics, which enhance the activity and stability of the catalysts. Their effectiveness is attributed to their pore structures and surface functionalities that facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on improving the selectivity and efficiency of these catalysts by optimizing the metal-support interactions and modifying the zeolite topology to better accommodate the dehydrogenation process.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及金属氧化物与沸石支持物的结合。这些方法可以是物理混合或以两层形式出现，其中ZnO作为上游层。合成过程包括在高于550°C的条件下对ZnO进行还原，这会生成Zn原子，与支持物OH基团反应形成活性ZnOx物种。缺陷的OH基团在这一过程中起着关键作用。具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，由于它们的特定结构特征，增强了催化剂的活性和稳定性。其有效性归因于它们的孔结构和表面功能，这些结构促进了丙烷的脱氢。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向可能集中在通过优化金属-支持相互作用和修改沸石拓扑结构来提高选择性和效率，以便更好地适应脱氢过程。
