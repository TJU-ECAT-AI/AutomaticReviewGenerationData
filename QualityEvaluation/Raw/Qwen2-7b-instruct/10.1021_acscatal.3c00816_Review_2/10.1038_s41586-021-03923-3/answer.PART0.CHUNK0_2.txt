<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.</p>
<p>The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.</p>
<p>This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve combining metal oxides with zeolite supports either as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers, with ZnO as the upstream layer. The effectiveness of these catalysts is attributed to the role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species. The developed ZnO-based catalyst outperforms commercial counterparts, showing about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及将金属氧化物与沸石支持体以物理混合物的形式或以两层形式使用，其中ZnO作为上游层。这些催化剂的有效性归因于缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的作用。开发的ZnO基催化剂表现出约三倍更高的丙烯产率，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。
