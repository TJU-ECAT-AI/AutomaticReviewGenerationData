<p>It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] and SiO2 [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke.</p>
<p>In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>According to the systematic characterizations, it is found that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum, which shows high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for PDH.</p>
<p>The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species.</p>

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions typically employ MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their unique structures. These zeolites feature a high surface area and numerous pores, which enhance the adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. Their high Lewis acidity also facilitates the dehydrogenation process. The tetrahedral coordination of Co2+ ions within the zeolite framework is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, as opposed to aggregated Co3O4 particles which lead to lower performance and more side reactions.

2. The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts involves solid-phase grinding (SPG) of metal precursors and zeolite powders. This process allows for uniform dispersion of metal ions within the zeolite matrix. Further heat treatment at different atmospheres (oxygen-rich or oxygen-free) is used to control the state of the metal species, promoting the formation of Co2+ ions that are well-dispersed and anchored within the zeolite framework.

3. The characterization techniques employed in this study include XRD, TEM, ICP-OES, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, Raman, XPS, TG as well as in situ FT-IR. These methods provide insights into the structure, acidity, dispersion, and reactivity of the Co species, helping to elucidate the differences in catalytic performance among the various catalysts.

4. The synthesis of Co2+ species in Co-S-1-Ar catalysts involves driving Co precursors towards the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 under high temperature and Ar atmosphere. The Co species are then anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the zeolite framework, resulting in the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions. This process is facilitated by the abundance of silanol nests in Silicalite-1, which enables the efficient anchoring and incorporation of Co species, leading to improved catalytic activity.

1. 在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，金属-沸石催化剂通常使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石。这些沸石具有高表面积和众多孔隙，可以增强丙烷分子的吸附和反应。其高的Lewis酸性也有助于脱氢过程。在沸石框架内四面体配合的Co2+离子的结构对于实现高丙烯选择性和催化活性至关重要，而聚集的Co3O4颗粒会导致较低的性能和更多副反应。

2. 金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是通过固体相研磨（SPG）将金属前体和沸石粉末混合。此过程允许金属离子在沸石基质中的均匀分散。进一步的热处理在不同的气氛下（富氧或无氧）用于控制金属物种的状态，促进形成分散并锚定在沸石框架内的Co2+离子。

3. 本研究采用的表征技术包括XRD、TEM、ICP-OES、N2物理吸附、NH3-TPD、Py-IR、H2-TPR、UV-Vis、拉曼、XPS、TG以及原位FT-IR。这些方法提供了关于结构、酸性、分散性和反应性的信息，有助于揭示各种催化剂之间的差异。

4. 在Co-S-1-Ar催化剂中合成Co2+物种的过程涉及在高温和Ar气氛下驱动Co前体向Silicalite-1的硅醇基团。然后，Co物种由硅醇基团锚定并整合到沸石框架中，从而形成四面体配合的Co2+离子。这一过程得益于Silicalite-1中硅醇基团的丰富性，这使得有效地锚定和整合Co物种成为可能，导致提高了催化活性。
