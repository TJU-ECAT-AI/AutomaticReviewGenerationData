<p>It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] and SiO2 [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke.</p>
<p>Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we are continuously considering developing facile strategies to isolate and stabilize Co species effectively from aggregation.</p>
<p>Catalyst synthesized via changing the calcination atmosphere seems to be an effective way. Recently, Dai and Peeters et al. reported the fundamental role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in the Sn-based zeolite catalysts, in which the inert gas or vacuum calcination atmosphere promoted the Sn sites into the framework of dealuminzation Beta, while the air calcination atmosphere resulted in the generation of extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst.</p>
<p>In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their structural characteristics and other factors that enhance their effectiveness. MFI zeolites are known for their high stability, while BEA zeolites offer additional features like larger pore sizes and greater surface areas, which are advantageous for PDH reactions. Their tetrahedral coordination of metal ions, especially Co2+, leads to high activity and selectivity in PDH processes. The dispersion of metal species, particularly in the form of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+, contributes to superior performance by facilitating effective adsorption of reactants and products. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species, such as isolated Co2+ stabilized by γ-Al2O3 matrices or incorporated into the zeolite framework via replacing silanol nests, further improves catalytic stability and performance. Changing the calcination atmosphere, such as using inert gases or vacuum, facilitates the formation of Co2+ species within the zeolite framework, enhancing the catalytic activity for PDH. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to control metal states, dispersion, and zeolite structure, aiming for even higher activity and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法涉及使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石。这些沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，原因在于它们的结构特性和其他因素提高了其有效性。MFI沸石因其高度稳定性而知名，而BEA沸石提供了更大的孔径大小和更大的表面积等额外特性，这有利于PDH反应。金属离子的四面体配合，尤其是Co2+，导致PDH过程中的高活性和选择性。金属物种的分散，特别是在四面体配合的Co2+形式下，通过有效吸附反应物和产物来促进卓越性能。通过稳定γ-Al2O3矩阵中的孤立Co2+或通过替换硅醇巢将Co物种整合到沸石骨架中，进一步改进了催化稳定性。改变煅烧气氛，如使用惰性气体或真空，有助于在沸石骨架中形成Co2+物种，从而增强PDH的催化活性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成方法以控制金属状态、分散性和沸石结构，旨在实现更高的活性和选择性。
