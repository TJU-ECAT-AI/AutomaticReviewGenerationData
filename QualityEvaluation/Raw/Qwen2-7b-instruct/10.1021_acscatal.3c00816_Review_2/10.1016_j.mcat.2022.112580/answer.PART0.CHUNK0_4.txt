Analyzing the synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the importance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites, with their microporous and well-defined pore systems, enable efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. Their high Lewis acid sites enhance the catalytic activity by facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The presence of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species within the zeolite framework is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity. These species, incorporated via the replacement of silanol nests in the zeolite, are responsible for the superior PDH performance. The use of oxygen-free calcination atmospheres like Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum facilitates the formation of these Co2+ species, leading to catalysts with enhanced performance compared to those prepared with air calcination. This research offers insights into developing catalysts with controlled metal valence states, paving the way for advancements in PDH catalyst design.
