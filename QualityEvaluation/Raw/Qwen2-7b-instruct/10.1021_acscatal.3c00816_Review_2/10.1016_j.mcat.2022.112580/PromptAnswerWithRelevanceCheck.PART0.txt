The document investigates the synthesis of different Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The oxygen-free heat-treatment leads to the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species. The TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air. The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance. The Co2+ species is generated via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve modifying the heat-treatment atmosphere. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in this application due to their specific structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, such as Silicalite-1, have a cubic structure with channels and cages that can accommodate metal ions. These zeolites provide a suitable framework for metal incorporation, enhancing the dispersion and stability of metal species. BEA zeolites, with a larger pore size, can also accommodate metal ions effectively, facilitating their use in PDH catalysts. Their Lewis acid sites are crucial for the adsorption of reactants and products, contributing to the high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve a higher proportion of desirable metal states, such as Co2+, within the zeolite framework. This would potentially lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly PDH catalysts.

<p>It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] and SiO2 [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke.</p>
<p>Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we are continuously considering developing facile strategies to isolate and stabilize Co species effectively from aggregation.</p>
<p>Catalyst synthesized via changing the calcination atmosphere seems to be an effective way. Recently, Dai and Peeters et al. reported the fundamental role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in the Sn-based zeolite catalysts, in which the inert gas or vacuum calcination atmosphere promoted the Sn sites into the framework of dealuminzation Beta, while the air calcination atmosphere resulted in the generation of extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst.</p>
<p>In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their structural characteristics and other factors that enhance their effectiveness. MFI zeolites are known for their high stability, while BEA zeolites offer additional features like larger pore sizes and greater surface areas, which are advantageous for PDH reactions. Their tetrahedral coordination of metal ions, especially Co2+, leads to high activity and selectivity in PDH processes. The dispersion of metal species, particularly in the form of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+, contributes to superior performance by facilitating effective adsorption of reactants and products. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species, such as isolated Co2+ stabilized by γ-Al2O3 matrices or incorporated into the zeolite framework via replacing silanol nests, further improves catalytic stability and performance. Changing the calcination atmosphere, such as using inert gases or vacuum, facilitates the formation of Co2+ species within the zeolite framework, enhancing the catalytic activity for PDH. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to control metal states, dispersion, and zeolite structure, aiming for even higher activity and selectivity.

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions typically employ MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their unique structures. These zeolites feature a high surface area and numerous pores, which enhance the adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. Their high Lewis acidity also facilitates the dehydrogenation process. The tetrahedral coordination of Co2+ ions within the zeolite framework is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, as opposed to aggregated Co3O4 particles which lead to lower performance and more side reactions.

2. The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts involves solid-phase grinding (SPG) of metal precursors and zeolite powders. This process allows for uniform dispersion of metal ions within the zeolite matrix. Further heat treatment at different atmospheres (oxygen-rich or oxygen-free) is used to control the state of the metal species, promoting the formation of Co2+ ions that are well-dispersed and anchored within the zeolite framework.

3. The characterization techniques employed in this study include XRD, TEM, ICP-OES, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, Raman, XPS, TG as well as in situ FT-IR. These methods provide insights into the structure, acidity, dispersion, and reactivity of the Co species, helping to elucidate the differences in catalytic performance among the various catalysts.

4. The synthesis of Co2+ species in Co-S-1-Ar catalysts involves driving Co precursors towards the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 under high temperature and Ar atmosphere. The Co species are then anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the zeolite framework, resulting in the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions. This process is facilitated by the abundance of silanol nests in Silicalite-1, which enables the efficient anchoring and incorporation of Co species, leading to improved catalytic activity.
