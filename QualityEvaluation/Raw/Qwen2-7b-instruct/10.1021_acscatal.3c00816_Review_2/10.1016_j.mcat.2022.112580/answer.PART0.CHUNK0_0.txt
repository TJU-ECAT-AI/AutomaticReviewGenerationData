The document investigates the synthesis of different Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The oxygen-free heat-treatment leads to the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species. The TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air. The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance. The Co2+ species is generated via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve modifying the heat-treatment atmosphere. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in this application due to their specific structural characteristics. MFI zeolites, such as Silicalite-1, have a cubic structure with channels and cages that can accommodate metal ions. These zeolites provide a suitable framework for metal incorporation, enhancing the dispersion and stability of metal species. BEA zeolites, with a larger pore size, can also accommodate metal ions effectively, facilitating their use in PDH catalysts. Their Lewis acid sites are crucial for the adsorption of reactants and products, contributing to the high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve a higher proportion of desirable metal states, such as Co2+, within the zeolite framework. This would potentially lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly PDH catalysts.

主要的金属-沸石催化剂合成方法用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应涉及通过改变热处理气氛进行。MFI和BEA拓扑的沸石在该应用中占据主导地位，由于它们的特定结构特性。MFI沸石，如Silicalite-1，具有立方结构，包含通道和笼子，可以容纳金属离子。这些沸石为金属离子提供了合适的框架，提高了金属物种的分散性和稳定性。BEA沸石具有较大的孔径，也可以有效地容纳金属离子，因此在PDH催化剂中使用。它们的Lewis酸位点对于反应物和产物的吸附至关重要，有助于提高PDH反应的活性和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成条件，以实现框架内沸石中更理想的金属状态，如Co2+的比例。这可能会导致更高效且环境友好的PDH催化剂。
