Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the text highlights that zinc-modified ZSM-5 zeolites with varying zinc contents are synthesized via hydrothermal methods. These zeolites serve as supports for platinum catalysts in PDH reactions. The synthesis of Zn-ZSM-5 involves incorporating zinc into the zeolite synthesis gels, leading to the formation of agglomerated crystal rods and an increase in specific surface area. The zinc substitution affects the material acidity, minimizing undesirable side reactions, thereby improving the reaction selectivity. The PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits the highest initial activity and lowest deactivation parameter after 10 hours of reaction. The introduction of zinc during synthesis enhances the interaction between platinum and the support, leading to improved dispersion of metallic particles. Compared to traditional impregnation methods, zinc incorporation into the support more effectively reflects the modification effect on the metal phase and support acidity, contributing to optimized PDH catalytic activity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on utilizing Zn-ZSM-5 zeolites with optimized zinc content and structure for enhanced activity and selectivity.

分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法，文献指出，通过水热法合成含锌量不同的ZSM-5沸石作为铂催化剂的支持物。这些沸石用于PDH反应中。在Zn-ZSM-5的合成过程中，将锌引入到沸石合成胶体中，导致形成聚集晶体棒和特定表面积的增加。锌的替换会影响材料的酸性，减少不必要的副反应，从而改善反应选择性。当锌含量为1.0%时，PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5催化剂显示出最高的初始活性和最低的失活参数。在合成过程中引入锌增强了铂与支持物之间的相互作用，有效提高了金属颗粒的分散度。与传统的浸渍方法相比，锌在支持物中的整合更有效地反映了促进剂对金属相和支持物酸性的修改效果，有助于优化PDH催化活性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在利用具有优化锌含量和结构的Zn-ZSM-5沸石，以提高活性和选择性。
