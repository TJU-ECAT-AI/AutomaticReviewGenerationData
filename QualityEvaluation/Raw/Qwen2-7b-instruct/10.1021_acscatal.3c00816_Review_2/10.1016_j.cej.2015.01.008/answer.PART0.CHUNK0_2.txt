<p>In the present work, Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of zinc was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of zinc substitution, the comparative study of the PtNa catalysts with different Zn introducing method has also been made.</p>
<p>The analysis by SEM shows the appearance of the agglomerated crystal rods with the increase content of Zn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the substitution of Zn reduces the total acidity of the support significantly and the acidic centers of the Zn-doping materials are mainly related with the weak-medium acid sites.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the use of this zinc containing ZSM-5 results in the strong interactions between Pt and the support, thus leads to a higher resistance towards reduction.</p>
<p>Moreover, relatively homogeneous distribution of metallic particles and the improved Pt dispersion are observed over the Zn-doped catalysts.</p>
<p>Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the incorporation of Zn into the support makes the modification effect of the promoter to the metal phase and support acidity is reflected more effectively.</p>
<p>In our experiments, the catalytic behavior of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the highest initial activity (40.60%) and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after the reaction for 10 h.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is evident that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. Their effectiveness stems from their unique structural characteristics, such as the special three-dimensional channels and adjustable Si-Al ratios, which make them suitable for applications as catalyst carriers in PDH reactions. These zeolites offer a relatively large surface area and specific channel characters that facilitate the accommodation of coke, improving the catalyst's stability. Incorporating metal promoters into these zeolite structures can enhance the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support, particularly in the presence of zinc. Zinc, when introduced into the zeolite framework, affects the catalyst structure and performance in multiple ways, including altering the acidity of the support, facilitating the strong interaction between platinum and the support, and promoting the homogeneous distribution of metallic particles. The substitution method of incorporating zinc into the support material is found to be more effective in reflecting the modification effect of the promoter on the metal phase and support acidity compared to the traditional impregnation method. The PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst stands out for its highest initial activity and lowest deactivation parameter after 10 hours of reaction, highlighting the benefits of using zinc-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for platinum catalysts in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may aim to leverage these insights to optimize the use of MFI and BEA zeolites and improve the effectiveness of metal-promoter interactions for enhanced catalytic performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法分析显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位。它们的有效性源自其独特的结构特征，如特殊的三维通道和可调整的Si-Al比，这使得它们适用于PDH反应的应用作为催化剂载体。这些沸石提供相对较大的表面积和特定的通道特性，有助于容纳焦炭，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。将金属促进剂引入这些沸石结构中可以增强反应选择性，通过中和支持物的酸性，尤其是在存在锌的情况下。当锌被引入到沸石结构中时，它以多种方式影响催化剂结构和性能，包括改变支持物的总酸度、促进铂与支持物之间的强相互作用以及促进金属颗粒的均匀分布。将锌引入支持材料的方法被发现比传统的浸渍法更有效地反映促进剂对金属相和支持物酸性的修改效果。Zn(1.0%) - ZSM-5催化剂在10小时反应后的最高初始活性和最低失活参数凸显出使用锌修饰的ZSM-5沸石作为铂催化剂支持物的益处。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能旨在利用这些见解，优化MFI和BEA沸石的使用并改进金属促进剂相互作用的有效性，以实现增强的催化性能。
