[1] "The Zn modified ZSM-5 zeolites with different content of Zn have been hydrothermally synthesized and then this kind of zeolite has been used as the support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Unfortunately, the reaction stability of this catalyst is still not satisfactory. As a result, great efforts have been made to improve the reaction performance of the supported Pt catalysts by using the new support with distinctive structure and property."
[3] "For instance, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Possibly, the relatively large surface area and the particular channel character of the ZSM-5 zeolite should be responsible for this behavior."
[5] "On the other hand, the introduction of the metal promoter has also been confirmed as an effective method."
[6] "It has been suggested that the presence of Zn either as a promoter or acting as a support (as ZnO) can improve the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes significantly."
[7] "Based on the results of Silvestre-Albero et al., the presence of zinc on the supported platinum catalyst could greatly improve the selectivity to dehydrogenated product (iso-butene), which could reach a value of as high as 100%."
[8] "Nevertheless, worthy mention is that over these Zn-doped catalysts, the deposition of Zn is mainly carried out by the impregnating with aqueous solution of the Zn precursor."
[9] "In the present work, Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of zinc was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
[10] "In our experiments, the catalytic behavior of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the highest initial activity (40.60%) and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after the reaction for 10 h."

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that hydrothermal synthesis is employed to produce Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites with varying zinc content. These zeolites are then utilized as supports for platinum catalysts in PDH reactions. The effectiveness of ZSM-5 zeolites in PDH applications is attributed to their unique physical properties, including their special three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio. The relatively large surface area and distinctive channel character of ZSM-5 zeolites contribute to their ability to accommodate coke formation, which is crucial in PDH reactions. Metal promoters, particularly zinc, are introduced to enhance the catalytic properties of platinum catalysts in PDH processes. Zinc can improve the selectivity of the catalysts towards dehydrogenated products, such as iso-butene, reaching up to 100%. However, the deposition of zinc typically occurs through impregnation with aqueous zinc precursor solutions. The study highlights the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst, which demonstrates the highest initial activity (40.60%) and lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after 10 hours of reaction.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，发现采用水热合成方法制备含有不同锌含量的Zn改性ZSM-5沸石。这些沸石随后被用作铂催化剂在PDH反应中的支撑材料。ZSM-5沸石在PDH应用中的有效性归因于它们的独特物理性质，包括特殊的三维通道结构和可调整的Si-Al比。ZSM-5沸石较大的表面积和独特的通道特性有助于其在PDH反应中容纳焦炭形成的能力。金属促进剂，特别是锌，被引入以增强铂催化剂在PDH过程中的催化性能。锌可以显著提高催化剂对脱氢产物的选择性，如异丁烯，最高可达100%。然而，锌的沉积通常通过使用水溶性的锌前体溶液浸渍实现。研究强调了PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5催化剂，该催化剂在10小时反应后表现出最高的初始活性（40.60%）和最低的失活参数（7.3%）。
