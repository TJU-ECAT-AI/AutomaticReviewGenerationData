[1] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
