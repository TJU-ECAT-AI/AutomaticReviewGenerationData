The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metal components into zeolite frameworks. Zeolites, particularly those with MFI and BEA topologies, are favored due to their unique structures and properties. These structures allow for the creation of a large surface area, control of pore size, and modulation of acidity, which enhances the dispersion of active sites and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity of the zeolites in PDH reactions. The regular pore structure facilitates efficient mass transfer and movement of reactants and products. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may involve optimizing zeolite frameworks, using metal promoters, and exploring new zeolite topologies to further enhance performance.
