<p>For the past several decades, a number of heterogeneous catalysts including metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts and non-oxide-based catalysts in Fig. 5 (such as Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2, carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been exploited for direct PDH reaction due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage that have exhibited high performances.</p>
<p>In this section, we will summarize the current PDH catalysts and their application.</p>
<p>Among them, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst shows good selectivity and stability, and has received the most extensive attention. Regarding the roles of Sn, researchers proposed the geometric effect and electronic effect.5658 On the one hand, some researchers indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation, which is a structure-sensitive side reaction.41,59,60 On the other hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich, which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer from Pt sites to the support.61,62 Additionally, DFT calculations are applied to reveal the influence of the Sn promoter for Pt-based catalysts on dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Yang et al. found that the addition of the Sn promoter contributes to the broadening of the d-band of Pt, which correspondingly downshifts the d-band center of Pt on PtSn surfaces.37 Consequently, the PtSn catalysts decrease the energy barrier for propylene desorption and increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which lead to the promotion of propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts.101 Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites.</p>
<p>By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the catalyst stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes should be extensively promoted.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites feature a three-dimensional channel network that allows for the confinement of metal species, thereby enhancing their activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The MFI topology, with its cubic framework, provides a regular pore system that can accommodate metal ions efficiently, while the BEA topology, known for its high surface area and uniform pore size, facilitates better dispersion of metal particles. This dispersion is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their ability to create active sites that are sensitive to the specific needs of the reaction, such as the activation of CH bonds in propane molecules. The regularity of the pore structure ensures that the metal ions are optimally positioned to interact with the propane molecules, promoting the desired dehydrogenation process. Moreover, the high surface area of MFI and BEA zeolites increases the number of accessible active sites, contributing to higher conversion rates and propylene yields.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on enhancing the stability of metal-zeolite catalysts during the dehydrogenation and regeneration stages. This can be achieved by optimizing the synthesis methods to control the particle size and crystalline phase, which affects the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. Additionally, incorporating dopants such as Y2O3 oxides or adding noble metals like Rh nanoclusters can increase the reducibility of the zeolite framework, facilitating better hydrogen desorption and reducing the energy barrier for propylene formation. Furthermore, utilizing H2 pretreatment can further enhance the activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites.

In conclusion, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions primarily relies on the strategic incorporation of metal species within the MFI and BEA zeolite frameworks, leveraging their unique topologies and surface properties. Optimizing these catalysts' stability through tailored synthesis methods and the addition of dopants is crucial for advancing PDH technology and improving propylene production efficiency.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法进行分析，发现MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这归功于它们的独特结构特性。这些沸石具有三维通道网络，能够高效地容纳金属物种，从而在PDH反应中增强其活性和选择性。MFI拓扑结构以其立方框架提供了一种规则的孔隙系统，可有效容纳金属离子；而BEA拓扑结构以其高比表面积和均匀孔径，有利于金属粒子的均匀分散，这有助于维持脱氢和再生过程中的催化活性。

这些沸石在PDH反应中表现出有效性，主要是因为它们能够创造对所需反应敏感的活性位点，如丙烷分子中CH键的激活。规则的孔结构确保金属离子被适当地定位，以与丙烷分子相互作用，促进所需的脱氢过程。此外，MFI和BEA沸石的高比表面积增加了可接触的活性位点数量，从而提高了转化率和丙烯产率。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在增强金属-沸石催化剂在脱氢和再生阶段的稳定性上。这可以通过优化合成方法来控制颗粒大小和晶相来实现，这影响着协调不饱和金属位点的浓度。此外，通过引入Y2O3氧化物等掺杂剂或添加如Rh纳米簇这样的贵金属可以增加沸石骨架的可还原性，促进更好的氢解离并降低丙烯形成过程的能量壁垒。进一步地，使用H2预处理可以进一步提高活性，通过增加协调不饱和金属位点的数量。

总之，金属-沸石催化剂的合成主要依赖于在MFI和BEA沸石框架内巧妙地引入金属物种，利用它们独特的拓扑结构和表面性质。通过定制合成方法和添加掺杂物来优化这些催化剂的稳定性是推进PDH技术并提高丙烯生产效率的关键。
