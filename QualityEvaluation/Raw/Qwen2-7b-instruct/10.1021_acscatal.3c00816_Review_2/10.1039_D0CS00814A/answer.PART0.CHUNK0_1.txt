The ADHO technology for propane dehydrogenation has several advantageous features. Firstly, it does not require any pretreatment of raw materials, enabling them to be fed directly into the reactor without needing desulfurization, dearsenification, or other complex processes. Secondly, the technology utilizes a non-toxic, environmentally friendly catalyst that does not cause corrosion, ensuring safe and stable operation over a prolonged period. The catalyst also demonstrates high mechanical strength and low consumption of agents. It is versatile enough to handle the dehydrogenation of pure propane and butane, as well as mixtures of these compounds. An industrialization test conducted at Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited revealed that the single-pass conversion rates of alkanes and the yields and selectivities of alkenes were on par with the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, thereby closing the technological gap in this field within China.
