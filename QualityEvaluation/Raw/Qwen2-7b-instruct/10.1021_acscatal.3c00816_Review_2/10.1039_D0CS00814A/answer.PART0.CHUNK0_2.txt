The ADHO technology has the following characteristics, where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearsenification and other complex technical processes.25 The reaction and catalyst regeneration are carried out continuously with high production efficiency. The catalyst is non-toxic with no pollution to the environment and non-corrosive, and is conducive to the safe and stable operation of the device over a long period. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits high mechanical strength and low agent consumption. It is not only suitable for dehydrogenation of propane and butane alone, but also for dehydrogenation of mixed propane and butane. The results of the industrialization test in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited show that the single-pass conversion rates of alkanes, and the yields and selectivities of alkenes are comparable to the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, which fills the gap in the field of this technology in China.

The active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3.

The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is attributed to its monoclinic structure, in which Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on octahedra and tetrahedra, providing a multitude of weak acid sites. According to DFT calculations on Ga2O3(100), the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 begins with the loss of one hydrogen atom of the propane molecule, forming a propyl group and a hydroxyl group. Subsequently, the removal of β-H results in another hydroxyl group. However, eliminating these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2 requires substantial energy, particularly for the latter. It is believed that the challenge of hydrogen atom desorption limits the activity of Ga2O3.

镓2氧化物的活性位点是通过配位不饱和镓3+提供的Lewis酸位点。β-镓2氧化物的高活性归因于其单斜晶系结构，在该结构中，镓3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，提供了大量弱酸位点。根据对Ga2O3(100)的DFT计算，丙烷在镓2氧化物表面的活化始于丙烷分子中一个氢原子的丢失，形成一个丙基团和一个羟基团。随后，β-H的去除导致另一个羟基的形成。然而，消除这两个羟基以形成H2O或H2需要大量的能量，特别是后者。人们认为，吸附氢原子的脱附步骤的困难限制了镓2氧化物的活性。

By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site.113 The promoting effect of the metal is therefore hindered. In addition, the bulk ZrO2 showed significant limitations of deactivation for carbon deposit in the dehydrogenation step and sintering in redox cycles. Therefore, the development of ZrO2-based catalysts remains a great challenge.

通过改变颗粒尺寸和晶体相态，可以显著调整Zrcus离子浓度。110,111 此外，掺杂并在还原气氛下预处理是有效生成并增加具有更高脱氢活性的Zrcus位点的方法。例如，掺杂Y2O3氧化物对于生成并增强具有更高脱氢活性的Zrcus位点是有效的。109 同样，添加如Rh纳米簇这样的贵金属能显著影响zirconia的可还原性。112 Rh纳米簇有助于促进氢解离，并降低裸露的ZrO2上的PDH反应的能量壁垒。113 H2预处理导致Zrcus位点增加，从而提高PDH性能。尽管ZrO2含有Zrcus显示出了优越的脱氢活性，但应避免过度还原。例如，在Rh/ZrO2催化剂中，ZrO2的还原程度增加会导致丙烯强烈吸附至Rh上，阻塞氢重组位点。113 这阻碍了金属的促进效果。此外，块状ZrO2在脱氢步骤中的碳沉积失活以及红氧循环中的烧结表现出明显的局限性。因此，开发ZrO2基催化剂仍是一个巨大的挑战。
