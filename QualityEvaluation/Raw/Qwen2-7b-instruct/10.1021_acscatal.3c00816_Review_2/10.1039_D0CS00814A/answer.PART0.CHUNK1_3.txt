[1] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metals into zeolite frameworks through various methods. Zeolites, especially those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate in this application due to their high surface area, pore structure, and ability to accommodate metal cations. The MFI topology, with its cubic channels and square-ring openings, and the BEA topology, with its cubic cages, are particularly effective for PDH. These zeolites can incorporate metal ions at various sites within their frameworks, leading to the formation of metal-zeolite catalysts with desirable properties for dehydrogenation reactions. The high surface area of these zeolites facilitates the dispersion of metal species, enhancing their activity and selectivity. The cubic structure of MFI and BEA zeolites allows for the formation of ordered metal clusters, which can be tailored for specific catalytic activities. The presence of Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for PDH, is facilitated by the zeolite structure, enabling efficient activation of alkane molecules. The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design is the continued exploration of zeolite frameworks for metal incorporation, aiming for the optimization of metal loading, distribution, and interaction with the zeolite structure to enhance catalytic performance. Additionally, the integration of zeolites with other materials, such as metal oxides or carbides, could potentially create synergistic effects, improving the overall efficiency and stability of the catalysts.

例如，存在各种类型的Cr物种（如Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+、Cr2+、孤立的Cr、聚合态Crn+和结晶态Cr2O3）以及Ga物种（如Ga3+、[GaH2]+、[GaH]2+和镓氧化物的多晶型），这些存在于CrOx-和GaOx基催化剂上，这使得确定实际活性位点变得困难，特别是在PDH反应条件下。金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法涉及通过各种方式将金属引入沸石骨架中。沸石，尤其是MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，在这一应用中占据主导地位，因为它们具有高表面积、孔结构和能够容纳金属离子的能力。MFI拓扑结构具有立方通道和正方形环开口，而BEA拓扑结构具有立方笼子，特别适合PDH。这些沸石可以在其框架中引入金属离子，从而形成具有理想性质的金属-沸石催化剂，以促进脱氢反应。这些沸石的高表面积有助于金属物种的分散，从而增强其活性和选择性。MFI和BEA沸石的立方结构允许形成有序的金属簇，可以针对特定催化活性进行优化。沸石结构中的Lewis酸位点的存在促进了烷烃分子的激活，从而实现高效的脱氢。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来开发而言，继续探索沸石骨架中金属的整合是关键，旨在优化金属负载、分布和与沸石结构的相互作用，以提高催化性能。此外，结合沸石与氧化物或碳化物等其他材料可能创造出协同效应，进而改善催化剂的整体效率和稳定性。
