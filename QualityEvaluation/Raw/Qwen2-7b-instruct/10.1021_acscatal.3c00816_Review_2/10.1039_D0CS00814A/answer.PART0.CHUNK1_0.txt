<p>For metal oxide-based catalysts, to promote propylene productivity, CO2 as a mild oxidant can be cofed during propane dehydrogenation. There are significant roles of CO2, including removal of coke deposition, reoxidation of the reduced metal oxides, and hydrogen consumption via the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS).</p>
<p>When the basicity is appropriate, CO2 can promote the occurrence of RWGS. However, when these basic sites in supports are extensively strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. When there are no basic sites on supports, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are very weak.</p>
<p>In addition, cofeeding H2 can effectively tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene. By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance.</p>

1. CO2 can play a significant role in propane dehydrogenation by removing coke deposition, reoxidizing reduced metal oxides, and consuming hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). The effectiveness of CO2 depends on the basicity of the support material. When the support has appropriate basicity, CO2 promotes RWGS. However, if the basicity is too strong, CO2 can irreversibly adsorb and poison these sites. When there are no basic sites, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are minimal. 

2. H2 cofeeding can help tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on metal oxide catalysts, thereby influencing the desorption barrier of propylene. Gong and coworkers found a positive correlation between the hydroxyl groups formed by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding and the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance of the catalyst.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳可以发挥重要作用，包括去除焦炭沉积、氧化还原金属氧化物和通过逆向水煤气变换反应消耗氢气。二氧化碳的作用取决于支持材料的碱性。当支持材料具有适当的碱性时，二氧化碳可以促进逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）。然而，如果碱性太强，二氧化碳会不可逆地吸附并毒化这些位点。当没有基本位点时，二氧化碳共喂养的效果非常微弱。

2. 氢气共喂养可以帮助调节金属氧化物催化剂上的表面羟基覆盖率，从而影响丙烯的脱附壁垒。 Gong 和同事们发现，由氢气预处理和共喂养形成的羟基与催化剂的丙烯选择性和抗失活能力之间存在正相关关系。
