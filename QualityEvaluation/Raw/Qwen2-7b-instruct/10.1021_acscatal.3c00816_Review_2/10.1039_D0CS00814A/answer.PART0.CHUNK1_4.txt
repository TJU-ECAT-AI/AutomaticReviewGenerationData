[1] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
[2] "The complex structures and pretreatment of metal oxides make it difficult to reveal the nature of the active sites, especially under the reaction conditions."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include impregnation, coprecipitation, sol-gel, and ion exchange. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their high surface area, pore size, and regular pore structure. These characteristics enable efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, which are crucial for the PDH reaction. The regular pore structure ensures that the reactants can be effectively confined, while the high surface area provides a large number of active sites for the reaction. The implication for future developments is that the design and synthesis of zeolite catalysts with optimized pore sizes and shapes, as well as improved surface functionalities, will enhance their catalytic performance for PDH reactions.

主要合成方法包括浸渍、共沉淀、溶胶凝胶和离子交换。在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石占据主导地位，这归因于它们的高比表面积、孔径和规则的孔结构。这些特性能够有效地吸附和扩散反应物和产物，这对于PDH反应至关重要。规则的孔结构确保反应物可以有效被限制，而高比表面积提供了大量的活性位点用于反应。未来开发的含义是，设计和合成具有优化孔大小和形状以及改进表面功能性的沸石催化剂将增强它们的催化性能用于PDH反应。
