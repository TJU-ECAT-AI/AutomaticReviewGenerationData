<p>For metal oxide-based catalysts, to promote propylene productivity, CO2 as a mild oxidant can be cofed during propane dehydrogenation. There are significant roles of CO2, including removal of coke deposition, reoxidation of the reduced metal oxides, and hydrogen consumption via the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS).</p>
<p>When the basicity is appropriate, CO2 can promote the occurrence of RWGS. However, when these basic sites in supports are extensively strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. When there are no basic sites on supports, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are very weak.</p>
<p>In addition, cofeeding H2 can effectively tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene. By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance.</p>

1. CO2 can play a significant role in propane dehydrogenation by removing coke deposition, reoxidizing reduced metal oxides, and consuming hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). The effectiveness of CO2 depends on the basicity of the support material. When the support has appropriate basicity, CO2 promotes RWGS. However, if the basicity is too strong, CO2 can irreversibly adsorb and poison these sites. When there are no basic sites, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are minimal. 

2. H2 cofeeding can help tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on metal oxide catalysts, thereby influencing the desorption barrier of propylene. Gong and coworkers found a positive correlation between the hydroxyl groups formed by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding and the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance of the catalyst.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳可以发挥重要作用，包括去除焦炭沉积、氧化还原金属氧化物和通过逆向水煤气变换反应消耗氢气。二氧化碳的作用取决于支持材料的碱性。当支持材料具有适当的碱性时，二氧化碳可以促进逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）。然而，如果碱性太强，二氧化碳会不可逆地吸附并毒化这些位点。当没有基本位点时，二氧化碳共喂养的效果非常微弱。

2. 氢气共喂养可以帮助调节金属氧化物催化剂上的表面羟基覆盖率，从而影响丙烯的脱附壁垒。 Gong 和同事们发现，由氢气预处理和共喂养形成的羟基与催化剂的丙烯选择性和抗失活能力之间存在正相关关系。

The active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3.

By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site.113 The promoting effect of the metal is therefore hindered. In addition, the bulk ZrO2 showed significant limitations of deactivation for carbon deposit in the dehydrogenation step and sintering in redox cycles.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metals into zeolite frameworks through various methods. Zeolites, especially those with MFI and BEA topologies, dominate in this application due to their high surface area, pore structure, and ability to accommodate metal cations. The MFI topology, with its cubic channels and square-ring openings, and the BEA topology, with its cubic cages, are particularly effective for PDH. These zeolites can incorporate metal ions at various sites within their frameworks, leading to the formation of metal-zeolite catalysts with desirable properties for dehydrogenation reactions. The high surface area of these zeolites facilitates the dispersion of metal species, enhancing their activity and selectivity. The cubic structure of MFI and BEA zeolites allows for the formation of ordered metal clusters, which can be tailored for specific catalytic activities. The presence of Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for PDH, is facilitated by the zeolite structure, enabling efficient activation of alkane molecules. The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design is the continued exploration of zeolite frameworks for metal incorporation, aiming for the optimization of metal loading, distribution, and interaction with the zeolite structure to enhance catalytic performance. Additionally, the integration of zeolites with other materials, such as metal oxides or carbides, could potentially create synergistic effects, improving the overall efficiency and stability of the catalysts.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is noted that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics and other factors. MFI zeolites feature a three-dimensional cubic structure with a high surface area and uniform pore size distribution, which facilitates the dispersion of metal particles and reduces coke formation. BEA zeolites, also known as beta zeolites, have a cubic structure with a hexagonal channel system that allows for the confinement of metal ions within the zeolite framework. This confinement enhances the stability of the metal species and improves the selectivity for propylene production.

The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by enabling better control over the size and shape of metal clusters, which affects the reactivity and stability of the catalyst. The uniform pore size distribution in MFI zeolites allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products, while the hexagonal channel system in BEA zeolites provides a stable environment for metal incorporation, minimizing sintering and deactivation.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to tailor the metal-zeolite interactions, thereby enhancing the stability, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. This could involve exploring new zeolite frameworks with tailored pore structures, modifying the metal loading and distribution, and incorporating synergistic additives to improve the catalytic performance under harsh reaction conditions. The aim is to develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts that can operate with high stability over extended periods, reducing the need for frequent regeneration and minimizing environmental impacts.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the potential for increased propylene yields, reduced energy consumption, and minimized emissions, contributing to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propane dehydrogenation processes. These advancements could also pave the way for the integration of PDH technologies into existing petrochemical infrastructures, enhancing the efficiency of propylene production from propane sources.

The normalization of the formation rate of C3H6 (propylene) as the unit of mol C3H6 gmetal1 h1 provides a standardized metric for comparing the catalytic activity of different metal-based catalysts. This approach facilitates a quantitative assessment of the catalyst performance, enabling researchers to identify the most active and selective catalysts for PDH reactions. By standardizing the measurement, it becomes easier to benchmark different catalysts, optimize synthesis conditions, and compare the results across various studies, ultimately accelerating the development of high-performance PDH catalysts.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法时，注意到MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据主导地位，这是由于它们的结构特性和其他因素。MFI沸石具有三维立方结构，表面面积高且孔径分布均匀，这有利于金属粒子的分散并减少焦炭沉积。BEA沸石，也被称为贝塔沸石，具有立方结构和六角通道系统，允许将金属离子限制在沸石框架中。这种限制增强了金属物种的稳定性，并提高了丙烯选择性生产。

MFI和BEA沸石的结构特性通过控制金属簇的大小和形状来促进PDH反应的有效性，从而影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。MFI沸石的均匀孔径分布有助于有效扩散反应物和产物，而BEA沸石的六角通道系统提供了一个稳定环境来容纳金属离子，最大限度地减少了结块和失活。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在优化合成方法，以定制金属-沸石相互作用，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。这可能涉及探索具有特定孔结构的新沸石框架、调整金属负载和分布以及引入协同添加剂，以改善催化性能。目标是开发更高效、更可持续的催化剂，能够在长时间内稳定运行，减少频繁再生的需求并最小化环境影响。

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include impregnation, coprecipitation, sol-gel, and ion exchange. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their high surface area, pore size, and regular pore structure. These characteristics enable efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, which are crucial for the PDH reaction. The regular pore structure ensures that the reactants can be effectively confined, while the high surface area provides a large number of active sites for the reaction. The implication for future developments is that the design and synthesis of zeolite catalysts with optimized pore sizes and shapes, as well as improved surface functionalities, will enhance their catalytic performance for PDH reactions.

<p>For the past several decades, a number of heterogeneous catalysts including metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts and non-oxide-based catalysts in Fig. 5 (such as Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2, carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been exploited for direct PDH reaction due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage that have exhibited high performances.</p>
<p>In this section, we will summarize the current PDH catalysts and their application.</p>
<p>Among them, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst shows good selectivity and stability, and has received the most extensive attention. Regarding the roles of Sn, researchers proposed the geometric effect and electronic effect.5658 On the one hand, some researchers indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation, which is a structure-sensitive side reaction.41,59,60 On the other hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich, which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer from Pt sites to the support.61,62 Additionally, DFT calculations are applied to reveal the influence of the Sn promoter for Pt-based catalysts on dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Yang et al. found that the addition of the Sn promoter contributes to the broadening of the d-band of Pt, which correspondingly downshifts the d-band center of Pt on PtSn surfaces.37 Consequently, the PtSn catalysts decrease the energy barrier for propylene desorption and increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which lead to the promotion of propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>The active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts.101 Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites.</p>
<p>By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the catalyst stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes should be extensively promoted.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites feature a three-dimensional channel network that allows for the confinement of metal species, thereby enhancing their activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The MFI topology, with its cubic framework, provides a regular pore system that can accommodate metal ions efficiently, while the BEA topology, known for its high surface area and uniform pore size, facilitates better dispersion of metal particles. This dispersion is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their ability to create active sites that are sensitive to the specific needs of the reaction, such as the activation of CH bonds in propane molecules. The regularity of the pore structure ensures that the metal ions are optimally positioned to interact with the propane molecules, promoting the desired dehydrogenation process. Moreover, the high surface area of MFI and BEA zeolites increases the number of accessible active sites, contributing to higher conversion rates and propylene yields.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on enhancing the stability of metal-zeolite catalysts during the dehydrogenation and regeneration stages. This can be achieved by optimizing the synthesis methods to control the particle size and crystalline phase, which affects the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. Additionally, incorporating dopants such as Y2O3 oxides or adding noble metals like Rh nanoclusters can increase the reducibility of the zeolite framework, facilitating better hydrogen desorption and reducing the energy barrier for propylene formation. Furthermore, utilizing H2 pretreatment can further enhance the activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites.

In conclusion, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions primarily relies on the strategic incorporation of metal species within the MFI and BEA zeolite frameworks, leveraging their unique topologies and surface properties. Optimizing these catalysts' stability through tailored synthesis methods and the addition of dopants is crucial for advancing PDH technology and improving propylene production efficiency.

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在增强金属-沸石催化剂在脱氢和再生阶段的稳定性上。这可以通过优化合成方法来控制颗粒大小和晶相来实现，这影响着协调不饱和金属位点的浓度。此外，通过引入Y2O3氧化物等掺杂剂或添加如Rh纳米簇这样的贵金属可以增加沸石骨架的可还原性，促进更好的氢解离并降低丙烯形成过程的能量壁垒。进一步地，使用H2预处理可以进一步提高活性，通过增加协调不饱和金属位点的数量。

总之，金属-沸石催化剂的合成主要依赖于在MFI和BEA沸石框架内巧妙地引入金属物种，利用它们独特的拓扑结构和表面性质。通过定制合成方法和添加掺杂物来优化这些催化剂的稳定性是推进PDH技术并提高丙烯生产效率的关键。
