[1] "Supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth, they show high activity and selectivity in the process."
[2] "Recently, the use of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation is being the subject of an intense research work."
[3] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."
[4] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[5] "However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination."
[6] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[7] "Indeed, calcination is an important factor to influence the catalytic structure and properties, especially for the La-doped catalysts."
[8] "When the calcination time was relatively low, the active sites being responsible for the formation of oxygenated products had not been formed, which resulted in the variation in the reaction conversion and selectivity."
[9] "Clearly, this behavior caused by the introduction of La is very different with that of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of La."
[10] "In this way, the introduction of La can partially restrict the breaking of the SiOAl bonds of the ZSM-5 zeolite, which in consequence improves the thermal stability of the support."
[11] "Furthermore, the location and species of rare earth ions may play an important role in determining this."
[12] "It is known that the La3+ cations are also weak Lewis acid sites."
[13] "These observations demonstrate that the calcination temperature of La has an obvious influence on the dispersive status of Pt particles and the high treatment temperature (i.e.700 C) leads to the sintering of Pt particles."
[14] "However, after the thermal treatment at 700 C, the acid amount of the catalyst decreases sharply."
[15] "The higher acid sites generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially formed C3+carbenium ions."
[16] "On HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates."
[17] "Meanwhile, the introduction of La produces a strong combination with the support, which results in the relatively gentle dealumination of the catalyst and strong interactions between Pt and Sn oxides."
[18] "These new sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, which result in the higher catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation process."

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily involve the use of supported platinum-tin catalysts, with ZSM-5 zeolite being a preferred support due to its high activity and selectivity. Three-dimensional microporous structures of ZSM-5 are favored over mesoporous materials like SBA-15 because of their intrinsic catalytic properties. Promoters like lanthanum (La) enhance the performance by increasing propane conversion and propene selectivity. Direct impregnation of the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution is used for adding promoters, avoiding the calcination step. The calcination of lanthanum is crucial for improving thermal stability, inhibiting dealumination, stabilizing tin species, and enhancing the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, leading to higher catalytic efficiency.

2. The calcination of lanthanum (La) has significant impacts on the catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It enhances the thermal stability of the support by allowing lanthanum species to enter the ZSM-5 channels, reducing dealumination, and stabilizing tin species. The calcination process also strengthens the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, improving the dispersion of platinum particles. This results in better catalytic activity and stability, especially at higher reaction temperatures. However, calcination at too high a temperature can lead to a decrease in catalyst acidity, sintering of platinum particles, and formation of tin0 species, causing irreversible deactivation.

3. The choice of zeolite topology, such as MFI and BEA, in metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is influenced by their structural characteristics and the specific requirements of the PDH process. MFI and BEA zeolites have distinct pore structures and surface functionalities that facilitate the efficient adsorption, diffusion, and transformation of propane molecules into propene. Their high surface area and well-defined pore sizes allow for optimal control over the catalytic reaction pathways, leading to enhanced conversion rates and selectivity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on refining zeolite composition, modifying pore architecture, and incorporating advanced catalyst components to further optimize activity, stability, and selectivity. This could involve the integration of novel metal precursors, the use of co-supported metals, or the development of innovative synthesis methodologies to tailor the catalyst's properties for improved PDH performance.

1. 金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要应用涉及支持铂锡催化剂，其中ZSM-5沸石作为支撑材料由于其高活性和选择性而受到青睐。ZSM-5的三维微孔结构优于SBA-15等介孔材料，因为它们具有内在的催化性质。镧（La）等促进剂通过直接用La(NO3)3水溶液浸渍支撑材料来增强性能，从而提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，避免了后续的煅烧步骤。镧的煅烧对于提高热稳定性、抑制去铝化、稳定锡物种以及增强铂与锡氧化物之间的相互作用至关重要，从而提高了脱氢过程的催化效率。

2. 镧（La）的煅烧对PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能有显著影响。它通过允许镧物种进入ZSM-5通道来提高支撑材料的热稳定性，减少去铝化，并稳定锡物种。煅烧过程还加强了铂与锡氧化物之间的相互作用，改善了铂颗粒的分散。这导致了更高的催化活性和稳定性，尤其是在较高反应温度下。然而，高温煅烧可能导致催化剂酸性降低、铂颗粒聚集和形成锡0物种，导致不可逆失活。

3. 选择MFI和BEA等沸石拓扑结构在金属-沸石催化剂中用于丙烷脱氢的原因是它们独特的结构特性和PDH过程的具体需求。MFI和BEA沸石具有不同的孔结构和表面功能，可以有效地吸附、扩散和转换丙烷分子为丙烯。它们的高比表面积和定义明确的孔尺寸允许对催化反应路径进行优化，从而提高转化率和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展方向可能集中在细化沸石组成、修改孔架构以及整合新型催化剂成分以进一步优化活性、稳定性和选择性。这可能包括集成新型金属前体、双金属共支持或开发创新合成方法，以针对改进的PDH性能调整催化剂的性质。
