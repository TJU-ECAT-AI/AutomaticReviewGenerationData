<p>In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La. In this way, relatively strong interactions between lanthanum species and the support exist.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the calcination of La works in the following three ways. First, it improves the thermal stability of the support. As has been observed in XRD and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, more amounts of La species can enter into the ZSM-5 channels and the dealumination of the support can be inhibited when the calcination temperature is less or equal to 650 C.</p>
<p>Second, the calcination of La strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn oxide, which has been testified by the increased total amounts of adsorbed hydrogen and also the ones at high temperature (Table 2).</p>
<p>Third, the calcination of La stabilizes the tin species. It is well known that the existence of aluminum can stabilize the Sn species.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structures. MFI zeolites, characterized by their cubic symmetry and a microporous framework, provide a highly ordered structure that facilitates the separation of reactants and products. BEA zeolites, with their hexagonal symmetry and mesoporous structure, offer a balance between pore size and accessibility, which is crucial for efficient catalytic reactions. Their structural characteristics, such as pore size and shape, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by allowing optimal adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include exploring the impact of zeolite topology, modifying the synthesis conditions to enhance the stability and activity of the catalyst, and incorporating additional metals or promoters to improve the selectivity and longevity of the catalysts.

[1] "Supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth, they show high activity and selectivity in the process."
[2] "Recently, the use of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation is being the subject of an intense research work."
[3] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."
[4] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[5] "However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination."
[6] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[7] "Indeed, calcination is an important factor to influence the catalytic structure and properties, especially for the La-doped catalysts."
[8] "When the calcination time was relatively low, the active sites being responsible for the formation of oxygenated products had not been formed, which resulted in the variation in the reaction conversion and selectivity."
[9] "Clearly, this behavior caused by the introduction of La is very different with that of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of La."
[10] "In this way, the introduction of La can partially restrict the breaking of the SiOAl bonds of the ZSM-5 zeolite, which in consequence improves the thermal stability of the support."

[13] "These observations demonstrate that the calcination temperature of La has an obvious influence on the dispersive status of Pt particles and the high treatment temperature (i.e.700 C) leads to the sintering of Pt particles."
[14] "However, after the thermal treatment at 700 C, the acid amount of the catalyst decreases sharply."
[15] "The higher acid sites generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially formed C3+carbenium ions."
[16] "On HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates."
[17] "Meanwhile, the introduction of La produces a strong combination with the support, which results in the relatively gentle dealumination of the catalyst and strong interactions between Pt and Sn oxides."

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily involve the use of supported platinum-tin catalysts, with ZSM-5 zeolite being a preferred support due to its high activity and selectivity. Three-dimensional microporous structures of ZSM-5 are favored over mesoporous materials like SBA-15 because of their intrinsic catalytic properties. Promoters like lanthanum (La) enhance the performance by increasing propane conversion and propene selectivity. Direct impregnation of the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution is used for adding promoters, avoiding the calcination step. The calcination of lanthanum is crucial for improving thermal stability, inhibiting dealumination, stabilizing tin species, and enhancing the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, leading to higher catalytic efficiency.

2. The calcination of lanthanum (La) has significant impacts on the catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It enhances the thermal stability of the support by allowing lanthanum species to enter the ZSM-5 channels, reducing dealumination, and stabilizing tin species. The calcination process also strengthens the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, improving the dispersion of platinum particles. This results in better catalytic activity and stability, especially at higher reaction temperatures. However, calcination at too high a temperature can lead to a decrease in catalyst acidity, sintering of platinum particles, and formation of tin0 species, causing irreversible deactivation.

3. The choice of zeolite topology, such as MFI and BEA, in metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is influenced by their structural characteristics and the specific requirements of the PDH process. MFI and BEA zeolites have distinct pore structures and surface functionalities that facilitate the efficient adsorption, diffusion, and transformation of propane molecules into propene. Their high surface area and well-defined pore sizes allow for optimal control over the catalytic reaction pathways, leading to enhanced conversion rates and selectivity. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on refining zeolite composition, modifying pore architecture, and incorporating advanced catalyst components to further optimize activity, stability, and selectivity. This could involve the integration of novel metal precursors, the use of co-supported metals, or the development of innovative synthesis methodologies to tailor the catalyst's properties for improved PDH performance.

1. 金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要应用涉及支持铂锡催化剂，其中ZSM-5沸石作为支撑材料由于其高活性和选择性而受到青睐。ZSM-5的三维微孔结构优于SBA-15等介孔材料，因为它们具有内在的催化性质。镧（La）等促进剂通过直接用La(NO3)3水溶液浸渍支撑材料来增强性能，从而提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，避免了后续的煅烧步骤。镧的煅烧对于提高热稳定性、抑制去铝化、稳定锡物种以及增强铂与锡氧化物之间的相互作用至关重要，从而提高了脱氢过程的催化效率。

2. 镧（La）的煅烧对PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能有显著影响。它通过允许镧物种进入ZSM-5通道来提高支撑材料的热稳定性，减少去铝化，并稳定锡物种。煅烧过程还加强了铂与锡氧化物之间的相互作用，改善了铂颗粒的分散。这导致了更高的催化活性和稳定性，尤其是在较高反应温度下。然而，高温煅烧可能导致催化剂酸性降低、铂颗粒聚集和形成锡0物种，导致不可逆失活。

3. 选择MFI和BEA等沸石拓扑结构在金属-沸石催化剂中用于丙烷脱氢的原因是它们独特的结构特性和PDH过程的具体需求。MFI和BEA沸石具有不同的孔结构和表面功能，可以有效地吸附、扩散和转换丙烷分子为丙烯。它们的高比表面积和定义明确的孔尺寸允许对催化反应路径进行优化，从而提高转化率和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展方向可能集中在细化沸石组成、修改孔架构以及整合新型催化剂成分以进一步优化活性、稳定性和选择性。这可能包括集成新型金属前体、双金属共支持或开发创新合成方法，以针对改进的PDH性能调整催化剂的性质。

MFI zeolites, with their cubic framework and 10 Å channels, are particularly suited for PDH processes. They offer a high surface area and controlled pore size, facilitating the efficient separation of products. BEA zeolites, with their 12 Å channels, are also effective in PDH reactions due to their ability to control the size and shape of the pores, which affects the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Structural characteristics and other factors contributing to their effectiveness in PDH include:

1. **High Surface Area**: Zeolites provide a large surface area for adsorption and reaction sites, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are synthesized primarily through impregnation methods. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics, which enable efficient separation and diffusion of reactants and products. Their effectiveness stems from their high surface area, uniform pore sizes, and well-defined pore structures that facilitate the PDH reaction pathway. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include optimizing the zeolite topology, promoter addition strategies, and calcination temperatures to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity.

2. The addition of lanthanum (La) as a promoter in the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst system for PDH reactions increases propane conversion and propene selectivity. However, direct addition of La without calcination can lead to weak interactions between La species and the support, potentially affecting the catalytic performance. Calcination of La enhances the thermal stability of the support, inhibits dealumination, stabilizes tin species, and strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn oxides. This leads to improved catalytic properties. The calcination temperature of 650°C yields the best reaction activity and stability, as evidenced by the highest yield of propene (34.3%) over 82 hours under specific reaction conditions.

3. The calcination of La affects the acidity of the catalyst, with a decrease in acidity observed at higher calcination temperatures due to severe dealumination. This, combined with the sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species, leads to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Lower calcination temperatures preserve the matching between the active sites and acid sites, maintaining catalytic efficiency even at higher reaction temperatures.

4. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their structural characteristics, including high surface area, uniform pore sizes, and well-defined pore structures. These features facilitate efficient reactant and product diffusion, enabling optimal PDH reaction pathways. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing zeolite topology, promoter addition, and calcination temperatures to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity. Additionally, understanding the role of acidic sites and Pt active sites in propene selectivity could guide the development of more efficient PDH catalysts.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂主要通过浸渍方法合成。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石因其结构特征而占据主导地位，这些特征能够有效分离和扩散反应物和产物。它们的有效性源于其高比表面积、均匀孔径和定义明确的孔结构，这些结构有利于PDH反应途径。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向包括优化沸石拓扑结构、促进剂添加策略以及煅烧温度，以增强活性、稳定性和选择性。

2. 在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂系统中添加镧（La）作为促进剂可以增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。然而，在没有煅烧的情况下直接添加La可能导致La物种与支撑之间的弱相互作用，可能影响催化性能。La的煅烧提高了支撑的热稳定性，抑制了去铝化，稳定了锡物种，并加强了Pt和Sn氧化物之间的相互作用。这导致了改善的催化性质。在650°C的煅烧温度下获得了最佳的反应活性和稳定性，证明了在特定反应条件下丙烯的最大产率为34.3%。

3. La的煅烧影响催化剂的酸度，在较高煅烧温度下由于严重的去铝化导致酸度急剧下降。这与Pt颗粒的聚集和Sn0物种的形成相结合，导致催化剂不可逆失活。较低的煅烧温度保留了活性位点和酸位之间的匹配，即使在较高的反应温度下也能维持催化效率。

4.PDH反应中MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石的有效性归因于其结构特性，包括高比表面积、均匀孔径和定义明确的孔结构。这些特征促进了反应物和产物的高效扩散，有利于最优的PDH反应途径。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向应集中在优化沸石拓扑结构、促进剂添加和煅烧温度上，以增强活性、稳定性和选择性。此外，理解酸性位点和Pt活性位点在丙烯选择性中的作用可以指导开发更高效的PDH催化剂。
