<p>Our previous work [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity.</p>
<p>However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst [12] , the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination.</p>
<p>In deed, calcination is an important factor to influence the catalytic structure and properties [13] , especially for the La-doped catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalyst calcined at 650 C exhibits the beat catalytic activity and stability, the maximum initial and final conversions appear as 37.2 and 34.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species are also inevitable, which seriously result in the deactivation of catalyst.</p>
<p>When the calcination temperature of La is below 700 C, although the amounts of the weak acid sites increase a little, no sintering of Pt particles are observed.</p>
<p>However, after the thermal treatment at 700 C, the acid amount of the catalyst decreases sharply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates [35] .</p>
<p>Therefore, the changes of catalytic acidity and Pt active sites should be responsible for the selectivity to propene.</p>

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are synthesized primarily through impregnation methods. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics, which enable efficient separation and diffusion of reactants and products. Their effectiveness stems from their high surface area, uniform pore sizes, and well-defined pore structures that facilitate the PDH reaction pathway. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include optimizing the zeolite topology, promoter addition strategies, and calcination temperatures to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity.

2. The addition of lanthanum (La) as a promoter in the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst system for PDH reactions increases propane conversion and propene selectivity. However, direct addition of La without calcination can lead to weak interactions between La species and the support, potentially affecting the catalytic performance. Calcination of La enhances the thermal stability of the support, inhibits dealumination, stabilizes tin species, and strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn oxides. This leads to improved catalytic properties. The calcination temperature of 650°C yields the best reaction activity and stability, as evidenced by the highest yield of propene (34.3%) over 82 hours under specific reaction conditions.

3. The calcination of La affects the acidity of the catalyst, with a decrease in acidity observed at higher calcination temperatures due to severe dealumination. This, combined with the sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species, leads to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Lower calcination temperatures preserve the matching between the active sites and acid sites, maintaining catalytic efficiency even at higher reaction temperatures.

4. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their structural characteristics, including high surface area, uniform pore sizes, and well-defined pore structures. These features facilitate efficient reactant and product diffusion, enabling optimal PDH reaction pathways. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing zeolite topology, promoter addition, and calcination temperatures to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity. Additionally, understanding the role of acidic sites and Pt active sites in propene selectivity could guide the development of more efficient PDH catalysts.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂主要通过浸渍方法合成。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石因其结构特征而占据主导地位，这些特征能够有效分离和扩散反应物和产物。它们的有效性源于其高比表面积、均匀孔径和定义明确的孔结构，这些结构有利于PDH反应途径。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向包括优化沸石拓扑结构、促进剂添加策略以及煅烧温度，以增强活性、稳定性和选择性。

2. 在PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂系统中添加镧（La）作为促进剂可以增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。然而，在没有煅烧的情况下直接添加La可能导致La物种与支撑之间的弱相互作用，可能影响催化性能。La的煅烧提高了支撑的热稳定性，抑制了去铝化，稳定了锡物种，并加强了Pt和Sn氧化物之间的相互作用。这导致了改善的催化性质。在650°C的煅烧温度下获得了最佳的反应活性和稳定性，证明了在特定反应条件下丙烯的最大产率为34.3%。

3. La的煅烧影响催化剂的酸度，在较高煅烧温度下由于严重的去铝化导致酸度急剧下降。这与Pt颗粒的聚集和Sn0物种的形成相结合，导致催化剂不可逆失活。较低的煅烧温度保留了活性位点和酸位之间的匹配，即使在较高的反应温度下也能维持催化效率。

4.PDH反应中MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石的有效性归因于其结构特性，包括高比表面积、均匀孔径和定义明确的孔结构。这些特征促进了反应物和产物的高效扩散，有利于最优的PDH反应途径。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展方向应集中在优化沸石拓扑结构、促进剂添加和煅烧温度上，以增强活性、稳定性和选择性。此外，理解酸性位点和Pt活性位点在丙烯选择性中的作用可以指导开发更高效的PDH催化剂。
