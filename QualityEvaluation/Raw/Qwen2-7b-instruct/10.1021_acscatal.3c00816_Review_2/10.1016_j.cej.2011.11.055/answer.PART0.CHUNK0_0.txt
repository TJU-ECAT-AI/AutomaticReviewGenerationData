<p>In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La. In this way, relatively strong interactions between lanthanum species and the support exist.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the calcination of La works in the following three ways. First, it improves the thermal stability of the support. As has been observed in XRD and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, more amounts of La species can enter into the ZSM-5 channels and the dealumination of the support can be inhibited when the calcination temperature is less or equal to 650 C.</p>
<p>Second, the calcination of La strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn oxide, which has been testified by the increased total amounts of adsorbed hydrogen and also the ones at high temperature (Table 2).</p>
<p>Third, the calcination of La stabilizes the tin species. It is well known that the existence of aluminum can stabilize the Sn species.</p>

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structures. MFI zeolites, characterized by their cubic symmetry and a microporous framework, provide a highly ordered structure that facilitates the separation of reactants and products. BEA zeolites, with their hexagonal symmetry and mesoporous structure, offer a balance between pore size and accessibility, which is crucial for efficient catalytic reactions. Their structural characteristics, such as pore size and shape, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by allowing optimal adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include exploring the impact of zeolite topology, modifying the synthesis conditions to enhance the stability and activity of the catalyst, and incorporating additional metals or promoters to improve the selectivity and longevity of the catalysts.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法采用浸渍技术。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在该应用中占主导地位，这得益于它们的独特结构。MFI沸石具有立方对称性和微孔框架，提供了一个高度有序的结构，有利于反应物和产物的分离。BEA沸石具有六边形对称性和介孔结构，提供了孔径大小与可访问性之间的平衡，这对于高效的催化反应至关重要。其结构特征，如孔径大小和形状，有助于它们在PDH反应中的有效性，通过优化吸附和扩散反应物和产物。未来PDH催化剂设计的含义包括探索沸石拓扑的影响、修改合成条件以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性，并引入额外的金属或促进剂以提高选择性和催化剂寿命。
