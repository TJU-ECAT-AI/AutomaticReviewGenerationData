1. The vapor-phase exchange method is a primary synthesis technique for metal-zeolite catalysts utilized in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This method was employed in the preparation of Ga/H-MFI zeolites, which contain isolated Ga3+ cations. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are favored in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics, including high surface area and pore size, which facilitate efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. Moreover, their microporous nature, stability, and selectivity under high-temperature conditions are key factors contributing to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. These zeolites' performance highlights the importance of considering these factors in the design of future PDH catalysts. Future advancements might aim to improve stability, increase activity, and enhance selectivity through modifications in synthesis techniques or zeolite topology.
