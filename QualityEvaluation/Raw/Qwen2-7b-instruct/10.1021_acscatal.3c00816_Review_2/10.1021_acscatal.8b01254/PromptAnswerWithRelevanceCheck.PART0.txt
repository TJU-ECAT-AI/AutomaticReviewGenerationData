1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized through the vapor-phase exchange method. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature a high surface area and large pore size, which enhances the diffusion of reactants and products. Conversely, BEA zeolites possess a more ordered framework structure, increasing the catalyst's selectivity. These properties enable efficient conversion of propane into propylene. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to integrate these characteristics into novel materials.
