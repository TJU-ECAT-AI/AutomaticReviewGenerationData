The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves the vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI zeolite with GaCl3 to prepare Ga/H-MFI. Metal-zeolite catalysts, specifically those with MFI and BEA topological structures, dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics and other contributing factors. Future advancements in PDH catalyst design may concentrate on refining these characteristics to enhance performance.
