Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that these methods typically involve preparing zeolite frameworks and incorporating metals through techniques like impregnation, co-precipitation, and ion-exchange. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are predominant in PDH applications because they possess high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and the capability to host metal cations within their channels. These zeolites' structural features, including micropores, enhance the catalysts' selectivity and activity, while their large surface area facilitates more efficient interaction with reactants. Other contributing factors to their effectiveness include stability under reaction conditions, resistance to sintering, and the potential to adjust their properties by modifying synthesis parameters. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may explore new metal-zeolite combinations, optimize synthesis protocols, and develop strategies to improve thermal and chemical stability while maintaining high catalytic performance.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法显示，这些方法通常涉及制备沸石框架并采用浸渍、共沉淀和离子交换等技术引入金属。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占据主导地位，因为它们具有高表面积、明确的孔结构以及在通道内容纳金属阳离子的能力。这些沸石的结构特征，包括微孔，提高了催化剂的选择性和活性，而其大的表面积促进了与反应物的有效相互作用。其他影响其有效性的因素包括在反应条件下稳定性、抗烧结性以及通过调整合成参数来调整其性质的可能性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能探索新的金属-沸石组合、优化合成协议，并开发提高热稳定性和化学稳定性的策略，同时保持高水平的催化性能。
