1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized through the vapor-phase exchange method. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature a high surface area and large pore size, which enhances the diffusion of reactants and products. Conversely, BEA zeolites possess a more ordered framework structure, increasing the catalyst's selectivity. These properties enable efficient conversion of propane into propylene. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to integrate these characteristics into novel materials.

1. 炔烃脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂主要通过气相交换法合成。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石因其独特的结构特性而占据主导地位。MFI沸石具有高比表面积和大孔径，有利于反应物和产物的扩散。而BEA沸石则具有更有序的框架结构，提高了催化剂的选择性。这些特性使得这两种沸石能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在将这些特性融入新材料中。
