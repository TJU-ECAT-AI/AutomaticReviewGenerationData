The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating materials with specific topologies, such as MFI and BEA zeolites. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics, including cubic symmetry in MFI zeolites, which promotes efficient adsorption and desorption processes. BEA zeolites, with their high Si/Al ratio, offer a stable framework for metal loading, enhancing catalyst stability under harsh conditions. The introduction of metals like gallium (Ga) creates active sites for PDH reactions, boosting the catalyst's activity. Key factors influencing PDH efficiency include pore size, surface area, and acidity. Future research aims to optimize these features to improve the performance of metal-zeolite catalysts in PDH processes.
