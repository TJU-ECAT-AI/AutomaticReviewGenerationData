The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating a framework structure where metal species are embedded within the zeolite matrix. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application because they possess unique structural characteristics such as high surface area and well-defined pore structures. These features enable the efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules, contributing to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. For future developments in PDH catalyst design, the focus should be on enhancing these structural features while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

主要的合成方法是通过在沸石矩阵中嵌入金属物种来制备金属沸石催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石之所以在这一应用中占主导地位，是因为它们具有独特的结构特性，如高比表面积和定义明确的孔结构。这些特性使得丙烷分子能够有效地吸附和反应，从而提高其在PDH反应中的效率。对于未来PDH催化剂设计的发展方向，应着重于增强这些结构特征同时减少不必要的副反应。
