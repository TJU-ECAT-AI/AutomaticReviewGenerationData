<p>However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life.</p>
<p>In the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to increase the stability of CrOx catalysts by loading them onto porous supports such as SBA-15, mesoporous carbon and ordered mesoporous ZrO2.</p>
<p>The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique ( Figs. 4 and S7).</p>
<p>The Cr species supported on HZSM-5 with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) possess similar specific surface area, which are much larger than that of 5%Cr/Al2O3 and 5%Cr/SiO2 samples.</p>
<p>The NH3 desorbed signals of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, indicating the increase acidity of Cr/Z-5 catalysts with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively.</p>
<p>It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites).</p>
<p>The main Cr6+ species in 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts must be due to the presence of strong interactions between Cr species and zeolite supports, such as the formation of Al-O-Cr and/or Si-O-Cr linkages.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 6, 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h displays a weight loss of 5.7% from 300 to 600 C. However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke.</p>
<p>Obviously, the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts can be fitted into three peaks centered at  270,  310 and  380 C respectively, corresponding to the weakly adsorbed propylene (peak I#), moderately adsorbed propylene (peak II#) and strongly adsorbed propylene species (peak III#), respectively.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the calculated TOF values of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts decrease with the increase of Cr loading from 1% to 10%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the propylene desorption property can also affect the selectivity, stability and anti-coking capability of PDH catalysts due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed propylene would be deep dehydrogenated, cracked and/or polymerized.</p>
<p>To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9.</p>
<p>Typically, the propane molecules would be adsorbed and activated on the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, whereas, the NaZSM-5 with almost no Brnsted acid sites processes very few propane adsorption.</p>
<p>On the basis of above characterizations and analysis, it can be concluded that the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH.</p>

1. The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve loading metals onto porous supports like SBA-15, mesoporous carbon, and ordered mesoporous ZrO2 to enhance stability against coke formation.

2. Metal-zeolite catalysts often use MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their structural characteristics. MFI zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined channels that facilitate the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. BEA zeolites, with their smaller pore size, help control the reaction pathways, leading to higher selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

3. The specific surface area of metal-zeolite catalysts is crucial for PDH reactions. A larger surface area allows for more active sites, enhancing reactivity. In this case, the specific surface area of the metal-zeolite catalysts with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is comparable to that of the CrOx catalysts on Al2O3 and SiO2 supports, suggesting that the choice of zeolite type significantly impacts the catalyst's performance.

4. The acidity of metal-zeolite catalysts plays a significant role in PDH reactions. Zeolites with controlled acidity levels, specifically Brnsted acid sites, are beneficial for propane adsorption and activation. However, excessive acidity can lead to cracking and deep dehydrogenation of propane, negatively impacting the PDH process.

5. The metal-support interactions between metal species and zeolite supports, such as the formation of Al-O-Cr and/or Si-O-Cr linkages, are essential for the stability and activity of metal-zeolite catalysts. These interactions influence the dispersion and stabilization of metal species on the zeolite surface, contributing to the catalyst's overall performance.

6. The weight loss analysis of the catalysts after PDH reactions demonstrates the effectiveness of the chosen zeolite type in reducing coke formation. Zeolites like HZSM-5 with a specific SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit lower coke formation compared to others, enhancing the catalyst's stability and longevity.

7. The interactions between reactant molecules and the catalyst surface, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation, are critical for the efficiency of PDH catalysts. The presence of Brnsted acid sites on zeolite supports affects the adsorption and desorption of propylene molecules, influencing the selectivity, stability, and anti-coking capabilities of the catalysts.

8. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing the zeolite type and composition to balance the acidity, porosity, and metal-support interactions. This approach aims to achieve high activity and selectivity while maintaining stability against coke formation.

2. 金属-沸石催化剂通常使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，因为它们具有结构特性。MFI沸石具有高比表面积和明确的通道，有助于丙烷分子的吸附和活化。而BEA沸石由于其较小的孔径尺寸，有助于控制反应途径，从而在脱氢过程中获得更高的选择性。

3. 金属-沸石催化剂的特定比表面积对于PDH反应至关重要。较大的比表面积提供了更多的活性位点，增强了反应活性。在这种情况下，特定比表面积较低的SiO2/Al2O3比例的金属-沸石催化剂与Al2O3和SiO2支持上的CrOx催化剂的比表面积相当，表明选择沸石类型对催化剂性能影响显著。

4. 金属-沸石催化剂的酸度在PDH反应中起着重要作用。具有特定酸度水平，特别是Brnsted酸性位点的沸石是丙烷吸附和激活的有利条件。然而，过高的酸度可能导致丙烷裂解和深脱氢，对PDH过程产生负面影响。

5. 金属与沸石支持之间的金属-支持相互作用，如形成Al-O-Cr和/或Si-O-Cr键，对于金属-沸石催化剂的稳定性和活性至关重要。这些相互作用影响金属物种在沸石表面的分散和稳定，对催化剂的整体性能产生重要影响。

6. 催化剂在PDH反应后重量损失分析表明，所选沸石类型在减少焦炭形成方面的有效性。具有特定SiO2/Al2O3比例的沸石，如HZSM-5，显示出较低的焦炭形成，提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

7. 反应物分子与催化剂表面之间的相互作用，特别是在丙烷脱氢的背景下，对于PDH催化剂的效率至关重要。沸石支持上的Brnsted酸性位点影响丙烯分子的吸附和脱附，影响催化剂的选择性、稳定性和抗结焦能力。

8. 未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在优化沸石类型和组成，以平衡酸度、孔隙率和金属-支持相互作用。这种方法旨在实现高活性和选择性的同时，保持对抗焦炭形成的稳定性。

<p>However, no obvious improvement of the catalytic stability was achieved.</p>
<p>It is reported that CrZrO2 prepared by a coprecipitation method with 40 times lower Cr content exhibited comparable activity to commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 in PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ordered mesoporous Cr-Zr-O and Cr-Zr-K-O catalysts were synthesized and used for PDH, exhibiting enhanced catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>Although many efficient Cr-based catalysts have been exploited for PDH, no obvious improvement of the catalytic stability was achieved.</p>
<p>Especially, the Cr loading amounts can affect the dispersion of Cr species on Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, affecting their catalytic performance toward PDH.</p>
<p>In particular, the calculated TOF value of 1%Cr/Z-5(260) is close to that of its actual TOF value, suggesting that almost all Cr atoms are the active sites in 1%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1 (a and b), it can be found that the catalytic performances of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>Clearly, the propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively.</p>
<p>The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites).</p>
<p>While only two obvious peaks can be seen in the 5%Cr/Z-5(28) and 5%Cr/Z-5(260), corresponding to the Cr6+ 2p3/2 (578.8 eV) and Cr6+ 2p1/2 (588.6 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>As to bulk Cr2O3, four peaks can be observed in the Cr 2p XPS spectrum, corresponding to the Cr3+ 2p3/2 (576.8, 577.9 and 579.5 eV), and Cr3+ 2p1/2 (587.3 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>And the 5%Cr/Al2O3 sample after 5 h time on stream was also tested for comparison.</p>
<p>However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7 (a), all the Cr/Z-5 catalysts exhibit an obvious C3H8 desorbed signal in the temperature range of 150  500 C.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7 (b), the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts can be fitted into three peaks centered at  270,  310 and  380 C respectively.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports.</p>
<p>So, the presence of Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH.</p>
<p>This study may provide an important instruction to design and synthesize stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity.</p>

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized through wet-impregnation methods, where metal salts are mixed with zeolite in a solvent, followed by drying and calcination. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity. These structural characteristics allow for efficient adsorption and activation of propane molecules. The high dispersion of metal species within the zeolite framework contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. The Lewis and Brnsted acid sites originating from both metal species and zeolite structure play key roles in the catalytic performance, facilitating the activation of the CH bonds in propane and the formation of propylene. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support influences the catalytic performance, with lower ratios enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Optimization of preparation conditions allows for the creation of catalysts with high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are favored in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined channels that are beneficial for the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. The MFI topology features a square planar channel with a width slightly larger than propane, which facilitates the adsorption of propane molecules. The BEA topology offers even more complex channel structures that can enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. The presence of Brnsted acid sites within the zeolite structure is crucial for the activation of propane molecules, allowing for the efficient conversion to propylene. The Lewis acid sites on the metal species contribute to the stability of the catalysts and prevent the formation of coke, which is detrimental to the PDH process. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support plays a significant role in determining the catalytic performance; a lower ratio leads to improved selectivity and stability. The wet-impregnation method enables the uniform dispersion of metal species within the zeolite framework, maximizing their reactivity and stability during PDH reactions.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it appears that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. These zeolites are characterized by their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the dispersion and stabilization of metal species. The Brnsted acid sites within these zeolites play a crucial role in enhancing propane adsorption and activating the CH bonds, contributing to the overall catalytic performance. The high surface area and pore structure of zeolites like HZSM-5 provide an ideal environment for the metal species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability.

When considering the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design, it is essential to optimize the preparation conditions and tailor the zeolite structure to achieve a balance between acid site density and selectivity. The document highlights that zeolites with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio tend to have a high amount of acidic sites, which can lead to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propane, negatively impacting the propylene selectivity. Thus, future research might focus on modifying the zeolite structure or incorporating additional components to control the acidity and improve the selectivity of PDH catalysts.

The optimized catalyst developed in the study, with 5 wt% Cr supported on HZSM-5(260), demonstrates high activity and stability under high WHSV conditions, achieving a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 after 50 hours. This example showcases the potential for achieving superior PDH performance through careful catalyst design and optimization.

分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法，似乎MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石占据了主导地位。这些沸石具有明确的孔结构和高比表面积，有利于金属物种的分散和稳定化。沸石内的Brnsted酸位点在增强丙烷吸附和活化CH键中起着关键作用，从而促进了整体催化性能。沸石如HZSM-5的高比表面积和孔结构为金属物种提供了一个理想的环境，确保了高催化活性和稳定性。

对于未来PDH催化剂设计的影响，优化制备条件并根据需要调整沸石结构至关重要，以实现酸位密度与选择性的平衡。文档指出，SiO2/Al2O3比率较低的沸石倾向于具有较高的酸位密度，这可能导致深度脱氢和丙烷裂解，从而负面影响丙烯选择性。因此，未来研究可能集中在修改沸石结构或引入额外成分来控制酸性和提高PDH催化剂的选择性。

研究中优化得到的催化剂，以5 wt% Cr支持在HZSM-5(260)上，表现出在高空速条件下高的活性和稳定性，实现了27.9 mmol gcat1 h1的高丙烯形成速率，经过50小时后。这一例子展示了通过精确催化剂设计和优化实现优越PDH性能的潜力。
