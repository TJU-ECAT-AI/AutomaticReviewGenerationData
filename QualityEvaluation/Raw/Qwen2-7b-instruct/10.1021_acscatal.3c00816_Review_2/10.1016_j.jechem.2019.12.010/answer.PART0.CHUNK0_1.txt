<p>However, no obvious improvement of the catalytic stability was achieved.</p>
<p>It is reported that CrZrO2 prepared by a coprecipitation method with 40 times lower Cr content exhibited comparable activity to commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 in PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ordered mesoporous Cr-Zr-O and Cr-Zr-K-O catalysts were synthesized and used for PDH, exhibiting enhanced catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>Although many efficient Cr-based catalysts have been exploited for PDH, no obvious improvement of the catalytic stability was achieved.</p>
<p>Especially, the Cr loading amounts can affect the dispersion of Cr species on Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, affecting their catalytic performance toward PDH.</p>
<p>In particular, the calculated TOF value of 1%Cr/Z-5(260) is close to that of its actual TOF value, suggesting that almost all Cr atoms are the active sites in 1%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1 (a and b), it can be found that the catalytic performances of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>Clearly, the propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively.</p>
<p>The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites).</p>
<p>While only two obvious peaks can be seen in the 5%Cr/Z-5(28) and 5%Cr/Z-5(260), corresponding to the Cr6+ 2p3/2 (578.8 eV) and Cr6+ 2p1/2 (588.6 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>As to bulk Cr2O3, four peaks can be observed in the Cr 2p XPS spectrum, corresponding to the Cr3+ 2p3/2 (576.8, 577.9 and 579.5 eV), and Cr3+ 2p1/2 (587.3 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>And the 5%Cr/Al2O3 sample after 5 h time on stream was also tested for comparison.</p>
<p>However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7 (a), all the Cr/Z-5 catalysts exhibit an obvious C3H8 desorbed signal in the temperature range of 150  500 C.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7 (b), the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts can be fitted into three peaks centered at  270,  310 and  380 C respectively.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports.</p>
<p>So, the presence of Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH.</p>
<p>This study may provide an important instruction to design and synthesize stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity.</p>

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized through wet-impregnation methods, where metal salts are mixed with zeolite in a solvent, followed by drying and calcination. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity. These structural characteristics allow for efficient adsorption and activation of propane molecules. The high dispersion of metal species within the zeolite framework contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. The Lewis and Brnsted acid sites originating from both metal species and zeolite structure play key roles in the catalytic performance, facilitating the activation of the CH bonds in propane and the formation of propylene. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support influences the catalytic performance, with lower ratios enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Optimization of preparation conditions allows for the creation of catalysts with high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are favored in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their unique structural characteristics. These zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined channels that are beneficial for the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. The MFI topology features a square planar channel with a width slightly larger than propane, which facilitates the adsorption of propane molecules. The BEA topology offers even more complex channel structures that can enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. The presence of Brnsted acid sites within the zeolite structure is crucial for the activation of propane molecules, allowing for the efficient conversion to propylene. The Lewis acid sites on the metal species contribute to the stability of the catalysts and prevent the formation of coke, which is detrimental to the PDH process. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support plays a significant role in determining the catalytic performance; a lower ratio leads to improved selectivity and stability. The wet-impregnation method enables the uniform dispersion of metal species within the zeolite framework, maximizing their reactivity and stability during PDH reactions. Overall, these factors collectively contribute to the effectiveness of metal-zeolite catalysts in PDH applications.
