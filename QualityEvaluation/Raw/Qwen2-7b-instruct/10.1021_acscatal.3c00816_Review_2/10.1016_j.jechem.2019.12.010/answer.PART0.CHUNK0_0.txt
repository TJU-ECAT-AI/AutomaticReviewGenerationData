<p>However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life.</p>
<p>In the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to increase the stability of CrOx catalysts by loading them onto porous supports such as SBA-15, mesoporous carbon and ordered mesoporous ZrO2.</p>
<p>The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique ( Figs. 4 and S7).</p>
<p>The Cr species supported on HZSM-5 with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) possess similar specific surface area, which are much larger than that of 5%Cr/Al2O3 and 5%Cr/SiO2 samples.</p>
<p>The NH3 desorbed signals of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, indicating the increase acidity of Cr/Z-5 catalysts with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively.</p>
<p>It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites).</p>
<p>The main Cr6+ species in 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts must be due to the presence of strong interactions between Cr species and zeolite supports, such as the formation of Al-O-Cr and/or Si-O-Cr linkages.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 6, 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h displays a weight loss of 5.7% from 300 to 600 C. However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke.</p>
<p>Obviously, the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts can be fitted into three peaks centered at  270,  310 and  380 C respectively, corresponding to the weakly adsorbed propylene (peak I#), moderately adsorbed propylene (peak II#) and strongly adsorbed propylene species (peak III#), respectively.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the calculated TOF values of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts decrease with the increase of Cr loading from 1% to 10%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the propylene desorption property can also affect the selectivity, stability and anti-coking capability of PDH catalysts due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed propylene would be deep dehydrogenated, cracked and/or polymerized.</p>
<p>To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9.</p>
<p>Typically, the propane molecules would be adsorbed and activated on the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, whereas, the NaZSM-5 with almost no Brnsted acid sites processes very few propane adsorption.</p>
<p>On the basis of above characterizations and analysis, it can be concluded that the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH.</p>

1. The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve loading metals onto porous supports like SBA-15, mesoporous carbon, and ordered mesoporous ZrO2 to enhance stability against coke formation.

2. Metal-zeolite catalysts often use MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their structural characteristics. MFI zeolites have a high surface area and well-defined channels that facilitate the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. BEA zeolites, with their smaller pore size, help control the reaction pathways, leading to higher selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

3. The specific surface area of metal-zeolite catalysts is crucial for PDH reactions. A larger surface area allows for more active sites, enhancing reactivity. In this case, the specific surface area of the metal-zeolite catalysts with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is comparable to that of the CrOx catalysts on Al2O3 and SiO2 supports, suggesting that the choice of zeolite type significantly impacts the catalyst's performance.

4. The acidity of metal-zeolite catalysts plays a significant role in PDH reactions. Zeolites with controlled acidity levels, specifically Brnsted acid sites, are beneficial for propane adsorption and activation. However, excessive acidity can lead to cracking and deep dehydrogenation of propane, negatively impacting the PDH process.

5. The metal-support interactions between metal species and zeolite supports, such as the formation of Al-O-Cr and/or Si-O-Cr linkages, are essential for the stability and activity of metal-zeolite catalysts. These interactions influence the dispersion and stabilization of metal species on the zeolite surface, contributing to the catalyst's overall performance.

6. The weight loss analysis of the catalysts after PDH reactions demonstrates the effectiveness of the chosen zeolite type in reducing coke formation. Zeolites like HZSM-5 with a specific SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit lower coke formation compared to others, enhancing the catalyst's stability and longevity.

7. The interactions between reactant molecules and the catalyst surface, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation, are critical for the efficiency of PDH catalysts. The presence of Brnsted acid sites on zeolite supports affects the adsorption and desorption of propylene molecules, influencing the selectivity, stability, and anti-coking capabilities of the catalysts.

8. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing the zeolite type and composition to balance the acidity, porosity, and metal-support interactions. This approach aims to achieve high activity and selectivity while maintaining stability against coke formation.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，用于金属-沸石催化剂合成的方法通常涉及将金属负载到诸如SBA-15、介孔碳和有序介孔ZrO2等多孔支持物上，以提高抗焦炭形成稳定性。

2. 金属-沸石催化剂通常使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，因为它们具有结构特性。MFI沸石具有高比表面积和明确的通道，有助于丙烷分子的吸附和活化。而BEA沸石由于其较小的孔径尺寸，有助于控制反应途径，从而在脱氢过程中获得更高的选择性。

3. 金属-沸石催化剂的特定比表面积对于PDH反应至关重要。较大的比表面积提供了更多的活性位点，增强了反应活性。在这种情况下，特定比表面积较低的SiO2/Al2O3比例的金属-沸石催化剂与Al2O3和SiO2支持上的CrOx催化剂的比表面积相当，表明选择沸石类型对催化剂性能影响显著。

4. 金属-沸石催化剂的酸度在PDH反应中起着重要作用。具有特定酸度水平，特别是Brnsted酸性位点的沸石是丙烷吸附和激活的有利条件。然而，过高的酸度可能导致丙烷裂解和深脱氢，对PDH过程产生负面影响。

5. 金属与沸石支持之间的金属-支持相互作用，如形成Al-O-Cr和/或Si-O-Cr键，对于金属-沸石催化剂的稳定性和活性至关重要。这些相互作用影响金属物种在沸石表面的分散和稳定，对催化剂的整体性能产生重要影响。

6. 催化剂在PDH反应后重量损失分析表明，所选沸石类型在减少焦炭形成方面的有效性。具有特定SiO2/Al2O3比例的沸石，如HZSM-5，显示出较低的焦炭形成，提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

7. 反应物分子与催化剂表面之间的相互作用，特别是在丙烷脱氢的背景下，对于PDH催化剂的效率至关重要。沸石支持上的Brnsted酸性位点影响丙烯分子的吸附和脱附，影响催化剂的选择性、稳定性和抗结焦能力。

8. 未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在优化沸石类型和组成，以平衡酸度、孔隙率和金属-支持相互作用。这种方法旨在实现高活性和选择性的同时，保持对抗焦炭形成的稳定性。
