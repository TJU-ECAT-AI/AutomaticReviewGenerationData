The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating materials with unique structural characteristics, specifically high surface area and well-defined pore structure. Zeolites of MFI and BEA topologies dominate because they provide an optimal environment for the dehydrogenation process. The presence of metal sites within the zeolite framework enhances the catalytic activity, contributing to their effectiveness. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to incorporate more active metals and refine the zeolite structure to improve performance.

主要合成方法是通过制备具有独特结构特征的材料，特别是高比表面积和有序孔结构的金属-沸石催化剂。MFI和BEA型沸石在丙烷脱氢反应中占据主导地位，是因为它们为脱氢过程提供了最佳环境。沸石框架中的金属位点增强了催化活性，从而提高了这些材料的有效性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在引入更活跃的金属并优化沸石结构以提高性能。
