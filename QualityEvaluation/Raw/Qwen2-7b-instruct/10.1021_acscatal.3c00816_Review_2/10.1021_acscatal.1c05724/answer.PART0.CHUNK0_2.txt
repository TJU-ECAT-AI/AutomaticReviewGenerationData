Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and effective stabilization of metal species. These zeolite types offer a balance between acid strength and basicity, which is essential for the PDH reaction. Their effectiveness is attributed to the precise control over the metal-support interactions and the zeolite framework. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might aim to enhance the stability of active sites, improve selectivity towards desired products, and optimize the interaction between metals and the zeolite framework.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，我们发现MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石占据主导地位，这得益于它们的高比表面积、明确的孔结构以及对金属物种的有效稳定。这些沸石类型提供了酸性和碱性之间的平衡，这对于PDH反应至关重要。它们的高效性归因于对金属-载体相互作用和沸石框架的精确控制。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在增强活性位点的稳定性、提高目标产物的选择性以及优化金属与沸石框架之间的相互作用。
