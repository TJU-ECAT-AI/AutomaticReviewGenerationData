The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metal ions into the zeolite framework through various techniques such as ion exchange, co-precipitation, and impregnation. These methods aim to stabilize the metal species within the zeolite structure, enhancing their reactivity and stability during PDH processes. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their specific pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the efficient adsorption and reaction of propane molecules. Their structural characteristics, including the size and shape of the pores, contribute significantly to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the optimization of metal loading, the selection of appropriate metal ions for enhanced activity, and the modification of zeolite frameworks to tailor their properties for improved performance under PDH conditions.

主要的合成方法包括通过离子交换、共沉淀和浸渍等技术将金属离子引入沸石框架中，旨在在沸石结构中稳定金属物种，从而增强其在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的活性和稳定性。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位，主要是由于它们特定的孔结构和高表面积，这有助于高效吸附和反应丙烷分子。它们的结构特性，包括孔的大小和形状，对PDH反应的有效性贡献很大。未来PDH催化剂设计的影响包括优化金属负载、选择合适的金属离子以增强活性以及修改沸石框架以根据PDH条件改进性能的定制性质。
