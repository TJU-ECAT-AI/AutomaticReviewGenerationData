[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[4] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[5] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
[6] "The same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
[7] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."
[8] "For the PtCo catalysts, the Co/Pt atomic ratio was considerably different, increasing in the order of alumina < mz < mz-deGa."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques, where metal precursors are dissolved in water and then added to the zeolite framework. These methods rely on the unique structure of mesoporous zeolites, characterized by ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which facilitate reactant and product diffusion and dispersion of metal nanoparticles. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their ability to enhance catalytic performance by providing a suitable environment for metal dispersion and facilitating reaction kinetics. The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) like lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) into the zeolite structure improves dispersion of platinum (Pt) and prevents deactivation caused by coke deposition, which otherwise leads to loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The synthesis of mesoporous zeolites under sodium-free conditions creates silanol nests, which are crucial for the formation of atomically dispersed REEs and subsequent Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles. This process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the continued exploration of REE incorporation, optimization of zeolite synthesis conditions to maximize the formation of silanol nests, and the creation of new alloy compositions that can further improve catalytic efficiency. The discovery of REE-based and other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures using mesoporous zeolites opens new opportunities for enhancing PDH processes.

In the case of PtCo catalysts, the Co/Pt atomic ratio varies depending on the support material. The presence of gallium (Ga) in the support material (mz-deGa) is believed to play a role in the catalytic function and the formation of Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles, although its effect is not as dramatic as the alloying effect itself.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法涉及浸渍技术，即将金属前体溶解在水中，然后添加到沸石骨架中。这些方法依赖于微孔沸石的独特结构，其特征是超薄沸石框架和相互连接的介孔，这有助于反应物和产物的扩散以及金属纳米粒子的分散。具有MFI和BEA拓扑的沸石因其能够通过提供适合金属分散的环境和促进反应动力学来增强催化性能而主导PDH应用。通过将稀土元素（REE）如镧（La）和钇（Y）纳入沸石结构中，可以改善铂（Pt）的分散并防止由焦炭沉积引起的活性丧失，这会导致丙烯选择性的损失。在钠自由条件下合成的微孔沸石产生硅醇巢，这对于形成原子分散的REE至关重要，并随后形成Pt-REE合金纳米颗粒。这一过程显著增强了PDH反应的催化性能，特别是在活性、选择性和耐用性方面。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，包括继续探索REE的整合、优化沸石合成条件以最大化硅醇巢的形成，以及创造新的合金组成，以进一步提高催化效率。使用微孔沸石发现基于REE和其他过渡金属的合金催化剂的各种组成和结构，为增强PDH过程开辟了新机会。

在PtCo催化剂的情况下，Co/Pt原子比根据支撑材料的不同而变化。支撑材料（mz-deGa）中存在的镓（Ga）被认为在催化功能和Pt-Co合金纳米颗粒的形成中发挥作用，尽管其效果不如合金效应本身。
