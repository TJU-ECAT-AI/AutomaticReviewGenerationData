<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.</p>
<p>Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite. Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La.</p>
<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods).</p>
<p>With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid (see Methods and Extended Data Figs. 2, 3).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the importance of utilizing zeolites with specific structural characteristics. Two key types mentioned are MFI and BEA topological zeolites, which are favored for their hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures. These features enhance the catalytic performance by facilitating both reactant and product diffusion, while also enabling high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The use of MFI zeolites, in particular, is emphasized for their ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which significantly boost the activity of supported metals in PDH reactions.

The synthesis of these zeolites typically involves a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of advanced catalyst supports. The presence of these unique structures allows for superior dispersion of metal nanoparticles, improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) such as La and Y into the zeolite matrix is noted to increase the catalytic lifetime, with systematic exploration achieving a 700-fold increase when supported Pt nanoparticles are present as intermetallic compounds with La.

In terms of the preparation methods, the literature describes a process involving co-impregnation of metal precursors (such as Pt and REEs) followed by heat treatments under O2 and H2 flows. This method enables the formation of intermetallic nanoparticles, particularly when using mesoporous zeolites. Furthermore, the generation of silanol nests through the synthesis of a gallosilicate zeolite and subsequent removal of Ga atoms is highlighted as a strategy to assist in the atomistic dispersion of REEs and facilitate their conversion to metallic states, thereby contributing to the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.

Despite the successful synthesis of PtLa/mz-deGa catalysts with a significant amount of Ga remaining after degallation, it is recognized that this element might still play a role in the catalytic function. The literature suggests that the use of mesoporous zeolites as supports offers a promising avenue for the development of PDH catalysts, allowing for the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures. This opens up new opportunities for catalytic applications in the field of PDH reactions.

In summary, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions primarily relies on leveraging zeolites with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures, which enhance the catalytic performance through improved diffusion properties and enhanced dispersion of metal nanoparticles. The strategic incorporation of rare earth elements, facilitated by the creation of silanol nests, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity, selectivity, and durability in these catalysts. The versatility of these zeolite supports suggests potential for the discovery of a wide range of alloy catalysts with diverse compositions and structures, further advancing the field of PDH catalysis.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，文献强调了使用具有特定结构特性的沸石的重要性。两种关键类型的沸石提到的是MFI和BEA拓扑结构，它们特别适合于微/介孔结构的层次结构。这些特性通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及支持金属纳米颗粒在介孔中的高分散性，显著提高了催化性能。特别是MFI沸石，因其超薄沸石框架和相互连接的介孔而受到重视，这极大地提高了支持金属在PDH反应中的活性。

这些沸石的合成通常涉及多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂，从而形成先进的催化剂支撑。这些独特的结构允许金属纳米颗粒的优越分散，从而提高整体催化效率。此外，将稀土元素（REEs）如La和Y纳入沸石矩阵中被注意到可以增加催化剂寿命，系统探索显示，当支持的Pt纳米颗粒以与La的互金属化合物形式存在时，催化寿命可增加700倍。

关于合成方法，文献描述了一个过程，其中金属前体（如Pt和REEs）的共浸渍随后是O2和H2流的热处理。这种方法使形成互金属纳米颗粒成为可能，特别是在使用介孔沸石的情况下。此外，通过合成一种镓硅酸盐沸石并随后去除Ga原子来生成硅醇基巢被视为一种策略，以帮助REE的原子级分散，并促进它们向金属状态的转换，从而有助于形成互金属合金纳米颗粒的形成。

尽管成功合成了含少量Ga残留的PtLa/mz-deGa催化剂，但在去镓化后仍然存在，但已认识到这种元素仍可能在催化功能中发挥作用。文献指出，作为支持的介孔沸石为PDH催化剂的发展提供了有前景的途径，允许发现不仅基于REE的合金催化剂，而且还有其他过渡金属基合金催化剂的各种组成和结构。这为PDH催化应用开辟了新的机会。

综上所述，用于PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂的合成主要依赖于利用具有微/介孔结构层次的沸石，这些沸石通过改进扩散特性和金属纳米颗粒的增强分散性，显著提高了催化性能。通过战略性地引入稀土元素，并借助硅醇基巢的生成，实现了高活性、选择性和耐用性的催化剂。这些沸石支撑的灵活性表明，有可能发现各种组成和结构的合金催化剂，进一步推动PDH催化领域的发展。
