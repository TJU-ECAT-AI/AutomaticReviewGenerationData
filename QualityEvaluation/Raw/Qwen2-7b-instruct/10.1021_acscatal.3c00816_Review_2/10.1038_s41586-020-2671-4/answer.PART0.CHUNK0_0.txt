<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13.</p>
<p>Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.</p>
<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods).</p>
<p>Alternatively, when zeolites synthesized under a sodium-free condition were used, there was a small but distinct increase in the catalytic lifetime.</p>
<p>In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite.</p>
<p>The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d.</p>
<p>The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles.</p>

To synthesize metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the document primarily discusses using a mesoporous MFI zeolite as a support. This type of zeolite has a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, which is synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent. The MFI zeolite's unique structure, comprising ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, enhances the catalytic performance of supported metals. It facilitates both reactant and product diffusion and provides high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. This makes the MFI zeolite an advanced catalyst support for PDH reactions.

The document also mentions the use of rare-earth elements (REEs) like lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) to improve the stability and activity of PDH catalysts. The REEs are incorporated into the zeolite support by co-impregnation, followed by heating under an oxygen flow at 350°C and then under hydrogen at 700°C. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports is crucial for controlling the formation of REE-containing alloy nanoparticles, which can significantly increase the catalytic lifetime.

The document highlights the use of the MFI zeolite as a superior support compared to traditional alumina for PDH catalysts. The MFI zeolite, along with REEs, leads to improved catalytic activity and durability under harsh operating conditions. The high activity and selectivity of the catalysts are attributed to the unique structure of the MFI zeolite, which allows for facile diffusion of reactants and products and efficient dispersion of metal nanoparticles. The document also suggests that the addition of REEs can further enhance the performance of the PDH catalysts by stabilizing the metal nanoparticles and improving their dispersion within the zeolite support.

In summary, the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions involve using a mesoporous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a support. The MFI zeolite's unique structure, combined with the strategic incorporation of REEs, contributes to the catalysts' effectiveness in PDH reactions, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the MFI zeolite's structure and the incorporation of REEs to further enhance the catalysts' performance under various operating conditions.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的合成，文档主要讨论使用MFI沸石作为支撑。这种类型的沸石具有微孔和介孔的层级结构，通过多氨基表面活性剂作为模板剂进行合成。MFI沸石的独特结构，由超薄沸石框架和三维互连的介孔组成，提高了支持金属的催化性能。它促进了反应物和产物的扩散，并提供了金属纳米粒子在介孔中的高效分散。这使得MFI沸石成为PDH反应中先进的催化剂支持。

文档还提到了镧（La）和钇（Y）等稀土元素的使用，以提高PDH催化剂的稳定性和活性。这些稀土元素通过共浸渍方法被引入到沸石支撑中，然后在氧气流下加热至350°C，随后在氢气下加热至700°C。沸石支撑中硅醇巢的存在对于控制形成含有稀土的合金纳米颗粒至关重要，这可以显著增加催化剂的使用寿命。

文档强调了使用MFI沸石作为PDH催化剂优于传统氧化铝的支撑。MFI沸石，加上稀土元素，导致了改进的催化活性和耐久性，在恶劣的操作条件下。PDH催化剂的高活性和选择性归因于MFI沸石的独特结构，允许反应物和产物的快速扩散以及金属纳米粒子在沸石支撑中的有效分散。文档还表明，添加稀土元素可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的性能，通过稳定金属纳米粒子并改善它们在沸石支撑中的分散。

简而言之，用于PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法涉及使用具有微孔和介孔层级结构的MFI沸石作为支撑。MFI沸石独特的结构与精心引入的稀土元素相结合，有助于催化剂在PDH反应中的有效性，特别是在活动性、选择性和耐用性方面。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化MFI沸石的结构和引入稀土元素，以进一步增强在各种操作条件下的催化剂性能。
