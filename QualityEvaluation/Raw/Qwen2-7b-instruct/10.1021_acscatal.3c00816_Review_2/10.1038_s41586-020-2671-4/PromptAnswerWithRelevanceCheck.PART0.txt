<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.

To synthesize metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the document primarily discusses using a mesoporous MFI zeolite as a support. This type of zeolite has a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, which is synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent. The MFI zeolite's unique structure, comprising ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, enhances the catalytic performance of supported metals. It facilitates both reactant and product diffusion and provides high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. This makes the MFI zeolite an advanced catalyst support for PDH reactions.

The document also mentions the use of rare-earth elements (REEs) like lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) to improve the stability and activity of PDH catalysts. The REEs are incorporated into the zeolite support by co-impregnation, followed by heating under an oxygen flow at 350°C and then under hydrogen at 700°C. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports is crucial for controlling the formation of REE-containing alloy nanoparticles, which can significantly increase the catalytic lifetime.

The document highlights the use of the MFI zeolite as a superior support compared to traditional alumina for PDH catalysts. The MFI zeolite, along with REEs, leads to improved catalytic activity and durability under harsh operating conditions. The high activity and selectivity of the catalysts are attributed to the unique structure of the MFI zeolite, which allows for facile diffusion of reactants and products and efficient dispersion of metal nanoparticles. The document also suggests that the addition of REEs can further enhance the performance of the PDH catalysts by stabilizing the metal nanoparticles and improving their dispersion within the zeolite support.

In summary, the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions involve using a mesoporous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a support. The MFI zeolite's unique structure, combined with the strategic incorporation of REEs, contributes to the catalysts' effectiveness in PDH reactions, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the MFI zeolite's structure and the incorporation of REEs to further enhance the catalysts' performance under various operating conditions.

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the importance of utilizing zeolites with specific structural characteristics. Two key types mentioned are MFI and BEA topological zeolites, which are favored for their hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures. These features enhance the catalytic performance by facilitating both reactant and product diffusion, while also enabling high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The use of MFI zeolites, in particular, is emphasized for their ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which significantly boost the activity of supported metals in PDH reactions.

The synthesis of these zeolites typically involves a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of advanced catalyst supports. The presence of these unique structures allows for superior dispersion of metal nanoparticles, improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) such as La and Y into the zeolite matrix is noted to increase the catalytic lifetime, with systematic exploration achieving a 700-fold increase when supported Pt nanoparticles are present as intermetallic compounds with La.

In terms of the preparation methods, the literature describes a process involving co-impregnation of metal precursors (such as Pt and REEs) followed by heat treatments under O2 and H2 flows. This method enables the formation of intermetallic nanoparticles, particularly when using mesoporous zeolites. Furthermore, the generation of silanol nests through the synthesis of a gallosilicate zeolite and subsequent removal of Ga atoms is highlighted as a strategy to assist in the atomistic dispersion of REEs and facilitate their conversion to metallic states, thereby contributing to the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.

Despite the successful synthesis of PtLa/mz-deGa catalysts with a significant amount of Ga remaining after degallation, it is recognized that this element might still play a role in the catalytic function. The literature suggests that the use of mesoporous zeolites as supports offers a promising avenue for the development of PDH catalysts, allowing for the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures. This opens up new opportunities for catalytic applications in the field of PDH reactions.

In summary, the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions primarily relies on leveraging zeolites with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures, which enhance the catalytic performance through improved diffusion properties and enhanced dispersion of metal nanoparticles. The strategic incorporation of rare earth elements, facilitated by the creation of silanol nests, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity, selectivity, and durability in these catalysts. The versatility of these zeolite supports suggests potential for the discovery of a wide range of alloy catalysts with diverse compositions and structures, further advancing the field of PDH catalysis.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，文献强调了使用具有特定结构特性的沸石的重要性。两种关键类型的沸石提到的是MFI和BEA拓扑结构，它们特别适合于微/介孔结构的层次结构。这些特性通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及支持金属纳米颗粒在介孔中的高分散性，显著提高了催化性能。特别是MFI沸石，因其超薄沸石框架和相互连接的介孔而受到重视，这极大地提高了支持金属在PDH反应中的活性。

这些沸石的合成通常涉及多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂，从而形成先进的催化剂支撑。这些独特的结构允许金属纳米颗粒的优越分散，从而提高整体催化效率。此外，将稀土元素（REEs）如La和Y纳入沸石矩阵中被注意到可以增加催化剂寿命，系统探索显示，当支持的Pt纳米颗粒以与La的互金属化合物形式存在时，催化寿命可增加700倍。

关于合成方法，文献描述了一个过程，其中金属前体（如Pt和REEs）的共浸渍随后是O2和H2流的热处理。这种方法使形成互金属纳米颗粒成为可能，特别是在使用介孔沸石的情况下。此外，通过合成一种镓硅酸盐沸石并随后去除Ga原子来生成硅醇基巢被视为一种策略，以帮助REE的原子级分散，并促进它们向金属状态的转换，从而有助于形成互金属合金纳米颗粒的形成。

尽管成功合成了含少量Ga残留的PtLa/mz-deGa催化剂，但在去镓化后仍然存在，但已认识到这种元素仍可能在催化功能中发挥作用。文献指出，作为支持的介孔沸石为PDH催化剂的发展提供了有前景的途径，允许发现不仅基于REE的合金催化剂，而且还有其他过渡金属基合金催化剂的各种组成和结构。这为PDH催化应用开辟了新的机会。

综上所述，用于PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂的合成主要依赖于利用具有微/介孔结构层次的沸石，这些沸石通过改进扩散特性和金属纳米颗粒的增强分散性，显著提高了催化性能。通过战略性地引入稀土元素，并借助硅醇基巢的生成，实现了高活性、选择性和耐用性的催化剂。这些沸石支撑的灵活性表明，有可能发现各种组成和结构的合金催化剂，进一步推动PDH催化领域的发展。

1. The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves impregnating metal precursors, such as platinum (Pt), lanthanum (La), and yttrium (Y), into a mesoporous zeolite support. This is achieved through co-impregnation techniques followed by heating under oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) flows at specific temperatures. The use of mesoporous zeolites, particularly those with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures like MFI zeolites, is favored due to their ability to provide optimal conditions for both reactant and product diffusion and high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The addition of rare earth elements (REEs) like La and Y is aimed at improving the initial PDH activity and catalytic lifetime of the Pt catalysts, although counterintuitively, the study found that the catalytic lifetime was significantly enhanced when these elements were added.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH application due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which facilitate efficient diffusion of reactants and products, as well as dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. This structure contributes to the effectiveness of these zeolites in enhancing the catalytic performance of the supported metals. BEA zeolites, with their bicontinuous mesoporous structure, also offer advantages in terms of pore connectivity and size, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of these zeolites allows for a balance between surface area and pore size, optimizing the interaction between metal nanoparticles and the zeolite support. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may leverage these structural features to engineer zeolites with tailored pore sizes and shapes that further enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是将铂（Pt）、镧（La）和钇（Y）等金属前体浸渍到介孔沸石载体中。这通过共浸渍技术和随后在氧气（O2）和氢气（H2）流下的加热来实现。使用如MFI沸石这样的介孔沸石，特别是那些具有微/介孔结构的沸石，被青睐，因为它们能够提供最佳条件，使反应物和产物扩散，并且在介孔内高分散金属纳米颗粒。向铂催化剂中添加稀土元素（REEs）如La和Y旨在提高初始PDH活性和催化寿命，尽管出乎意料的是，研究发现当这些元素被添加时，催化寿命显著增加。

2. MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，主要是由于它们独特的结构特征。MFI沸石具有超薄沸石框架和相互连接的介孔，这促进了反应物和产物的有效扩散，以及金属纳米颗粒在介孔内的高分散。这种结构有助于增强支持金属的催化性能。BEA沸石的双连续介孔结构也提供了优势，在于孔的连通性和大小，这对催化反应是有益的。这些沸石的层次微/介孔结构允许平衡表面积和孔尺寸之间的平衡，优化金属纳米颗粒与沸石支持物之间的相互作用。PDH催化剂设计的未来开发可能利用这些结构特征，工程化沸石以具有定制的孔大小和形状，进一步提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性。

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve impregnation techniques, where metal precursors are dissolved in water and then added to the zeolite framework. These methods rely on the unique structure of mesoporous zeolites, characterized by ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which facilitate reactant and product diffusion and dispersion of metal nanoparticles. Zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications due to their ability to enhance catalytic performance by providing a suitable environment for metal dispersion and facilitating reaction kinetics. The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) like lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) into the zeolite structure improves dispersion of platinum (Pt) and prevents deactivation caused by coke deposition, which otherwise leads to loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. The synthesis of mesoporous zeolites under sodium-free conditions creates silanol nests, which are crucial for the formation of atomically dispersed REEs and subsequent Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles. This process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the continued exploration of REE incorporation, optimization of zeolite synthesis conditions to maximize the formation of silanol nests, and the creation of new alloy compositions that can further improve catalytic efficiency. The discovery of REE-based and other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures using mesoporous zeolites opens new opportunities for enhancing PDH processes.

In the case of PtCo catalysts, the Co/Pt atomic ratio varies depending on the support material. The presence of gallium (Ga) in the support material (mz-deGa) is believed to play a role in the catalytic function and the formation of Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles, although its effect is not as dramatic as the alloying effect itself.

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，包括继续探索REE的整合、优化沸石合成条件以最大化硅醇巢的形成，以及创造新的合金组成，以进一步提高催化效率。使用微孔沸石发现基于REE和其他过渡金属的合金催化剂的各种组成和结构，为增强PDH过程开辟了新机会。

Analyze the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, explaining why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. How do their structural characteristics and other factors contribute to their effectiveness, and what are the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design?

Metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions are typically synthesized by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. MFI and BEA topological zeolites are favored due to their unique structure, comprising ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores. These features enhance the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and enabling high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The presence of silanol nests, which are often detected in mesoporous zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions, plays a crucial role in stabilizing single atomic rare-earth elements (REEs) with a higher chemical potential, allowing for easier conversion to metallic REEs and aiding in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. This stabilization is key to the prolonged catalytic lifetime of the REE-Pt catalysts. The incorporation of REEs, such as La and Y, improves Pt dispersion and stability, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. The synthesis methods involving the generation of silanol nests through degallation of zeolites and subsequent incorporation of REEs as single atomic species leads to the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit superior PDH catalytic performance, including high activity, selectivity, and durability. The presence of small amounts of gallium (Ga) in the catalysts, even after degallation, suggests its potential participation in the catalytic function. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could leverage the insights gained from the role of silanol nests and the effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites to engineer catalysts with improved properties, such as enhanced stability and activity, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable propane-to-propylene conversion processes.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the potential to optimize the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts by tailoring the zeolite structure, enhancing the stability and activity of the catalysts, and exploring the synergistic effects of metal-alloy formation with rare-earth elements. The use of advanced synthesis techniques to generate zeolites with controlled mesoporosity and the strategic incorporation of silanol nests could lead to the development of catalysts with improved catalytic lifetimes and selectivities. Additionally, the identification of the specific roles of elements like gallium and the optimization of their concentrations could further enhance the performance of PDH catalysts. The integration of these strategies may enable the creation of more efficient, durable, and environmentally friendly catalysts for the PDH process, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable chemical synthesis.

金属-沸石催化剂通过在高温下使用氢气流还原金属前体化合物进行合成。MFI和BEA结构的沸石因其独特的结构而受到青睐，该结构由超薄沸石框架和三维互联的介孔组成。这些特征通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及在介孔中的金属纳米粒子高分散来增强支持金属的催化性能。沸石中的硅醇巢的存在，通常在钠自由条件下合成的介孔沸石中被检测到，对于稳定单原子稀有地球元素（REEs）并赋予它们更高的化学势起着关键作用，这使得它们更容易转化为金属REEs，并有助于形成金属合金纳米颗粒。这种稳定化是RE-PT催化剂长期催化寿命的关键。通过生成硅醇巢的方法，如通过去镓的沸石，随后将REEs作为单原子物种引入，可以形成金属合金纳米颗粒，这些颗粒表现出优越的PDH催化性能，包括高活性、选择性和耐久性。在催化剂中加入镧（La）和钇（Y），可以改善铂的分散性和稳定性，从而提高催化活性和选择性。通过在去镓的沸石上合成，然后在其中加入单原子REEs，可以获得具有优良PDH催化性能的合金纳米颗粒。这些性能包括高转化率、高丙烯选择性和极长的催化剂寿命。催化剂中即使在去镓后仍存在的微量镓（Si/Ga=598）表明其可能在催化功能中发挥作用。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能依赖于从硅醇巢的作用和MFI和BEA沸石的有效性中获得的见解，以工程具有改进特性的催化剂，如增强的稳定性和活性，最终导致更高效和环境友好的丙烷到丙烯转换过程。

未来PDH催化剂设计的影响包括优化金属-沸石催化剂的合成方法，通过调整沸石结构、增强催化剂的稳定性和活性，并探索金属合金与稀有地球元素协同作用的效果。通过先进的合成技术控制介孔的尺寸和结构，并战略性地引入硅醇巢，可以促进开发具有改进催化寿命和选择性的催化剂。此外，识别特定元素如镓的作用及其浓度优化，可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的性能。整合这些策略可能使创造更有效、更耐用且更环保的PDH催化剂成为可能，为更广泛的可持续化学合成目标做出贡献。
