<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.</p>
<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods).</p>
<p>Alternatively, when zeolites synthesized under a sodium-free condition were used, there was a small but distinct increase in the catalytic lifetime.</p>
<p>With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid (see Methods and Extended Data Figs. 2, 3).</p>
<p>In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary Video 1).</p>
<p>The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2.</p>

1. The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves impregnating metal precursors, such as platinum (Pt), lanthanum (La), and yttrium (Y), into a mesoporous zeolite support. This is achieved through co-impregnation techniques followed by heating under oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) flows at specific temperatures. The use of mesoporous zeolites, particularly those with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures like MFI zeolites, is favored due to their ability to provide optimal conditions for both reactant and product diffusion and high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The addition of rare earth elements (REEs) like La and Y is aimed at improving the initial PDH activity and catalytic lifetime of the Pt catalysts, although counterintuitively, the study found that the catalytic lifetime was significantly enhanced when these elements were added.

2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH application due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which facilitate efficient diffusion of reactants and products, as well as dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. This structure contributes to the effectiveness of these zeolites in enhancing the catalytic performance of the supported metals. BEA zeolites, with their bicontinuous mesoporous structure, also offer advantages in terms of pore connectivity and size, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of these zeolites allows for a balance between surface area and pore size, optimizing the interaction between metal nanoparticles and the zeolite support. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may leverage these structural features to engineer zeolites with tailored pore sizes and shapes that further enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是将铂（Pt）、镧（La）和钇（Y）等金属前体浸渍到介孔沸石载体中。这通过共浸渍技术和随后在氧气（O2）和氢气（H2）流下的加热来实现。使用如MFI沸石这样的介孔沸石，特别是那些具有微/介孔结构的沸石，被青睐，因为它们能够提供最佳条件，使反应物和产物扩散，并且在介孔内高分散金属纳米颗粒。向铂催化剂中添加稀土元素（REEs）如La和Y旨在提高初始PDH活性和催化寿命，尽管出乎意料的是，研究发现当这些元素被添加时，催化寿命显著增加。

2. MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，主要是由于它们独特的结构特征。MFI沸石具有超薄沸石框架和相互连接的介孔，这促进了反应物和产物的有效扩散，以及金属纳米颗粒在介孔内的高分散。这种结构有助于增强支持金属的催化性能。BEA沸石的双连续介孔结构也提供了优势，在于孔的连通性和大小，这对催化反应是有益的。这些沸石的层次微/介孔结构允许平衡表面积和孔尺寸之间的平衡，优化金属纳米颗粒与沸石支持物之间的相互作用。PDH催化剂设计的未来开发可能利用这些结构特征，工程化沸石以具有定制的孔大小和形状，进一步提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性。
