The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the creation of MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites dominate in PDH applications because of their high surface areas and well-defined pore structures, which efficiently manage the adsorption and desorption of reactants. This enables effective dehydrogenation of propane. The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design is the optimization of these materials to achieve higher performance.
