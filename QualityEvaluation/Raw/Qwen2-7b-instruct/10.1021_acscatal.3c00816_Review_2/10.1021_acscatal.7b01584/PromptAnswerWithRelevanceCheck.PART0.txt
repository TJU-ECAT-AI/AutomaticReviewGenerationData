The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metal species into the zeolite framework. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their unique pore structures and surface properties. These zeolites have well-defined pores that facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, which is crucial for efficient PDH reactions. Their structural characteristics, such as high surface area and uniform pore size, contribute significantly to their effectiveness. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the optimization of metal loading, modification of zeolite topology, and the integration of additional functionalities to enhance activity and selectivity.
