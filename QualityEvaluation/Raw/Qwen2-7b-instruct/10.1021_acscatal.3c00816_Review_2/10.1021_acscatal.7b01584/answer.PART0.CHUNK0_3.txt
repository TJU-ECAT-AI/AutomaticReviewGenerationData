The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating materials with specific topologies, such as MFI and BEA zeolites. These topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics which enhance their performance in the dehydrogenation process. Their effectiveness stems from these structural features, and this suggests implications for future advancements in the design of PDH catalysts.
