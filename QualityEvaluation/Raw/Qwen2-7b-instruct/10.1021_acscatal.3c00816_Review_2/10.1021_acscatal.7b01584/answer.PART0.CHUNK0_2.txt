The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve creating materials with specific topologies, such as MFI and BEA, which are known for their high surface area and pore size distribution. These structural characteristics allow for efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity towards the desired products. This makes MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominant in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design should aim to improve upon these properties.
