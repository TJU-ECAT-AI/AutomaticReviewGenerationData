The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the creation of zeolites with MFI and BEA topologies. These zeolites dominate due to their structural characteristics, including a high surface area and pore size selectivity, which are crucial for the effective dehydrogenation of propane. The positive role of hydrogen in this process on the Pt(111) surface is also highlighted. For future developments in PDH catalyst design, the focus will be on optimizing these properties to improve both activity and stability.

主要合成方法是通过制备具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的金属-沸石催化剂，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起作用。这些沸石之所以占据主导地位，是因为它们的结构特性，如高比表面积和孔径选择性，对有效脱氢丙烷至关重要。氢在Pt(111)表面对该过程的积极作用也被强调。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来开发，重点将放在优化这些性质上，以提高活性和稳定性。
