1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve modifying zeolite structures through various chemical treatments, often focusing on the addition of metal ions to enhance catalytic activity. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique pore structures and high surface areas, which are crucial for efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products during PDH.
