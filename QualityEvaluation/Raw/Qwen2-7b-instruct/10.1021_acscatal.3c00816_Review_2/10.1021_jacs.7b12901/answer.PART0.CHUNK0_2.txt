1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metals into zeolite frameworks through various techniques such as impregnation or co-precipitation. The selection of zeolite topology plays a crucial role in their effectiveness due to the unique properties of different zeolite structures.
2. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications because of their specific pore structures and surface functionalities, which facilitate efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Their effectiveness is attributed to the balance between pore size, shape, and accessibility, as well as the presence of active sites on the zeolite surface.
3. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on enhancing the stability, activity, and selectivity of metal-zeolite catalysts by optimizing the synthesis conditions, modifying the metal loading, or integrating new materials into the zeolite framework to improve the catalytic performance.

1. 研究金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的主要合成方法涉及通过各种技术将金属引入沸石骨架中，如浸渍或共沉淀。不同沸石结构的选择对它们的有效性至关重要，因为它们独特的性质。
2. MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石之所以在PDH应用中占据主导地位，是因为它们特有的孔结构和表面功能，这有助于高效吸附和脱附反应物和产物。它们的有效性归因于孔径、形状和可接近性的平衡，以及沸石表面活性位点的存在。
3. 未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可以集中在提高金属-沸石催化剂的稳定性、活性和选择性上，通过优化合成条件、调整金属负载或在沸石框架中整合新材料，以改善催化性能。
