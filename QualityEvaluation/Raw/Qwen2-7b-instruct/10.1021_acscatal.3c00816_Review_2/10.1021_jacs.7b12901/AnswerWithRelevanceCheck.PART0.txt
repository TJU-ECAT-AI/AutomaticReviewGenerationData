          The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the incorporation of metals into MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites dominate due to their unique structural characteristics which enhance the catalytic activity in PDH reactions. The effectiveness of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation process efficiently. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design suggest focusing on refining the metal-zeolite interactions, improving stability, and enhancing selectivity to produce higher value products.
