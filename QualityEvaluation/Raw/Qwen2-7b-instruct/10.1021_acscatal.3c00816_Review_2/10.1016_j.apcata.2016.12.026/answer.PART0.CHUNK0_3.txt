[1] "A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method."
[2] "The resulting materials were used to disperse Pt, Sn particles and further studied the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area."
[4] "Such a modification of support not only enhanced the interaction of the Sn-support, but also stabilized the oxidation state of Sn species, leading to the improvement of catalytic activity and stability."
[5] "The best catalytic performances were obtained on PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% of magnesium, showing a higher than 98% selectivity toward propene at a 38.0% conversion of propane even after 6 h reaction."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation reactions involve the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites are favored due to their unique mesoporous structure, high surface area, and regular pore sizes. Their structural characteristics enable efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the ordered nature of these zeolites ensures optimal distribution of metal particles, enhancing the catalytic activity. The implication for future developments in PDH catalyst design is the continued optimization of zeolite structures to improve metal dispersion and stability, as well as the exploration of novel topologies that could offer superior catalytic performance. The Mg-incorporated SBA-15 materials, synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, demonstrated superior Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area compared to impregnation methods. This led to enhanced interaction between Sn and support, stabilization of Sn oxidation states, and improved catalytic activity and stability. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% magnesium showed the best performance, achieving a 98% propene selectivity at a 38.0% propane conversion after 6 hours of reaction.
