Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it is evident that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structural characteristics. MFI zeolites feature a cubic structure with channels and cages, while BEA zeolites have a square-ring topology. These zeolites are chosen for PDH reactions because they offer high surface areas, well-defined pore structures, and tunable acidity. The high surface areas enhance the dispersion of metal species, which is critical for efficient catalysis. The ordered pore structures allow for the precise control of metal particle sizes, reducing sintering and enhancing the stability of the catalyst. The acidity of the zeolite, provided by the presence of acidic sites, is crucial for the dehydrogenation reactions, but it also needs to be modulated to prevent unwanted side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition. The use of Mg in the synthesis of SBA-15 zeolites helps to stabilize the oxidation states of tin species, facilitating the migration of coke deposits from active metals to the support, thereby improving the catalytic activity and stability. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on fine-tuning the interaction between metal species and zeolite support, optimizing acidity, and enhancing metal dispersion to achieve higher conversion and selectivity towards propene.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，可以看出MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在该应用中占主导地位，这归功于它们的独特结构特性。MFI沸石具有立方结构，带有通道和笼子，而BEA沸石具有四环拓扑结构。这些沸石之所以被选用于PDH反应，是因为它们提供高比表面积、定义明确的孔结构和可调酸性。高比表面积可以增强金属物种的分散，这对于高效的催化作用至关重要。有序的孔结构允许对金属颗粒大小进行精确控制，减少结块并提高催化剂稳定性。沸石的酸性，由存在的酸性位点提供，对于脱氢反应至关重要，但需要适当调节以防止不希望的副反应，如裂解和焦炭沉积。在合成SBA-15沸石时加入Mg有助于稳定锡物种的氧化状态，促进焦炭沉积从活性金属转移到支撑物，从而改善催化活性和稳定性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在精细调整金属物种与支撑物之间的相互作用，优化酸性和增强金属分散，以实现更高的转化率和丙烯选择性。
