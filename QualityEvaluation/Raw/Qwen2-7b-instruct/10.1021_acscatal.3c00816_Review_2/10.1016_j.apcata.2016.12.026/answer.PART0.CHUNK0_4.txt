<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>High-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 was prepared by a facile one-pot synthesis method.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Mg modified the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions of Pt, Sn species and support.</p>
<p>The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support.</p>
<p>Catalysts with appropriate magnesium incorporated showed significant improvements in catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The physicochemical properties of the supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD and TG-DTA techniques.</p>
<p>Mg/SBA-15 sample was synthesized using the traditional impregnation method as the referential sample.</p>
<p>The differences between these samples on structure-activity relationships were identified and discussed.</p>
<p>It was found that incorporation of appropriate amounts of Mg promoted the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles and facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the support.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>Improved propene yield can be achieved by adding alkaline or alkaline earth metals to the catalyst formulation for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the additive promoter might clog the mesoporous channel thus decrease the surface area and pore size of SBA-15.</p>
<p>The introduction of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal in the published literature was mostly loaded through the post-synthesis procedure.</p>
<p>In the present paper, we prepared the Mg-incorporated SBA-15 with different magnesium loadings by one-pot method.</p>
<p>This can provide us with important information to identify the influence of magnesium promoter on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic properties of PtSn/SBA-15 in the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>It was noted that the surfaces of PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM sample seemed to be covered by dark clouds, which could be caused by the unequally dispersion of Mg species and be further responsible for the decline in both pore volume and surface area.</p>
<p>The introduction of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal in the published literature was mostly loaded through the post-synthesis procedure.</p>
<p>However, the one-pot synthesis method was better able to maintain the mesoporous structure of silica materials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the addition of Mg promoted metal dispersion and decreased the acidity of the catalyst, inhibiting the side reactions, so a better catalyst performance was obtained.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was widely reported that two types of Pt active sites existed in the PtSn catalyst.</p>
<p>Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized.</p>
<p>As for PtSn/SBA-15 sample, some metal particles were agglomerated due to the weak interaction among Pt, Sn and support.</p>
<p>However, with the continuous addition of Mg and the impregnation method both led to a deterioration of the ordered pore structure and decreased the surface area of catalyst, which were damage to the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>For the spent PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, some porous channels were blocked by the deposited carbonaceous species, resulting in the activity loss.</p>
<p>There was no obvious carbon species was observed on the spent Mg-modified catalysts, and most of the metallic particles were confined within the channels of the porous.</p>
<p>The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance.</p>
<p>These phenomena suggested that the presence of Mg in the catalyst promoted the migration of the coke deposits from the metal sites to the support.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more coke formation was formed since excess introduction of Mg resulted in decreased of these M1 active sites.</p>

Analyzing the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their unique structural characteristics. The MFI topology offers a regular hexagonal pore system, providing a high surface area and a uniform pore size, which is crucial for efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. The BEA topology, with its cubic pores, also offers a high surface area and a regular pore structure, facilitating optimal reactivity and selectivity. Their ordered mesoporous structures allow for precise control over the size and shape of pores, which is essential for the effective confinement and stabilization of metal nanoparticles, enhancing their dispersion and preventing agglomeration. This leads to improved catalytic activity and stability.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their ability to promote the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, stabilize the oxidation states of metal promoters, and enhance the interactions between the metal sites and the zeolite framework. The presence of alkaline or alkaline earth metals, such as magnesium, can further improve the dispersion of metals and stabilize the zeolite framework, thereby reducing the risk of sintering and enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to ensure the formation of well-defined mesoporous structures and achieving uniform distribution of metal components. The use of one-pot synthesis methods, as demonstrated in this study, can be particularly advantageous as they maintain the mesoporous structure and allow for better control over the incorporation of metal promoters. Additionally, exploring the effects of different metal combinations and their interactions with the zeolite framework could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH reactions.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the potential to achieve higher propene yields, improved stability, and reduced coke formation, ultimately leading to more cost-effective and environmentally friendly processes for propane dehydrogenation.

分析用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法显示，MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在该应用中占据主导地位，这是由于它们的独特结构特性。MFI拓扑提供了一个规则的六边形孔系统，提供了高表面积和均匀的孔径，这对于有效吸附和扩散反应物和产物至关重要。BEA拓扑结构，其立方孔，也提供了高表面积和规则的孔结构，促进了最佳的活性和选择性。它们的有序介孔结构允许精确控制孔的大小和形状，这对于有效容纳和稳定金属纳米粒子至关重要，从而增强了它们的分散性和防止聚集。这导致了增强的催化活性和稳定性。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性归因于它们促进金属纳米粒子的分散、稳定金属促进剂的氧化状态以及增强金属位点与沸石骨架之间的相互作用的能力。碱或碱土金属的存在，如镁，可以进一步提高金属的分散度和稳定沸石框架，从而减少结焦的风险并增强催化剂的整体稳定性。

未来PDH催化剂设计的发展应集中在优化合成方法以确保形成清晰定义的介孔结构，并实现金属组分的均匀分布。采用一步合成方法，如本研究中所展示的，特别有利，因为它们保持了介孔结构，并允许更好地控制金属促进剂的掺入。此外，探索不同的金属组合及其与沸石骨架的作用，可能会导致开发更高效、选择性更强的PDH反应催化剂。

未来PDH催化剂设计的潜在影响包括实现更高的丙烯产率、改善稳定性并减少焦炭形成，最终导致更经济和环保的丙烷脱氢过程。
