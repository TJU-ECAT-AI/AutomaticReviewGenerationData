1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions primarily use synthesis methods involving the encapsulation of metal sites within N-doped carbon materials. This strategy enhances the stability of metal species by confining them in a protective matrix, which prevents aggregation and degradation during the catalytic process. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), serve as suitable precursors for this purpose due to their ability to provide a stable coordination environment for metal ions. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications because of their unique pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, and promote efficient catalytic activity. Their effectiveness stems from the ability to create spatially isolated metal sites, which are crucial for the PDH reaction mechanism. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the optimization of metal loading, the exploration of new metal-nitrogen-doped carbon combinations, and the improvement of catalyst stability and selectivity.
