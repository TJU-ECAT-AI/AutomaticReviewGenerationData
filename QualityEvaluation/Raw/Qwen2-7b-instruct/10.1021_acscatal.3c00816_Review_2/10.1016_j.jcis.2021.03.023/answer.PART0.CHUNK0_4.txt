2.1. Material synthesis
Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [37] ,[38] .
For reference, ZnCo-ZIF sample was synthesized as similar to the above process without the addition of silicalite-1.
CoOx@NC/S-1 (4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 C for 2 h with a 5 C min1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 C min1.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the preparation of a metal-zeolite precursor followed by carbonization and calcination. Silicalite-1 zeolite plays a crucial role in this process. Its MFI topology contributes to the formation of spatially isolated metal sites, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The BEA topology is not mentioned in this context, but it is known for its potential in heterogeneous catalysis due to its unique pore structure and high surface area. The effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH reactions is attributed to their ability to isolate metal sites, preventing aggregation and maintaining high activity and selectivity over prolonged operation. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on optimizing the metal loading, modifying the zeolite framework, and exploring the use of alternative zeolite topologies to further enhance performance.

主要的金属-沸石催化剂合成方法用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，包括制备金属-沸石前体，随后进行碳化和煅烧。硅铝沸石在这一过程中起着关键作用。其MFI拓扑结构有助于形成空间隔离的金属位点，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。BEA拓扑结构未在此上下文中提及，但因其独特的孔隙结构和高表面积而被认为适用于异相催化。这些催化剂在PDH反应中的有效性归因于它们能够隔离金属位点，防止聚集并维持长时间操作时的高活性和选择性。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化金属负载、修改沸石骨架以及探索使用其他沸石拓扑结构来进一步提高性能上。
