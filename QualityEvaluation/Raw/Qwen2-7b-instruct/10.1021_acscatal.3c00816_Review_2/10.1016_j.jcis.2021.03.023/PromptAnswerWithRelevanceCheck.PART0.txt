1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions primarily use synthesis methods involving the encapsulation of metal sites within N-doped carbon materials. This strategy enhances the stability of metal species by confining them in a protective matrix, which prevents aggregation and degradation during the catalytic process. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), serve as suitable precursors for this purpose due to their ability to provide a stable coordination environment for metal ions. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications because of their unique pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, and promote efficient catalytic activity. Their effectiveness stems from the ability to create spatially isolated metal sites, which are crucial for the PDH reaction mechanism. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the optimization of metal loading, the exploration of new metal-nitrogen-doped carbon combinations, and the improvement of catalyst stability and selectivity.

1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs). These frameworks are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which are utilized as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in nitrogen-doped carbon materials through a pyrolysis process. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their specific pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the confinement of isolated metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers. This strategy enhances the stability of metal species, prevents their aggregation, and ensures selective catalysis for PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing the synthesis methods, improving the confinement of metal sites, and exploring alternative topologies or materials that might offer superior catalytic properties.

2. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 followed by calcination in air atmosphere, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH reactions. It achieves a propane conversion of 40% with a propene selectivity of 97%, and maintains significant propane conversion even after a 10-hour PDH reaction at 600°C. This indicates the effectiveness of the active site isolation strategy employed in the catalyst design, leading to improved stability and selectivity for PDH.

3. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are widely utilized in the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions due to their unique structural characteristics. ZIFs consist of metal-containing nodes connected by organic linkers, which allows for the formation of metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon materials. These materials are considered suitable precursors because they enable the creation of isolated metal sites that are confined within the nitrogen-doped carbon layers. This confinement strategy enhances the stability of metal species, reduces aggregation, and promotes selective catalysis, contributing to the effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH reactions.

4. To understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, researchers conducted in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy investigations of both propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation). These studies provided insights into the active sites and the reaction pathway for PDH, elucidating the mechanisms involved in the conversion of propane to propene over the catalyst.
