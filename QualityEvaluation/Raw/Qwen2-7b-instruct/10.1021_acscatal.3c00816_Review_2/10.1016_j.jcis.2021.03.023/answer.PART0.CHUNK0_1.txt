1. The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve the use of zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs). These frameworks are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which are utilized as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in nitrogen-doped carbon materials through a pyrolysis process. The MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application due to their specific pore structures and high surface areas, which facilitate the confinement of isolated metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers. This strategy enhances the stability of metal species, prevents their aggregation, and ensures selective catalysis for PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design could focus on optimizing the synthesis methods, improving the confinement of metal sites, and exploring alternative topologies or materials that might offer superior catalytic properties.

2. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 followed by calcination in air atmosphere, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH reactions. It achieves a propane conversion of 40% with a propene selectivity of 97%, and maintains significant propane conversion even after a 10-hour PDH reaction at 600°C. This indicates the effectiveness of the active site isolation strategy employed in the catalyst design, leading to improved stability and selectivity for PDH.

3. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are widely utilized in the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions due to their unique structural characteristics. ZIFs consist of metal-containing nodes connected by organic linkers, which allows for the formation of metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon materials. These materials are considered suitable precursors because they enable the creation of isolated metal sites that are confined within the nitrogen-doped carbon layers. This confinement strategy enhances the stability of metal species, reduces aggregation, and promotes selective catalysis, contributing to the effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH reactions.

4. To understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, researchers conducted in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy investigations of both propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation). These studies provided insights into the active sites and the reaction pathway for PDH, elucidating the mechanisms involved in the conversion of propane to propene over the catalyst.

1. 近期，通过使用金属有机框架（MOFs）的子类，即含有金属节点和有机连接剂的锌咪唑骨架（ZIFs），在氮掺杂碳材料中限制孤立金属位点的方法，在异丁烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法得到了广泛应用。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石由于其特定的孔结构和高表面积，在此应用中占据主导地位。这些特性促进了金属位点在氮掺杂碳层内的限制，提高了金属物种的稳定性，防止了它们的聚集，并确保了选择性的催化作用。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能集中在优化合成方法、改善金属位点的限制以及探索可能提供更优越催化性能的其他拓扑结构或材料。

2. 通过在氮气气氛下对含锌/钴双金属ZIF负载在硅铝酸盐上的预处理样品进行热解后，在空气中进行4小时的煅烧制备出的CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂，展示了出色的PDH反应性能。该催化剂实现了40%的丙烷转化率和97%的丙烯选择性，并且在600°C下连续10小时的PDH反应后，丙烷转化率并未显著下降。这表明采用的活性位点隔离策略在催化剂设计中的有效性，提高了稳定性和选择性，从而在PDH反应中表现出了优异的性能。

3. 锌咪唑骨架（ZIFs）在PDH反应中被广泛用于金属-沸石催化剂的合成，主要得益于它们独特的结构特征。ZIFs由金属节点与有机连接剂组成，允许在氮掺杂碳材料内形成金属位点。这些材料被视为合适的前体，因为它们能够创建被限制在氮掺杂碳层内的孤立金属位点。这种限制策略增强了金属物种的稳定性，减少了聚集，并促进了选择性的催化作用，为PDH反应提供了有效的催化剂。

4. 为了理解CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂上的PDH机制，研究人员利用原位傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）技术对丙烷脱氢及其微观逆过程（丙烯加氢）进行了研究。这些研究提供了关于活性位点和PDH转化机制的见解，揭示了丙烷转化为丙烯过程中催化剂所涉及的机制。
