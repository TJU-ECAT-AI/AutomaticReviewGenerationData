[1] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[4] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[5] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[6] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[7] "As is well-known, zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which have been considered as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in N-doped carbon by pyrolysis."
[8] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction."
[9] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[10] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions primarily use MFI and BEA topological zeolites because of their unique pore structures and high surface areas. These characteristics enable the precise confinement of metal species, which is crucial for PDH reactions. MFI zeolites have a cubic framework with channels that are suitable for the passage of propane molecules, facilitating dehydrogenation. BEA zeolites, with their larger cages, offer more space for metal species and can accommodate larger molecules, enhancing their reactivity in PDH. Their effectiveness in PDH applications lies in the ability to maintain high activity and selectivity, particularly for propene production. Future developments in PDH catalyst design might focus on refining the zeolite framework to optimize metal dispersion and improve stability, as well as exploring new metal combinations that could further enhance performance.

2. The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by providing a stable, ordered environment for metal species. The zeolite framework ensures that metal clusters are spatially isolated, preventing aggregation and maintaining their catalytic properties. The large surface area and pore size facilitate efficient interaction with reactants and products, enhancing the reaction kinetics. Additionally, the ability to tune the metal loading and distribution through the zeolite matrix allows for customization of the catalyst to match specific PDH reaction requirements. The implications for future developments include the potential for creating more robust catalysts with improved selectivity and longer operational lifetimes, as well as the exploration of novel zeolite structures that could further enhance the efficiency of PDH processes.
