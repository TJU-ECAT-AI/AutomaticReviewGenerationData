[1] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[2] "Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction."
[3] "However, the propane conversion was severely decreased due to the high surface free energy of the isolated Co sites."
[4] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[5] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."
[6] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction."
[7] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[8] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
[9] "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[10] "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

1. Metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions primarily employ MFI and BEA topological zeolites because of their unique pore structures and high surface areas, which are advantageous for the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Their crystal structures enable the creation of spatially isolated active sites, crucial for achieving high propene selectivity and stability during the PDH process. These factors contribute to their effectiveness in enhancing the catalytic performance for PDH reactions.

2. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design involve focusing on the synthesis of catalysts that maintain stable and isolated active sites, particularly in N-doped carbon materials. By doing so, researchers can optimize the selectivity towards propene and extend the operational stability of the catalysts. The use of advanced characterization techniques like in situ FT-IR and theoretical modeling could further elucidate the reaction mechanisms, guiding the rational design of more efficient and sustainable PDH catalysts.

1. 近年来，金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中主要使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，因为它们独特的孔结构和高比表面积，对反应物和产物的吸附与解吸非常有利。其晶体结构允许形成空间隔离的活性位点，对于实现PDH反应中的高丙烯选择性和稳定性至关重要。这些因素有助于提高PDH反应的催化性能。

2. 对于未来PDH催化剂设计的影响包括专注于合成保持稳定且孤立活性位点的催化剂，特别是在氮掺杂碳材料中。通过这样做，研究人员可以优化丙烯的选择性，并延长催化剂的操作稳定性。利用先进的表征技术如原位FT-IR和理论建模，可以进一步揭示反应机理，指导更高效、更可持续PDH催化剂的理性设计。
