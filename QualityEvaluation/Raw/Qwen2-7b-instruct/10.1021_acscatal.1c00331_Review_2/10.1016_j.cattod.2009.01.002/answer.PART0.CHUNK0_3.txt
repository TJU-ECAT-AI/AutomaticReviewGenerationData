3. "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
4. "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
5. "However, it is also evident from this study that the amount of coke formed over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW is much higher than that on Pt-SBA-15-IW."
6. "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."
7. "This work evaluates the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in Pt-SBA-15 and on DHP activity, selectivity to propylene, the degree of coking and catalyst stability."
8. "Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation than larger Pt particles however, the former are less selective and stable than the latter."
9. "Differently, the drain-off effect, that has been widely ignored, was first proposed by Lieske et al. and it is discussed in the context of particle ensemble effect."
10. "Consequently, Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation compared to Pt-SBA-15-IW which contains larger Pt particles."
11. "However, the possibility of the promoting effect of Sn on the formation of coke cannot be completely ruled out."
12. "But these observations can be explained by a combination of electronic and drain-off effects rather than by the electronic effect alone."
13. "In Pt-Sn-SBA-15, Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously."
14. "In other words, Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. The PDH process is characterized by the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, converting them into propylene. However, the process can lead to the formation of coke, which is a byproduct that deactivates the catalyst. The coke formation is influenced by the energy barriers involved in the conversion processes, the pattern of coke accumulation, the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and the potential for graphitization. These effects can significantly impact the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.

The hydrogen cofeeding can alter the energy landscape of the reaction, potentially reducing the energy barriers for coke formation. This can lead to faster coke deposition on the catalyst surface, affecting the reaction kinetics and reducing the catalytic activity. The pattern of coke accumulation can vary depending on the feedstock composition and the operational parameters of the PDH process. Efficient management of the hydrogen cofeeding can help maintain a balance that prevents excessive coke formation, preserving the catalyst's activity and stability.

Acid sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the PDH process, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane molecules. The conversion of these acid sites due to hydrogen cofeeding can influence the selectivity of the process. If the hydrogen cofeeding is optimized, it can enhance the selectivity to propylene by modulating the acid site distribution and reactivity. This optimization can contribute to higher yields of propylene and improved process efficiency.

Graphitization refers to the transformation of the catalyst surface into a graphite-like structure, which can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. Hydrogen cofeeding can mitigate this issue by maintaining a stable surface environment that prevents excessive graphitization. By controlling the hydrogen cofeeding, it is possible to reduce the risk of graphitization and preserve the catalyst's performance over time.

In conclusion, the hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process plays a critical role in managing coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Optimal control of hydrogen cofeeding can lead to improved process efficiency, higher propylene yields, and longer catalyst life. However, achieving this balance requires careful consideration of various factors, including the feedstock composition, operational conditions, and the specific characteristics of the catalyst used in the PDH process.
