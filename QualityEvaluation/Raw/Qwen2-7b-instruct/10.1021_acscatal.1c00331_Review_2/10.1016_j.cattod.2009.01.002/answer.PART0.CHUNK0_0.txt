[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity,selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating micro- balance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
[3] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IWthan onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[4] "However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
[5] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles. Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by changing energy barriers, altering coke accumulation patterns, affecting acid site conversions, and influencing graphitization. These effects lead to variations in the overall process efficiency and performance. Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding can potentially reduce the energy required for cracking reactions, thereby decreasing the formation of coke. It also influences the stability of the catalyst by impacting the accumulation of coke precursors and their conversion into coke. Acid site conversions and graphitization can also be affected, which in turn impacts the selectivity and yield of desired products. The implications of these effects include improved process efficiency, reduced catalyst deactivation, and enhanced selectivity to high-value products.

Answer: Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, influencing process efficiency and performance. It can reduce coke formation, improve catalyst stability, and enhance product selectivity.
