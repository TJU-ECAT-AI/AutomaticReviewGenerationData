[1] "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating micro- balance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
[2] "Based on these results, the following main conclusions can be drawn: Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn- SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."
[3] "Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter. However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
[4] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles. Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

1. The TEOM, coupled with an online GC, was utilized to assess the catalysts' activity, selectivity, coking, and stability simultaneously.

2. Sn enhances Pt dispersion through alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW, leading to the creation of smaller Pt particles in comparison to Pt-SBA-15-IW, as confirmed by TEM, XRD, and H2-chemisorption.

3. The higher surface roughness of the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW particles results in greater propane conversion and coke formation, although the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation remains uncertain.

4. The Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst displays superior selectivity for propylene and enhanced catalyst stability due to the reduced adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in the bimetallic particles, creating a draining-off effect that prevents coking.

1. 通过耦合在线GC的TEOM，同时研究了催化剂的活性、选择性、结焦和稳定性。

2. Sn通过合金形成在Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW中提高了Pt的分散度，导致与Pt-SBA-15-IW相比，形成的Pt颗粒更小。这一结论通过TEM、XRD和H2-化学吸附得到证实。

3. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW颗粒较高的表面粗糙度导致更高的丙烷转化率和结焦量，但Sn促进结焦的作用尚未完全排除。

4. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂由于双金属粒子表面Pt位点对烃类的吸附能力较弱，展现出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的催化剂稳定性，形成了防止结焦的排泄效应。
