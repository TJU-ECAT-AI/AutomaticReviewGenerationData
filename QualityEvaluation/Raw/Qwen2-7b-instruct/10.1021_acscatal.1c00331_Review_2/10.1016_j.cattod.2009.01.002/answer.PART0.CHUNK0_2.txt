[1] "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
[2] "Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."
[3] "Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter."
[4] "However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
[5] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."
[6] "Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

1. The surface Pt sites' activity properties vary based on the surface roughness of the particles, which is influenced by the type of support material.
2. The electronic properties of Pt sites are modified by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles, affecting their catalytic performance.
3. Smaller Pt particles, like those in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW, exhibit higher surface roughness, leading to enhanced activity and coke formation.
4. While Sn might promote coke formation, its effect is not fully excluded from consideration.
5. The Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst shows improved propylene selectivity and stability due to the reduced adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on its surface Pt sites.
6. This creates a draining-off effect that helps maintain the active sites free from coke accumulation.

1. 催化剂表面Pt位点的活性性质因颗粒表面粗糙度的不同而不同，这取决于支撑材料的类型。
2. PtSn合金粒子中的Pt位点的电子性质由Sn修改，影响其催化性能。
3. 小型Pt颗粒，如在Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW中，表现出更高的表面粗糙度，导致活性增强和焦炭形成增加。
4. 虽然Sn可能促进焦炭形成，但其效应并未完全排除考虑。
5.Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂由于其表面Pt位点对烃类吸附力减弱，显示出更好的丙烯选择性和稳定性。
6. 这种排水效果有助于保持活性位点不受焦炭积累的影响。
