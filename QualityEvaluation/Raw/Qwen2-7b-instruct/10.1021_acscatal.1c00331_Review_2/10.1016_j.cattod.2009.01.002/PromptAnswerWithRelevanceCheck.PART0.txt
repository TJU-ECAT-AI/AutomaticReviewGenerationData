[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity,selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating micro- balance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
[3] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IWthan onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[4] "However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
[5] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles. Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by changing energy barriers, altering coke accumulation patterns, affecting acid site conversions, and influencing graphitization. These effects lead to variations in the overall process efficiency and performance. Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding can potentially reduce the energy required for cracking reactions, thereby decreasing the formation of coke. It also influences the stability of the catalyst by impacting the accumulation of coke precursors and their conversion into coke. Acid site conversions and graphitization can also be affected, which in turn impacts the selectivity and yield of desired products. The implications of these effects include improved process efficiency, reduced catalyst deactivation, and enhanced selectivity to high-value products.

Answer: Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, influencing process efficiency and performance. It can reduce coke formation, improve catalyst stability, and enhance product selectivity.

[1] "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating micro- balance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
[2] "Based on these results, the following main conclusions can be drawn: Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn- SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."
[3] "Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter. However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."

3. "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
4.

5. "However, it is also evident from this study that the amount of coke formed over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW is much higher than that on Pt-SBA-15-IW."
6. "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."

8. "Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation than larger Pt particles however, the former are less selective and stable than the latter."
9. "Differently, the drain-off effect, that has been widely ignored, was first proposed by Lieske et al. and it is discussed in the context of particle ensemble effect."
10. "Consequently, Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation compared to Pt-SBA-15-IW which contains larger Pt particles."
11. "However, the possibility of the promoting effect of Sn on the formation of coke cannot be completely ruled out."

14. "In other words, Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. The PDH process is characterized by the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, converting them into propylene. However, the process can lead to the formation of coke, which is a byproduct that deactivates the catalyst. The coke formation is influenced by the energy barriers involved in the conversion processes, the pattern of coke accumulation, the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and the potential for graphitization. These effects can significantly impact the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.

The hydrogen cofeeding can alter the energy landscape of the reaction, potentially reducing the energy barriers for coke formation. This can lead to faster coke deposition on the catalyst surface, affecting the reaction kinetics and reducing the catalytic activity. The pattern of coke accumulation can vary depending on the feedstock composition and the operational parameters of the PDH process. Efficient management of the hydrogen cofeeding can help maintain a balance that prevents excessive coke formation, preserving the catalyst's activity and stability.

Acid sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the PDH process, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane molecules. The conversion of these acid sites due to hydrogen cofeeding can influence the selectivity of the process. If the hydrogen cofeeding is optimized, it can enhance the selectivity to propylene by modulating the acid site distribution and reactivity. This optimization can contribute to higher yields of propylene and improved process efficiency.

Graphitization refers to the transformation of the catalyst surface into a graphite-like structure, which can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. Hydrogen cofeeding can mitigate this issue by maintaining a stable surface environment that prevents excessive graphitization. By controlling the hydrogen cofeeding, it is possible to reduce the risk of graphitization and preserve the catalyst's performance over time.

In conclusion, the hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process plays a critical role in managing coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Optimal control of hydrogen cofeeding can lead to improved process efficiency, higher propylene yields, and longer catalyst life. However, achieving this balance requires careful consideration of various factors, including the feedstock composition, operational conditions, and the specific characteristics of the catalyst used in the PDH process.

氢助燃剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。PDH过程的特点是去除丙烷分子中的氢，将其转化为丙烯。然而，该过程可能导致焦炭的生成，这是会降低催化剂活性的副产品。焦炭的形成受到转化过程中涉及的能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、催化剂表面酸性位点的转化和可能的石墨化的影响。这些效应可以显著影响PDH过程的整体效率和性能。

氢助燃剂的添加可以改变反应的能量景观，可能降低焦炭形成的能量壁垒。这可能导致催化剂表面上焦炭沉积速度加快，影响反应动力学并降低催化活性。焦炭沉积模式根据所用原料的组成和PDH过程的操作参数而变化。通过有效管理氢助燃剂的使用，可以防止过度焦炭形成，从而保持催化剂活性和稳定性。

催化剂表面的酸性位点在PDH过程中起着关键作用，促进丙烷分子的脱氢。氢助燃剂的转化可以影响过程的选择性。如果氢助燃剂的使用得到优化，则可以通过调整酸性位点分布和活性来增强丙烯选择性，从而提高丙烯产量和过程效率。

石墨化是指催化剂表面转化为类似石墨的结构，这会导致催化活性下降。氢助燃剂的使用可以减少这种风险，通过维持稳定表面环境，防止过度石墨化。通过精确控制氢助燃剂的使用，有可能减少石墨化的风险，并保持催化剂的长期性能。

总之，氢助燃剂在PDH过程中的使用对于管理焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制具有重要影响。通过精确控制氢助燃剂的使用，可以实现更高的丙烯产量、改进的过程效率和更长的催化剂寿命。然而，要实现这一平衡，需要仔细考虑各种因素，包括原料组成、操作条件和用于PDH过程的特定催化剂特性。
