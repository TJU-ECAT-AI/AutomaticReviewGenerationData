3. "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
4. "Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."
5. "Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter."
6. "However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
7. "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

1. Surface Pt sites' activity properties differ based on the surface roughness of the particles.
2. Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt sites in bimetallic PtSn particles.
3. Smaller Pt particles lead to higher propane conversion and coke formation due to increased surface roughness.
4. The effect of Sn on coke formation is not fully excluded.
5. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher propylene selectivity and stability due to reduced hydrocarbon adsorption on Pt sites.

1. 颗粒表面粗糙度不同导致表面Pt位点的活性性质不同。
2. Sn修改了Pt位点在双金属PtSn颗粒中的电子性质。
3. 小型Pt颗粒导致更高的丙烷转化率和焦炭形成，因为表面粗糙度增加。
4. Sn对焦炭形成的促进作用尚未完全排除。
5. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW由于在Pt-Sn合金颗粒上的烃吸附减弱，表现出更高的丙烯选择性和稳定性。
