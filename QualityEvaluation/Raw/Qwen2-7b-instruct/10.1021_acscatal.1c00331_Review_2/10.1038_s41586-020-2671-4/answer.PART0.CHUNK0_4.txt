The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by lowering the energy barriers for coke deposition on the Pt surface. This leads to faster coke accumulation and a shorter catalyst lifetime. The acid site conversions are also influenced, potentially leading to a shift in product distribution towards less desirable byproducts. Graphitization, a process where coke transforms into graphite, is also accelerated under hydrogen-rich conditions, further deteriorating catalyst performance. These effects reduce the overall process efficiency and performance, necessitating the development of catalysts that can withstand hydrogen-induced coke formation and maintain their activity over extended periods.

The presence of rare-earth elements (REEs) in the catalyst supports, particularly lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y), significantly improves the PDH catalysts' lifetime. The REEs, when present as single atomic species, enable the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles with platinum (Pt), which are highly active and selective for PDH reactions. This is facilitated by the silanol nests in the zeolite support, which stabilize the REEs in a single atomic form, making it easier for them to react with Pt under hydrogen reduction conditions.

The PtLa and PtY bimetallic catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity, along with slow catalyst deactivation. This is attributed to the modification of Pt's geometric and electronic properties due to the larger atomic size and lower electron negativity of La compared to Y. This results in enhanced catalytic performance. The role of gallium (Ga) in the catalysts is minimal, with the alloy formation being the primary factor affecting the catalyst's performance.

Efficient regeneration methods, such as the oxychlorination process used for PtSn/alumina catalysts, are crucial for the industrial application of zeolite-supported catalysts. This allows for the restoration of catalyst activity, maintaining the efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的供给对焦油形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了影响，降低了焦油沉积在铂表面的能量壁垒，导致焦油积累速度加快和催化剂寿命缩短。酸基团的转化也受到影响，可能导致产品分布向更不理想的副产品倾斜。在氢含量丰富的条件下，焦油转化为石墨的过程加速，进一步恶化了催化剂性能，从而降低了整个过程的效率和性能，需要开发能够抵抗氢引起的焦油形成并保持活动性的催化剂。

稀土元素（REE）的存在，特别是镧（La）和钇（Y），显著提高了PDH催化剂的使用寿命。当REE以单原子形式存在时，它们与铂（Pt）形成互金属合金纳米颗粒，这些合金纳米颗粒具有高活性和选择性，对于PDH反应非常有效。这是由在沸石支持物中发现的硅醇巢所促进的，这些硅醇巢稳定了REE的单原子形式，使得它们更容易在氢还原条件下与Pt反应。

PtLa和PtY双金属催化剂表现出高初始丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，并且催化剂降解缓慢。这归因于La比Y具有更大的原子大小和更低的电子亲和力，这修改了铂的几何和电子性质。这导致催化性能增强。镓（Ga）在催化剂中的作用相对较小，合金形成是影响催化剂性能的主要因素。

高效再生方法，如用于PtSn/氧化铝催化剂的氧氯化过程，对于沸石支持催化剂的工业应用至关重要。这允许恢复催化剂活性，维持PDH过程的效率和可持续性。
