[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[3] "The Pt3Y intermetallic compound nanoparticles formed on the mesoporous zeolite display a distinctive H2 sorption behaviour (see Extended Data Table1)."
[4] "The rapid deactivation behaviour of the PtLa/mz catalyst was similar to that of the monometallic Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite (Pt/mz), consistent with the hydrogen chemisorption property of the PtLa/mz sample, indicating that the supported Pt existed entirely as monometallic nanoparticles and that no alloy with La was present (Extended Data Table1)."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, hydrogen cofeeding helps in overcoming energy barriers associated with coke formation, thus mitigating coke accumulation. This is because hydrogen can react with coke precursors, preventing their aggregation and growth. Secondly, hydrogen assists in converting acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can otherwise contribute to coke formation. By maintaining a high hydrogen partial pressure, the catalyst surface remains active, reducing the risk of coke buildup. Thirdly, hydrogen promotes a more uniform distribution of reactants and products across the catalyst surface, enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products, and improving the overall efficiency of the PDH process. Lastly, hydrogen can prevent the graphitization of the catalyst, which is a common issue in high-temperature reactions, by acting as a nucleation inhibitor. This ensures that the catalyst maintains its structure and activity over prolonged periods, contributing to improved catalyst stability and performance.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共供给对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。首先，氢气有助于克服与焦炭形成相关的能量壁垒，从而减少焦炭积累。这是因为氢气可以与焦炭前体反应，防止它们的聚集和增长。其次，氢气帮助转化催化剂表面的酸性位点，否则这些位点可能会促进焦炭形成。通过保持较高的氢分压，催化剂表面保持活性，降低焦炭堆积的风险。第三，氢气促进反应物和产物在催化剂表面的更均匀分布，增强反应物和产物的扩散，提高PDH过程的整体效率。最后，氢气可以通过作为核化抑制剂来防止催化剂的石墨化，这是高温反应中常见的问题。这确保了催化剂保持其结构和活性，延长了催化剂的使用寿命，从而提高了其稳定性和性能。
