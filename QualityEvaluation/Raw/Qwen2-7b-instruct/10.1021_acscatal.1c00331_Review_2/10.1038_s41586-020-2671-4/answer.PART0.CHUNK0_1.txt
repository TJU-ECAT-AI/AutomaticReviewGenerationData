[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "We believe that the silanol nests could stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds16."
[3] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by enabling the formation of PtLa and PtY intermetallic nanoparticles. This is achieved through the stabilization of single atomic REE species by silanol nests on the zeolite surface, which facilitates the alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles. This process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction, including activity, selectivity, and durability, by altering the electronic state of the intermetallic compound nanoparticles compared to monometallic Pt.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过使镧和钇与铂形成互金属纳米颗粒，影响了焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。这得益于表面硅醇巢对单原子REE物种的稳定作用，该作用促进了镧和钇在铂纳米颗粒中的合金化。这一过程显著提高了PDH反应的催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性，通过改变互金属复合纳米颗粒的电子状态，与单一铂相比。
