[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[3] "We believe that the silanol nests could stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds16."
[4] "The Pt3Y nanoparticles generated in this manner exhibited a distinctive H2 sorption behaviour (see Extended Data Table1)."
[5] "Nevertheless,it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly influences coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It reduces energy barriers, alters coke accumulation patterns, affects acid site conversions, and impacts graphitization. These effects enhance overall process efficiency and performance by improving catalyst activity and selectivity. Silanol nests in the mesoporous zeolite support play a crucial role in enabling the atomistic alloying of rare-earth elements (REEs) into platinum nanoparticles. This leads to improved catalytic performance, particularly in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst durability. The presence of a small amount of gallium (Ga) in the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contributes to its catalytic function, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the significant impact of the REE alloying effect.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生了重大影响。它降低了能量壁垒，改变了焦炭积累模式，影响了酸性位点转换，并影响了石墨化。这些效果通过提高催化剂活性和选择性来增强整体过程效率和性能。介孔沸石支持中的硅醇巢在使稀有地球元素（REE）与铂纳米粒子合金化中起着关键作用。这导致了催化性能的显著改善，特别是在丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂耐久性方面。PtLa/mz-deGa 催化剂中微量镓（Ga）的存在对催化功能有所贡献，但其影响程度远小于REE合金化效应的影响。
