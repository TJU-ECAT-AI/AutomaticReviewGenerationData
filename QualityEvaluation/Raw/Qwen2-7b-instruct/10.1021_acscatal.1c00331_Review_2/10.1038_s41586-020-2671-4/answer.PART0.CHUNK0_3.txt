[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide,making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[3] "Propane conversion (%) Time on stream (d) 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50"
[4] "bimetallic PtREE alloy catalysts are composed of 1wt% Pt and 1wt% REE."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by facilitating the activation of rare-earth elements (REEs) into single atomic species through silanol nests in the mesoporous zeolite support. This increases the chemical potential of REEs, enabling them to diffuse onto platinum (Pt) nanoparticles and form intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. These alloys exhibit high initial propane conversion, slow deactivation, and improved propylene selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The silanol nests play a crucial role in overcoming the energy barrier for REE reduction, thus promoting the formation of the metal alloys. The PtREE catalysts can efficiently convert propane to propylene under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating enhanced catalytic performance.

氢协同在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过促进稀土元素（REE）在介孔沸石支持体中的单原子物种激活，以硅醇巢的形式。这显著提高了REE的化学势，使它们能够扩散到铂（Pt）纳米颗粒上并形成互金属合金纳米颗粒。这些合金表现出较高的初始丙烷转化率、缓慢失活和改进的丙烯选择性，与单一金属Pt催化剂相比。硅醇巢在克服REE还原的能量壁垒中起着关键作用，从而促进了金属合金的形成。PtREE催化剂能够在苛刻的操作条件下高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，显示出增强的催化性能。
