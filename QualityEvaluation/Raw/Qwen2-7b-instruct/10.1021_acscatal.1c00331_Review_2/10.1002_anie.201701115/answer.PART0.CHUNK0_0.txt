Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It reduces coke formation by suppressing coke accumulation patterns, converting acid sites, preventing graphitization, and enhancing the catalyst's overall efficiency and performance. By utilizing the redox properties of the CeO2 support, hydrogen facilitates the use of water vapor as an oxidant, which not only suppresses coke formation but also enables the catalyst to maintain its stability at high temperatures. The CeO2 support acts as an effective trapping site for Pt atoms, ensuring that the PtSn clusters remain stable even during extended reaction periods at high temperatures. Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding promotes the formation of PtSn clusters, which exhibit high selectivity for propylene production due to their facile desorption properties. This mechanism ensures that the catalyst remains active and regenerable, as the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed state on CeO2 upon oxidation treatment, without the requirement for additional chlorine compounds. Overall, hydrogen cofeeding optimizes the PDH process by enhancing catalyst stability, reducing coke formation, and improving the efficiency of propylene production.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共供给对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生了显著影响。它通过抑制焦炭积累模式、转化酸性位点、防止石墨化以及提高整个过程的效率和性能来减少焦炭形成。通过利用CeO2支持的还原性特性，氢气允许使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，不仅抑制了焦炭形成，而且还使催化剂能够在高温下保持稳定性。CeO2支持作为Pt原子的有效捕获站点，确保了PtSn簇即使在长时间的高温反应期间也能保持稳定。此外，氢气共供给促进了PtSn簇的形成，这些簇由于其易于脱附的性质而表现出高丙烯选择性。这一机制确保了催化剂保持活性和可再生性，因为PtSn簇在氧化处理后能够迅速恢复到CeO2上的原子分散状态，无需额外的氯化物化合物。总体而言，氢气共供给优化了PDH过程，通过增强催化剂稳定性、减少焦炭形成和提高丙烯生产效率提高了过程效率。
