[1] "The CeO2 support traps Pt atoms in ionic form, providing exceptional stability for isolated single atoms of Pt."
[2] "When Sn is added to CeO2, the single-atom Pt catalyst undergoes an activation phase where it transforms into PtSn clusters under reaction conditions."
[3] "Formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product."
[4] "The PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state, unlike those on the alumina support."
[5] "Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process suppresses coke formation during the dehydrogenation."
[6] "Coke layers were found to cover only the support surface for the spent PtSn catalyst."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It helps suppress coke formation, leading to enhanced catalyst stability and prolonged reaction duration. The coke accumulates primarily on the support surface, minimizing its impact on the catalyst's performance. This effect increases the overall process efficiency and ensures better performance by maintaining a cleaner reaction environment and preventing catalyst deactivation due to coke buildup.
