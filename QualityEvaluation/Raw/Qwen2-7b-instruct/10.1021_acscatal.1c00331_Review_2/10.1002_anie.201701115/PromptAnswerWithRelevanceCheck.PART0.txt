Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It reduces coke formation by suppressing coke accumulation patterns, converting acid sites, preventing graphitization, and enhancing the catalyst's overall efficiency and performance. By utilizing the redox properties of the CeO2 support, hydrogen facilitates the use of water vapor as an oxidant, which not only suppresses coke formation but also enables the catalyst to maintain its stability at high temperatures. The CeO2 support acts as an effective trapping site for Pt atoms, ensuring that the PtSn clusters remain stable even during extended reaction periods at high temperatures. Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding promotes the formation of PtSn clusters, which exhibit high selectivity for propylene production due to their facile desorption properties. This mechanism ensures that the catalyst remains active and regenerable, as the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed state on CeO2 upon oxidation treatment, without the requirement for additional chlorine compounds. Overall, hydrogen cofeeding optimizes the PDH process by enhancing catalyst stability, reducing coke formation, and improving the efficiency of propylene production.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共供给对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生了显著影响。它通过抑制焦炭积累模式、转化酸性位点、防止石墨化以及提高整个过程的效率和性能来减少焦炭形成。通过利用CeO2支持的还原性特性，氢气允许使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，不仅抑制了焦炭形成，而且还使催化剂能够在高温下保持稳定性。CeO2支持作为Pt原子的有效捕获站点，确保了PtSn簇即使在长时间的高温反应期间也能保持稳定。此外，氢气共供给促进了PtSn簇的形成，这些簇由于其易于脱附的性质而表现出高丙烯选择性。这一机制确保了催化剂保持活性和可再生性，因为PtSn簇在氧化处理后能够迅速恢复到CeO2上的原子分散状态，无需额外的氯化物化合物。总体而言，氢气共供给优化了PDH过程，通过增强催化剂稳定性、减少焦炭形成和提高丙烯生产效率提高了过程效率。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. By feeding hydrogen, the energy barriers for coke formation are lowered, thereby reducing the likelihood of coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. This is because hydrogen competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption sites, preventing the formation of large carbon deposits. Moreover, hydrogen promotes the conversion of acidic sites on the catalyst into basic sites, which can inhibit the graphitization process, a key factor in coke formation. The introduction of hydrogen thus maintains a cleaner catalyst surface, allowing for better reaction kinetics and higher overall process efficiency. Additionally, the use of hydrogen as an oxidant in the regeneration process enables the suppression of coke formation, enhancing the catalyst's longevity and performance during PDH reactions.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly influence coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. By incorporating hydrogen, the energy barriers for various reactions can be modulated, potentially reducing the likelihood of coke formation. This is because hydrogen can act as a scavenger for free radicals and reactive intermediates, preventing them from polymerizing and forming coke deposits. Moreover, hydrogen can help stabilize the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst and prolonging its operational life. 

In terms of coke accumulation patterns, hydrogen cofeeding can alter the spatial distribution of coke deposits. Typically, coke tends to accumulate preferentially on the catalyst surface. However, with hydrogen present, the coke layer might be more evenly distributed across the support surface, reducing the risk of localized overheating and subsequent sintering of the catalyst particles.

Acid site conversions, which play a crucial role in the PDH process, can also be affected by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen can shift the acidity profile of the catalyst, leading to changes in the selectivity towards desired products like propylene. It can either enhance the activity for dehydrogenation or favor specific reaction pathways that result in the formation of fewer coke precursors.

Graphitization, a process where coke transforms into a more ordered graphite structure, can also be influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. Graphitization is a critical factor in the deactivation of PDH catalysts, as it can lead to a loss of active sites and reduced catalytic activity. Hydrogen can mitigate this effect by inhibiting the graphitization process, preserving the catalyst's structure and functionality.

Overall, the implications of these effects on the PDH process efficiency and performance are profound. Hydrogen cofeeding can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, enhanced catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation. However, it may also introduce trade-offs, such as a decrease in the rate of propane dehydrogenation due to a higher activation barrier. Therefore, optimizing hydrogen cofeeding strategies is crucial for achieving balanced process outcomes that maximize propylene yield while minimizing coke formation and maintaining catalyst efficiency.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can have multifaceted impacts on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It influences energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, ultimately affecting the overall process efficiency and performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气可以显著影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。通过加入氢气，可以调节各种反应的能量壁垒，从而减少焦炭形成的可能性。氢气可以作为自由基和活性中间体的清除剂，防止它们聚合形成焦炭沉积物。此外，氢气还可以帮助稳定催化剂表面，从而增强催化剂的稳定性并延长其使用寿命。

从焦炭沉积模式的角度来看，氢气添加可以改变焦炭沉积物的分布。通常，焦炭倾向于在催化剂表面上优先积累。然而，在存在氢气的情况下，焦炭层可能会更均匀地分布在支撑表面，从而降低局部过热和随后催化剂颗粒烧结的风险。

对于PDH过程中的酸性位点转换，氢气添加也会影响其效果。氢气可以改变催化剂的酸度轮廓，导致对所需产品如丙烯的选择性变化。它可能增强脱氢活性或偏向特定反应路径，从而形成更少的焦炭前体。

图瓦特化也是一个关键因素，它是焦炭转化为更有序的石墨结构的过程，这会导致催化剂活性丧失并降低催化剂效率。氢气可以通过抑制图瓦特化过程来缓解这一影响，从而保持催化剂的结构和功能。

综上所述，氢气添加对PDH过程的影响是多方面的。它可以在焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制方面产生复杂的影响。它影响能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸性位点转换和图瓦特化，最终影响整体过程效率和性能。

简而言之，在PDH过程中添加氢气可以对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生深远影响。它通过调节能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸性位点转换和图瓦特化，最终影响整个过程的效率和性能。
