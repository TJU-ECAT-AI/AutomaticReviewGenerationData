[1] "Adding a second Pt atom to Sn causes it to bind strongly, suggesting that Sn helps to serve as a nucleation site for forming PtSn clusters."
[2] "When Sn is added, DFT calculations suggest that it can bind strongly to CeO2. The Pt atoms can bind strongly with Sn embedded in CeO2."
[3] "Our DFT results also indicate that the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst has a much lower adsorption energy for propylene product than that on the single-atom Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
[4] "As a result, formed propylene desorbs easily, which prevents further reaction."
[5] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[6] "The CeO2 support slows the process of ripening since it is able to trap the PtSn clusters."
[7] "The redox properties of CeO2 allow water vapor to be used as the oxidant, suppressing coke formation during the dehydrogenation."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. By feeding hydrogen, the energy barriers for coke formation are lowered, thereby reducing the likelihood of coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. This is because hydrogen competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption sites, preventing the formation of large carbon deposits. Moreover, hydrogen promotes the conversion of acidic sites on the catalyst into basic sites, which can inhibit the graphitization process, a key factor in coke formation. The introduction of hydrogen thus maintains a cleaner catalyst surface, allowing for better reaction kinetics and higher overall process efficiency. Additionally, the use of hydrogen as an oxidant in the regeneration process enables the suppression of coke formation, enhancing the catalyst's longevity and performance during PDH reactions.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的添加对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了显著影响。通过提供氢，可以降低形成焦炭的能量壁垒，从而减少催化剂表面的焦炭积聚可能性。这是因为氢与碳氢化合物竞争吸附位点，阻止大型碳沉积物的形成。此外，氢还可以促进催化剂上的酸性位点转化为碱性位点，这可以抑制焦炭形成的关键因素——石墨化过程。因此，氢的引入保持了催化剂表面的清洁，提高了反应动力学和整体工艺效率。同时，将氢用作再生过程中氧化剂的方法能够抑制焦炭形成，从而增强催化剂的使用寿命和PDH反应性能。
