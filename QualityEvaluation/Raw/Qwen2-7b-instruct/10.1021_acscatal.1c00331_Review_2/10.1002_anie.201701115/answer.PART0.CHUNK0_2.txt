[1] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[2] "As a result, formed propylene desorbs easily, which prevents further reaction."
[3] "The ability of mobile Pt to reduce the dispersed Sn species is similar to that seen previously where Pt was found to reduce PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles."
[4] "In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst presents particle sizes about 8nm in diameter."
[5] "The primary mechanism for sintering of the PtSn catalyst is Ostwald ripening at high temperatures."
[6] "However, no significant differences were observed in the FTIR spectra of the two catalysts, suggesting that this technique may not be able to distinguish between these two catalysts."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly influence coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. By incorporating hydrogen, the energy barriers for various reactions can be modulated, potentially reducing the likelihood of coke formation. This is because hydrogen can act as a scavenger for free radicals and reactive intermediates, preventing them from polymerizing and forming coke deposits. Moreover, hydrogen can help stabilize the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst and prolonging its operational life. 

In terms of coke accumulation patterns, hydrogen cofeeding can alter the spatial distribution of coke deposits. Typically, coke tends to accumulate preferentially on the catalyst surface. However, with hydrogen present, the coke layer might be more evenly distributed across the support surface, reducing the risk of localized overheating and subsequent sintering of the catalyst particles.

Acid site conversions, which play a crucial role in the PDH process, can also be affected by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen can shift the acidity profile of the catalyst, leading to changes in the selectivity towards desired products like propylene. It can either enhance the activity for dehydrogenation or favor specific reaction pathways that result in the formation of fewer coke precursors.

Graphitization, a process where coke transforms into a more ordered graphite structure, can also be influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. Graphitization is a critical factor in the deactivation of PDH catalysts, as it can lead to a loss of active sites and reduced catalytic activity. Hydrogen can mitigate this effect by inhibiting the graphitization process, preserving the catalyst's structure and functionality.

Overall, the implications of these effects on the PDH process efficiency and performance are profound. Hydrogen cofeeding can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, enhanced catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation. However, it may also introduce trade-offs, such as a decrease in the rate of propane dehydrogenation due to a higher activation barrier. Therefore, optimizing hydrogen cofeeding strategies is crucial for achieving balanced process outcomes that maximize propylene yield while minimizing coke formation and maintaining catalyst efficiency.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can have multifaceted impacts on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It influences energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, ultimately affecting the overall process efficiency and performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气可以显著影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。通过加入氢气，可以调节各种反应的能量壁垒，从而减少焦炭形成的可能性。氢气可以作为自由基和活性中间体的清除剂，防止它们聚合形成焦炭沉积物。此外，氢气还可以帮助稳定催化剂表面，从而增强催化剂的稳定性并延长其使用寿命。

从焦炭沉积模式的角度来看，氢气添加可以改变焦炭沉积物的分布。通常，焦炭倾向于在催化剂表面上优先积累。然而，在存在氢气的情况下，焦炭层可能会更均匀地分布在支撑表面，从而降低局部过热和随后催化剂颗粒烧结的风险。

对于PDH过程中的酸性位点转换，氢气添加也会影响其效果。氢气可以改变催化剂的酸度轮廓，导致对所需产品如丙烯的选择性变化。它可能增强脱氢活性或偏向特定反应路径，从而形成更少的焦炭前体。

图瓦特化也是一个关键因素，它是焦炭转化为更有序的石墨结构的过程，这会导致催化剂活性丧失并降低催化剂效率。氢气可以通过抑制图瓦特化过程来缓解这一影响，从而保持催化剂的结构和功能。

综上所述，氢气添加对PDH过程的影响是多方面的。它可以在焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制方面产生复杂的影响。它影响能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸性位点转换和图瓦特化，最终影响整体过程效率和性能。

简而言之，在PDH过程中添加氢气可以对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生深远影响。它通过调节能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸性位点转换和图瓦特化，最终影响整个过程的效率和性能。
