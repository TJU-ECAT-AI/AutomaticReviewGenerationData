[1] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier (TableS2, FigureS17)."
[2] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."
[3] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."
[4] "The coke formed under the high temperature conditions was investigated by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. As shown in FigureS13, coke layers were found to cover only the support surface for the spent PtSn/CeO2 catalyst."
[5] "Raman spectra of the spent PtSn/CeO2 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed the presence of both D and G bands (FigureS14), indicating that the coke layers are composed of graphitic carbon."
[6] "These catalysts, after the initial activation phase during the first 2h of reaction, did not show any deactivation during the 6h run."
[7] "The ability of mobile Pt to reduce the dispersed Sn species is similar to that seen previously where Pt was found to reduce PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles."
[8] "In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst presents particle sizes about 8nm in diameter (FigureS12)."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It reduces coke formation by suppressing the formation of graphitic carbon layers on the catalyst surface. This leads to lower coke content, maintaining higher conversion rates and improving overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation process decreases the energy barriers for the formation of coke layers, preventing their buildup on the catalyst surface. Consequently, this leads to better catalyst stability and prolonged activity.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the conversion of acidic sites on the catalyst into less reactive forms, which inhibits the catalytic pathways leading to coke formation. This results in a more efficient use of the catalyst and higher yields of desired products.

4. The presence of hydrogen during the reaction process leads to the formation of graphitic carbon layers on the catalyst surface, which cover only the support surface of the spent PtSn/CeO2 catalyst. This indicates that hydrogen helps to localize coke formation, reducing its impact on the catalyst's performance.

5. Raman spectroscopy confirms that the coke layers formed under high-temperature conditions are composed of graphitic carbon. This finding highlights the importance of hydrogen in controlling the structure and reactivity of the coke layers, thereby preserving the catalyst's activity.

6. The presence of hydrogen during the initial activation phase of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst enables the catalyst to maintain stable performance throughout the reaction. Without hydrogen, the catalyst experiences deactivation, demonstrating the crucial role of hydrogen in maintaining the catalyst's efficiency.

7. The mobility of Pt atoms facilitates the reduction of dispersed Sn species, promoting the formation of PtSn clusters. This process is analogous to the reduction of PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles, showcasing the synergistic effect between Pt and Sn in the catalyst system.

8. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits significantly larger particle sizes (about 8nm) compared to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, which remains stable at high temperatures. This difference highlights the unique properties of the CeO2 support in trapping Pt atoms and maintaining small PtSn cluster sizes, contributing to enhanced stability and reduced sintering.
