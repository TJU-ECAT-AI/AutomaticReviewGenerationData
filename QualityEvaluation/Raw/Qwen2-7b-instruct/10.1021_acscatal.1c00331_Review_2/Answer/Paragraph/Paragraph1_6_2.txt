        Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly influences the formation of coke, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It does so by affecting energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, which in turn has substantial implications for the overall process efficiency and performance. 

        Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding facilitates a reduction in the formation of coke, thereby improving catalyst stability. It does this by lowering energy barriers associated with coke formation, which leads to a decrease in the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface. This reduction in coke formation minimizes the deactivation rate of the catalyst and allows for a more efficient conversion of feedstock. 

        Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding promotes a more selective reaction mechanism, favoring the dehydrogenation of light alkanes over other potential side reactions. This selective dehydrogenation further reduces the formation of coke precursors, contributing to improved overall process efficiency. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding has implications for reducing the risk of graphitization, which can degrade catalyst performance.

        The integration of hydrogen cofeeding into the PDH process thus represents a critical strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of the process. It enables a more efficient and selective conversion of propane into propylene, optimizing the entire process flow and output quality.

        在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中加入氢气能显著影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。它通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位转换和石墨化，从而对整个过程效率和性能产生重要影响。

        具体而言，氢气添加有助于减少焦炭形成，从而提高催化剂稳定性。它通过降低与焦炭形成相关联的能量壁垒，导致催化剂表面焦炭积聚减少。这种减少焦炭形成的效应降低了催化剂的失活率，并允许更高效的原料转化。

        此外，氢气添加促进更选择性的反应机制，优先催化轻烷烃的脱氢反应，而避免其他潜在副反应。这种选择性的脱氢进一步减少了形成焦炭前体的可能性，从而改善了整体过程效率。氢气添加还有助于降低石墨化风险，这可能损害催化剂性能。

        因此，将氢气添加融入PDH过程是增强过程稳定性和性能的关键策略。它使丙烷更高效和选择性地转化为丙烯，优化整个流程和产品质量。
