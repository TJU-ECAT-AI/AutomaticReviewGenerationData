Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.cattod.2020.05.053\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/jacs.7b12901\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2015.08.029\], and \[10.1021/acscatal.6b01286\]. A comprehensive understanding of hydrogen cofeeding's effects on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reveals its pivotal role in coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen's impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization significantly shapes the PDH process's overall efficiency and performance.
