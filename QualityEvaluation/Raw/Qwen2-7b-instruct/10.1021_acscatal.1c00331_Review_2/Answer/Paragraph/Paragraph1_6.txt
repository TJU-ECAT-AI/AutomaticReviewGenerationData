        The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process are multifaceted. Hydrogen cofeeding mitigates coke formation and enhances catalyst stability, crucial for propylene production. It achieves this by lowering energy barriers, preventing coke accumulation, inhibiting acid site conversions, and moderating graphitization. The Sn-Beta zeolite and the Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with their high Lewis acid content and low Brnsted/Lewis ratio, significantly enhance the PDH process, delivering a 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity. Theoretical studies confirm that dehydrogenation occurs primarily on the Lewis acid sites, and the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible.
