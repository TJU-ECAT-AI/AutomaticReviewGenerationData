            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/cs400566y\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcata.2015.08.029\], \[10.1016/j.cattod.2020.05.053\], and \[10.1021/cs501279v\]. The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process are pivotal for enhancing process efficiency and performance. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation, stabilizes the catalyst, and optimizes reaction mechanisms by lowering energy barriers, altering coke accumulation patterns, converting acid sites, and mitigating graphitization. This not only minimizes coke buildup but also maintains optimal reaction conditions, leading to a more efficient PDH process. Future research might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as utilizing advanced catalyst designs that can further enhance the hydrogen's positive impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics. For instance, catalysts with enhanced hydrogen interaction sites could offer new avenues for improving process efficiency and performance by effectively managing coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability. Moreover, investigating the precise mechanisms of hydrogen's role in coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics could lead to the development of more targeted and effective strategies for optimizing PDH processes.
