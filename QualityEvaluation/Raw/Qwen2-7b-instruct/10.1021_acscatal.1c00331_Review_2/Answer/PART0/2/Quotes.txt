          "[5] The adsorption energy of propylene in the di-mode on Pt(1 0 0) is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than that in the mode."
          "[6] The C-C bond length in the di-adsorption mode is elongated to 1.49 A, close to the CC interatomic distance in molecular propane (1.54 A)."
          "[7] Both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) show significant distortions in propylene adsorption during di-bonding."
          "[8] The transition states for the formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are shown in Fig. 5."
          "[9] The activation energies for the initial methyl (Step 1) and methylene (Step 2) CH bond activations are 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively."
          "[10] The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observation that the cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) shows higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity than the octahedral particles that are dominated by Pt(1 1 1)."
