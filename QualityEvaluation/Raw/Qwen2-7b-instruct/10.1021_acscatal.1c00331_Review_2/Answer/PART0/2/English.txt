The addition of calcium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts enhances propylene selectivity and reduces carbon deposition. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition provides optimal catalytic activity, while higher calcium loads lead to the formation of PtSn alloy, which diminishes activity. In the propane dehydrogenation process, propylene is the primary product, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products. Calcium addition modifies both the acid and metal functions of the catalyst, suppressing coke deposits.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can reduce the energy barrier for coke formation, facilitating its accumulation on the catalyst surface.

Propane dehydrogenation was performed under atmospheric pressure at 813 K in a flow reactor. The specific surface activity and propylene turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated by normalizing the mass activity to the number of surface Pt atoms determined by H2 chemisorption, indicating the activity for selective CH bond cleavage in the dehydrogenation reaction. The activity for dehydrogenation and cracking on cubic particles is notably higher than that on octahedral particles. The selectivity towards propylene is lower on cubic particles compared to octahedral particles. The adsorption energy of propylene in the di-mode on Pt(1 0 0) is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than in the mode. The C-C bond length in the di-adsorption mode is extended to 1.49 A, closely matching the molecular propane C-C interatomic distance of 1.54 A. Both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) display significant deformations in propylene adsorption during di-bonding.

          Specifically, the impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization were considered.
          These effects play crucial roles in determining the overall process efficiency and performance.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reduces the energy barrier for coke formation, leading to a more uniform coke accumulation pattern on the catalyst surface. It also promotes the stability of acid sites on the catalyst and alters the graphitization process, which collectively improves the overall process efficiency and catalyst performance.

The addition of calcium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts enhances propylene selectivity and reduces carbon deposition. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition provides optimal catalytic activity, while higher calcium loads lead to the formation of PtSn alloy, which diminishes activity. In the propane dehydrogenation process, propylene is the primary product, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products. Calcium addition modifies both the acid and metal functions of the catalyst, suppressing coke deposits.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications on process efficiency and performance in the context of propane dehydrogenation.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can reduce the energy barrier for coke formation, facilitating its accumulation on the catalyst surface. This can lead to a decrease in alkene selectivity and catalyst stability, as coke accumulates and blocks active sites. Additionally, hydrogen can affect the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst, potentially leading to a shift in the reaction mechanism towards coke formation rather than the desired alkene production. Graphitization, a process where the catalyst structure becomes more ordered and less active, can also be influenced by hydrogen, affecting the catalyst's overall performance and efficiency.

How hydrogen cofeeding affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process includes its impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It examines energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These effects have significant implications for the overall process efficiency and performance.

Propane dehydrogenation was performed under atmospheric pressure at 813 K in a flow reactor. The specific surface activity and propylene turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated by normalizing the mass activity to the number of surface Pt atoms determined by H2 chemisorption, indicating the activity for selective CH bond cleavage in the dehydrogenation reaction. The activity for dehydrogenation and cracking on cubic particles is notably higher than that on octahedral particles. The selectivity towards propylene is lower on cubic particles compared to octahedral particles. The adsorption energy of propylene in the di-mode on Pt(1 0 0) is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than in the mode. The C-C bond length in the di-adsorption mode is extended to 1.49 A, closely matching the molecular propane C-C interatomic distance of 1.54 A. Both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) display significant deformations in propylene adsorption during di-bonding. The transition states for propylene formation from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are depicted in Fig. 5. The activation energies for the initial methyl (Step 1) and methylene (Step 2) CH bond activations are 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) explain the observed higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity of cubic particles over octahedral particles.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the activation energy barrier for coke formation, altering coke accumulation patterns to be more uniform, influencing acid site conversions to reduce coke formation, mitigating the formation of large coke structures through graphitization processes. These effects lead to improvements in catalyst stability and efficiency.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process significantly influences energy barriers, thereby affecting the rate of coke formation and catalyst stability. This alteration can modify coke accumulation patterns, change the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and potentially impact the catalyst's graphitization. Collectively, these effects have substantial implications on the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.
