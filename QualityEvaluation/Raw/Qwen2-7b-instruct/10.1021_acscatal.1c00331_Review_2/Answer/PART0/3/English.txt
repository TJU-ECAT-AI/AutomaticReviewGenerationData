There are no specific quotes addressing hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process, coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. However, it is established that the presence of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction, with the isolated Sn atoms playing a crucial role. The Lewis acid acts as the active site for dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid is responsible for the cracking process. An increased L/B ratio correlates positively with the dehydrogenation rate, enhancing the propane conversion. The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites demonstrate remarkable stability, remaining unaffected under severe reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations support the direct pathway being more energetically advantageous for dehydrogenation, with open sites exhibiting higher reactivity compared to closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation levels.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process leads to reduced coke formation, enhanced catalyst stability, and altered energy barriers related to coke formation. It modifies the coke accumulation patterns, leading to more uniform deposition, changes the reaction pathways due to altered acid site conversions, and impacts the catalyst's structure by affecting graphitization processes.

The document discusses the synthesis of ordered mesoporous Mg-SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It examines how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not directly addressed within the provided literature.

Propylene plays a critical role in the modern petrochemical industry, serving as a key raw material in the production of various products like polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, and improving gasoline octane ratings. In the propane dehydrogenation process, propylene is the primary product, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products. Calcium addition to the catalyst can modify its properties, enhancing its selectivity towards propylene while suppressing coke formation. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition can boost catalytic activity, but excessive calcium can lead to catalyst inactivation.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.
