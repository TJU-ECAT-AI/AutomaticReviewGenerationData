It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.", "Chinese": "氢共喂养在PDH过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。它可能减少焦炭形成并抑制表面束缚丙烯进一步脱氢，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。具体影响取决于氢气和反应物之间的平衡，影响去活率和丙烯产率。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008"},
