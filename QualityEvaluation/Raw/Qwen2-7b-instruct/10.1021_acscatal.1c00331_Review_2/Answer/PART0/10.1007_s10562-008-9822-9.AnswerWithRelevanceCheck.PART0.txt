          "As known, the carbonaceous deposit is mainly produced by the polymerization of olefins formed during the dehydrogenation process. The polymerization is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites."
          "The coke content over PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst was 12.8%, whereas over PtSnCa(0.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst was 5.9%. This implies that the addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to catalyst could greatly reduce coke deposit."
          "In all catalysts, the TPO profiles also exhibited some differences in the temperature and shape of peaks. The combustion peak area both in low and high temperature decreased with the Ca loading."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can enhance the coke formation on metallic surfaces, as evidenced by the combustion peak areas decreasing with the addition of calcium. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the formation of coke on both metal and support sites, affecting the overall process efficiency and performance negatively. The calcium addition helps in reducing the amount of carbon deposits on catalysts, improving catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene.

          氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢的加入可能促进金属表面的焦炭形成，这可以从燃烧峰区随钙添加而降低的现象中看出。这表明氢共喂养在金属和支撑位点上促进焦炭形成，从而影响整个过程的效率和性能。钙的添加有助于减少催化剂上的碳沉积，提高催化剂稳定性并增加丙烯的选择性。

          "The presence of calcium in the catalysts improved the selectivity to propylene but also decreased the amount of carbon deposits on catalyst. The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity. However an excessive Ca loading caused that a large amount of oxidized tin species were reduced to metallic state, which could interact with Pt to produce high percentage of PtSn alloy, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity."
          "Propylene is one of the most important materials in the modern petrochemical industry, largely used as an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, refinery feed stock to improve the octane rating of gasoline."
          "In the case of propane dehydrogenation process, side reactions like hydrogenolysis, cracking and coke formation compete with dehydrogenation reaction. Propylene is the major product of the reaction, whereas methane, ethane and ethylene are by-products."
          "The addition of calcium could not only modify the characteristics and properties of both acid and metal function but also suppress coke deposits on the catalyst."

          The addition of calcium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts enhances propylene selectivity and reduces carbon deposition. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition provides optimal catalytic activity, while higher calcium loads lead to the formation of PtSn alloy, which diminishes activity. In the propane dehydrogenation process, propylene is the primary product, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products. Calcium addition modifies both the acid and metal functions of the catalyst, suppressing coke deposits.

          向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中添加钙可以提高丙烯选择性并减少碳沉积。在0.9 wt%的钙添加下，可以获得最佳的催化活性，而更高的钙负载会导致PtSn合金的形成，从而降低活性。在丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烯是主要产物，而甲烷、乙烷和乙烯是副产品。钙的添加不仅可以修改催化剂的酸性和金属功能特性，还可以抑制催化剂上的焦炭沉积。

          Propylene plays a critical role in the modern petrochemical industry, serving as a key raw material in the production of various products like polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, and improving gasoline octane ratings. In the propane dehydrogenation process, propylene is the primary product, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products. Calcium addition to the catalyst can modify its properties, enhancing its selectivity towards propylene while suppressing coke formation. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition can boost catalytic activity, but excessive calcium can lead to catalyst inactivation.

          丙烯在现代石油化工行业中扮演着重要角色，是生产聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸、甘油、异丙醇等产品的关键原料，并能提高汽油的辛烷值。在丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烯是主要产物，而甲烷、乙烷和乙烯是副产品。向催化剂中添加钙不仅可以修改其酸性和金属功能特性，还能抑制催化剂上的焦炭沉积。在0.9 wt%的钙添加下，可以提升催化活性，但过量的钙可能导致催化剂失效。
