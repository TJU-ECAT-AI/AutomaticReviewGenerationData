The document discusses the synthesis of PtSn catalysts supported on ordered mesoporous Mg-SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation. It examines how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke formation patterns, acid site transformations, and graphitization, which in turn impacts the overall process efficiency and performance.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance.
