          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a critical industrial process for manufacturing propylene. Hydrogen cofeeding is a strategy employed to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability. Coke formation in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is intricately linked to the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Accumulation of coke negatively impacts catalyst stability, causing reductions in both activity and selectivity. Energy barriers, acid site transformations, and graphitization are pivotal in coke formation and its elimination. Gaining insight into the PDH process kinetics is fundamental for optimizing the process efficiency and performance.

      <English>
          Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process significantly influences energy barriers, thereby affecting the rate of coke formation and catalyst stability. This alteration can modify coke accumulation patterns, change the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and potentially impact the catalyst's graphitization. Collectively, these effects have substantial implications on the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.
