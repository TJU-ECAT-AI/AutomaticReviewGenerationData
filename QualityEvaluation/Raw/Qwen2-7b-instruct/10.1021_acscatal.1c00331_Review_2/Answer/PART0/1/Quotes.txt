          "[3] The selectivity toward propylene depends strongly on the relative rate between propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption."
          "[4] According to the Arrhenius equation, activation energy plays a key role in determining the reaction rate constant."

[1] "The study investigates the effect of hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms."
          [2] "Considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, the study aims to understand the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an important industrial process for producing propylene."
          [2] "Hydrogen cofeeding has been proposed as a means to mitigate the formation of coke and improve catalyst stability."
          [3] "Coke formation in the PDH process is closely related to the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."
          [4] "Catalyst stability is affected by the accumulation of coke, which can lead to decreased activity and selectivity."
          [5] "Energy barriers, acid site conversions, and graphitization play significant roles in the formation and removal of coke."
          [6] "Understanding the kinetics of the PDH process is crucial for optimizing the process efficiency and performance."
