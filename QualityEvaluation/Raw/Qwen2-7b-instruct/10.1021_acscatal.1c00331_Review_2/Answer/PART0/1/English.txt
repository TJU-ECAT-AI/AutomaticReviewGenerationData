The formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) is illustrated in Fig. 5. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational explanation for the experimentally observed higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity of cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) compared to octahedral particles dominated by Pt(1 1 1). Propylene selectivity is significantly influenced by the relative rates of propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption. The Arrhenius equation highlights the pivotal role of activation energy in defining the reaction rate constant.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a critical industrial process for manufacturing propylene. Hydrogen cofeeding is a strategy employed to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability. Coke formation in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is intricately linked to the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
