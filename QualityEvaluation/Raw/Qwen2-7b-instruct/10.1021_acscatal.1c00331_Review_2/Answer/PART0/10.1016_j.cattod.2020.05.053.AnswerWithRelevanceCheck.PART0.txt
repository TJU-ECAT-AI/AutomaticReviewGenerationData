      <English>
          The key to maintaining catalytic stability lies in understanding the comparative study of side reactions involving solgel derived SnOx/SiO2 catalysts and K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. This involves examining how these catalysts affect energy barriers, the patterns of coke accumulation, the conversion of acid sites, and the process of graphitization. The implications of these effects on the overall efficiency and performance of the process are significant and require careful consideration.
