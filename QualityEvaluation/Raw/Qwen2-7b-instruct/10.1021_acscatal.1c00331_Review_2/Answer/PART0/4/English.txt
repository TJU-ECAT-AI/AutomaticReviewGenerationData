The literature does not provide specific information about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the overall process efficiency and performance in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, controlling coke accumulation patterns, facilitating acid site conversions, and enhancing catalyst stability. These improvements lead to increased process efficiency and performance by reducing coke accumulation and maintaining high catalyst activity.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.
