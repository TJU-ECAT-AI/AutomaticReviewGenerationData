3.1. The Effect of Cofeed
3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
"Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
"the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
"Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a."
"In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
"this implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

3.2. The Modification of Active Component
3.2.1. Effect of Structure and Size
"The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions."
"furthermore, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation."

3.2.2. Effect of Promoter
"As mentioned in section 2.1, adding promoter is one of the most effective methods to modify the nature of Pt catalyst. Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports."
"the main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1."
"Moreover, the coke precursor adsorbed weakly on PtSn, which enables the easy transfer from metal to support."
"By this method, the active components are kept intact, which delivers good activity and stability."
"Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed."

3.2.3. Third Element Based on Sn Promoter
"Further elements are introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on PtSn."
"The performances of a series of PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts show that the higher Al concentration leads to higher coke formation rate."

3.3. The Modification of Support
"Vu et al. found that PtSn/ZnAl2O4 shows higher tolerance for deactivation than PtSn/Al2O3 on PDH due to the different coke mobility from metal to support (entry 15, Table 1)."
"The origin of the mobility of coke is caused by the contents of PtSn and Pt3Sn induced by different support during the reaction."
"The better performance is ascribed to the formation of PtGa alloy."
"With the optimal content of TiO2 (10 wt %), the catalyst would have a better performance by transferring coke from the active component to the support and leaving the active component free (entry 18, Table 1)."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms through various pathways. Hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing the precursor of coke. The adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum surface increases the energy barrier for dehydrogenation reactions, preventing the occurrence of deep reactions. In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is reduced, converting from Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which decreases the rate of coking on the support. The presence of highly ordered graphitic coke, which is harder to remove, indicates that hydrogen feeding makes coke removal more challenging. Smaller platinum particles have higher activity but also lead to a higher rate of coke formation due to the presence of numerous undercoordinated sites that are highly active in carbon-carbon (CH) and carbon-hydrogen (CC) bond activation. Tin is a widely used promoter that improves selectivity and stability by weakening the adsorption of coke precursors on the metal surface, facilitating their easy transfer from metal to support, and maintaining intact active components, which contributes to good activity and stability. Further elements like aluminum and gallium can be introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on the PtSn system, affecting coke formation rates. Metal oxide supports, such as zinc-aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, can influence catalytic performance and coke suppression by forming PtGa alloys, altering electron density, and introducing acid centers that facilitate coke accumulation on the support. The optimal content of titanium oxide in the catalyst can improve performance by transferring coke from the active component to the support, leaving the active component free. These modifications collectively enhance process efficiency and performance by controlling coke formation, stabilizing catalysts, and optimizing reaction mechanisms.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中作为共剂，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。氢减少了焦炭形成速率并增强了催化剂稳定性，通过去除焦炭前体来实现。氢吸附在铂表面增加了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，阻止了深层反应的发生。在氢气氛中，支持物的酸性降低，从路易斯酸位点转化为布恩斯特酸位点，这有助于减少支持物上的焦炭形成速率。高度有序的石墨化焦炭的存在表明，在氢供给下，焦炭去除更加困难。较小的铂颗粒具有更高的活性但焦炭沉积率也更高，原因是含有大量在碳-碳（CH）和碳-氢（CC）键激活中非常活跃的非协调位点。锡是广泛使用的促进剂，它通过减弱焦炭前体在金属表面的吸附、促进金属到支持物的焦炭容易转移以及保持活性成分的完整性，提高了选择性和稳定性，从而贡献了良好的活性和稳定性。铝、镓等进一步元素可以在PtSn体系中引入以调整催化性能，影响焦炭形成速率。锌铝氧化物和镁铝氧化物等金属氧化物支持物可以通过形成PtGa合金、改变电子密度和引入酸中心等方式影响催化性能和焦炭抑制能力，促进焦炭在支持物上的积累。钛氧化物的最佳含量在催化剂中的应用可以改善性能，通过将焦炭从活性成分转移到支持物，让活性成分保持自由状态。这些修改综合提高了过程效率和性能，通过控制焦炭形成、稳定催化剂和优化反应机制。

"However, the DFT calculation showed that the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH are increasing slightly when H2O existed."
"Therefore, the effect of steam in improving activity could be ascribed to the low coking rate, which leads to a high percentage of free active sites."
"In particular, the amount of coke decreases significantly on PtSn/CeO2 (decreasing by 82%) and PtSn/Al2O3 (decreasing by 90%) under moisture."

氢气共喂养在PDH过程中，通过减少焦炭形成速率、提高催化剂稳定性并阻止深度反应，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢气吸附在Pt表面增加了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，抑制了深度反应。在氢气气氛中，支持物的酸性被弱化，从而减少了支持物上的结焦速率。焦炭的石墨化与氢分压呈正相关，使得在氢气供给下更难去除焦炭。加入少量水分可以降低焦炭形成并增加活性，通过降低结焦率，导致更多自由活性位点。在湿度下，像PtSn/CeO2和PtSn/Al2O3这样的催化剂中的焦炭量显著减少。

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的辅助喂料通过减少焦炭形成速率和增加催化剂稳定性，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生影响。氢通过去除焦炭前体和减弱支持体的酸性，由Lewis酸位点转化为Brnsted酸位点，实现这一目标。焦炭的石墨化与氢分压正相关，使得在氢喂料下更难移除焦炭，因为高度有序的石墨状焦炭在较高温度下被燃烧。较小的铂颗粒具有更高的活性，但也有更高的焦炭形成速率，导致更多的焦炭沉积。锡促进剂通过影响脱氢和产品脱附的能量壁垒以及侧反应自由位点的局部覆盖率，改善催化剂的选择性和稳定性。传统的PDH催化剂支持物是Al2O3，它是酸性的，并倾向于焦炭沉积，因此需要修改以提高抗焦炭能力。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by eliminating the precursor of coke. This is achieved by decreasing coke accumulation on the support surface in a hydrogen atmosphere. The acidity of the support is weakened, which helps in reducing the coking rate on the support. The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding.
