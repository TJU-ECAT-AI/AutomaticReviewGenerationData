3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
"Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
"Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere."
"In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
"Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."
"Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity."
"The addition of H2O decreases the apparent activation energy of propane conversion, but also decreases the selectivity of propylene."
"However, the DFT calculation showed that the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH are increasing slightly when H2O existed."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by eliminating the precursor of coke. This is achieved by decreasing coke accumulation on the support surface in a hydrogen atmosphere. The acidity of the support is weakened, which helps in reducing the coking rate on the support. The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding. Additionally, a small amount of water in the feed can decrease coke formation and increase activity, although it may also slightly increase the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH processes. The addition of water reduces the apparent activation energy of propane conversion but decreases the selectivity of propylene production.

氢气共喂养在PDH过程中减少了焦炭形成的速度并增强了催化剂稳定性，通过消除焦炭生成的前体。这主要是通过在氢气气氛下减少支持表面的焦炭积累实现的。支持的酸性减弱，有助于降低支持上的焦炭生成速率。焦炭的石墨化与氢分压成正比，这意味着在氢气供应下更难去除焦炭，因为高度有序的石墨焦炭在较高温度下燃烧。此外，原料中微量水分可以减少焦炭形成并提高活性，尽管也可能略微增加PDH过程中基本反应的能量壁垒。水分的添加降低了丙烷转换的显着活化能，但降低了丙烯的选择性。
