3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
"The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
"Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a."
"In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
"Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."
"Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity."
"However, the DFT calculation showed that the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH are increasing slightly when H2O existed."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by increasing the energy barrier of dehydrogenation, reducing coke accumulation on the support, weakening the acidity of the support, and making it harder to remove graphitized coke. The presence of water in the feed can also decrease coke formation and increase activity, although it slightly increases the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH.

在PDH过程中，氢的共喂养通过增加脱氢反应的能量壁垒、减少支撑上焦油沉积物的积累、减弱支撑的酸性以及使有序的石墨化焦油更难去除，影响焦油形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。在流体中添加少量水可以降低焦油形成并提高活性，尽管这略微增加了PDH中基础反应的能量壁垒。
