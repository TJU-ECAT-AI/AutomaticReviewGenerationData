3.1. The Effect of Cofeed
3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
"Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
"Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere."
"In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
"Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

3.2. The Modification of Active Component
3.2.1. Effect of Structure and Size
"The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions."

3.2.2. Effect of Promoter
"Moreover, the coke precursor adsorbed weakly on PtSn, which enables the easy transfer from metal to support."
"The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively."
"Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction."

3.3. The Modification of Support
3.3.1. Doping of Support
"The conventional support of a commercial Pt catalyst in PDH is Al2O3, which is acidic and is inclined to coke deposition."

The hydrogen cofeed in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by decreasing the rate of coke formation and increasing the stability of the catalyst. Hydrogen achieves this by removing the precursor of coke and weakening the acidity of the support through conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites. Graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding. Smaller Pt particles have higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. The Sn promoter improves the selectivity and stability of the catalyst by influencing the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products and affecting the local coverage of free sites for side reactions. The conventional support of a commercial Pt catalyst in PDH is Al2O3, which is acidic and prone to coke deposition, necessitating modifications to improve anticoke ability.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的辅助喂料通过减少焦炭形成速率和增加催化剂稳定性，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生影响。氢通过去除焦炭前体和减弱支持体的酸性，由Lewis酸位点转化为Brnsted酸位点，实现这一目标。焦炭的石墨化与氢分压正相关，使得在氢喂料下更难移除焦炭，因为高度有序的石墨状焦炭在较高温度下被燃烧。较小的铂颗粒具有更高的活性，但也有更高的焦炭形成速率，导致更多的焦炭沉积。锡促进剂通过影响脱氢和产品脱附的能量壁垒以及侧反应自由位点的局部覆盖率，改善催化剂的选择性和稳定性。传统的PDH催化剂支持物是Al2O3，它是酸性的，并倾向于焦炭沉积，因此需要修改以提高抗焦炭能力。
