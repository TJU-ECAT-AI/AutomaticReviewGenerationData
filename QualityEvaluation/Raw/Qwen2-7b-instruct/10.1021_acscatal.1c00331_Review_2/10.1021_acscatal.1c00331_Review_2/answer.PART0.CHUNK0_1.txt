3.1. The Effect of Cofeed
3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
"Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
"The energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
"Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a."
"In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
"Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure."
"Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity."
"The addition of H2O decreases the apparent activation energy of propane conversion, but also decreases the selectivity of propylene, as shown in Figure 4b."
"However, the DFT calculation showed that the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH are increasing slightly when H2O existed."
"Therefore, the effect of steam in improving activity could be ascribed to the low coking rate, which leads to a high percentage of free active sites."
"In particular, the amount of coke decreases significantly on PtSn/CeO2 (decreasing by 82%) and PtSn/Al2O3 (decreasing by 90%) under moisture."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the rate of coke formation, increasing catalyst stability, and preventing deep reactions. Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier of dehydrogenation, inhibiting deep reactions. In hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened, which reduces the rate of coking on the support. Graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding. Adding a small amount of water decreases coke formation and increases activity by reducing the coking rate, leading to a higher percentage of free active sites. Under moisture, the amount of coke decreases significantly on catalysts like PtSn/CeO2 and PtSn/Al2O3.

氢气共喂养在PDH过程中，通过减少焦炭形成速率、提高催化剂稳定性并阻止深度反应，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢气吸附在Pt表面增加了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，抑制了深度反应。在氢气气氛中，支持物的酸性被弱化，从而减少了支持物上的结焦速率。焦炭的石墨化与氢分压呈正相关，使得在氢气供给下更难去除焦炭。加入少量水分可以降低焦炭形成并增加活性，通过降低结焦率，导致更多自由活性位点。在湿度下，像PtSn/CeO2和PtSn/Al2O3这样的催化剂中的焦炭量显著减少。
