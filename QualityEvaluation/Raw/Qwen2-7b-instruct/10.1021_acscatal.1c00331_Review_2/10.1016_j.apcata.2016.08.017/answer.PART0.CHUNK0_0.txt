3.1. Propane dehydrogenation A series of catalysts with different sodium ion contents were employed in propane dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation. (Fig. 1A, curve a; Fig. 1B, curve a). The PtSnNa catalysts, exhibited lower initial propane conversion but were more durable. Obviously, sodium ion as additive largely improved the catalyst durability, which led to the stable high propane conversion (Fig. 1A, curves b-e vs. a) and high propy lene yields (Fig. 1C, curves b-d vs. a), but the reactivity especially the initial reactivity of the catalyst was lowered. Excess sodium ion was harmful on contrary and it was found that within 1.5wt % content of the sodium ion was favorable (Fig. 1C, curves b-d vs. e).

3.2. Structure and surface properties of the catalysts X-ray diffractions (XRD) experiments of the materials were then performed. As shown in Fig. 2, no signals of Pt, Sn or Na were observed after the impregnation, possibly due to their low concentration and/or the high dispersion states of these metal elements (Fig. 2, curves b1, c, d1, e and f) [25]. Moreover, compared with the original structure of SUZ-4 zeolite, the XRD patterns of the sup ported catalysts did not show any characteristic changes (Fig. 2, curves a vs. bf). After the propane dehydrogenation reaction for 10 h, the signals of SUZ-4 zeolite were also observed in the cat alysts, as shown in Fig. 2, curves b2 and d2, which indicated the structure of the supports was not destructed during the reaction.

3.3. Pre-treatment experiment with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene To investigate the detailed structure of the materials, experiments using dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-poisoned catalysts were tested. As shown in Fig. 4, for all of the PtSn/SUZ-4, PtSnNa(1.0)/SUZ-4 and PtSnNa(1.5)/SUZ-4 catalysts, their activities decreased after treating with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (Figs. 4A, B and C), but the activity of PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4 was nearly unchanged after being treated with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (Fig. 4D). Because dibenzo[b,d]thiophene had larger molecule diameter (ca. 0.8 nm) than the tunnels of SUZ-4 zeolite (ca.0.46-0.52 nm)[29,33], it could only contact with the surface Pt catalyst, while the catalyst Pt particles inside the tunnels remained untouched. Therefore, the proportion of Pt inside the pores of zeolite can be analyzed by the ratio of propane conversion between the reactions with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-poisoned catalysts and fresh ones (P/F).

3.4. Interaction of catalyst components Previous studies have indicated that the interaction between Pt-Sn-support was an important factor that affected the state of the Sn component, the state of the Pt dispersion and the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst [34,35]. For catalysts with high content of metal components but low dispersion, it is difficult to get enough information on the catalyst active phase structure through XRD and XPS methods. In order to further disclose the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa supported catalysts, temperature-programmed reactions (TPR) with H2 were then investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, a broad but weak reduction peak was observed at 350 C for Pt/SUZ-4 sample, indicating that most Pt(II) decomposed to Pt(0) after calcination (curve a) [36]. For Sn/SUZ-4, two TPR peaks were observed: the peak at 300 C was attributed to be the reduction of Sn(IV) to Sn(II), while the peak at 520 C clearly indicated the reduction of Sn(IV) or Sn(II) to Sn(0) (curve b) [37].

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This leads to changes in the overall process efficiency and performance. Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding can reduce energy barriers, altering the pathways for coke formation and affecting the distribution of coke deposits on the catalyst surface. It can also impact the conversion of acid sites, leading to changes in the acidity profile of the catalyst and potentially reducing the formation of coke. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the degree of graphitization, which is a form of carbon deposition that can block the active sites of the catalyst, reducing its activity. These effects collectively influence the stability and selectivity of the PDH process, impacting the yield of propylene and the longevity of the catalyst. The precise mechanisms and implications depend on the specific conditions of the reaction, including the concentration of hydrogen, the presence of other reactants, and the nature of the catalyst itself.
