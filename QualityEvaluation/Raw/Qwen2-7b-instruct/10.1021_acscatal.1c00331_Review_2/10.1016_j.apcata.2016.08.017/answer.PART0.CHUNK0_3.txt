[1] "The experimental results showed that PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts exhibited high durability, high propylene selectivity and high stability with adequate sodium ion content."
[2] "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites and prevented the formation of coke."
[3] "However, excess sodium ion not only reduced tin species to metallic tin, which reduced the catalyst activity by forming PtSn alloys, but also led to more Pt particles inside the pore of zeolite, which were easily deactivated by coke."
[4] "It was found that catalysts with the sodium ion content at 0.51.5wt % led to the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[5] "The addition of sodium ion led to the increase of TPR peak area."
[6] "Moreover, Sn(II) to Sn(0) TPR peak moved to lower temperature, showing that Sn species in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was much easier to be reduced to metallic Sn especially for PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4."

1. The addition of sodium ion in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst system effectively neutralizes the strong acid sites, enhancing the catalyst's durability, propylene selectivity, and stability during propane dehydrogenation processes.
2. Excessive sodium ion content in the catalyst leads to a reduction in tin species to metallic tin, which decreases catalyst activity by forming PtSn alloys.
3. An adequate amount of sodium ion content, specifically within the range of 0.5 to 1.5 wt%, optimizes propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
4. The TPR peak area increases with the addition of sodium ion, indicating changes in the catalyst's interaction dynamics.
5. The Sn species in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst becomes more susceptible to reduction to metallic Sn, especially in the case of PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4, due to the movement of the Sn(II) to Sn(0) TPR peak to lower temperatures.

1. 添加钠离子在PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂体系中有效中和强酸位点，增强催化剂的耐久性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。
2. 催化剂中的过量钠离子导致锡物种转化为金属锡，降低催化剂活性，形成PtSn合金。
3. 合适的钠离子含量范围（0.5至1.5 wt%）优化了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
4. 随着钠离子添加量的增加，TPR峰面积增大，表明催化剂相互作用动力学的变化。
5. PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂中的Sn物种更容易还原为金属Sn，尤其是在PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4的情况下，由于Sn(II)到Sn(0)的TPR峰移动到较低温度。
