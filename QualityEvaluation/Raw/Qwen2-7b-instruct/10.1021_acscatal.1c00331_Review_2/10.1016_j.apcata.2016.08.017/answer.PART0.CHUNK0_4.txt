The experimental results showed that PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts exhibited high durability, high propylene selectivity, and high stability with adequate sodium ion content.
Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites and prevented the formation of coke. However, excess sodium ion not only reduced tin species to metallic tin, which reduced the catalyst activity by forming PtSn alloys, but also led to more Pt particles inside the pore of zeolite, which were easily deactivated by coke.
It was found that catalysts with the sodium ion content at 0.5-1.5 wt% led to the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

The study indicates that the addition of sodium ions to PtSn/SUZ-4 catalysts enhances the catalyst's stability and propylene selectivity by neutralizing the strong acid sites and inhibiting coke formation. However, too much sodium leads to the reduction of tin species to metallic tin, forming PtSn alloys, which reduces the catalyst's activity. Excess sodium also causes more Pt particles to form within the zeolite pores, which are susceptible to deactivation by coke. Optimal sodium ion content ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% for achieving the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

研究表明，向PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂中添加钠离子可以增强催化剂的稳定性与丙烯选择性，通过中和强酸位点并抑制焦炭形成。然而，过量的钠会导致锡物种还原为金属锡，形成PtSn合金，这会降低催化剂的活性。过多的钠还会导致更多的Pt颗粒在沸石孔内形成，这些颗粒容易被焦炭活化。最优的钠离子含量范围为0.5到1.5 wt%，以实现最高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
