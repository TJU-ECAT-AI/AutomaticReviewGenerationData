3.1. Propane dehydrogenation A series of catalysts with different sodium ion contents were employed in propane dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation. (Fig. 1A, curve a; Fig. 1B, curve a). The PtSnNa catalysts, exhibited lower initial propane conversion but were more durable. Obviously, sodium ion as additive largely improved the catalyst durability, which led to the stable high propane conversion (Fig. 1A, curves b-e vs. a) and high propy lene yields (Fig. 1C, curves b-d vs. a), but the reactivity especially the initial reactivity of the catalyst was lowered. Excess sodium ion was harmful on contrary and it was found that within 1.5wt % content of the sodium ion was favorable (Fig. 1C, curves b-d vs. e).

3.2. Structure and surface properties of the catalysts X-ray diffractions (XRD) experiments of the materials were then performed. As shown in Fig. 2, no signals of Pt, Sn or Na were observed after the impregnation, possibly due to their low concentration and/or the high dispersion states of these metal elements (Fig. 2, curves b1, c, d1, e and f) [25]. Moreover, compared with the original structure of SUZ-4 zeolite, the XRD patterns of the sup ported catalysts did not show any characteristic changes (Fig. 2, curves a vs. bf). After the propane dehydrogenation reaction for 10 h, the signals of SUZ-4 zeolite were also observed in the cat alysts, as shown in Fig. 2, curves b2 and d2, which indicated the structure of the supports was not destructed during the reaction.

3.3. Pre-treatment experiment with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene To investigate the detailed structure of the materials, experiments using dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-poisoned catalysts were tested. As shown in Fig. 4, for all of the PtSn/SUZ-4, PtSnNa(1.0)/SUZ-4 and PtSnNa(1.5)/SUZ-4 catalysts, their activities decreased after treating with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (Figs. 4A, B and C), but the activity of PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4 was nearly unchanged after being treated with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (Fig. 4D). Because dibenzo[b,d]thiophene had larger molecule diameter (ca. 0.8 nm) than the tunnels of SUZ-4 zeolite (ca.0.46-0.52 nm)[29,33], it could only contact with the surface Pt catalyst, while the catalyst Pt particles inside the tunnels remained untouched. Therefore, the proportion of Pt inside the pores of zeolite can be analyzed by the ratio of propane conversion between the reactions with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-poisoned catalysts and fresh ones (P/F).

3.4. Interaction of catalyst components Previous studies have indicated that the interaction between Pt-Sn-support was an important factor that affected the state of the Sn component, the state of the Pt dispersion and the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst [34,35]. For catalysts with high content of metal components but low dispersion, it is difficult to get enough information on the catalyst active phase structure through XRD and XPS methods. In order to further disclose the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa supported catalysts, temperature-programmed reactions (TPR) with H2 were then investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, a broad but weak reduction peak was observed at 350 C for Pt/SUZ-4 sample, indicating that most Pt(II) decomposed to Pt(0) after calcination (curve a) [36]. For Sn/SUZ-4, two TPR peaks were observed: the peak at 300 C was attributed to be the reduction of Sn(IV) to Sn(II), while the peak at 520 C clearly indicated the reduction of Sn(IV) or Sn(II) to Sn(0) (curve b) [37].

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This leads to changes in the overall process efficiency and performance. Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding can reduce energy barriers, altering the pathways for coke formation and affecting the distribution of coke deposits on the catalyst surface. It can also impact the conversion of acid sites, leading to changes in the acidity profile of the catalyst and potentially reducing the formation of coke. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the degree of graphitization, which is a form of carbon deposition that can block the active sites of the catalyst, reducing its activity. These effects collectively influence the stability and selectivity of the PDH process, impacting the yield of propylene and the longevity of the catalyst. The precise mechanisms and implications depend on the specific conditions of the reaction, including the concentration of hydrogen, the presence of other reactants, and the nature of the catalyst itself.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These effects lead to changes in the overall process efficiency and performance. Specifically, hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the energy barriers for coke formation, alter the coke accumulation patterns, and modify the acid sites on the catalyst surface. This, in turn, impacts the reaction pathways and potentially leads to graphitization. These modifications can either enhance or hinder the PDH process depending on how they affect the balance between the desired propylene production and coke formation.

In terms of coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding can either suppress or promote coke deposition, depending on its interaction with the acid sites. On one hand, hydrogen can help stabilize the catalyst by reducing the acidic sites, which might prevent coke formation. On the other hand, if the hydrogen cofeeding is too high, it can lead to a shift in the reaction pathway favoring coke formation, especially in the presence of high energy barriers and suitable conditions for coke formation.

Regarding catalyst stability, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the stability by affecting the distribution of active sites, such as Pt and Sn, and modifying the reaction environment. The interaction between Pt and Sn components can be crucial for the dehydrogenation performance, and hydrogen cofeeding can alter this interaction, leading to changes in the dispersion of these metals and their state. This can impact the catalyst's ability to maintain its activity over multiple cycles, affecting its long-term stability.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process has a complex relationship with coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It can either promote or hinder these aspects, depending on the specific conditions and interactions within the system. Optimizing the hydrogen cofeeding can help in managing these effects to improve the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共供给对焦油形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了影响，这些影响包括能量壁垒、焦油积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化等。这些变化直接影响到整个过程的效率和性能。具体而言，氢的共供给可以降低形成焦油的能量壁垒，改变焦油积累的模式，并修改催化剂表面的酸性位点。这进而影响反应路径，并可能导致石墨化。这些调整既可以增强也可以阻碍PDH过程，取决于它们如何影响预期丙烯产量与焦油形成之间的平衡。

在焦油形成方面，氢的共供给既可以抑制也可以促进焦油沉积，这取决于它与酸性位点的相互作用。一方面，氢可以帮助稳定催化剂，通过减少酸性位点来防止焦油形成。另一方面，如果氢的共供给过高，它可能导致反应路径发生偏移，有利于焦油形成，尤其是在存在高能量壁垒和适合焦油形成条件的情况下。

关于催化剂稳定性，氢的共供给可以影响稳定性，通过改变活性位点（如Pt和Sn）的分布和反应环境。Pt和Sn成分之间的相互作用对于脱氢性能至关重要，氢的共供给可以改变这种相互作用，导致金属分散度的变化及其状态。这可以影响催化剂保持其活性的能力，从而影响其长期稳定性。

综上所述，氢在PDH过程中的共供给与焦油形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制之间有着复杂的相互关系。它可以既促进也阻碍这些方面，具体取决于系统内的特定条件和相互作用。优化氢的共供给有助于管理这些影响，以提高PDH过程的整体效率和性能。
