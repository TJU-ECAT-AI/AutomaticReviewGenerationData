[1] "The experimental results showed that PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts exhibited high durability,high propylene selectivity and high stability with adequate sodium ion content."
[2] "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites and prevented the formation of coke."
[3] "However, excess sodium ion not only reduced tin species to metallic tin, which reduced the catalyst activity by forming PtSn alloys, but also led to more Pt particles inside the pore of zeolite, which were easily deactivated by coke."
[4] "It was found that catalysts with the sodium ion content at 0.51.5wt % led to the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[5] "Compared with -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite possesses a special three dimensional topological structure, which can inhibit the production of large hydrocarbon molecules to suppress the coke deposits and enhance the catalyst stability."
[6] "The addition of sodium ion led to the increase of TPR peak area. Moreover, Sn(II) to Sn(0) TPR peak moved to lower temperature, showing that Sn species in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was much easier to be reduced to metallic Sn especially for PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4."

1. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts demonstrated high durability, high propylene selectivity, and high stability when they had sufficient sodium ion content. Sodium ions helped neutralize the strong acid sites and prevented coke formation.

2. Excessive sodium ion content negatively impacted the catalyst by converting tin species into metallic tin, which reduced catalyst activity due to the formation of PtSn alloys. Additionally, it led to more Pt particles within the zeolite pores, making them prone to deactivation by coke.

3. It was discovered that catalysts with sodium ion content ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% achieved the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

4. Zeolite ZSM-5's unique three-dimensional structure inhibited the production of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus reducing coke deposits and enhancing catalyst stability compared to -Al2O3.

5. The addition of sodium ions increased the TPR peak area, and the Sn(II) to Sn(0) TPR peak shifted to lower temperatures, indicating that the Sn species in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst was more prone to reduction to metallic Sn, particularly in PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4.

1.PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在钠离子含量充足时，展现出高耐久性、高丙烯选择性和高稳定性。钠离子有助于中和强酸位点并防止结焦形成。

2. 过量的钠离子不仅将锡物种转化为金属锡，导致催化剂活性降低，形成PtSn合金，而且还会使更多的铂颗粒进入沸石孔内，这些颗粒容易被结焦而失活。

3. 研究发现，钠离子含量在0.5到1.5 wt%范围内的催化剂实现了最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

4. 与-Al2O3相比，ZSM-5沸石独特的三维结构抑制了大型烃分子的生成，从而减少了结焦沉积并提高了催化剂稳定性。

5. 钠离子的添加增加了TPR峰面积，而Sn(II)到Sn(0)的TPR峰向更低温度移动，表明PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂中的Sn物种更容易还原为金属Sn，特别是在PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4中。
