<quotes>
[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[3] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The dehydrogenation of propane is believed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and the presence of CO2 enhances this process due to the occurrence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.
2. The positive influence of CO2 on the β-Ga2O3 catalyst becomes more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.
3. Hydrogen thermogravimetric reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicate that gallium oxide is scarcely reduced below 600°C.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3.
The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 is obviously increased, and the reduction in surface area after reaction is more evident.
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was run on chromium oxide catalyst under the same conditions; the data are listed in Table 1 for comparison. It seems that the specific activity of chromium oxide is higher than that of β-Ga2O3 in the absence of CO2.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts varies with the type of gallium oxide used. β-Ga2O3 shows a lower coke deposition compared to other gallium oxides, especially when CO2 is present. The specific surface area of β-Ga2O3 is likely responsible for its reduced coke formation. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 increases, and there is a more noticeable decrease in surface area after the reaction. 

2. The specific activity of chromium oxide is higher than β-Ga2O3 in the absence of CO2 when comparing both catalysts under similar conditions. This suggests that chromium oxide is more efficient in converting propane to propene without the presence of CO2.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 催化剂上沉积的焦炭量随所使用的镓氧化物类型而变化。β-Ga2O3显示了较低的焦炭沉积，特别是当存在CO2时。β-Ga2O3的特定表面积可能是其减少焦炭形成的原因。在没有CO2的情况下，β-Ga2O3上的焦炭沉积量增加，并且反应后表面积减少了更多。 

2. 在没有CO2的情况下，比较两种催化剂在相似条件下的活性时，铬氧化物的特定活性高于β-Ga2O3。这表明，在没有CO2的情况下，铬氧化物在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面更有效。
