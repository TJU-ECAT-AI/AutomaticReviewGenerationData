[1] "The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."
[2] "Again, the gallium oxides behave differently in the reaction. For all of the catalysts the initial conversion of propane is reduced in the presence of CO2, but the catalysts are more stable with respect to reaction time."
[3] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was run on chromium oxide catalyst under the same conditions; the data are listed in Table 1 for comparison."
[4] "It has been reported that pure gallium oxide cannot be reduced by hydrogen below 600 C [22,23]."
[5] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3."
[6] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."

1. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 leads to a lower amount of coke deposition compared to other gallium oxide catalysts. 
2. In the presence of CO2, the initial conversion of propane decreases across all catalysts, yet they exhibit greater stability over time.
3. The dehydrogenation of propane was also tested on chromium oxide catalyst under identical conditions, providing a comparative dataset.
4. It's known that pure gallium oxide is not reduced by hydrogen below 600 C.
5. NH3-TPD analysis reveals that medium-strength acid sites are prevalent on gallium oxide catalyst surfaces, especially on β-Ga2O3.
6. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this portion of the reducible oxide isn't restored after regeneration with O2.

1. β-Ga2O3的低表面积导致了较低的焦炭沉积量，与其它镓氧化物催化剂相比。
2. 在CO2存在下，所有催化剂的丙烷初始转化率降低，但它们在反应时间内的稳定性更高。
3. 在相同条件下，也对铬氧化物催化剂进行了丙烷脱氢测试，提供了比较数据。
4. 纯镓氧化物在600°C以下无法被氢气还原。
5. NH3-TPD分析表明，这些催化剂表面普遍存在中等强度的酸性位点，特别是β-Ga2O3。
6. 大约有15 mol% 的新鲜镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原，但在用O2再生后，这部分可还原氧化物无法恢复。
