[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[3] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane is believed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and the presence of CO2 enhances this process due to the occurrence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.
2. The positive influence of CO2 on the β-Ga2O3 catalyst becomes more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.
3. Hydrogen thermogravimetric reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicate that gallium oxide is scarcely reduced below 600°C.

1. 烯烃脱氢反应通过异裂解反应途径进行，二氧化碳的存在由于逆向水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦反应的出现而增强这一过程。
2. 在550°C以上，二氧化碳对β-Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用更为明显。
3. 氢气热重分析（H2-TPR）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）研究表明，镓氧化物在600°C以下很难被还原。
