The propane dehydrogenation reaction was run on chromium oxide catalyst under the same conditions; the data are listed in Table 1 for comparison. It seems that the specific activity of chromium oxide is higher than that of β-Ga2O3 in the absence of CO2.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Chromium oxide catalyst shows higher specific activity than β-Ga2O3 catalyst in the absence of CO2.

<quotes>
Again, the gallium oxides behave differently in the reaction. For all of the catalysts the initial conversion of propane is reduced in the presence of CO2, but the catalysts are more stable with respect to reaction time.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
2. In the presence of CO2, the initial propane conversion decreases across all catalysts, yet the catalyst stability increases with time.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
2. 在CO2存在的条件下，所有催化剂的初始丙烷转化率下降，但催化剂在反应过程中的稳定性增加。

<quotes>
The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 is obviously increased, and the reduction in surface area after reaction is more evident.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
3. The lower surface area of β-Ga2O3 likely leads to less coke deposition. Without CO2, more coke is deposited on β-Ga2O3, and a greater surface area reduction is observed post-reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
3. β-Ga2O3较低的表面积可能导致较少的焦炭沉积。在没有CO2的情况下，β-Ga2O3上的焦炭沉积量明显增加，并且反应后表面面积的减少更为明显。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
Moreover, in comparison with chromium oxide, β-Ga2O3 is more active for the reaction in the presence of CO2. Its specific activity is almost twice as great as that of chromium oxide.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. β-Ga2O3 shows greater activity than chromium oxide in the presence of CO2, with its specific activity approximately twice that of chromium oxide.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
4. 在CO2存在下，β-Ga2O3的活性大于铬氧化物，其比活性大约是铬氧化物的两倍。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. The enhancing effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. CO2对β-Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用在550°C以上更明显。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
6. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 might be linked to a large number of medium-strong acid sites on the surface, related to the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ ions and the conjugate action of protons and oxide.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
6. β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能与表面大量中等强度酸性位点有关，这些位点与配位不饱和的Ga3+离子和质子与氧化物的共轭作用相关。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>
