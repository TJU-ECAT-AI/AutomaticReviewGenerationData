1. The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide polymorphs was studied at 500 C in the absence of CO2. The results showed differences in the catalysts' behavior.

2. When CO2 is present, the initial conversion of propane is reduced across all catalysts, but they exhibit better stability over time.

3. In the presence of CO2, β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more active compared to chromium oxide, with a specific activity that is almost twice as high.

4. The lower surface area of β-Ga2O3 contributes to a lesser amount of coke deposition on the catalyst.

5. The impact of the pre-treatment atmosphere on the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was analyzed. 

6. A regeneration process for β-Ga2O3 catalyst at 500 C was attempted.

7. The reducibility of the gallium oxide polymorphs was evaluated using H2-TPR.

8. NH3-TPD measurements revealed that β-Ga2O3 has the highest surface acid site density among the polymorphs, enhancing the reaction through a conjugated effect of protons and oxide.

9. 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy indicated that the surface acidity of gallium oxides is connected to the presence of tetra-coordinated GaIV ions.
