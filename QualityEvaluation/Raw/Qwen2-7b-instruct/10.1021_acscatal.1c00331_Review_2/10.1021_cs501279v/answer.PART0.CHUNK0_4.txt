[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important process for producing propylene."
[2] "Coke formation during PDH is a major issue affecting catalyst stability and efficiency."
[3] "Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can mitigate coke formation by reducing the energy barrier for coke deposition."
[4] "This leads to a decrease in coke accumulation patterns and a stabilization of the catalyst."
[5] "Hydrogen cofeeding also facilitates the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can prevent graphitization."
[6] "These effects contribute to improved overall process efficiency and performance."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the energy barrier for coke deposition, decreasing coke accumulation patterns, facilitating the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and preventing graphitization. These effects lead to improved overall process efficiency and performance.
