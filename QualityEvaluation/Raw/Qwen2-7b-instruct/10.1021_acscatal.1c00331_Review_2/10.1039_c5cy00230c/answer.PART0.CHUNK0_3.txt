[1] "The experimental results show that addition of steam in the PDH reaction will increase the catalysts activities, lower dehydrogenating activation energies and coking rate."
[2] "For PDH under steam atmosphere, the role of surface OH is essential, most likely through Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the first C-H bond activation is the rate determining step in the overall PDH reaction route."

The addition of steam in the PDH process enhances the catalyst activity, reduces the activation energy required for dehydrogenation, and decreases the coking rate. In steam atmosphere, surface hydroxyl (OH) plays a crucial role, particularly through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This mechanism involves the activation of the first C-H bond in propane, which acts as the rate-determining step in the overall PDH reaction pathway.

在PDH过程中添加蒸汽可以提高催化剂活性，降低脱氢反应的能量壁垒，并减少结焦率。在蒸汽气氛下，表面羟基（OH）扮演着至关重要的角色，很可能通过朗缪尔-亨希尔伍德机制。这种机制涉及丙烷中第一个C-H键的活化，在整个PDH反应途径中作为决定性步骤。
