[1] "Compared with dehydrogenation over clean Pt(111) surface, the DFT results show that the energy barriers of different dehydrogenation steps are elevated due to the adsorption of water and its dissociated species."
[2] "The only exception is for i-propyl dehydrogenating to propene step with the involvement of surface -OH through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanism."
[3] "For PDH under steam atmosphere, the role of surface OH is essential, most likely through Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the first C-H bond activation is the rate determining step in the overall PDH reaction route."
[4] "The promoting effect of steam can be ascribed to the removal of cokes deposited on active Pt surfaces and the changes of adsorption species coverage on Pt surface."

1. According to the document, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process leads to increased energy barriers for dehydrogenation steps, except for the i-propyl dehydrogenating to propene step, which benefits from the involvement of surface -OH.
2. The document states that the role of surface OH is essential in PDH under steam atmosphere, especially through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where the first C-H bond activation acts as the rate-determining step.
3. Steam's positive impact on the PDH reaction is attributed to its ability to remove coke deposited on active Pt surfaces and modify the adsorption species coverage on Pt surfaces.
4. The document suggests that hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, leading to increased energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These effects have implications for overall process efficiency and performance.

1. 根据文档，丙烷脱氢过程中的氢共喂料导致不同脱氢步骤的能量壁垒增加，除了异丙基脱氢化为丙烯步骤，该步骤得益于表面-OH的参与。
2. 文档表明，在蒸汽气氛下的PDH反应中，表面OH的作用至关重要，尤其是通过兰格缪尔-希尔沃德机制，在整个PDH反应途径中，第一个C-H键活化作为决定速率的步骤。
3. 文档指出，蒸汽对PDH反应的积极影响归因于其清除沉积在活性铂表面上的焦炭的能力和Pt表面吸附物种覆盖的变化。
4. 文档指出，丙烷脱氢过程中氢共喂料会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，导致能量壁垒增加、焦炭积累模式变化、酸性位点转换和石墨化。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有重要意义。
