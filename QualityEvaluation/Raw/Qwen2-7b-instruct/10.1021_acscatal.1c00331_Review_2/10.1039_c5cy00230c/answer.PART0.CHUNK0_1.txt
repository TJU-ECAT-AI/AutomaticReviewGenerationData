[1] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation over an alumina supported Pt catalyst in the presence of steam is carried out and it is found that the catalyst activity is increased and the apparent activation energy lowered due to the presence of steam."
[2] "The observed enhanced catalysts activity is ascribed to the lowered coking rates as well as the changes in surface coverage due to the co-adsorption of water and the surface oxygenated species."
[3] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate."
[4] "Introducing steam in the feed can strengthen PDH processes by increasing propane equilibrium conversion and lowering the temperature drop of the adiabatic dehydrogenation reactors."
[5] "The role of surface OH is essential, most likely through Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the first C-H bond activation is the rate determining step in the overall PDH reaction route."
[6] "The promoting effect of steam can be ascribed to the removal of cokes deposited on active Pt surfaces and the changes of adsorption species coverage on Pt surface."

1. Propane dehydrogenation activity over a platinum catalyst supported on alumina is increased when steam is present. This results in a reduction of apparent activation energy. The catalyst's activity enhancement is attributed to decreased coke formation rates and altered surface coverage due to the co-adsorption of water and surface oxygenated species.

2. Hydrogen cofeeding improves propene selectivity and reduces coke formation.

3. Steam injection increases propane conversion and reduces the temperature drop in adiabatic dehydrogenation reactors.

4. The surface hydroxyl (OH) group plays a crucial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation process through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This mechanism involves the activation of the first C-H bond in propane, which is the rate-determining step.

5. Steam's positive effect on the catalyst is explained by its capability to remove coke deposits on active platinum surfaces and modify the adsorption species coverage on the platinum surface.

6. The increased catalytic activity observed in steam atmosphere is primarily due to the removal of coke on active Pt surfaces and the changes in surface coverage caused by the co-adsorption of water and oxygenated species.

1. 在铝氧化物支持的铂催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应时，在蒸汽存在的情况下，催化剂活性增加，显着降低活化能。催化剂活性的增强归因于焦炭形成速率的降低以及由于水和表面氧物种的共吸附导致的表面覆盖度变化。

2. 氢气共供给可以提高丙烯选择性并减少焦炭形成。

3. 蒸汽注入可以增加丙烷的转化率，并降低绝热脱氢反应器的温度下降。

4. 表面羟基（OH）组在通过朗缪尔-希恩伍德机制增强脱氢过程中起着关键作用。该机制涉及丙烷中第一个C-H键的激活，这是整体PDH反应路径中的决定性步骤。

5. 蒸汽对催化剂的积极作用可归因于其去除活性铂表面上的焦炭沉积物的能力以及由水和氧物种的共吸附导致的铂表面覆盖度的变化。

6. 在蒸汽气氛下观察到的催化活性增加主要归因于去除活性Pt表面上的焦炭以及由水和氧物种共吸附引起表面覆盖度的变化。
