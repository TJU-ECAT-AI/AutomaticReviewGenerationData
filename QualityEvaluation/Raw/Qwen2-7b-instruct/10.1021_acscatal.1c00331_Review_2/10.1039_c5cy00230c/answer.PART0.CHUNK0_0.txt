[1] "Compared with dehydrogenation over clean Pt(111) surface, the DFT results show that the energy barriers of different dehydrogenation steps are elevated due to the adsorption of water and its dissociated species."
[2] "But, the water adsorption on Pt(111) is weak and may have a low surface coverage, which would limit the effect of steam in a certain range."
[3] "When steam is introduced, the selectivity loss of propene mainly goes to cracking products, in accordance with other authors."
[4] "On these sites, cracking products and coking reaction prevail. Therefore, mono-metallic Pt catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation."
[5] "Since propane dehydrogenation on these sites have lower activation energies, it can also account for the experimentally observed decrease in activation energies."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by enhancing catalyst stability and reducing coking rate. Steam reduces the formation of coke by removing coke deposited on active platinum surfaces. The reduction in coke formation leads to an improvement in overall process efficiency and performance by maintaining a higher proportion of active catalyst surface area. Additionally, steam increases the activity of the catalyst by lowering the activation energy required for propane dehydrogenation, which is attributed to the removal of coke and changes in the surface coverage of adsorbed species on the Pt surface. This effect also contributes to a decrease in the selectivity to propene, which is beneficial as it allows for a higher yield of propene, a more valuable product.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中通过增强催化剂稳定性并减少结焦率，影响结焦形成。蒸汽通过去除沉积在活性铂表面的结焦来减少结焦形成，从而提高整体工艺效率和性能。此外，蒸汽通过降低丙烷脱氢所需的活化能来增加催化剂活性，这归因于去除结焦和Pt表面吸附物种的变化。这种效果也有助于降低丙烯的选择性，这有利于获得更高产率的丙烯，这是更宝贵的产品。
