[5] "The observed enhanced catalysts activity is ascribed to the lowered coking rates as well as the changes in surface coverage due to the co-adsorption of water and the surface oxygenated species."
[6] "The promotion effect of steam can be ascribed to the removal of cokes deposited on active Pt surfaces and the changes of adsorption species coverage on Pt surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The introduction of steam in the PDH process enhances catalyst activity and lowers the apparent activation energy.
2. Steam affects the dehydrogenation process by elevating energy barriers through repulsion interactions between adsorbed species.
3. Surface OH plays a crucial role in enhancing dehydrogenation, particularly in the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.
4. The increase in catalyst activity with steam is attributed to reduced coking rates and altered surface coverage.
5. Steam's promotion effect is due to its capability to remove coke from active Pt surfaces and modify the adsorption species on the surface.

1. 在PDH过程中引入蒸汽可以增强催化剂活性并降低显着的活化能。
2. 蒸汽通过吸附物种之间的排斥作用影响脱氢过程，从而提高能量壁垒。
3. 表面OH在促进脱氢中起关键作用，特别是在兰格缪尔-希恩伍德机制中。
4. 通过蒸汽增加催化剂活性的原因归因于降低结焦速率和表面覆盖度的变化。
5. 蒸汽的促进效果在于其能够从活性Pt表面上去除焦炭，并且能够改变表面的吸附物种。
