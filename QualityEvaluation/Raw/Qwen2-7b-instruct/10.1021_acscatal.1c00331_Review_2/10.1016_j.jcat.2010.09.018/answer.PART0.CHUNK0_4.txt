[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt and PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst materials during 10 successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. Although the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest initial reaction activity, after 6 h of reaction, the catalyst deactivates very fast with propane conversions decreasing from 40% to 5%. After this first reaction and subsequent isothermal regeneration process, the catalytic activity is observed to be much lower during the second and third reaction cycles, resulting in almost no net conversion after three dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[2] "In contrast, the presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."
[3] "Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The corresponding propene selectivities of the Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. It is clear that for the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases with reaction time."
[5] "However, in contrast, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst not only shows higher overall propene selectivity, but also the selectivity increases gradually throughout the experiment."
[6] "For the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, an initial D over G ratio of 0.4 is observed. This ratio increases with time on stream until reaching a value of around 1 where it remains constant even after one hour of reaction."
[7] "In the case of the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, the initial D over G ratio is around 0.7 and remains almost constant during the cycle, indicating that no changes take place in the nature of the coke."
[8] "However, after the first regeneration process, the coke formed at the beginning of the next dehydrogenation cycle seems more disordered and with reaction time, the D over G ratio first increases, but after one hour-on-stream the D over G ratio decreases."
[9] "These results suggest that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
[10] "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtASn alloy formation is detected."
[11] "Moreover, for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, it is necessary to introduce another coordination shell, namely PtASn, at similar distances as the PtAPt first shell (R = 2.76 Å) to obtain a good fit to the data. The presence of this PtASn coordination shell is evidence for the existence of a PtASn alloy in the catalyst."
[12] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size of the Pt nanoclusters as lower coordination numbers are obtained for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material."
[13] "The EXAFS results suggest the formation of 11 atom semispherical-like nanoparticles, for the fresh PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is poor in Sn. More specifically, the Sn atoms are located at the surface of these Pt nanoparticle entities."
[14] "After one dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle, both the Pt nanoparticle size and the Sn content in the PtASn alloy increase but this time resulting in the formation of a coreshell type structure where Sn is located in the outer layer."
[15] "However, after 10 successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, not only the number of Sn atoms increases, but also their dilution in the whole Pt nanoparticles. These effects give rise to more homogeneous bimetallic entities."
[16] "The CO desorption curves shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the addition of Sn decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and also that these surface species desorb at lower temperatures."

1. The catalytic performance of the Pt and PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst materials shows a decrease in activity over successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, especially for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of Sn as a promoter significantly improves the catalyst's performance, maintaining high propane conversion and propene selectivity throughout the experiment.

2. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher net conversion rates compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst during the experiment.

3. The propene selectivity for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst decreases with reaction time, whereas the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst shows an increase in selectivity over time.

4. The D over G ratio for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases with reaction time, suggesting a change in the nature of the coke formed. In contrast, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst maintains a constant D over G ratio, indicating no change in coke nature.

5. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst experiences a gradual catalyst deactivation, but it always achieves higher net conversions compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

6. The addition of Sn to the catalyst system decreases the particle size of the Pt nanoparticles and leads to a PtASn alloy formation, indicated by a red shift in the 5f Continuum Resonance (CR).

7. The EXAFS analysis reveals that the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst forms semispherical-like nanoparticles with Sn atoms primarily located at the surface of these particles.

8. After one dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle, the Pt nanoparticles and the PtASn alloy increase in size and Sn content, forming a core-shell structure with Sn on the outer layer.

9. After ten cycles, the PtASn alloy in the catalyst shows an increase in the number of Sn atoms and a dilution throughout the entire Pt nanoparticles, leading to more homogeneous bimetallic entities.

10. The addition of Sn to the catalyst system decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and causes these species to desorb at lower temperatures, possibly due to the modified adsorption properties of the Pt species in the PtASn alloy.
