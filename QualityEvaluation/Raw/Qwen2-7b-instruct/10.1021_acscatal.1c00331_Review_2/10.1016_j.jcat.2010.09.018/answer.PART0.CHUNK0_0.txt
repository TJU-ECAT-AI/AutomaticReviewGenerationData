[1] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more centers on the surface available for CO adsorption. However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."
[2] "The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen can lower the energy barriers for coke formation, leading to faster coke accumulation. This can affect the stability of the catalyst and the efficiency of the process. Hydrogen can also lead to the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can impact the reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen can facilitate the graphitization process, affecting the structure and electronic properties of the catalyst. These effects collectively influence the overall performance and efficiency of the propane dehydrogenation process.
