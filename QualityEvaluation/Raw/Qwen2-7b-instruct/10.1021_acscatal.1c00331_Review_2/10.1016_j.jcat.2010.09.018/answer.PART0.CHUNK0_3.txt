[1] "A 10-fold successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycling study, similar to that employed in an industrial propane dehydrogenation reactor, was performed in order to examine the catalyst activity and stability as well as the propene selectivity."
[2] "However, during the first dehydrogenation cycle, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst shows lower initial propane conversion and a higher rate of coke formation when compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "In contrast, the presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."
[4] "Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "The addition of Sn decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and also that these surface species desorb at lower temperatures."

1. A 10-fold dehydrogenation-regeneration cycling study was carried out to assess catalyst activity, stability, and propene selectivity, resembling industrial propane dehydrogenation reactor conditions. 
2. In the first dehydrogenation cycle, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst had lower initial propane conversion and faster coke formation than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
3. The presence of Sn as a promoter significantly enhances catalyst performance, offering higher propane conversion and propene selectivity that remains consistent across the initial dehydrogenation step.
4. Despite gradual catalyst deactivation, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst always achieves higher net conversion compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst throughout the experiment.
5. Adding Sn reduces the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and enables these species to desorb at lower temperatures.

1. 进行了10次连续加氢再生循环研究，以评估催化剂活性、稳定性和丙烯选择性，模拟工业丙烷脱氢反应器条件。
2. 在首次脱氢步骤中，PtASn/Al2O3催化剂的初始丙烷转化率较低且形成焦炭的速度较快，与Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比。
3. 添加锡作为促进剂能显著提高催化剂性能，提供更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，并在整个初始脱氢步骤中保持一致。
4. 尽管催化剂逐渐失活，但整个实验期间PtASn/Al2O3催化剂的净转化率始终高于Pt/Al2O3催化剂。
5. 添加锡减少了Pt纳米颗粒上初始吸附的CO量，并使这些表面物种在较低温度下脱附。
