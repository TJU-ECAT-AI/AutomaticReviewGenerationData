[1] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more centers on the surface available for CO adsorption."
[2] "However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process may not directly affect coke formation or catalyst stability, but it can influence the reaction mechanisms. By altering the energy barriers and promoting certain pathways, hydrogen can potentially mitigate coke accumulation. The coke formation patterns could be altered, leading to different deposition rates and locations on the catalyst surface. Acid site conversions might also be affected, as hydrogen can act as a deactivating agent, potentially reducing the number of active sites available for coke formation. Graphitization, the transformation of coke into a more ordered, graphite-like structure, could also be influenced by hydrogen, depending on its concentration and the reaction conditions. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance would depend on how effectively hydrogen can prevent or delay coke buildup while maintaining or improving the yield of desired products like propene.

在丙烷脱氢过程中的氢共喂养可能不会直接影响焦炭形成或催化剂稳定性，但它可以影响反应机制。通过改变能量壁垒并促进某些途径，氢气有可能减轻焦炭积累。焦炭形成模式可能会被改变，导致焦炭沉积速率和位置的不同。酸性位点的转化也可能受到影响，因为氢气可以作为活性降低剂，可能减少可用于焦炭形成的活性位点数量。焦石的转化，即焦炭转化为更有序、石墨状结构的过程，也可能受到氢的影响，这取决于其浓度和反应条件。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响将取决于氢气是否能有效地防止或延迟焦炭积聚，同时保持或改善所需产品的产率，如丙烯。

[1] "For the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases with reaction time."
[2] "However, in contrast, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst not only shows higher overall propene selectivity, but also the selectivity increases gradually throughout the experiment."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases over time as the reaction progresses. Conversely, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates not only higher overall propene selectivity but also an incremental increase in selectivity as the experiment continues.

对于新鲜的Pt/Al2O3催化剂，丙烯选择性随反应时间的推移而降低。相反，PtASn/Al2O3催化剂不仅显示出更高的总体丙烯选择性，而且在整个实验过程中选择性逐渐增加。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Adding Sn reduces the size of Pt particles, creating more surface centers available for CO adsorption. However, the observed lesser amount of CO indicates that Sn partially occupies these centers, as predicted by our EXAFS analysis models.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
添加Sn减小了Pt颗粒的尺寸，从而创造了更多的表面中心用于CO吸附。然而，观察到的较少的CO量表明，Sn部分占据了这些中心，正如我们的EXAFS分析模型所预测的那样。
