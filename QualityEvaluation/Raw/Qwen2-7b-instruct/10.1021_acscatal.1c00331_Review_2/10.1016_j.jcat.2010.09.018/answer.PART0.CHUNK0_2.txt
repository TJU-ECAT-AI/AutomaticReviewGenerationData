[1] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more centers on the surface available for CO adsorption."
[2] "However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."
[3] "On the other hand, Pt sites in the PtASn alloy are more electron deficient since Sn draws electron density away from Pt."
[4] "Therefore, the adsorption properties of Pt are also modified by the presence of Sn: the more electron-poor Pt species adsorb CO more weakly and, as a consequence, COads species desorb at lower temperatures."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process leads to several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, and overall process efficiency. Firstly, the addition of hydrogen increases the surface area of the catalyst, creating more sites for CO adsorption. This can potentially reduce the amount of CO adsorption, as observed in the CO-TPD IR analysis. Secondly, the presence of hydrogen alters the electronic properties of the Pt sites, making them more electron deficient. This modification affects the adsorption of CO, causing it to occur more weakly and at lower temperatures. Consequently, the CO species desorb more efficiently, impacting the PDH process positively by reducing the accumulation of CO and the potential for coke formation.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机制以及整体过程效率产生了影响。首先，氢的加入增加了催化剂的表面面积，形成了更多的CO吸附位点。这可能导致CO吸附量减少，如CO-TPD红外分析所示。其次，氢的存在改变了Pt位点的电子性质，使其变得更加电子缺乏。这种修改影响了CO的吸附，导致其吸附得更弱，并且在较低温度下发生。因此，CO物种的脱附更加有效，对PDH过程产生积极影响，减少了CO积累和潜在的焦炭形成。
