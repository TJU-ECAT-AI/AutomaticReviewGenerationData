[1] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more centers on the surface available for CO adsorption. However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."
[2] "The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen can lower the energy barriers for coke formation, leading to faster coke accumulation. This can affect the stability of the catalyst and the efficiency of the process. Hydrogen can also lead to the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can impact the reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen can facilitate the graphitization process, affecting the structure and electronic properties of the catalyst. These effects collectively influence the overall performance and efficiency of the propane dehydrogenation process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process may not directly affect coke formation or catalyst stability, but it can influence the reaction mechanisms. By altering the energy barriers and promoting certain pathways, hydrogen can potentially mitigate coke accumulation. The coke formation patterns could be altered, leading to different deposition rates and locations on the catalyst surface. Acid site conversions might also be affected, as hydrogen can act as a deactivating agent, potentially reducing the number of active sites available for coke formation. Graphitization, the transformation of coke into a more ordered, graphite-like structure, could also be influenced by hydrogen, depending on its concentration and the reaction conditions. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance would depend on how effectively hydrogen can prevent or delay coke buildup while maintaining or improving the yield of desired products like propene.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在丙烷脱氢过程中的氢共喂养可能不会直接影响焦炭形成或催化剂稳定性，但它可以影响反应机制。通过改变能量壁垒并促进某些途径，氢气有可能减轻焦炭积累。焦炭形成模式可能会被改变，导致焦炭沉积速率和位置的不同。酸性位点的转化也可能受到影响，因为氢气可以作为活性降低剂，可能减少可用于焦炭形成的活性位点数量。焦石的转化，即焦炭转化为更有序、石墨状结构的过程，也可能受到氢的影响，这取决于其浓度和反应条件。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响将取决于氢气是否能有效地防止或延迟焦炭积聚，同时保持或改善所需产品的产率，如丙烯。

[2] "However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."
[3] "On the other hand, Pt sites in the PtASn alloy are more electron deficient since Sn draws electron density away from Pt."
[4] "Therefore, the adsorption properties of Pt are also modified by the presence of Sn: the more electron-poor Pt species adsorb CO more weakly and, as a consequence, COads species desorb at lower temperatures."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process leads to several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, and overall process efficiency. Firstly, the addition of hydrogen increases the surface area of the catalyst, creating more sites for CO adsorption. This can potentially reduce the amount of CO adsorption, as observed in the CO-TPD IR analysis. Secondly, the presence of hydrogen alters the electronic properties of the Pt sites, making them more electron deficient. This modification affects the adsorption of CO, causing it to occur more weakly and at lower temperatures. Consequently, the CO species desorb more efficiently, impacting the PDH process positively by reducing the accumulation of CO and the potential for coke formation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机制以及整体过程效率产生了影响。首先，氢的加入增加了催化剂的表面面积，形成了更多的CO吸附位点。这可能导致CO吸附量减少，如CO-TPD红外分析所示。其次，氢的存在改变了Pt位点的电子性质，使其变得更加电子缺乏。这种修改影响了CO的吸附，导致其吸附得更弱，并且在较低温度下发生。因此，CO物种的脱附更加有效，对PDH过程产生积极影响，减少了CO积累和潜在的焦炭形成。

[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt and PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst materials during 10 successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. Although the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest initial reaction activity, after 6 h of reaction, the catalyst deactivates very fast with propane conversions decreasing from 40% to 5%. After this first reaction and subsequent isothermal regeneration process, the catalytic activity is observed to be much lower during the second and third reaction cycles, resulting in almost no net conversion after three dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[2] "In contrast, the presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."
[3] "Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The corresponding propene selectivities of the Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. It is clear that for the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases with reaction time."
[5] "However, in contrast, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst not only shows higher overall propene selectivity, but also the selectivity increases gradually throughout the experiment."
[6] "For the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, an initial D over G ratio of 0.4 is observed. This ratio increases with time on stream until reaching a value of around 1 where it remains constant even after one hour of reaction."
[7] "In the case of the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, the initial D over G ratio is around 0.7 and remains almost constant during the cycle, indicating that no changes take place in the nature of the coke."
[8] "However, after the first regeneration process, the coke formed at the beginning of the next dehydrogenation cycle seems more disordered and with reaction time, the D over G ratio first increases, but after one hour-on-stream the D over G ratio decreases."
[9] "These results suggest that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
[10] "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtASn alloy formation is detected."
[11] "Moreover, for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, it is necessary to introduce another coordination shell, namely PtASn, at similar distances as the PtAPt first shell (R = 2.76 Å) to obtain a good fit to the data. The presence of this PtASn coordination shell is evidence for the existence of a PtASn alloy in the catalyst."
[12] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size of the Pt nanoclusters as lower coordination numbers are obtained for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material."
[13] "The EXAFS results suggest the formation of 11 atom semispherical-like nanoparticles, for the fresh PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is poor in Sn. More specifically, the Sn atoms are located at the surface of these Pt nanoparticle entities."
[14] "After one dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle, both the Pt nanoparticle size and the Sn content in the PtASn alloy increase but this time resulting in the formation of a coreshell type structure where Sn is located in the outer layer."
[15] "However, after 10 successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, not only the number of Sn atoms increases, but also their dilution in the whole Pt nanoparticles. These effects give rise to more homogeneous bimetallic entities."
[16] "The CO desorption curves shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the addition of Sn decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and also that these surface species desorb at lower temperatures."

10. The addition of Sn to the catalyst system decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles and causes these species to desorb at lower temperatures, possibly due to the modified adsorption properties of the Pt species in the PtASn alloy.
