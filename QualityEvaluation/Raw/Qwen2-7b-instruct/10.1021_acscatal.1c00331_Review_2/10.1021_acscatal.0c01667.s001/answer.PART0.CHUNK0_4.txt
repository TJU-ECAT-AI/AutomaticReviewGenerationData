Hydrogen cofeeding affects the propane dehydrogenation process by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It influences the stability of the catalyst and the efficiency of the reaction mechanisms. The provided figures and table demonstrate how different hydrogen-to-propane ratios impact the conversion and selectivity of the reaction, which are crucial factors in assessing the overall process efficiency and performance.
