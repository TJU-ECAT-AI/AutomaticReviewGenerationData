The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It impacts the overall process efficiency and performance by altering the selectivity and conversion rates of products such as methane, ethylene, and propylene. In the context of Ru-based phosphide catalysts, hydrogen cofeeding can lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and stability, affecting the propylene selectivity and propane conversion. The specific effects depend on the interaction between hydrogen and the catalyst surface, which can influence the reaction pathways and product distributions.
