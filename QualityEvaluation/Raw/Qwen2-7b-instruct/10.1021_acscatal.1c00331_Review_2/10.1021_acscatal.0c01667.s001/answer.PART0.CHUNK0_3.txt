Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It influences energy barriers, changes coke accumulation patterns, impacts acid site conversions, and alters graphitization. These effects lead to modifications in the overall process efficiency and performance.

The impact of hydrogen cofeeding is demonstrated through comparisons with monometallic Ru catalysts. The figures show that hydrogen cofeeding alters the selectivity towards methane and ethylene, as well as propylene, at different operating temperatures and hydrogen-to-propane ratios. The propylene selectivity varies significantly across the different Ru-P catalysts tested under identical conditions, indicating the influence of hydrogen cofeeding on the reaction mechanism and product distribution.

The conversion vs. selectivity at 600°C and atmospheric pressure with varying hydrogen-to-propane ratios further illustrates how hydrogen cofeeding affects the reaction kinetics and product yield. This highlights the importance of hydrogen cofeeding in controlling the PDH process, impacting both the rate of reaction and the distribution of products.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process has substantial implications for coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It enables better control over the product distribution, enhancing the overall process efficiency and performance. The detailed analysis provided in the figures offers insights into the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH reaction, supporting the optimization of the process for improved yields and selectivities.
