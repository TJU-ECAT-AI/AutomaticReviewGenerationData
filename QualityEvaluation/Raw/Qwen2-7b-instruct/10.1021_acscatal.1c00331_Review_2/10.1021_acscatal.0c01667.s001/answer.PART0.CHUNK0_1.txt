The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects the formation of coke, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance through changes in selectivity and conversion rates. For instance, Figure S5 compares the initial methane and ethylene selectivities for various Ru-P catalysts at different temperatures against a monometallic Ru catalyst. Table S1 outlines the catalytic conditions and corresponding reaction rates for C3H8 dehydrogenation at a 25% propane conversion. Figures S7 and S8 depict the propylene selectivity and propane conversion over various Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts under specific operating conditions, highlighting how hydrogen cofeeding influences these parameters.
