The document provides experimental data comparing the performance of different catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, including Ru/SiO2, Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, Ru-P/SiO2-15, and Ru-P/SiO2-50. These figures and tables show how hydrogen cofeeding affects the conversion of propane to propylene, methane, and ethylene, as well as the overall reaction rates and selectivities under various operating conditions.

The figures demonstrate that hydrogen cofeeding influences the coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This has implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as it affects the yield of desired products and the longevity of the catalyst.
