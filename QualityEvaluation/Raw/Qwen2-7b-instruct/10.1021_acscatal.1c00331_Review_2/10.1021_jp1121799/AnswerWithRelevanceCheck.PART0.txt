          Density Functional Theory was utilized to examine the adsorption processes of propane and propene on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces, providing insights into reaction pathways, energy obstacles, coke formation, and catalyst stability. Hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, and acid site conversions, impacting reaction kinetics and potentially reducing activation energy barriers. This leads to faster propane conversion into propene but may also contribute to coke formation on the catalyst surface, affecting its stability and decreasing overall reaction efficiency. Hydrogen's influence on acid site conversions and its potential impact on catalyst surface graphitization further complicates the process, affecting activity.

          使用密度泛函理论研究了丙烷和丙烯在Pt(111)和PtSn合金表面的吸附过程，揭示了反应机制、能量壁垒、焦炭生成和催化剂稳定性的深入理解。氢共供给影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式和酸性位点的转化，影响反应动力学，并可能降低激活能壁垒。这导致了丙烷向丙烯的更快转化，但同时也可能导致催化剂表面焦炭的形成，损害其稳定性并降低总体反应效率。氢对酸性位点的转化作用及其对催化剂表面石墨化的潜在影响进一步增加了过程的复杂性，影响了活性。
