<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects the energy barriers, leading to faster propane conversion into propene. However, it can also contribute to coke formation on the catalyst surface, which negatively impacts catalyst stability and reduces the overall reaction efficiency. Hydrogen's effect on acid site conversions is complex, and it might influence the graphitization of the catalyst surface, further affecting its activity.
