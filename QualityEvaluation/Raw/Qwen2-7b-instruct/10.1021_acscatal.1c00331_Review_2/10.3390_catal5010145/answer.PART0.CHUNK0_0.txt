[1] "Deactivation of supported metals by carbon or coke may occur chemically, owing to chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically and mechanically, owing to blocking of surface sites, metal crystallite encapsulation, plugging of pores, and destruction of catalyst pellets by carbon filaments."
[2] "Carbon may (1) chemisorb strongly as a monolayer or physically adsorb in multilayers and in either case block access of reactants to metal surface sites, (2) totally encapsulate a metal particle and thereby completely deactivate that particle, and (3) plug micro- and mesopores such that access of reactants is denied to many crystallites inside these pores."
[3] "Filamentous carbon formation rate is a strong function of reactant hydrocarbon structure; for example, it decreases in the order acetylenes, olefins, paraffins, i.e., in order of decreasing reactivity."

To address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, one must consider its influence on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen cofeeding can lower the activation energy for dehydrogenation reactions, potentially reducing the formation of coke precursors like olefins and aromatics. This can stabilize the catalyst by preventing the buildup of coke-forming species, enhancing the overall process efficiency and performance.

The implications of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process include:
1. By lowering the energy barriers for dehydrogenation, hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the formation of coke precursors, thus protecting the catalyst from deactivation.
2. It can alter the coke accumulation patterns by shifting the reaction pathways towards more desirable products, potentially reducing the formation of coke.
3. Hydrogen can help in the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may contribute to a more stable catalyst environment and improved selectivity.
4. It may also influence the rate of graphitization, which is a key factor in catalyst deactivation. Lowering the graphitization rate can extend the catalyst life and maintain its performance over time.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can have significant positive impacts on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, leading to improved process efficiency and performance.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中氢共喂料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的影响，需要考虑其对活化能、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响。氢共喂料可以降低脱氢反应的活化能，可能减少形成焦炭前体如烯烃和芳烃的数量，从而保护催化剂免受失活。

氢共喂料在PDH过程中的影响包括：
1. 通过降低脱氢反应的活化能，氢共喂料可以减少焦炭前体的形成，从而保护催化剂免于失活。
2. 它可以改变焦炭积累模式，通过改变反应途径的方向，可能减少焦炭的形成。
3. 氢可以帮助转换催化剂表面的酸性位点，这可能有助于保持更稳定的催化剂环境和提高选择性。
4. 它还可能影响石墨化的速率，这是催化剂失活的关键因素。降低石墨化速率可以延长催化剂寿命并维持其性能。

总之，氢共喂料在PDH过程中可以产生显著的积极影响，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制有改善作用，从而提高工艺效率和性能。
