[1] "Generally, the rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration."
[2] "Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation."
[3] "The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of supported metals, both chemical and physical."
[4] "Physical loss of activity also occurs as coke accumulates, ultimately partially or completely blocking catalyst pores as in supported metal catalysts."
[5] "Apparently, the blocking of active sites does not significantly affect porosity or catalyst surface area, as SiO2/Al2O3 contains relatively large mesopores."
[6] "Indeed, deactivation is typically more rapid in zeolites having small pores or apertures and/or a monodimensional structure."
[7] "Coking is relatively slow and deactivation is mainly due to acid-site poisoning, while at long contact times, coking is much faster because of the high concentrations of coke precursors."
[8] "That coke formed at large contact times not only blocks pores and/or pore intersections inside the zeolite, but also migrates to the outside of zeolite crystallites, where it blocks pore entrances."
[9] "Sintering processes generally take place at high reaction temperatures (e.g., > 500 C) and are generally accelerated by the presence of water vapor."
[10] "Metal crystallite stability depends on the volatility of metal oxides and the strength of the metal-oxide support interaction."
[11] "For example, sintering of copper catalysts for methanol synthesis is promoted by traces of chlorine in the feed, which react at about 225 C (500 K) with the active metal/metal oxide surface to produce a highly mobile copper chloride phase having a Tamman temperature of only 79174 C (352447 K) relative to 405527 C (678800 K) for copper metal or metal oxides."
[12] "The effect of temperature on sintering of metals and oxides can be understood physically in terms of the driving forces for dissociation and diffusion of surface atoms, which are both proportional to the fractional approach to the absolute melting point temperature (Tmp)."
[13] "For example, sintering of copper catalysts for methanol synthesis is promoted by traces of chlorine in the feed, which react at about 225 C (500 K) with the active metal/metal oxide surface to produce a highly mobile copper chloride phase having a Tamman temperature of only 79174 C (352447 K) relative to 405527 C (678800 K) for copper metal or metal oxides."
[14] "There is direct evidence from the previous studies of model-supported catalysts [104,107] for the occurrence of crystallite migration (mainly in well-dispersed systems early in the sintering process), atomic migration (mainly at longer sintering times), and spreading of metal crystallites (mainly in oxygen atmosphere)."
[15] "For example, the rate of loss of Ru during CO hydrogenation (H2/CO = 1, 200250 C, 1 atm) on Ru/NaY zeolite and Ru/Al2O3 for extended periods of time was significant (e.g., up to 40% while flowing CO at 175275 C over Ru/Al2O3 for 24 h)."
[16] "Decomposition of volatile platinum oxide species formed during high temperature reaction may (similar to the previously discussed formation of large crystallites of Ni from Ni(CO)4) lead to formation of large Pt crystallites and/or substantial restructuring of the metal surface."
[17] "While little Pt is volatilized from the PtRh gauze catalyst during HCN synthesis, the extensive restructuring leads to mechanical weakening of the gauze."
