In addition to hydrocarbon structure and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are also a function of the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. Generally, the rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration. Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation. For example, coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm) [82].

焦炭形成的速度和程度随催化剂的酸性和孔结构的增加而增加。焦炭生成量随孔径尺寸的减小而减少，特别是在沸石中，形状选择性对焦炭形成起着重要作用。例如，在流化催化裂化中，ZSM-5（孔直径为0.54×0.56纳米）的焦炭产率为0.4%，而Y-富勒烯的产率则为2.2%（开口直径为0.72纳米）。

The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of supported metals, both chemical and physical. However, some aspects of the chemistry are quite different. The principal chemical loss of activity in oxides and sulfides is due to the strong adsorption of coke molecules on acidic sites. However, as discussed earlier, strong acid sites also play an important role in the formation of coke precursors, which subsequently undergo condensation reactions to produce large polynuclear aromatic molecules that physically coat catalytic surfaces.

Answer: The deactivation of oxide and sulfide catalysts by coke follows both chemical and physical mechanisms, similar to supported metals. The main chemical loss of activity is caused by the strong adsorption of coke molecules onto acidic sites. Strong acid sites also contribute to the formation of coke precursors, which then undergo condensation reactions to create large polynuclear aromatic molecules that physically coat the catalytic surfaces.

焦炭通过氧化物和硫化物催化剂的机制，既有化学的也有物理的，与支持金属的情况类似。活性的主要化学损失是由于焦炭分子在酸性位点上的强烈吸附。强酸位点也参与了焦炭前体的形成，这些前体随后进行缩合反应生成大的多核芳香族分子，物理地覆盖了催化表面。

Catalyst deactivation by solid-state diffusion and reaction appears to be an important mechanism for degradation of complex multicomponent catalysts in dehydrogenation, synthesis, partial oxidation, and total oxidation reactions [8,149160]. However, it is difficult in most of these reactions to know the extent to which the solid-state processes, such as diffusion and solid-state reaction, are affected by surface reactions. For example, the rate of diffusion of Al2O3 to the surface to form an aluminate may be enhanced by the presence of gas-phase oxygen or water or the nucleation of a different phase may be induced by either reducing or oxidizing conditions.

Answer: Solid-state diffusion and reactions appear to be a significant mechanism for the degradation of complex multi-component catalysts in dehydrogenation, synthesis, partial oxidation, and total oxidation reactions. It is challenging to determine the impact of surface reactions on solid-state processes like diffusion and reactions in these reactions. Conditions such as gas-phase oxygen or water can enhance the diffusion of Al2O3 to form an aluminate, and phase nucleation can be influenced by reducing or oxidizing conditions.

在脱氢、合成、部分氧化和完全氧化反应中，固态扩散和反应似乎是复杂多组分催化剂降解的重要机制。在这些反应中确定表面反应对固态过程（如扩散和反应）的影响难度较大。例如，Al2O3向表面扩散形成铝酸盐的速率可能因气体相氧气或水的存在而增强，或者在还原或氧化条件下，不同相的核化可能被诱导。
