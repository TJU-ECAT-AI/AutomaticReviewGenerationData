1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It can impact energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This affects the overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The rate at which carbon or coke is accumulated in a given reaction varies significantly with catalyst structure. This includes metal type, metal crystallite size, promoter, and catalyst support.

3. In steam reforming, the rate of filamentous carbon formation is influenced by the structure of reactant hydrocarbons. Acetylenes, olefins, and paraffins exhibit decreasing reactivity, yet the activation energies for nickel remain in the same range (125139 kJ) regardless of hydrocarbon structure.

4. Hydrogen cofeeding in PDH can alter the energy barriers involved in coke formation, affecting the stability and performance of the catalyst. It can also influence the reaction mechanisms by converting acid sites and promoting graphitization.

5. Filamentous carbon formation rate in steam reforming is sensitive to the hydrocarbon structure, following the order acetylenes, olefins, and paraffins. This indicates that the structure of the hydrocarbons plays a crucial role in determining the rate of carbon deposition.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂料可以影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。它会影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，从而影响整体过程效率和性能。

2. 在给定条件下，碳或焦炭的累积速率会显著地依赖于催化剂结构。这包括金属类型、晶粒大小、促进剂以及催化剂支撑材料。

3. 在蒸汽重整中，碳纤维形成速率受到烃类反应物结构的影响。炔烃、烯烃和烷烃表现出递减的反应性，然而，镍的激活能保持在相同范围（125139 kJ），无论烃类结构如何。

4. PDH中的氢气共喂料可以改变参与焦炭形成的能量壁垒，影响催化剂的稳定性和性能。它还可以通过转换酸性位点和促进石墨化来影响反应机制。

5. 蒸汽重整中，碳纤维形成速率对烃类结构敏感，遵循炔烃、烯烃和烷烃的顺序。这表明烃类结构在决定碳沉积速率方面起着关键作用。
