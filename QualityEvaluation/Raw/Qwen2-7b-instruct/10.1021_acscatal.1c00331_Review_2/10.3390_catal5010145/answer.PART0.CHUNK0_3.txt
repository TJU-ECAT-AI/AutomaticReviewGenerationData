1. Deactivation of supported metals by carbon or coke can happen chemically, through chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically and mechanically, by blocking surface sites, encapsulating metal crystallites, plugging pores, and destroying catalyst pellets via carbon filaments.

2. The rate of filamentous carbon formation in steam reforming is significantly influenced by the structure of reactant hydrocarbons. The rate decreases in the order of acetylenes, olefins, paraffins, which correlates with their decreasing reactivity.

3. Similarly, the rate of filamentous carbon formation in steam reforming is strongly dependent on the structure of reactant hydrocarbons. The rate decreases in the order of acetylenes, olefins, paraffins, reflecting their decreasing reactivity.

1. 碳或焦炭在支撑金属上的失活可以通过化学吸附或碳化形成，或者通过阻塞表面位点、封装金属晶粒、堵塞孔隙和破坏催化剂颗粒中的碳纤维来物理和机械地发生。

2. 蒸汽重整中纤维状碳形成的速率显著受到反应物烃结构的影响。速率按炔烃、烯烃、烷烃的顺序递减，与它们的反应性递减相一致。

3. 类似地，蒸汽重整中纤维状碳形成的速率强烈依赖于反应物烃的结构。速率按炔烃、烯烃、烷烃的顺序递减，反映了它们的递减反应性。
