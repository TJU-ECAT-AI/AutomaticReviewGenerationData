"In addition to hydrocarbon structure and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are also a function of the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst."
"The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of supported metals, both chemical and physical."
"Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation."
"For example, coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm)."
"However, in pores of molecular diameter, a relatively small quantity of coke can cause substantial loss of activity."
"It should be emphasized that coke yield can vary considerably into the interior pores of a catalyst particle or along a catalyst bed, depending upon the extent to which the main and deactivation reactions are affected by film mass transport and pore diffusional resistance."

Answer: The extent and rate of coke formation in catalytic processes are influenced by the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. This impacts the efficiency and performance of the catalyst, particularly in processes like fluid catalytic cracking. For instance, in fluid catalytic cracking, the coke yield varies significantly based on the pore size and acidity of the catalyst. Coke formation can lead to substantial loss of activity, especially in pores of molecular diameter. The yield of coke can differ greatly within the interior pores of a catalyst particle or across the catalyst bed, depending on factors such as film mass transport and pore diffusional resistance.

在催化过程中，焦炭形成的速度和程度受到催化剂的酸性和孔结构的影响。这影响了催化剂的效率和性能，尤其是在流化床催化裂解等过程中。例如，在流化床催化裂解中，焦炭生成量会根据催化剂的孔径大小和酸性而显著变化。在分子直径的孔中，少量的焦炭就可能导致活性大幅下降。焦炭生成量在催化剂颗粒内部的孔或催化剂床层之间可能有很大差异，这取决于薄膜质量传输和孔扩散阻力等因素。
