Generally, the rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration.
Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation.
For example, coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm).

The rate and extent of coke formation increase with increased acid strength and concentration. Conversely, coke yield decreases with smaller pore size, particularly in zeolites where shape selectivity significantly influences coke formation. As an example, the coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking for ZSM-5, with pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm, is only 0.4%, whereas for Y-faujasite with an aperture diameter of 0.72 nm, the coke yield is 2.2%.

一般来说，酸强度和浓度增加会增加焦炭形成的速度和程度。相反，孔径尺寸减小（对于固定的酸强度和浓度）会导致焦炭产量下降，特别是在择形性较强的沸石中，形状选择性对焦炭形成起着重要作用。例如，在流化催化裂化中，ZSM-5的孔径为0.54 × 0.56 nm时，焦炭产率为0.4%，而Y沸石的孔径为0.72 nm时，焦炭产率为2.2%。

In the case of supported bifunctional metal/metal oxide catalysts, different kinds of coke are formed on the metal and the acidic oxide support, e.g., soft coke (high H/C ratio) on Pt or PtRe metals and hard coke (low H/C ratio) on the alumina support in catalytic reforming.
