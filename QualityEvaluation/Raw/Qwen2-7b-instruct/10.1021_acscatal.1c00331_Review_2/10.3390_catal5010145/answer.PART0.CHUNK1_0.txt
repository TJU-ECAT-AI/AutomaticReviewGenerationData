"In addition to hydrocarbon structure and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are also a function of the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst."
"The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of supported metals, both chemical and physical."
"The rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration."
"Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation."
"For example, coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm)."

Answer: 
The extent and rate of coke formation in catalytic processes are influenced by the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. Acid strength and concentration positively correlate with the rate and extent of coke formation. Conversely, decreasing pore size reduces the coke yield, particularly in zeolites where shape selectivity significantly impacts coke formation. For instance, in fluid catalytic cracking, the coke yield for ZSM-5, with pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm, is 0.4%, compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite with an aperture diameter of 0.72 nm.

在催化过程中，焦炭形成的程度和速率受催化剂的酸性和孔结构的影响。酸强度和浓度与焦炭形成的速度和程度正相关。相反，减小孔径会降低焦炭产量，尤其是在具有形状选择性的沸石中，其对焦炭形成有重要影响。例如，在流化催化裂化中，ZSM-5的焦炭产率为0.4%，其孔径为0.54×0.56 nm，而孔径为0.72 nm的Y沸石的焦炭产率则为2.2%。
