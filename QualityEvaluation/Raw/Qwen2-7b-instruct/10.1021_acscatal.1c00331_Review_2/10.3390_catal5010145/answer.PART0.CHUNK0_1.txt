[1] "Deactivation of supported metals by carbon or coke may occur chemically, owing to chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically and mechanically, owing to blocking of surface sites, metal crystallite encapsulation, plugging of pores, and destruction of catalyst pellets by carbon filaments."
[2] "Carbon formation and gasification rates are influenced differently by modifications in metal crystallite surface chemistry, which are in turn a function of catalyst structure, oxide additives or oxide supports may be used to moderate the rate of undesirable carbon or coke accumulation."
[3] "Since formation of coke, graphite, or filamentous carbon involves the formation of C-C bonds on multiple atoms sites, one might expect that coke or carbon formation on metals is structure-sensitive, i.e., sensitive to surface structure and metal crystallite size."
[4] "Bitter and co-workers [77] found that catalysts containing larger Pt crystallites deactivate more rapidly than those containing small crystallites."
[5] "Moreover, a crystallite size effect, observed in steam reforming of methane on nickel [60,78], appears to operate in the same direction, i.e., formation of filamentous carbon occurs at lower rates in catalysts containing smaller metal crystallites."

1. Deactivation of supported metals can occur chemically through chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically/mechanically by blocking surface sites, encapsulating metal crystallites, plugging pores, and destroying catalyst pellets through carbon filaments.

2. Modifications in metal crystallite surface chemistry can influence carbon formation and gasification rates, allowing for the use of oxide additives or oxide supports to regulate the accumulation of undesired carbon or coke.

3. The formation of coke, graphite, or filamentous carbon is expected to be structure-sensitive, influenced by surface structure and metal crystallite size.

4. Catalysts with larger Pt crystallites deactivate faster than those with smaller crystallites, as found by Bitter and colleagues.

5. In steam reforming of methane on nickel, a similar crystallite size effect exists, where filamentous carbon formation occurs at lower rates in catalysts with smaller metal crystallites.

1. 支持金属的失活可以通过化学吸附或碳化物形成，或者通过阻塞表面位点、金属晶粒包封、孔道堵塞和通过碳纤维破坏催化剂颗粒来发生。

2. 通过改变金属晶粒表面化学性质可以影响碳形成和气化速率，允许使用氧化物添加剂或氧化物载体来调节不希望的碳或焦炭积累。

3. 焦炭、石墨或纤维状碳的形成预计是结构敏感的，受表面结构和金属晶粒尺寸的影响。

4. Bitter等人的研究表明，具有更大Pt晶粒的催化剂比具有较小晶粒的催化剂更快地失活。

5. 在镍上进行甲烷蒸汽重整时，存在类似的晶粒尺寸效应，即在具有较小金属晶粒的催化剂中，纤维状碳形成速率较低。
