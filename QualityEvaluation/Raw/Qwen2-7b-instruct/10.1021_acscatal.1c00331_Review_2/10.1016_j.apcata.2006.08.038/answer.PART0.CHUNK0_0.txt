[1] "The results show that the Ce addition could greatly improve the catalytic performance and catalytic stability of the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3, which is reported as the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
[2] "Over these platinum-supported catalysts, the stability and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation to olefins increases while cracking process, isomerization reactions and coke formation process are suppressed."
[3] "The high stability values of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalyst at elevated temperature and in regeneration conditions partly profit from the improvement in the thermal stability of alumina."
[4] "It can be seen that the presence of Ce in the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts could not only stabilize the active states of Pt, Sn and support, but could also suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, and further improve the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by stabilizing the active states of Pt, Sn, and support, suppressing the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, improving the catalytic performance, and enhancing the thermal stability of the alumina support. These effects contribute to maintaining high conversion rates, selectivity, and yield of propylene, while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The PDH process benefits from these improvements, leading to increased overall process efficiency and performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢的共供给影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，通过稳定铂、锡和支撑物的活性状态，抑制催化剂反应期间的焦炭积累，提高催化性能，并增强氧化铝支撑的热稳定性。这些影响有助于保持较高的丙烯转化率、选择性和产率，同时减少焦炭形成和催化剂失活。PDH过程从这些改进中获益，从而提高了整个过程的效率和性能。
