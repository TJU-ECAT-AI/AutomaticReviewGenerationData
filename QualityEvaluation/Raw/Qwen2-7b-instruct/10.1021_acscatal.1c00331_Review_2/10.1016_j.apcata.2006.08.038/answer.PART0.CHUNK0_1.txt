[1] "The results show that the Ce addition could greatly improve the catalytic performance and catalytic stability of the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3, which is reported as the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
[2] "The addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can greatly promote its ability to adsorb hydrogen, especially in the high temperature range."
[3] "On the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst, the amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt do not show obvious changes before and after the recycle reaction."
[4] "It is seen that the presence of cerium over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can increase the reactivity of coke and reduce the accumulation of coke."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, the addition of cerium (Ce) to the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3 catalyst significantly improves the catalytic performance and stability, making it the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Secondly, cerium enhances the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen, particularly at high temperatures. This improvement in hydrogen adsorption leads to better stability and reduced coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. Additionally, the presence of cerium increases the reactivity of coke and reduces its accumulation over time. These effects collectively contribute to enhanced overall process efficiency and performance.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢过程中的影响体现在几个方面。首先，铈（Ce）的添加极大地提高了Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3催化剂的催化性能和稳定性，使其成为丙烷脱氢制丙烯的最佳催化剂。其次，铈显著增强了催化剂在高温下的氢吸附能力。这种提高的氢吸附能力有助于提高催化剂的稳定性并减少催化剂表面的积碳。此外，铈的存在增加了焦炭的活性并减少了其积累。这些效果共同促进了整个过程的效率和性能。
