<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, the addition of cerium (Ce) to the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3 catalyst significantly improves the catalytic performance and stability, making it the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Secondly, cerium enhances the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen, particularly at high temperatures. This improvement in hydrogen adsorption leads to better stability and reduced coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. Additionally, the presence of cerium increases the reactivity of coke and reduces its accumulation over time. These effects collectively contribute to enhanced overall process efficiency and performance.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, hydrogen can reduce the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially accelerating the reaction and affecting the coke formation patterns. Secondly, hydrogen can suppress the cracking process, isomerization reactions, and the coke formation process. This is due to the stabilization of active states of Pt, Sn, and the support by the presence of cerium, which further improves the catalytic performance of the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3 catalysts. 

Regarding acid site conversions, the presence of cerium leads to an increase in the strong acidity peak fraction and the total amount of acidity in the Pt/Ce-Al system. This is beneficial for the formation of highly dehydrogenated species through isomerization and coking reactions on the surface of the catalyst. However, the total acidity of the system does not undergo substantial change upon the addition of cerium.

Strong interactions between Pt, Sn, and Ce occur on the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which contributes to maintaining the stability of the catalyst. This is partly due to the improvement in the thermal stability of the alumina support.

The coke formation patterns and stability of the catalyst are closely related to the acidity of the catalyst. Catalysts with high acidity, such as Pt/Al and Pt/Ce-Al, exhibit poor stability and selectivity for propylene. The addition of cerium to the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst reduces the amount of coke, thereby improving the stability and selectivity for propylene.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding affects the PDH process by influencing the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These effects have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance. The stabilization of active states by cerium and the reduction of coke formation contribute to the high stability of the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了影响。首先，氢可以降低脱氢反应的能量壁垒，可能加速反应并影响焦炭积累模式。其次，氢可以抑制裂解过程、异构化反应和焦炭形成过程。这得益于铈的存在，它稳定了铂、锡和支撑物的活性状态，进而提高了Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3催化剂的催化性能。

关于酸性位点的转化，铈的存在导致Pt/Ce-Al系统中的强酸性峰分布增加和总酸性量增加。这对于表面物种的异构化和焦炭形成反应形成高度脱氢化的物种是有益的。然而，系统的总酸性并未因铈的添加而发生显著变化。

Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al催化剂上存在强烈的相互作用，这有助于维持催化剂的稳定性。这部分归功于铝氧化物支持体热稳定性的提高。

焦炭形成模式和催化剂稳定性与催化剂的酸性密切相关。具有高酸性的催化剂，如Pt/Al和Pt/Ce-Al，表现出较差的稳定性和丙烯选择性。向Pt-Sn/Al催化剂中添加铈减少了焦炭的形成，从而提高了稳定性和丙烯选择性。

综上所述，氢共给影响PDH过程，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有影响。铈的存在稳定活性状态以及减少焦炭形成有助于Pt-Sn/Ce-Al催化剂的高稳定性。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by suppressing the accumulation of coke on the catalyst. The presence of cerium stabilizes the active states of platinum, tin, and the support, which prevents coke accumulation during the reaction. This leads to improved catalytic performance and stability of the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst. As a result, the PDH process achieves high propane conversion (over 38%), propylene selectivity (over 98%), and propylene yield (over 37%) over 50 hours at 576°C. The increased reactivity of coke and reduced accumulation of coke, facilitated by cerium, contribute to the overall process efficiency and performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共给料通过抑制催化剂上的焦炭积累，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。铈的存在稳定了铂、锡和支撑体的活性状态，防止了反应期间催化剂上焦炭的积聚。这导致了Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3催化剂的高催化性能和稳定性。因此，PDH过程实现了超过38%的丙烷转化率、超过98%的丙烯选择性和超过37%的丙烯产率，在576°C、3800 h1和H2/ C3H8/Ar = 1/1/5的条件下持续50小时。焦炭活性的增加和积累的减少，由铈促进，对整个过程效率和性能产生积极影响。
