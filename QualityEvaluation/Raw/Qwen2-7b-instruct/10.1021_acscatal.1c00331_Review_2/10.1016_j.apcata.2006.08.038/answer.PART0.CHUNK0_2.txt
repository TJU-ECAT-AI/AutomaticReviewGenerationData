[1] "Over these platinum-supported catalysts, the stability and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation to olefins increases while cracking process, isomerization reactions and coke formation process are suppressed."
[2] "However, the dehydrogenation performance of PtSn catalysts is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the stability of PtSn catalysts during light paraffin conversion."
[3] "The presence of cerium in the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts could not only stabilize the active states of Pt, Sn and support, but could also suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, and further improve the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3."
[4] "The low amounts of coke and high thermal stability of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts are mainly responsible for the high stability of dehydrogenation."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by suppressing the cracking process, isomerization reactions, and coke formation process, thus improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst for paraffin dehydrogenation to olefins.
2. The stability of PtSn catalysts is crucial for the efficiency and performance of the PDH process, as unstable catalysts can lead to decreased performance.
3. The addition of cerium to the Pt-Sn catalyst stabilizes the active states of Pt, Sn, and the support, and reduces coke accumulation, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance in the PDH process.
4. The low coke formation and high thermal stability of the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts contribute significantly to the overall stability and efficiency of the PDH process.
