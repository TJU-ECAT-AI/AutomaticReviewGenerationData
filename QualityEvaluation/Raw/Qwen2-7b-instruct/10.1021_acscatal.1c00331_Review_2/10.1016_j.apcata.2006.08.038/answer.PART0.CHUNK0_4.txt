[1] "The results show that the Ce addition could greatly improve the catalytic performance and catalytic stability of the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3, which is reported as the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
[2] "We could keep >38% of propane conversion, >98% propylene selectivity and >37% propylene yield over 50 h in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene over Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts at 576 8C, 3800 h1 and H2/ C3H8/Ar = 1/1/5."
[3] "The presence of Ce in the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts could not only stabilize the active states of Pt, Sn and support, but could also suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, and further improve the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3."
[4] "Over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst, when reaction time reaches 50 h, the amount of coke increases to 50 mg C/g cat."
[5] "The TPO and O2-pulse investigations imply that the presence of cerium over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can increase the reactivity of coke and reduce the accumulation of coke."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by suppressing the accumulation of coke on the catalyst. The presence of cerium stabilizes the active states of platinum, tin, and the support, which prevents coke accumulation during the reaction. This leads to improved catalytic performance and stability of the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst. As a result, the PDH process achieves high propane conversion (over 38%), propylene selectivity (over 98%), and propylene yield (over 37%) over 50 hours at 576°C. The increased reactivity of coke and reduced accumulation of coke, facilitated by cerium, contribute to the overall process efficiency and performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共给料通过抑制催化剂上的焦炭积累，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。铈的存在稳定了铂、锡和支撑体的活性状态，防止了反应期间催化剂上焦炭的积聚。这导致了Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3催化剂的高催化性能和稳定性。因此，PDH过程实现了超过38%的丙烷转化率、超过98%的丙烯选择性和超过37%的丙烯产率，在576°C、3800 h1和H2/ C3H8/Ar = 1/1/5的条件下持续50小时。焦炭活性的增加和积累的减少，由铈促进，对整个过程效率和性能产生积极影响。
