The recent theoretical studies, similar energy barriers with values in the range of 0.290.42 eV for the initial activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) were obtained by Anghel et al.55,56

For the conversion of propane to produce propylene on step sites, the same two reaction pathways are taken into account.

The energy barriers for the initial activation of propane occurring at the methyl and methylene groups are calculated to be 0.32 and 0.28 eV, respectively.

Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms.

As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of methane, ethane and coke.

According to previous experimental work and our DFT calculations, the propane dehydrogenation process can be divided into two stages, namely the quick deactivation stage and steady state. At the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is suggested to be the active center for all the reactions including the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

1. The energy barriers for the activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) are in the range of 0.29 to 0.42 eV, similar to the activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(111).

2. The same two reaction pathways are considered for the conversion of propane to produce propylene, whether on flat or stepped surfaces.

3. The initial activation of propane at the methyl group has an energy barrier of 0.32 eV, and at the methylene group, it is 0.28 eV.

4. The activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption serves as a selectivity descriptor. Step sites are crucial for propane dehydrogenation, but they lower the selectivity towards propylene due to the preference of propylene for dehydrogenation over desorption.

5. Propyne is the starting point for CC bond cleaving, resulting in the formation of methane, ethane, and coke.

6. Propane dehydrogenation can be divided into two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. During the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface acts as the active center for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

1. 在Pt(110)-(12)上，乙烷转化为乙烯的活化能范围为0.29至0.42 eV，与在Pt(111)上的结果相似。

2. 对于丙烷转化为丙烯的转化过程，相同的两个反应途径在平滑和阶梯表面上都被考虑。

3. 丙烷在甲基位置的初始活化能壁垒为0.32 eV，在亚甲基位置为0.28 eV。

4. 丙烯脱氢与丙烯脱附之间的活化能量差作为选择性描述符。步骤站点对丙烷脱氢至关重要，但由于丙烯倾向于脱氢而不是脱附，它们降低了丙烯的选择性。

5. 丙炔是CC键断裂的起点，导致甲烷、乙烷和焦炭的形成。

6. 丙烷脱氢可以分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳定状态。在快速失活阶段，阶梯表面作为所有反应（包括C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解）的活性中心。
