[1] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[2] "The deep dehydrogenation process is terminated by propyne because the activation energy for propyne dehydrogenation is much higher than that for propyne cracking."
[3] "Our calculation results indicate that the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation is slightly lower than that for propylene desorption on Pt(111)."

1. The selectivity towards propylene is substantially reduced in the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms due to the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption. 
2. Propyne acts as the starting point for the CC bond cleaving process, which results in the formation of ethane, methane, and coke during the successive deep dehydrogenation.
3. The activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(111) is slightly lower than that for propylene desorption.

1. 在存在配位不饱和表面Pt原子的情况下，丙烯选择性显著降低，这是由于丙烯脱氢与脱附之间的活化能差异。
2. 丙炔作为深脱氢过程中CC键断裂的起始点，导致乙烷、甲烷和焦炭的形成。
3. 在Pt(111)上，丙烯脱氢的活化能略低于丙烯脱附。
