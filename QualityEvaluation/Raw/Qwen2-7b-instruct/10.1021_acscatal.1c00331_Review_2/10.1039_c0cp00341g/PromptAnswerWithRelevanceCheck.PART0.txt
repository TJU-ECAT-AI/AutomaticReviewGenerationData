The recent theoretical studies, similar energy barriers with values in the range of 0.290.42 eV for the initial activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) were obtained by Anghel et al.55,56

Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms.

As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking,propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of ethane, methane and coke.

It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions.

The energy barriers for the cracking of propane, 1-propyl, 2-propyl and propylene are significantly higher than those for the respective dehydrogenation steps on both Pt(111) and Pt(211), which indicates that the CC bond breaking is not favored in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene.

The energy barriers for the CC bond breaking are lowered more significantly than those for the dehydrogenation steps with the reactions moving from the flat to stepped surface.

The energy barriers for the cracking of propane, 1-propyl, 2-propyl and propylene are significantly higher than those for the respective dehydrogenation steps on both Pt(111) and Pt(211), which indicates that the CC bond breaking is not favored in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene.

With the progression of the successive deep dehydrogenation, the activation energy differences between the cracking and dehydrogenation elementary steps are substantially reduced on both surfaces.

The energy barriers for the CC bond breaking are lowered more significantly than those for the dehydrogenation steps with the reactions moving from the flat to stepped surface.

According to our calculations, the deep dehydrogenation process is terminated by propyne because the activation energy for propyne dehydrogenation is much higher than that for propyne cracking.

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by modifying energy barriers, influencing coke accumulation patterns, affecting acid site conversions, and potentially causing graphitization. These effects can impact the overall process efficiency and performance by altering reaction kinetics, product selectivities, and catalyst longevity.

2. The introduction of hydrogen can lead to an increase in the activation energy required for propylene dehydrogenation, simultaneously promoting the desorption of propylene under realistic conditions. This could enhance selectivity towards propylene by reducing the likelihood of propylene being further dehydrogenated into coke.

3. Propyne acts as the starting point for the cleavage of the CC bond during the deep dehydrogenation process. This leads to the formation of ethane, methane, and coke. The preference of propyne for CC bond cleavage over CH bond breaking suggests that hydrogen cofeeding might influence the pathway of coke formation by altering the energy barriers associated with these reactions.

4. The transition from a quick deactivation stage to a steady state in propane dehydrogenation involves the shift of the active center from the stepped surface to the flat surface. This change affects the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene. The introduction of hydrogen can promote propylene desorption, thereby enhancing selectivity towards propylene by lowering the energy barrier for desorption on the flat surface.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气可以影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，通过修改能垒、影响焦炭积累模式、影响酸基团转换和可能引起石墨化。这些影响可能会改变整个过程的效率和性能，通过改变反应动力学、产品选择性和催化剂寿命。

2. 氢的引入可以增加丙烯脱氢所需的活化能，同时在现实条件下促进丙烯的脱附。这可以通过提高丙烯脱氢的活化能，同时增强丙烯的脱附，从而增强丙烯的选择性，降低丙烯进一步脱氢为焦炭的可能性。

3. 丙炔作为深脱氢过程中CC键断裂的起始点，导致乙烷、甲烷和焦炭的形成。丙炔偏好于CC键断裂而非CH键断裂表明，氢的加入可能会影响焦炭形成的途径，通过改变与这些反应相关的能垒。

4. 在丙烷脱氢过程中从快速失活阶段过渡到稳定状态时，活性中心从步面转移到平坦表面。这种变化影响了催化活性和丙烯的选择性。氢的引入可以促进丙烯脱附，从而通过降低平坦表面脱附的能垒来增强丙烯的选择性。

1. The selectivity towards propylene is significantly reduced in the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms due to the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption.

2. Propyne acts as the initial trigger for CC bond cleavage resulting in the production of ethane, methane, and coke.

3. The propane dehydrogenation process is characterized by two phases: the rapid deactivation phase and the steady state. 

4. In the initial phase, the stepped surface acts as the primary reaction site for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

5. The preference for dehydrogenation over desorption by propylene results in low selectivity during the rapid deactivation phase.

6. As the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives progress, coke accumulates primarily on the stepped surface.

7. As the process evolves, the active site shifts from the stepped to the flat surface. This transition results in reduced catalytic activity for propylene dehydrogenation but enhances selectivity for propylene production, thanks to promoted desorption and suppressed deep dehydrogenation on the flat surface.

4. 初始阶段，步面表面作为所有反应（包括C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解）的主要反应位点。

5. 丙烯倾向于脱氢而不是脱附，因此在快速失活阶段丙烯的选择性较低。

6. 随着C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解进展，焦炭主要在步面表面上积累。

7. 随着过程的发展，活性中心从步面转移到平面。这一转变导致丙烯脱氢催化活性降低，但同时提高了丙烯生产的选择性，因为丙烯脱附被促进，同时在平面上抑制了丙烯的深度脱氢。

For the conversion of propane to produce propylene on step sites, the same two reaction pathways are taken into account.

The energy barriers for the initial activation of propane occurring at the methyl and methylene groups are calculated to be 0.32 and 0.28 eV, respectively.

Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms.

1. The energy barriers for the activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) are in the range of 0.29 to 0.42 eV, similar to the activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(111).

2. The same two reaction pathways are considered for the conversion of propane to produce propylene, whether on flat or stepped surfaces.

4. The activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption serves as a selectivity descriptor. Step sites are crucial for propane dehydrogenation, but they lower the selectivity towards propylene due to the preference of propylene for dehydrogenation over desorption.

5. Propyne is the starting point for CC bond cleaving, resulting in the formation of methane, ethane, and coke.

6. Propane dehydrogenation can be divided into two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. During the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface acts as the active center for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.
