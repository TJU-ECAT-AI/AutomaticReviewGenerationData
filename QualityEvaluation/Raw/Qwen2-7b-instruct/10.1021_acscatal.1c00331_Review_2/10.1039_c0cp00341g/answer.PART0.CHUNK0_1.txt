[1] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[2] "As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking,propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of ethane, methane and coke."
[3] "According to previous experimental work and our DFT calculations, the propane dehydrogenation process can be divided into two stages, namely the quick deactivation stage and steady state. At the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is suggested to be the active center for all the reactions including the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives."
[4] "At this stage, the selectivity towards propylene is rather low because propylene prefers dehydrogenation to desorption."
[5] "With the progression of the deep dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives, coke is preferentially formed on the stepped surface."
[6] "Then, the active center is transferred from the stepped to flat surface."
[7] "At the steady state, while the catalytic activity towards propylene dehydrogenation is lowered, high selectivity towards propylene is attained because propylene desorption is promoted and simultaneously the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat surface."

1. The selectivity towards propylene is significantly reduced in the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms due to the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption.

2. Propyne acts as the initial trigger for CC bond cleavage resulting in the production of ethane, methane, and coke.

3. The propane dehydrogenation process is characterized by two phases: the rapid deactivation phase and the steady state. 

4. In the initial phase, the stepped surface acts as the primary reaction site for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

5. The preference for dehydrogenation over desorption by propylene results in low selectivity during the rapid deactivation phase.

6. As the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives progress, coke accumulates primarily on the stepped surface.

7. As the process evolves, the active site shifts from the stepped to the flat surface. This transition results in reduced catalytic activity for propylene dehydrogenation but enhances selectivity for propylene production, thanks to promoted desorption and suppressed deep dehydrogenation on the flat surface.

1. 在配合物不饱和表面Pt原子的存在下，丙烯脱氢与丙烯脱附之间的活化能差异导致丙烯选择性显著降低。

2. 丙炔作为CC键断裂的初始触发点，最终导致乙烷、甲烷和焦炭的生成。

3. 丙烷脱氢过程可以分为两个阶段：快速失活阶段和稳定状态。

4. 初始阶段，步面表面作为所有反应（包括C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解）的主要反应位点。

5. 丙烯倾向于脱氢而不是脱附，因此在快速失活阶段丙烯的选择性较低。

6. 随着C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解进展，焦炭主要在步面表面上积累。

7. 随着过程的发展，活性中心从步面转移到平面。这一转变导致丙烯脱氢催化活性降低，但同时提高了丙烯生产的选择性，因为丙烯脱附被促进，同时在平面上抑制了丙烯的深度脱氢。
