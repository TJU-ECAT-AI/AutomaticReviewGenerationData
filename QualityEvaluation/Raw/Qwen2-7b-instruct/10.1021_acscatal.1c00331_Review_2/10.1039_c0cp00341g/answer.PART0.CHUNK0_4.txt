[1] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[2] "As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking,propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of ethane, methane and coke."
[3] "At the steady state, while the catalytic activity towards propylene dehydrogenation is lowered, high selectivity towards propylene is attained because propylene desorption is promoted and simultaneously the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat surface."

1. The selectivity towards propylene in propane dehydrogenation is significantly reduced on the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms due to the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption.
2. Propyne acts as the initial point for the cleavage of the CC bond during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of ethane, methane, and coke.
3. At the steady state, the catalytic activity for propylene dehydrogenation decreases, but the selectivity towards propylene increases. This is because propylene desorption is enhanced, and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is restrained on the flat surface.

1. 在表面Pt原子为配位不饱和的情况下，丙烯脱氢选择性丙烯降低，这是由于丙烯脱氢与丙烯脱附之间的活化能差所决定。
2. 丙炔被认为是丙烷脱氢过程中CC键断裂的起始点，导致生成乙烷、甲烷和焦炭。
3. 在稳态下，虽然丙烯脱氢活性降低，但丙烯的选择性提高。这是因为丙烯脱附被促进，同时在平面上丙烯的深层脱氢受到抑制。
