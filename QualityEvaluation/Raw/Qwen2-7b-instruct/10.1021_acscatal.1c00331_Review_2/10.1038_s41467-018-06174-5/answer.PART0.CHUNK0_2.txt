<p>From a mechanistic point of view, adsorbed propene molecules interact with each other to initially form small aromatic structures followed by further oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures. It is reasonable to suggest that propene molecules adsorbed horizontally to catalyst surface can recombine owing to their spatial location. Such adsorption should be more favourable for Zr sites located on flat ZrO2 surfaces in comparison to those located on corners or edges. Upon increasing the size of crystallites, the fraction of the former species will decrease and thus will result in a higher rate of carbon deposition.</p>
<p>Exactly this trend was observed experimentally. Further experimental and theoretical studies are, however, required to clarify the size effect on coke formation.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can lead to coke formation by increasing the rate of carbon deposition. This occurs because propene molecules adsorbed to the catalyst surface can recombine, particularly on flat ZrO2 surfaces, leading to the formation of small aromatic structures that undergo oligomerization and condensation to produce larger graphitic structures. As the size of the crystallites decreases, the fraction of flat surface sites increases, which results in a higher rate of carbon deposition and coke formation. However, further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to fully understand the size effect on coke formation.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中可能导致焦炭形成，从而增加碳沉积速率。这是因为吸附到催化剂表面的丙烯分子可以重新组合，特别是在平坦的ZrO2表面上，与位于角落或边缘的表面相比。随着晶粒尺寸的减小，平坦表面物种的比例增加，这导致更高的碳沉积速率和焦炭形成。然而，需要进一步的实验和理论研究来全面理解焦炭形成对晶粒尺寸的影响。
