[1] "The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size."
[2] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[3] "Such delay may indicate that some coke precursors (seeds) must be initially formed before coke formation can proceed."
[4] "Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic sites."
[5] "This result is in agreement with previous DFT calculations predicting that the energy for the formation of an oxygen vacancy in ZrO2 lowers for nanoscale particles."
[6] "Although the concentration of Zrcus can be adjusted in a controlled manner through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, further improvements are expected when the coordination number of zirconium cations, their location on certain facets and/or the shape of crystallites can also be tuned."

1. The activity of ZrO2 catalysts in the PDH process can be attributed to an increase in the concentration of Zrcus sites with decreasing crystallite size.
2. Smaller crystallite sizes of ZrO2 enhance propene selectivity in the PDH process.
3. The delay observed in coke formation might suggest an initial formation of coke precursors before the actual coke formation process begins.
4. An increase in the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10 correlates with the increased concentration of Lewis acidic sites determined by various probe molecules.
5. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 particles decreases as the particle size approaches the nanoscale.
6. Controlling the coordination number, location, and shape of ZrO2 crystallites can lead to further enhancements beyond adjusting the crystallite size.

1. ZrO2催化剂在PDH过程中的活性可以归因于随着晶粒尺寸减小，催化活性Zrcus位点浓度的增加。
2. ZrO2晶粒尺寸更小能提高丙烯选择性在PDH过程中。
3. 焦炭形成延迟可能表明，在实际焦炭形成过程开始之前，必须首先形成焦炭前体（种子）。
4. 从C2H6、C3H8和iso-C4H10生成的烯烃速率的增加与确定的各种探针分子中Lewis酸性位点的浓度增加相关。
5. 随着粒子尺寸接近纳米尺度，ZrO2中形成氧空位的能量变得更容易。
6. 控制ZrO2晶粒的配位数、位置和形状可以带来超越仅调整晶粒尺寸的进一步增强。
