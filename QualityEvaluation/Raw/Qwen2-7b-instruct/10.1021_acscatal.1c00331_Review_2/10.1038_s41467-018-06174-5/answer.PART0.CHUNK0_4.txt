<p>When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process.</p>
<p>Owing to small changes in the size, the catalyst was still active and durable at 550 C (last 10 cycles in Fig. 4b) after the preceding PDH tests at 600 and 625 C.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by changing the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. At higher temperatures, the catalyst becomes less durable due to increased crystallite sizes caused by temperature-induced sintering. However, the catalyst remains active and durable at 550°C after undergoing PDH tests at higher temperatures, demonstrating the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on maintaining catalyst performance under varying conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共喂养影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化。在较高温度下，由于温度诱导的烧结过程导致晶粒尺寸增加，催化剂的耐久性降低。然而，在550°C下，催化剂在经历较高温度下的PDH测试后仍保持活性和耐用性，这表明氢共喂养对在不同条件下维持催化剂性能的影响。
