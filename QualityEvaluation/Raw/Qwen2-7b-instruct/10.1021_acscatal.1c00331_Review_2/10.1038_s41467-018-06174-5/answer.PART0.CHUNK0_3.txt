<p>The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size.</p>
<p>To validate the importance of such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 C before testing in PDH at the same temperature.</p>
<p>The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b).</p>
<p>There are significant differences between the samples in the structure of the surface depending on the crystallite size.</p>
<p>The HAADF-STEM technique can provide only limited quantitative information about the concentration and distribution of defect sites.</p>
<p>Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic sites (Supplementary Fig. 15).</p>
<p>The conductivity increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites.</p>
<p>The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f).</p>
<p>Although the energies for activating C3H8 at the methylene or methyl CH bond to yield iso-C3H7 or n-C3H7 are close (Supplementary Table 7), subtraction of a second hydrogen to yield propene is kinetically more favourable for the iso-C3H7 fragment.</p>
<p>The full potential energy surfaces of the most preferred routes on both surfaces are shown in Fig. 6, while the Gibbs free energy profiles are given in Supplementary Fig. 17.</p>
<p>The Zr6cIO2c site should possess the highest reactivity because of the formation of the most stable Zr6cIiso-C3H7 and O2cH intermediates owing to the stronger basicity of O2c in comparison with O3c.</p>
