[1] "The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size."
[2] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[3] "Such delay may indicate that some coke precursors (seeds) must be initially formed before coke formation can proceed."
[4] "Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic sites."
[5] "This result is in agreement with previous DFT calculations predicting that the energy for the formation of an oxygen vacancy in ZrO2 lowers for nanoscale particles."
[6] "Although the concentration of Zrcus can be adjusted in a controlled manner through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, further improvements are expected when the coordination number of zirconium cations, their location on certain facets and/or the shape of crystallites can also be tuned."

<p>From a mechanistic point of view, adsorbed propene molecules interact with each other to initially form small aromatic structures followed by further oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures. It is reasonable to suggest that propene molecules adsorbed horizontally to catalyst surface can recombine owing to their spatial location. Such adsorption should be more favourable for Zr sites located on flat ZrO2 surfaces in comparison to those located on corners or edges. Upon increasing the size of crystallites, the fraction of the former species will decrease and thus will result in a higher rate of carbon deposition.</p>
<p>Exactly this trend was observed experimentally. Further experimental and theoretical studies are, however, required to clarify the size effect on coke formation.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can lead to coke formation by increasing the rate of carbon deposition. This occurs because propene molecules adsorbed to the catalyst surface can recombine, particularly on flat ZrO2 surfaces, leading to the formation of small aromatic structures that undergo oligomerization and condensation to produce larger graphitic structures. As the size of the crystallites decreases, the fraction of flat surface sites increases, which results in a higher rate of carbon deposition and coke formation. However, further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to fully understand the size effect on coke formation.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中可能导致焦炭形成，从而增加碳沉积速率。这是因为吸附到催化剂表面的丙烯分子可以重新组合，特别是在平坦的ZrO2表面上，与位于角落或边缘的表面相比。随着晶粒尺寸的减小，平坦表面物种的比例增加，这导致更高的碳沉积速率和焦炭形成。然而，需要进一步的实验和理论研究来全面理解焦炭形成对晶粒尺寸的影响。

<p>The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size.</p>
<p>To validate the importance of such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 C before testing in PDH at the same temperature.</p>
<p>The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b).</p>
<p>There are significant differences between the samples in the structure of the surface depending on the crystallite size.</p>
<p>The HAADF-STEM technique can provide only limited quantitative information about the concentration and distribution of defect sites.</p>
<p>Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic sites (Supplementary Fig. 15).</p>
<p>The conductivity increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites.</p>
<p>The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f).</p>
<p>Although the energies for activating C3H8 at the methylene or methyl CH bond to yield iso-C3H7 or n-C3H7 are close (Supplementary Table 7), subtraction of a second hydrogen to yield propene is kinetically more favourable for the iso-C3H7 fragment.</p>
<p>The full potential energy surfaces of the most preferred routes on both surfaces are shown in Fig. 6, while the Gibbs free energy profiles are given in Supplementary Fig. 17.</p>
<p>The Zr6cIO2c site should possess the highest reactivity because of the formation of the most stable Zr6cIiso-C3H7 and O2cH intermediates owing to the stronger basicity of O2c in comparison with O3c.</p>

<p>When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process.</p>
<p>Owing to small changes in the size, the catalyst was still active and durable at 550 C (last 10 cycles in Fig. 4b) after the preceding PDH tests at 600 and 625 C.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by changing the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. At higher temperatures, the catalyst becomes less durable due to increased crystallite sizes caused by temperature-induced sintering. However, the catalyst remains active and durable at 550°C after undergoing PDH tests at higher temperatures, demonstrating the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on maintaining catalyst performance under varying conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共喂养影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化。在较高温度下，由于温度诱导的烧结过程导致晶粒尺寸增加，催化剂的耐久性降低。然而，在550°C下，催化剂在经历较高温度下的PDH测试后仍保持活性和耐用性，这表明氢共喂养对在不同条件下维持催化剂性能的影响。
