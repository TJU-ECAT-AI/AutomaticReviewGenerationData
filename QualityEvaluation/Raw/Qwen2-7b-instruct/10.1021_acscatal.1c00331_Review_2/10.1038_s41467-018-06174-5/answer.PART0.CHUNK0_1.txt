[1] "The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size."
[2] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[3] "Exactly this trend was observed experimentally. Further experimental and theoretical studies are, however, required to clarify the size effect on coke formation."
[4] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size."
[5] "The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f)."

1. The concentration of catalytically active Zrcus sites increases with decreasing crystallite size, explaining the activity-size relationship. 
2. Smaller crystallite sizes enhance propene selectivity in the PDH process.
3. Further studies are needed to fully understand the effect of size on coke formation.
4. Decreasing crystallite size leads to an increase in the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10 without changing the activity order.
5. The size of ZrO2 crystallites significantly impacts the formation of anion vacancies, affecting conductivity.
