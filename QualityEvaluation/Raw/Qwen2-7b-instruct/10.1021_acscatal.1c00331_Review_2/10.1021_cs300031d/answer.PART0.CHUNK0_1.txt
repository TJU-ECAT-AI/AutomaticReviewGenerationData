Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation by significantly reducing the energy barrier for coke formation, leading to a decrease in coke accumulation. This reduction in coke accumulation improves catalyst stability and preserves active sites. Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which is crucial for maintaining high activity. Graphitization processes are also influenced, as hydrogen molecules help to prevent the formation of large graphite structures that could hinder the reaction pathways. These effects enhance the overall process efficiency and performance by promoting more effective reaction mechanisms and reducing coke formation.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过显著降低焦炭形成能垒，减少了焦炭积累。这减少了焦炭积累，提高了催化剂稳定性并保留了活性位点。此外，氢共给促进了催化剂表面酸性位点的转化，这对于维持高活性至关重要。图瓦特化过程也受到氢共给的影响，因为氢分子有助于防止形成可能阻碍反应途径的大片状石墨结构。这些影响通过促进更有效的反应机制和减少焦炭形成，增强了整体过程效率和性能。
