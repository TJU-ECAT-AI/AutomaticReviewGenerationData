<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study found that hydrogen cofeeding impacts the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process over PtSn catalysts by altering energy barriers, which in turn affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and the conversion of acid sites. These changes modify the reaction mechanisms, influencing both coke accumulation and the efficiency of the process.
