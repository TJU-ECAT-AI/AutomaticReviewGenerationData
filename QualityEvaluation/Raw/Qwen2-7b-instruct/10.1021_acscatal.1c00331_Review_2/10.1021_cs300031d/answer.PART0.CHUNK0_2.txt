How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

The literature indicates that hydrogen cofeeding significantly influences the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process by affecting coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. This influence is observed through changes in energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These alterations have substantial implications for the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process.
