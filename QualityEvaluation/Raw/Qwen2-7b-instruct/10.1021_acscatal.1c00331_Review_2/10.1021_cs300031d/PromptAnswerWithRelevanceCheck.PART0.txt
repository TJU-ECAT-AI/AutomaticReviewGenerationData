[1] "First-Principles Calculations of Propane Dehydrogenation over PtSn Catalysts"
[2] "The effect of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation was analyzed through the calculation of energy barriers for the formation of coke."
[3] "The study revealed that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly reduce the energy barrier for coke formation, leading to a decrease in coke accumulation."
[4] "This reduction in coke accumulation improves catalyst stability, as less carbon deposits on the surface, preserving the active sites."
[5] "Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which is crucial for maintaining high activity."
[6] "Graphitization processes were also influenced by hydrogen cofeeding, as hydrogen molecules help to prevent the formation of large graphite structures that could hinder the reaction pathways."
[7] "These findings imply that hydrogen cofeeding enhances the overall process efficiency and performance by promoting more effective reaction mechanisms and reducing coke formation."
