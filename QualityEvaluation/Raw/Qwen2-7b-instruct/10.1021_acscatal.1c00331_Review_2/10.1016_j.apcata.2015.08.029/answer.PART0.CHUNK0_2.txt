Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly influences coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It alters energy barriers, modifies coke accumulation patterns, converts acid sites on the catalyst surface, and impacts the graphitization process. These effects improve the selectivity towards ethylene, reduce coke formation, and enhance the overall process efficiency and performance by minimizing catalyst deactivation.
