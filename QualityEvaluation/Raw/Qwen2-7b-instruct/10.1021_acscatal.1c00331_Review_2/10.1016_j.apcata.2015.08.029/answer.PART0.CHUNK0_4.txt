[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane on PtIr/Mg(Al)O catalysts was studied with and without hydrogen cofeeding."
[2] "Coke formation was significantly reduced when hydrogen was co-fed during the PDH process."
[3] "This reduction in coke formation led to improved catalyst stability."
[4] "Energy barriers associated with coke accumulation were decreased due to hydrogen's ability to react with coke precursors."
[5] "Hydrogen also facilitated the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing its activity."
[6] "The pattern of coke accumulation was altered, resulting in less graphitization."
[7] "These effects collectively increased the overall process efficiency and performance."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing coke accumulation through decreased energy barriers, facilitating acid site conversions, altering coke accumulation patterns to prevent excessive graphitization, and improving overall process efficiency and performance.
