Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It reduces coke formation by lowering energy barriers, alters coke accumulation patterns improving catalyst stability, influences the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and impacts graphitization processes. These effects have substantial implications on the PDH process efficiency and performance.
