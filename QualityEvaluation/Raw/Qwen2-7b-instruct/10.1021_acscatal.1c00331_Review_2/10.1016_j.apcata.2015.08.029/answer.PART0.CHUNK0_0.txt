[1] "The addition of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation process leads to a reduction in coke formation."
[2] "This reduction in coke formation contributes to improved catalyst stability."
[3] "Hydrogen cofeeding also affects the reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, which can lead to different coke accumulation patterns."
[4] "Moreover, hydrogen can facilitate the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, potentially reducing graphitization."
[5] "These effects collectively enhance the overall process efficiency and performance by minimizing coke buildup and maintaining optimal reaction conditions."
