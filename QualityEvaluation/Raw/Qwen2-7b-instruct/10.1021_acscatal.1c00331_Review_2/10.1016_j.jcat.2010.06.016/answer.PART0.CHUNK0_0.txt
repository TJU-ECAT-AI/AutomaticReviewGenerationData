[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane."
[2] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation."
[3] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[4] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms?

The addition of hydrogen to the feed leads to an increase in activity, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. However, beyond a certain point, further hydrogen addition promotes alkene hydrogenation, which reduces the net rate of dehydrogenation. The presence of gallium (Ga) in the catalyst helps suppress coke formation. Notably, less coke is formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, and there is no direct correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

氢气共喂料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制有何影响？

向原料中添加氢气导致活性增加，特别是在丙烷脱氢过程中。然而，在某个点之后，进一步增加氢气浓度会促进烯烃氢化，从而降低脱氢速率。镓（Ga）的存在有助于抑制焦炭的形成。值得注意的是，与乙烷脱氢相比，在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭较少，并且焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有直接相关性。
