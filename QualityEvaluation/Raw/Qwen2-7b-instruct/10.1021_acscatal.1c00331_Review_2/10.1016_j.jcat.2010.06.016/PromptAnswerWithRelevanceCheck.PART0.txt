[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane."
[2] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation."
[3] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[4] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms?

The addition of hydrogen to the feed leads to an increase in activity, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. However, beyond a certain point, further hydrogen addition promotes alkene hydrogenation, which reduces the net rate of dehydrogenation. The presence of gallium (Ga) in the catalyst helps suppress coke formation. Notably, less coke is formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, and there is no direct correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

氢气共喂料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制有何影响？

向原料中添加氢气导致活性增加，特别是在丙烷脱氢过程中。然而，在某个点之后，进一步增加氢气浓度会促进烯烃氢化，从而降低脱氢速率。镓（Ga）的存在有助于抑制焦炭的形成。值得注意的是，与乙烷脱氢相比，在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭较少，并且焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有直接相关性。

[1] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."
[2] "However, as the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio."
[3] "The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."
[5] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process enhances the rate of alkene formation by facilitating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. 

2. As the concentration of alkene in the product nears equilibrium, the rate of alkene formation slows down with increased hydrogen-to-propane ratio.

3. The rate of activity loss is less pronounced during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

4. Accumulation of coke is more significant in ethane dehydrogenation, leading to a higher deposition of carbon on the catalyst, exceeding the number of exposed platinum atoms by many times.

5. The lack of correlation between deactivation extent and carbon accumulation indicates that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the surface of the platinum particles.

[3] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process increases the activity of the catalyst due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. This results in a higher rate of alkene formation. However, as the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The addition of hydrogen also suppresses coke formation. There is less coke formation during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The higher level of deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding improves the overall process efficiency and performance by enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, while suppressing coke formation and reducing catalyst deactivation.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制，考虑到其对能垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，以及这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的含义是什么？

氢共喂养在PDH过程中通过氢辅助脱氢作用于解离吸附的烷烃形成的烷基物种，提高了催化剂的活性，导致烷基形成速率更高。然而，当产物中的烯烃浓度接近平衡转化率时，随着H2/烷烃比例的增加，烯烃形成速率降低。氢的添加还能抑制焦炭的形成。在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭少于乙烷，且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的相关性。丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂更高的失活水平归因于从丙烷到铂表面的焦炭前体覆盖比乙烷更多。这些效应的含义是，氢共喂养通过提高催化剂的活性和选择性并减少焦炭形成和催化剂失活来改善整体过程效率和性能。

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process leads to a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane, attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond this peak, further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation.

2. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. This is particularly evident in propane dehydrogenation, where less coke was formed compared to ethane dehydrogenation, despite the absence of a correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

3. The coke deposited during PDH is mostly found on the support rather than the Pt particles. This is due to the fact that the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt.

1. 在PDH过程中，氢共喂料导致H2/烷烃活性峰值，归因于在反应物烷烃的离解吸附后形成的烷基物种的H原子辅助脱氢化。超过这个峰值，进一步增加氢气喂料浓度会导致烯烃氢化，从而降低脱氢速率。

2. 钆的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。这特别体现在丙烷脱氢中，其形成的焦炭量少于乙烷脱氢，尽管焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有相关性。

3. PDH过程中沉积的焦炭主要位于支撑体上而不是铂颗粒。这是由于沉积的碳作为焦炭的量高于暴露的铂量。
