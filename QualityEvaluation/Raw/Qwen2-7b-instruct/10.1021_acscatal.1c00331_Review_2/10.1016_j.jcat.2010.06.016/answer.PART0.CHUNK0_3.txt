[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."
[2] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[3] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process increases the activity of the catalyst due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. This results in a higher rate of alkene formation. However, as the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The addition of hydrogen also suppresses coke formation. There is less coke formation during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The higher level of deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding improves the overall process efficiency and performance by enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, while suppressing coke formation and reducing catalyst deactivation.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制，考虑到其对能垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，以及这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的含义是什么？

氢共喂养在PDH过程中通过氢辅助脱氢作用于解离吸附的烷烃形成的烷基物种，提高了催化剂的活性，导致烷基形成速率更高。然而，当产物中的烯烃浓度接近平衡转化率时，随着H2/烷烃比例的增加，烯烃形成速率降低。氢的添加还能抑制焦炭的形成。在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭少于乙烷，且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的相关性。丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂更高的失活水平归因于从丙烷到铂表面的焦炭前体覆盖比乙烷更多。这些效应的含义是，氢共喂养通过提高催化剂的活性和选择性并减少焦炭形成和催化剂失活来改善整体过程效率和性能。
