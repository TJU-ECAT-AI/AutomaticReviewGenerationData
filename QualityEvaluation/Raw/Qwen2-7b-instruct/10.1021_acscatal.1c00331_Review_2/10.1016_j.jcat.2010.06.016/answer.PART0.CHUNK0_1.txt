[1] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."
[2] "However, as the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio."
[3] "The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."
[5] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process enhances the rate of alkene formation by facilitating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. 

2. As the concentration of alkene in the product nears equilibrium, the rate of alkene formation slows down with increased hydrogen-to-propane ratio.

3. The rate of activity loss is less pronounced during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

4. Accumulation of coke is more significant in ethane dehydrogenation, leading to a higher deposition of carbon on the catalyst, exceeding the number of exposed platinum atoms by many times.

5. The lack of correlation between deactivation extent and carbon accumulation indicates that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the surface of the platinum particles.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢气共喂养可以增强烯烃形成速率，通过促进表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢作用。

2. 当产品中烯烃浓度接近平衡时，随着氢气与丙烷比例的增加，烯烃生成速率会减慢至预期的烷烃转化平衡值。

3. 活性丧失速率在脱乙烷过程中比脱丙烷过程要低。

4. 乙烷脱氢过程中积碳积累更为显著，沉积在催化剂上的碳原子数量远超过暴露的铂原子数量。

5. 碳沉积量和活性衰减之间的缺乏相关性表明，大部分积碳位于支持物上而非铂颗粒表面。
