[1] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."
[2] "As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio."
[3] "The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."
[5] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hydrogen cofeeding enhances alkene formation by facilitating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species on the surface.
2. As alkene concentration in the product nears equilibrium, alkene formation slows with higher hydrogen-to-alkane ratios.
3. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts lose activity more slowly during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane.
4. More coke accumulates during ethane dehydrogenation, with deposited carbon exceeding the amount of exposed Pt.
5. The lack of correlation between deactivation and coke formation indicates that most coke resides on the support, not on the Pt surface.

1. 氢气共喂养增强了烯烃形成，通过促进表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢。
2. 当产品中的烯烃浓度接近平衡时，随着氢与烷烃比值的增加，烯烃生成速率变慢。
3. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在脱乙烷过程中损失活性的速度比脱丙烷慢。
4. 更多的焦炭在脱乙烷过程中积累，沉积的碳量超过暴露的铂原子。
5. 焦炭形成和活性丧失之间缺乏相关性的事实表明，大部分焦炭位于支撑物上，而不是铂颗粒表面。
