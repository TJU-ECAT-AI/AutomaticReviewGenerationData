[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane."
[2] "The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."
[3] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation."
[4] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[5] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process leads to a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane, attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond this peak, further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation.

2. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. This is particularly evident in propane dehydrogenation, where less coke was formed compared to ethane dehydrogenation, despite the absence of a correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

3. The coke deposited during PDH is mostly found on the support rather than the Pt particles. This is due to the fact that the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt.

1. 在PDH过程中，氢共喂料导致H2/烷烃活性峰值，归因于在反应物烷烃的离解吸附后形成的烷基物种的H原子辅助脱氢化。超过这个峰值，进一步增加氢气喂料浓度会导致烯烃氢化，从而降低脱氢速率。

2. 钆的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。这特别体现在丙烷脱氢中，其形成的焦炭量少于乙烷脱氢，尽管焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有相关性。

3. PDH过程中沉积的焦炭主要位于支撑体上而不是铂颗粒。这是由于沉积的碳作为焦炭的量高于暴露的铂量。
