[1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to pre- vent extensive coking."

[3] "The purpose of this study is to characterize the be- havior of promoted Pt-Sn/u-alumina catalysts in steam and hydrogen environment."
[4] "Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst sta- bility."
[5] "The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity."
[6] "However, a more significant pa- rameter is the coke produced normalized by the propy- lene yield."
[7] "The kinetic model that explains the effect of promoters and steam through the acceleration of rate-determining steps is consistent with the experi- mental data."

1. Hydrogen, when used as a cofeed, prevents extensive coking by serving as an inert diluent, enhancing conversion in equilibrium-limited systems.
2. Hydrogen's role as an inert diluent facilitates conversion in equilibrium-limited systems.
3. The objective of this research is to examine the behavior of promoted Pt-Sn/u-alumina catalysts under steam and hydrogen environments.
4. Coke formation is a crucial indicator of catalyst stability.
5. Despite changes in the amount of coke on the catalyst throughout the process, the overall catalyst activity remains unaffected.
6. The more significant metric to consider is the coke production normalized by the propylene yield.
7. The kinetic model that elucidates the influence of catalyst promoters and steam on accelerating rate-determining steps aligns with the experimental findings.
