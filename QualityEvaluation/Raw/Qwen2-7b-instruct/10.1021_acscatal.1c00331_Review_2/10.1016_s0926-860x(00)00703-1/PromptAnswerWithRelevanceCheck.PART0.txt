The use of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process leads to inferior results, as it facilitates extensive coke formation. In contrast, steam acts as an effective coke inhibitor, enhancing conversion in equilibrium-limited systems. Steam has been found to be a superior medium for dehydrogenating propane compared to hydrogen typically used in commercial processes. By carefully selecting catalyst compositions and employing surface characterization techniques such as XPS, highly efficient, selective, and stable catalysts can be developed. Tin is identified as a critical promoter, with its effectiveness being maximized in the presence of steam. The addition of potassium further improves catalyst performance. However, it is crucial to control the catalyst composition to prevent the blocking of active sites. Notably, tin provides an essential coke tolerance effect in steam environments, offering significant advantages over hydrogen-based processes.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中会导致较差的结果，因为它促进大量结焦。相比之下，蒸汽作为有效的结焦抑制剂，可以增强在平衡受限系统中的转化率。蒸汽被发现是比商业过程中通常使用的氢气更有效的丙烷脱氢介质。通过精心选择催化剂组成并利用表面表征技术如XPS，可以开发出高效、选择性和稳定的催化剂。锡被确认为一个关键的促进剂，其效果在蒸汽存在下得到最大化。钾的添加进一步提高了催化剂性能。然而，需要控制催化剂组成以防止活性位点堵塞。值得注意的是，锡在蒸汽环境中提供了必要的结焦耐受性效果，为过程效率和性能提供了显著优势。

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process leads to increased coke formation, reduced catalyst stability, altered energy barriers, changes in coke accumulation patterns, shifts in acid site conversions, and potential graphitization. These effects can negatively impact the overall process efficiency and performance by reducing the yield of desired products and increasing the formation of byproducts.

2. In the PDH process, hydrogen cofeeding affects the catalyst stability by promoting coke formation, which can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. The reaction mechanisms might be influenced by the creation of additional energy barriers and changes in the distribution of acid sites on the catalyst surface. Graphitization could occur if the hydrogen cofeeding leads to the formation of graphite-like structures on the catalyst surface, which might interfere with the dehydrogenation process.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process enhances coke formation, but the presence of steam is crucial in maximizing the effect of tin as a promoter. Steam helps in controlling coke formation and enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The steam environment also facilitates the movement of tin, allowing it to act as an inert diluent that prevents the formation of strong bonds between reactants and the catalyst surface, thus reducing coking.

4. The kinetic model that explains the impact of hydrogen and steam on the PDH process through the acceleration of rate-determining steps aligns well with the experimental data. This model accounts for how the addition of hydrogen and steam affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and coke formation, providing a comprehensive understanding of the PDH process under different cofeeding conditions.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共供会导致焦炭形成增加、催化剂稳定性降低、能量壁垒改变、焦炭积累模式变化以及酸性位点转化，这些影响可能会降低整体过程效率和性能，导致期望产物的产量减少和副产物的增加。

2. 在PDH过程中，氢气共供对催化剂稳定性的影响是通过促进焦炭形成来实现的，这会降低催化活性。反应机制可能受到创建额外能量壁垒和催化剂表面酸性位点分布变化的影响。如果氢气共供导致在催化剂表面形成类似于石墨的结构，这可能会干扰脱氢过程，从而发生图示化。

3. 氢气共供在PDH过程中增加了焦炭形成，但蒸汽的存在对于最大化锡作为促进剂的效果至关重要。蒸汽有助于控制焦炭形成并增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。蒸汽环境也有助于锡的移动，使其作为惰性稀释剂作用于催化剂表面，防止形成强键，从而减少结焦，降低选择性。

4. 解释氢气和蒸汽对PDH过程影响的热力学模型通过加速决定性步骤来与实验数据相吻合。该模型考虑到氢气和蒸汽如何影响催化剂的活性、选择性和焦炭形成，为在不同共供条件下PDH过程提供了全面的理解。
