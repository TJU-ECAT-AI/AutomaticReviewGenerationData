Chemical Engineering Department, Blechner Center for Industrial Catalysis and Process Development, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel Received 28 February 2000; received in revised form 12 June 2000; accepted 23 June 2000 Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane was carried out on several promoted Pt catalysts. The performance of the catalysts (activity,selectivity and coke formation) was compared in steam and hydrogen environment. Promoting Pt supported on u-alumina with Sn and K is essential for developing high-performance catalysts. The combination of optimal catalyst composition and steam yields high activity and selectivity at low coke formation. Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent. Charac- terization of catalysts using XPS, TEM and chemisorption methods supported the results of reaction data.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic Pt-Sn supported on alumina, widely used as catalysts in platforming and dehydrogenation pro- cesses, have been studied extensively [112]. Their special property, besides increased activity and selec- tivity, is the ability to prevent blockage of platinum surface, thus, increasing significantly the coke tole- rance at relatively high coke levels. The explanation suggested was the modification of adsorption proper- ties of Pt. Conventional components of bimetallic de- hydrogenation catalysts are basic metals (mainly potassium) decreasing cracking and coking activities [1316].
Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to pre- vent extensive coking. The function of Sn was consi- dered to be alteration of hydrogen adsorption [6,912].

Steam was also found to be a very effective coke in- hibitor [13,14,1719]. Actually its function as inert diluent enhances conversion in the equilibrium-limited system [14]. However, Pt-Sn/u-alumina in steam en- vironment has been little studied.
The purpose of this study is to characterize the be- havior of promoted Pt-Sn/u-alumina catalysts in steam and hydrogen environment.
2. Experimental
Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of u-alumina with a minimum surplus of solvent (1.1 g of solvent to 1 g of alumina). Aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6 and KNO3 and ethanol solution of SnCl2 were used. Each component was impregnated sepa- rately in the order Sn, Pt and K. After impregnation of each component the samples were dried at room temperature for 3 h and then at 100 and 130C for 0926-860X/01/$  see front matter  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

2 h. Calcination was carried out in two stages: 350 and 550C for 2 h. u-Alumina was prepared from g-alumina (extru- dates 4191, 1.6 mm diameter and 3.5 mm length from Engelhard Corp.) by calcination at 1000C for 8 h.
XRD measurements proved complete conversion to u-alumina. BET data (NOVA-1000, Quantachrome) yielded 104 m2/g, pore volume of 0.5 cm3/g and pore diameter of 16 nm. The bulk density was 0.54 g/cm3.
Catalysts were characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS [20] prior and after reaction. Respective averag- ing of high resolution of XPS peaks was done. Maxi- mum positions were determined by fitting procedure using the equation given in [21]. Correct determina- tion of maximum in certain cases was complicated due to flat peak tops. Dispersion of platinum in some sam- ples was measured by hydrogen chemisorption using pulse technique with unit AMI-100 (Altamira Co.).
The samples were first reduced at 500C and hydro- gen was thermodesorbed in Ar flow at 500C. High resolution TEM (JEOL 2010 equipped with EDS) was used in certain cases. The composition of the catalysts used in this study is listed in Table 1.
The experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed re- actor, 18 mm i.d. and 240 mm long equipped with ax- ial thermowell. The reactor was heated electrically and operated isothermally. The temperature was controlled by an Eurotherm system and the gas (nitrogen, hydro- gen, air and propane) flow was set by Brooks mass flow controllers. Water was fed by Masterflex peri- staltic pump. Steam from the reactor was condensed in two traps. The gaseous product was analyzed by online, PC controlled GOW MAC GC Series 580.
Catalyst (0.55 g) diluted with 3 g quartz powder (0.1 mm) were packed in the reactor. The catalyst was Table 1 Composition of catalysts Sample no.

reduced in hydrogen flow at 500C for 1 h in the re- actor. For tests in steam, the reactor was purged with nitrogen after reduction. After each test, the catalyst was regenerated in a mixture of steam (87 mol%) and air at 250 cm3 (STP)/min and 400C. Coke was deter- mined by integration of CO2 concentration over time.
The regenerated catalyst was reduced in hydrogen.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst testing
A comparison of catalysts at standard operating conditions typical to dehydrogenation processes is provided by data listed in Table 2. The selectivity of Pt catalyst (sample 1) was poor. Hydrocracking was the sole reaction in hydrogen environment while steam generated mainly carbon dioxide through ox- idative cracking. Addition of K in sample 2 reduced support acidity thus, inhibiting the cracking reactions improving selectivity. The major improvement in per- formance was achieved by combining Pt and Sn in samples 3 and 4. Sn is inhibitor of cracking reactions on Pt and on support [3]. Increasing Sn concentration from sample 3 to 4 increased selectivity.
The best performance was measured with catalysts that contained all three components in samples 57. A significantly higher yield of propylene was produced in steam environment. The intrinsic activity of sam- ples tested in steam reflected in propane conversion is masked by chemical equilibrium, like in the case of sample 7. Therefore, the dehydrogenation rates were measured at low yields, far from equilibrium (42 and 60% of propylene in steam, 5 and 12% in hydrogen at 500 and 550C). Equilibrium ratio CO/CO2 in steam conversion at 500550C is close to zero [22]. In hy- drogen, the yield varied from 0.7 to 1.8%. Data mea- sured in steam, plotted in Fig. 1, includes only one point at yields beyond 20%.
The rates listed in Table 3 indicate a significant ef- fect of Sn, in the case of steam environment. In hydro- gen the effect was much smaller. However, effect of tin is inhibited by excess of potassium, indicated by a significant difference in activity of samples 6 and 7 in Table 2. High concentration of both promoters proba- bly leads to blockage of the Pt sites, like the detrimen- tal effect of Sn excess on dehydrogenation activity of

Pt catalysts [4,7,9]. The rates listed in Table 3 were employed in calculations of intrapellet mass transfer effects. Those effects were negligible, in agreement with experimental measurements that yielded a neg- ligible effect of decreasing pellet size (to 0.5 mm) on the reaction rate.

The rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation of propane on platinum according to [16] is the disso- ciative adsorption of propane. Removal of hydrogen atoms from propane adsorbed on the surface was re- ported to be the limiting factor in the overall kinetics [8,16]. This suggests that enhancement of dehydro- 188

Similar interaction of hydrogen with hydroxyls on platinum yielding wa- ter was invoked elsewhere [23]. This is also supported by the fact that effect of steam was measured even for sample 2 (that did not contain Sn) suggesting that presence of tin was not absolutely necessary (although important).

189 Inhibition of the dehydrogenation rate in presence of steam was reported for Pt-Sn/g-alumina [24]. The difference in the adsorption properties of the two sup- ports with respect to steam could reconcile the appar- ent discrepancy.
Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst sta- bility. The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity. The principal measure of stability is the amount of coke on feed. Its level was similar for all samples (57) that contained all three components.
Other samples displayed higher coke levels, especially in steam experiments. However, a more significant pa- rameter is the coke produced normalized by the propy- lene yield. The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for opti- mized sample 7.
3.2. Surface characterization
The dispersion of mono and bimetals on the surface of reduced catalysts was measured by H2 chemisorp- tion, XRD and TEM. Chemisorption yielded values listed in Table 1. Tin does not increase significantly the Pt crystal size [25]. Decrease of H2 uptake is explained by enrichment of bimetallic clusters surface with tin [2628] and partial blockage of platinum atoms [7,28] so real size of platinum particles in all the measured samples was small. Clusters of about 1 nm were ob- served in TEM micrograph of catalyst 7 (Fig. 2). Mi- croanalysis by EDS indicated that the visible dark spots were really Pt containing clusters. XRD mea- surements did not produce significant results because of the small crystal size.

XPS analysis of samples 1 and 4 tested in steam is displayed in Table 4. Some XPS plots are pre- sented in Fig. 3. Pt in reduced and regenerated forms of sample 1 is present in metallic state, as expected.
Since XPS attenuation length for platinum and tin is about 3 monolayers [29], surface concentration of supported components was measured. Pt concentra- tions based on XPS and SEM (bulk analysis) data show small size Pt containing clusters similar to the results of chemisorption and TEM. Reproducible val- ues of Pt and Sn XPS peaks intensities in the same 190

sample indicate satisfactory accuracy of data (Table 4,sample 4).
Coke on sample 1 blocked Pt completely providing a measure for the coke tolerance developed previously [4,20]. Regeneration recovered 74% of initial intensity of Pt spectra (Pt/Al ratio decreases from 0.35 × 102 to 0.26 × 102, Table 4) probably due to migration of platinum in subsurface vacancies of alumina lattice as result of either interaction with alumina in oxidative medium [30] or due to partial sintering.
The presence of Sn in sample 4 produced a differ- ent picture of the surface consistent with reaction data.
The Pt surface concentration is lower compared with sample 1 due to partial blockage of tin. Actually the surface ratio Sn/Pt is 7.810, higher than the bulk ratio of 34 indicating enrichment of surface with low melt- ing metal in agreement with previous data [2628].
Tin is present as a cation in reduced sample 4 as well as in coked and regenerated samples. Coke blocked only about 8% of the Pt surface, negligible in compar- ison with sample 1. This indicates an essential coke tolerance effect of tin, observed in steam environment for the first time, whereas previous data [4,5,20] were obtained in hydrogen medium.
Regeneration increased Pt surface concentration caused by segregation of bimetallic clusters during oxidative treatment [12]. The slight decrease of tin surface concentration after regeneration was probably due to the overlapping by Pt and not migration of tin into alumina since this effect was not observed in calcined Pt-Sn/alumina and Sn/alumina samples [27].
Absence of essential chemical shift on Pt and Sn and overlapping in Pt-Sn system confirm ensemble or diluent effect of tin in agreement with other studies [1,12,15,31,32]. Segregation of active platinum sites by tin acting as inert diluent reduces the probability of forming strong, multiple bond reactant-surface that are responsible for coking and detrimental to dehy- drogenation selectivity. It controls chemisorption of reactant, products and intermediates so as to enhance rate-limiting steps, increasing dehydrogenation rate.
4. Conclusions
Steam was found to be an extremely effective medium for dehydrogenation of propane, better than hydrogen normally used in commercial processes. A careful selection of catalyst composition supported and guided by surface characterization, mainly XPS,yielded and efficient, selective and stable catalyst. Tin is a critical promoter. The presence of steam maxi- mizes the effect of Sn. Addition of potassium further improves catalyst performance. However, the catalyst composition should be controlled to avoid blocking of active sites. It was observed that tin provides an essential coke tolerance effect in steam environment.
The kinetic model that explains the effect of promoters and steam through the acceleration of rate-determining steps is consistent with the experi- mental data.
