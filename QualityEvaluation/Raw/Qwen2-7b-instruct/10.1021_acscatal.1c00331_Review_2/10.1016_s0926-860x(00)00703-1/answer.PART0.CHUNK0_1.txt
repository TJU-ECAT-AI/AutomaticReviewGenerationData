1. Hydrogen is commonly utilized to hinder extensive coking in dehydrogenation processes. As an inert diluent, it boosts conversion in equilibrium-limited systems.

2. The function of steam is to effectively inhibit coking, enhancing conversion in equilibrium-limited systems.

3. Tin acts as an inhibitor for cracking reactions occurring on both the platinum surface and the support material.

4. The optimal performance was observed when all three components—platinum, tin, and potassium—were included in the catalyst formulations, specifically in samples 5 and 7.

5. An excessive concentration of both tin and potassium might lead to the blockage of active platinum sites.

6. The effectiveness of tin is suppressed by an excess of potassium.

7. Steam was discovered to be exceptionally efficient in dehydrogenating propane, surpassing the use of hydrogen in commercial processes.

8. Tin plays a crucial role as a promoter, and its impact is amplified when steam is present.

9. Potassium addition further enhances the catalyst's performance.

10. It is imperative to manage the catalyst composition to prevent the blocking of active sites.
