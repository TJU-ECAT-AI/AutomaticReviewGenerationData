The use of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process leads to inferior results, as it facilitates extensive coke formation. In contrast, steam acts as an effective coke inhibitor, enhancing conversion in equilibrium-limited systems. Steam has been found to be a superior medium for dehydrogenating propane compared to hydrogen typically used in commercial processes. By carefully selecting catalyst compositions and employing surface characterization techniques such as XPS, highly efficient, selective, and stable catalysts can be developed. Tin is identified as a critical promoter, with its effectiveness being maximized in the presence of steam. The addition of potassium further improves catalyst performance. However, it is crucial to control the catalyst composition to prevent the blocking of active sites. Notably, tin provides an essential coke tolerance effect in steam environments, offering significant advantages over hydrogen-based processes.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中会导致较差的结果，因为它促进大量结焦。相比之下，蒸汽作为有效的结焦抑制剂，可以增强在平衡受限系统中的转化率。蒸汽被发现是比商业过程中通常使用的氢气更有效的丙烷脱氢介质。通过精心选择催化剂组成并利用表面表征技术如XPS，可以开发出高效、选择性和稳定的催化剂。锡被确认为一个关键的促进剂，其效果在蒸汽存在下得到最大化。钾的添加进一步提高了催化剂性能。然而，需要控制催化剂组成以防止活性位点堵塞。值得注意的是，锡在蒸汽环境中提供了必要的结焦耐受性效果，为过程效率和性能提供了显著优势。
