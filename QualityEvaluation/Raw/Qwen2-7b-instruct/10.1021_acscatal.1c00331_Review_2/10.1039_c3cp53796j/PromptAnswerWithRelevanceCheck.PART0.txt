[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[2] "The introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors."
[3] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surface facilitates the desorption of alkenes during propane dehydrogenation, making it easier compared to the dehydrogenation of the alkene. This can help reduce coke formation.
2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the catalyst does not change the relative activation barriers for the formation of alkenes from adsorbed alkanes versus the loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkane, which is crucial for coke precursor formation.
3. For all alkanes studied, including ethane, propane, and butane, the rate-limiting step in their dehydrogenation is the cleavage of the first carbon-hydrogen bond.
4. The high selectivity for alkene production is attributed to the higher energy barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom, alongside the low binding energies of alkenes that decrease with increasing temperature. This results in a preference for alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation.

2. 添加锡（Sn）到催化剂上不会改变从吸附的烯烃形成气相烯烃与从吸附的烯烃失去氢气的相对活化壁垒，这是形成焦炭前体过程的关键。
3. 对所有烷烃的研究表明，包括乙烷、丙烷和丁烷，它们的脱氢反应中决定性的步骤是第一个碳-氢键的断裂。
4. 高度选择性地生产烯烃归因于第三个氢原子断裂的更高能量壁垒，以及随着温度升高而降低的烯烃结合能。这导致更倾向于烯烃脱附而不是进一步脱氢。

[1] "The first CH cleavage at A2 constitutes the rate-determining step. This process has a barrier height of only 0.05 eV, which is significantly lower than the barrier (0.70 eV) calculated for propane dehydrogenation on bulk Pt (111)."
[2] "The barrier for CH bond breaking is slightly lower for a hydrogen migration along the same edge of the tetrahedron than it is along other edges."
[3] "Our propane adsorption energy of 0.29 eV, on the other hand, is close to the experimental value measured for Pt (111), which lies between 0.35 and 0.44 eV."
[4] "Having identified the potential energy changes occurring during the dehydrogenation, we next determine changes in Gibbs free energies."
[5] "The gain in entropy for desorption at higher temperature leads to an inversion of the ordering at A10: the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."
[6] "The introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors."

1. The rate-determining step in propane dehydrogenation is the first CH bond cleavage, with a barrier height of 0.05 eV, much lower than the 0.70 eV barrier for propane dehydrogenation on bulk Pt (111).

2. Hydrogen migration along the same edge of the tetrahedron has a slightly lower barrier for CH bond breaking than along other edges.

3. The propane adsorption energy on the Pt4 cluster is 0.29 eV, close to the experimental value for Pt (111), which ranges from 0.35 to 0.44 eV.

4. After identifying the potential energy changes during dehydrogenation, the next step is to calculate changes in Gibbs free energies.

5. At higher temperatures, the gain in entropy for desorption leads to an inversion of the ordering at A10, making the desorption of alkenes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, explaining the high selectivity for alkene formation.

6. The substitution of a Pt atom by Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, which is responsible for coke precursor formation.

1. 烯烃脱氢过程中，关键的步骤是第一个C-H键断裂，其能垒仅为0.05 eV，远低于在纯铂（111）表面进行丙烷脱氢所需的0.70 eV能垒。

2. 沿四面体同一边进行氢迁移时，C-H键断裂的能垒略低于沿其他边进行的能垒。

3. 丙烷在Pt4簇上的吸附能为0.29 eV，接近实验测量的Pt（111）值，范围在0.35至0.44 eV之间。

4. 在确定了脱氢过程中的势能变化后，下一步是计算吉布斯自由能的变化。

5. 温度升高导致脱氢的熵增加，在A10处改变了顺序，使烯烃的脱附比第三次C-H键断裂更有利，这解释了实验观察到的高烯烃选择性。

6. 将一个Pt原子替换为Sn不会改变气相烯烃形成与吸附烯烃上氢原子丢失之间的相对活化能垒，后者会导致焦油前体的形成。

[1] "The presence of hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke and enhances the rate of alkane dehydrogenation, if the ratio of H2 to alkane is below about 1.5."
[2] "A phase diagram based on thermodynamic data derived from DFT calculations predicts one stable phase, Pt4H, for H2 partial pressures and temperatures typical of those used in experimental studies (below 0.1 bar and above 600 °C)."
[3] "The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."
[4] "This phase shows an improved selectivity towards alkene production: the third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption."
[5] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway."
[6] "Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."
[7] "The net result of this effect is to increase the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate limiting step."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process reduces coke formation, enhances alkane dehydrogenation rate, and improves catalyst stability. The reduction in coke formation is due to suppressed coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and delayed graphitization.

2. The phase diagram indicates that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt4 cluster forms a stable phase, Pt4H, under typical experimental conditions, promoting alkene production by shifting the third CH cleavage step to a higher energy barrier.

3. Hydrogen adsorption stabilizes the catalyst without altering its geometry, facilitating the study of its influence on the reaction pathway.

4. The Pt4H phase enhances alkene selectivity by making the third CH cleavage step less competitive with alkene desorption, thus improving overall process efficiency.

5. Substituting a Pt atom with Sn in the Pt4 cluster introduces a negative charge to the active site, shifting the potential energy surface downward and reducing the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.

6. This modification increases the catalyst's activity without affecting the relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus hydrogen loss, contributing to enhanced performance.

7. The introduction of Sn to the Pt4 cluster leads to a more active catalyst due to the decreased activation barrier for the rate-limiting step, despite unchanged relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus hydrogen loss.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程（PDH）中，氢共喂养可以减少焦炭形成，提高烷烃脱氢速率，并增强催化剂稳定性。氢共喂养通过抑制焦炭积累模式、酸基团转换和延迟石墨化来减少焦炭形成。

2. 相图显示，在典型的实验条件下，氢吸附在铂4簇上形成的稳定相为Pt4H，这促进乙烯生成，通过将第三个CH断裂步骤移至更高能量壁垒来改善选择性。

3. 氢吸附在催化剂上而不会改变其几何形状，从而稳定催化剂，使研究其对反应途径的影响成为可能。

4. Pt4H相通过使第三个CH断裂步骤的竞争性降低与脱附的乙烯相比，提高了选择性，从而整体提高了过程效率。

5. 将一个铂原子替换为锡在铂4簇中引入负电荷到活性位点，使反应路径的势能表面向下移动，减少了限制步骤的活化能阈值。

6. 这种修改增加了催化剂的活性，尽管相对活化能阈值保持不变，对于乙烯形成与氢损失之间的过程导致形成焦炭前体。

7. 将Sn引入到铂4簇中导致更活跃的催化剂，由于降低了限制步骤的活化能阈值，尽管对乙烯形成相对于氢损失的相对活化能阈值没有影响。
