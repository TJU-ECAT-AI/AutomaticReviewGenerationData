[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[2] "The introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors."
[3] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."

1. Adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surface facilitates the desorption of alkenes during propane dehydrogenation, making it easier compared to the dehydrogenation of the alkene. This can help reduce coke formation.
2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the catalyst does not change the relative activation barriers for the formation of alkenes from adsorbed alkanes versus the loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkane, which is crucial for coke precursor formation.
3. For all alkanes studied, including ethane, propane, and butane, the rate-limiting step in their dehydrogenation is the cleavage of the first carbon-hydrogen bond.
4. The high selectivity for alkene production is attributed to the higher energy barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom, alongside the low binding energies of alkenes that decrease with increasing temperature. This results in a preference for alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation.

1. 吸附在催化剂表面的氢原子能促进烯烃的脱附，相对于吸附烯烃的脱氢，这有助于减少焦炭形成。
2. 添加锡（Sn）到催化剂上不会改变从吸附的烯烃形成气相烯烃与从吸附的烯烃失去氢气的相对活化壁垒，这是形成焦炭前体过程的关键。
3. 对所有烷烃的研究表明，包括乙烷、丙烷和丁烷，它们的脱氢反应中决定性的步骤是第一个碳-氢键的断裂。
4. 高度选择性地生产烯烃归因于第三个氢原子断裂的更高能量壁垒，以及随着温度升高而降低的烯烃结合能。这导致更倾向于烯烃脱附而不是进一步脱氢。
