[1] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model."
[2] "The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."
[3] "A phase diagram based on thermodynamic data derived from DFT calculations predicts one stable phase, Pt4H, for H2 partial pressures and temperatures typical of those used in experimental studies (below 0.1 bar and above 600 °C)."
[4] "This phase shows an improved selectivity towards alkene production: the third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption."
[5] "However, the introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding can be simulated using the Pt4 model to assess its impact on reducing coking and altering the reaction pathway.
2. Hydrogen adsorption onto the Pt4 cluster maintains the cluster's stability, allowing for the investigation of hydrogen's influence on the dehydrogenation reaction without geometric alterations.
3. Under typical experimental conditions, a phase diagram based on thermodynamic data predicts the stable Pt4H phase, which exhibits enhanced selectivity for alkene production.
4. In the Pt4H phase, the third CH bond cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, decreasing its competitiveness with alkene desorption, thus improving selectivity.
5. The introduction of Sn into the Pt4 cluster does not change the relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus hydrogen loss leading to coke precursor formation.

1. 使用Pt4模型可以模拟氢气共喂料，以评估其减少结焦和改变反应路径的影响。
2. 氢吸附到Pt4簇上保持簇的稳定性，允许对氢对脱氢反应的影响进行调查，而不会引起几何结构的变化。
3. 在典型实验条件下，基于热力学数据的相图预测稳定Pt4H相，该相显示出增强的烯烃生成选择性。
4. 在Pt4H相中，第三个CH键断裂步骤被转移到更高的能量，降低了其与烯烃脱附的竞争性，从而提高了选择性。
5. 将Sn引入到Pt4簇中不会改变烯烃形成相对于吸附烯烃中氢损失导致焦化前体形成的过程中的相对活化壁垒。
