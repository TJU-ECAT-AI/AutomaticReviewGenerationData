[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[2] "The introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activa- tion barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation of coke precursors."
[3] "The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."
[4] "The third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption."

1. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the catalyst facilitates the desorption of alkenes, making it more likely than dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene, which reduces coke formation. 
2. The introduction of tin (Sn) in the catalyst does not change the relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus the loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, thus not affecting the process that leads to the formation of coke precursors.  
3. Hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst maintains its stability, allowing researchers to study the impact of adsorbed hydrogen on the reaction pathway without altering the catalyst's geometry.  
4. By shifting the third CH cleavage step to a higher energy, the catalyst improves its selectivity towards alkene production, making it less competitive with the desorption of the alkene, which reduces the formation of coke precursors.

1. 吸附在催化剂上的氢原子促进了烯烃的脱附，使得吸附的烷烃脱氢反应不如脱附反应，从而减少了焦炭形成。
2. 在催化剂中引入锡（Sn）不会改变烯烃形成相对于吸附烷烃脱氢的激活能比，因此不影响导致形成焦炭前体的过程。  
3. 氢吸附在催化剂上保持其稳定性，允许研究吸附氢对反应路径的影响而不改变催化剂的几何形状。  
4. 将第三个CH断裂步骤移至更高能量，催化剂提高了其向烯烃生产的选择性，使其与烯烃脱附的竞争性降低，从而减少了焦炭前体的形成。
