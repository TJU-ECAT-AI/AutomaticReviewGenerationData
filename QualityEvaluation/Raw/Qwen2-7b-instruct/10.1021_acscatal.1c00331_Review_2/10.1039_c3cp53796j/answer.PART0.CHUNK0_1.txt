1. The rate-determining step in propane dehydrogenation is the first CH bond cleavage, with a barrier height of 0.05 eV, much lower than the 0.70 eV barrier for propane dehydrogenation on bulk Pt (111).

2. Hydrogen migration along the same edge of the tetrahedron has a slightly lower barrier for CH bond breaking than along other edges.

3. The propane adsorption energy on the Pt4 cluster is 0.29 eV, close to the experimental value for Pt (111), which ranges from 0.35 to 0.44 eV.

4. After identifying the potential energy changes during dehydrogenation, the next step is to calculate changes in Gibbs free energies.

5. At higher temperatures, the gain in entropy for desorption leads to an inversion of the ordering at A10, making the desorption of alkenes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, explaining the high selectivity for alkene formation.

6. The substitution of a Pt atom by Sn does not alter the relative activation barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, which is responsible for coke precursor formation.

1. 烯烃脱氢过程中，关键的步骤是第一个C-H键断裂，其能垒仅为0.05 eV，远低于在纯铂（111）表面进行丙烷脱氢所需的0.70 eV能垒。

2. 沿四面体同一边进行氢迁移时，C-H键断裂的能垒略低于沿其他边进行的能垒。

3. 丙烷在Pt4簇上的吸附能为0.29 eV，接近实验测量的Pt（111）值，范围在0.35至0.44 eV之间。

4. 在确定了脱氢过程中的势能变化后，下一步是计算吉布斯自由能的变化。

5. 温度升高导致脱氢的熵增加，在A10处改变了顺序，使烯烃的脱附比第三次C-H键断裂更有利，这解释了实验观察到的高烯烃选择性。

6. 将一个Pt原子替换为Sn不会改变气相烯烃形成与吸附烯烃上氢原子丢失之间的相对活化能垒，后者会导致焦油前体的形成。
