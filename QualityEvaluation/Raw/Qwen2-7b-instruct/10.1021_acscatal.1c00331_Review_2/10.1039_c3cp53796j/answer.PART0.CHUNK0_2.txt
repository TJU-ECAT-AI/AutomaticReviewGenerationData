[1] "The presence of hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke and enhances the rate of alkane dehydrogenation, if the ratio of H2 to alkane is below about 1.5."
[2] "A phase diagram based on thermodynamic data derived from DFT calculations predicts one stable phase, Pt4H, for H2 partial pressures and temperatures typical of those used in experimental studies (below 0.1 bar and above 600 °C)."
[3] "The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."
[4] "This phase shows an improved selectivity towards alkene production: the third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption."
[5] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway."
[6] "Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."
[7] "The net result of this effect is to increase the activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate limiting step."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process reduces coke formation, enhances alkane dehydrogenation rate, and improves catalyst stability. The reduction in coke formation is due to suppressed coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and delayed graphitization.

2. The phase diagram indicates that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt4 cluster forms a stable phase, Pt4H, under typical experimental conditions, promoting alkene production by shifting the third CH cleavage step to a higher energy barrier.

3. Hydrogen adsorption stabilizes the catalyst without altering its geometry, facilitating the study of its influence on the reaction pathway.

4. The Pt4H phase enhances alkene selectivity by making the third CH cleavage step less competitive with alkene desorption, thus improving overall process efficiency.

5. Substituting a Pt atom with Sn in the Pt4 cluster introduces a negative charge to the active site, shifting the potential energy surface downward and reducing the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.

6. This modification increases the catalyst's activity without affecting the relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus hydrogen loss, contributing to enhanced performance.

7. The introduction of Sn to the Pt4 cluster leads to a more active catalyst due to the decreased activation barrier for the rate-limiting step, despite unchanged relative activation barriers for alkene formation versus hydrogen loss.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程（PDH）中，氢共喂养可以减少焦炭形成，提高烷烃脱氢速率，并增强催化剂稳定性。氢共喂养通过抑制焦炭积累模式、酸基团转换和延迟石墨化来减少焦炭形成。

2. 相图显示，在典型的实验条件下，氢吸附在铂4簇上形成的稳定相为Pt4H，这促进乙烯生成，通过将第三个CH断裂步骤移至更高能量壁垒来改善选择性。

3. 氢吸附在催化剂上而不会改变其几何形状，从而稳定催化剂，使研究其对反应途径的影响成为可能。

4. Pt4H相通过使第三个CH断裂步骤的竞争性降低与脱附的乙烯相比，提高了选择性，从而整体提高了过程效率。

5. 将一个铂原子替换为锡在铂4簇中引入负电荷到活性位点，使反应路径的势能表面向下移动，减少了限制步骤的活化能阈值。

6. 这种修改增加了催化剂的活性，尽管相对活化能阈值保持不变，对于乙烯形成与氢损失之间的过程导致形成焦炭前体。

7. 将Sn引入到铂4簇中导致更活跃的催化剂，由于降低了限制步骤的活化能阈值，尽管对乙烯形成相对于氢损失的相对活化能阈值没有影响。
