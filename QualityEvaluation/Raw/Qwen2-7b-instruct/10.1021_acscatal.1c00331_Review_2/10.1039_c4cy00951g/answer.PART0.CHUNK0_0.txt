<p>Compared with non-noble catalysts, noble (Pt) catalysts show higher catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Therefore, appropriate amounts of Al should be added to the catalyst system to maintain the oxidation state of Sn.</p>
<p>The addition of Al dramatically restrains the formation of Sn0 by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn, and promotes the transformation of framework Sn(SiO)4 to surface SiOSnOH or AlOSnOH.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the XPS results after reaction, the addition of Al inhibits the reduction of Sn species by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn.</p>
<p>It has been reported that two types of Lewis acid sites are shown to exist in Sn-silica material due to the incorporation of Sn into the silica framework and the formation of Sn(SiO)4 (site A) and Sn(SiO)3SnOH (site B) sites.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Al into the framework of SBA-15 leads to the desorption peak at about 400 C, which is attributed to the generation of Brnsted acid sites.</p>
<p>The addition of Al, on the one hand, promotes the transformation of Td coordination Sn to Oh coordination Sn, which is in favor of the interaction with Pt and the support.</p>
<p>The close contact of Pt and Brnsted acid sites may result in electron transfer from Pt to Brnsted proton.</p>
<p>Therefore, Al addition changes the acidity of the catalysts, which influences coke formation.</p>
<p>In situ Raman spectra results indicate that the catalysts with different Al contents show different coke formation rates.</p>
