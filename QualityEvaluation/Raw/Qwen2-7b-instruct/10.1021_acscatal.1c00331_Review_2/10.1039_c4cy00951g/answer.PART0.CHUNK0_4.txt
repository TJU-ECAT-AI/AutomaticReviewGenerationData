[1] "The addition of aluminum enhances the interaction of the Sn support and consequently stabilizes the oxidation state of Sn during the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The acid centers formed by aluminum addition show close contact with metal centers (Pt), which favors the synergistic effect of the bifunctional active centers."
[3] "High catalytic performance over PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 was obtained, and one-pass propane conversion and propene selectivity are 55.9% and 98.5%, respectively."
[4] "The addition of Al dramatically restrains the formation of Sn0 by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn, and promotes the transformation of framework Sn(SiO)4 to surface SiOSnOH or AlOSnOH."
[5] "The close contact of Pt and Brnsted acid sites may result in electron transfer from Pt to Brnsted proton. It can decrease the electron transfers to Snn+ and then prevent the formation of metallic Sn from SnOx, which can prevent the deactivation of the catalysts."
[6] "The addition of Al changes the acidity of the catalysts, which influences coke formation."
[7] "The catalysts with different Al contents show different coke formation rates."
[8] "The addition of excess Al results in the increase in strong acid sites, which is favorable for coke formation, and leads to the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The close contact between metal sites and acid sites facilitated by aluminum addition promotes the synergistic effect of bifunctional active centers. Aluminum stabilizes the oxidation state of tin and enhances the interaction between Sn and the support, preventing the formation of metallic Sn and reducing coke formation. The introduction of strong acid sites by excess aluminum accelerates coke formation, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. The overall process efficiency and performance are influenced by these effects.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基转换和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。铝的添加促进了金属位点与酸基之间的紧密接触，从而促进双功能活性中心的协同效应。铝稳定了锡的氧化状态，并增强了锡与支撑物之间的相互作用，防止了金属锡的形成并减少了焦炭形成。引入强酸基位点的过量铝加速了焦炭形成，导致催化剂快速失活。这些效果影响了过程的整体效率和性能。
