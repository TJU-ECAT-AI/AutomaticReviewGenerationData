[1] "The addition of aluminum enhances the interaction of the Sn support and consequently stabilizes the oxidation state of Sn during the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The acid centers formed by aluminum addition show close contact with metal centers (Pt), which favors the synergistic effect of the bifunctional active centers."
[3] "High catalytic performance over PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 was obtained, and one-pass propane conversion and propene selectivity are 55.9% and 98.5%, respectively."
[4] "The addition of Al dramatically restrains the formation of Sn0 by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn, and promotes the transformation of framework Sn(SiO)4 to surface SiOSnOH or AlOSnOH."
[5] "It has been reported that two types of Lewis acid sites are shown to exist in Sn-silica material due to the incorporation of Sn into the silica framework and the formation of Sn(SiO)4 (site A) and Sn(SiO)3SnOH (site B) sites."
[6] "The addition of excess Al results in the increase in strong acid sites, which is favorable for coke formation, and leads to the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The introduction of aluminum into the catalyst system enhances the interaction between tin (Sn) and supports, stabilizing the oxidation state of Sn and promoting the formation of close contacts between acid sites and metal centers, which enhances the synergistic effect of bifunctional active sites. This leads to improved catalytic performance, with one-pass propane conversion reaching 55.9% and propene selectivity at 98.5%. Aluminum addition also restrains the formation of Sn0, facilitating its transformation into surface sites via interactions with silica frameworks. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding influences the conversion of acid sites, affecting the degree of graphitization. Excessive aluminum incorporation increases the density of strong acid sites, which accelerates coke formation and deactivates the catalyst rapidly. These effects collectively impact the overall process efficiency and performance by controlling coke formation, catalyst stability, and the effectiveness of the reaction mechanisms.

氢助剂在丙烷脱氢过程中通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基转换和石墨化程度，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。铝的引入增强了锡（Sn）与载体之间的相互作用，稳定了Sn的氧化状态，并促进了酸基与金属中心之间的紧密接触，从而增强双功能活性中心的协同效应。这导致催化性能的改善，一程丙烷转化率达到55.9%，丙烯选择性为98.5%。铝的添加还限制了Sn0的形成，通过与硅氧骨架的相互作用促进其向表面位点的转变。此外，氢助剂对酸基转换的影响也会影响石墨化的程度。过量铝的加入增加了强酸位的数量，加速了焦炭形成并迅速使催化剂失效。这些效果共同影响整个过程的效率和性能，通过控制焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制的有效性。
