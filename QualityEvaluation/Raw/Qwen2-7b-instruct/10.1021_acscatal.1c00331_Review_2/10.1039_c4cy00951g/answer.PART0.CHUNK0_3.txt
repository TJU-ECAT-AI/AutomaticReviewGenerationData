[1] "For PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts, different Al loading results in dif- ferent acid amounts and acid strengths, which may lead to different coke formation rates. The formation rate of coke on these catalysts influences the propane dehydrogenation deac- tivation rate."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species was reduced during the reaction and alloyed with Pt. Moreover, the alloying degree increased with decreasing Al content."
[3] "The addition of Al changes the acidity of the catalysts, which influences coke formation. In situ Raman spectra results indicate that the catalysts with different Al contents show different coke formation rates. The addition of excess Al results in the increase in strong acid sites, which is favorable for coke formation, and leads to the fast deactiva- tion of the catalyst."

1. Different aluminum loadings on the PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts lead to varying amounts and strengths of acid sites, which in turn affect the rate of coke formation. This impacts the deactivation rate of the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation.
2. During the reaction, some Sn species were reduced and combined with Pt, and the degree of alloying increased with decreasing aluminum content.
3. Adding aluminum alters the acidity of the catalysts, influencing coke formation. In situ Raman spectra show that catalysts with different aluminum contents exhibit distinct coke formation rates. Excess aluminum introduces more strong acid sites, facilitating coke formation and causing rapid catalyst deactivation.

1. 不同铝加载量的PtSnAl/SBA-15催化剂导致不同的酸量和酸强度，进而影响焦炭形成速率。这影响丙烷脱氢催化剂的失活率。
2. 反应过程中，一些Sn物种被还原并与Pt结合，且铝含量减少时合金化程度增加。
3. 添加铝改变催化剂的酸性，影响焦炭形成。原位拉曼光谱显示不同铝含量的催化剂具有不同的焦炭形成速率。过量的铝引入更多的强酸性位点，有利于焦炭形成，并导致催化剂快速失活。
