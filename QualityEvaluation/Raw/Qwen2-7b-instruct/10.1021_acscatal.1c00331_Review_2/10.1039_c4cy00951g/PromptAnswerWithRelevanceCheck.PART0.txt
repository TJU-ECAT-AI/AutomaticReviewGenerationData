<p>Compared with non-noble catalysts, noble (Pt) catalysts show higher catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Therefore, appropriate amounts of Al should be added to the catalyst system to maintain the oxidation state of Sn.</p>
<p>The addition of Al dramatically restrains the formation of Sn0 by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn, and promotes the transformation of framework Sn(SiO)4 to surface SiOSnOH or AlOSnOH.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the XPS results after reaction, the addition of Al inhibits the reduction of Sn species by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn.</p>
<p>It has been reported that two types of Lewis acid sites are shown to exist in Sn-silica material due to the incorporation of Sn into the silica framework and the formation of Sn(SiO)4 (site A) and Sn(SiO)3SnOH (site B) sites.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Al into the framework of SBA-15 leads to the desorption peak at about 400 C, which is attributed to the generation of Brnsted acid sites.</p>
<p>The addition of Al, on the one hand, promotes the transformation of Td coordination Sn to Oh coordination Sn, which is in favor of the interaction with Pt and the support.</p>
<p>The close contact of Pt and Brnsted acid sites may result in electron transfer from Pt to Brnsted proton.</p>
<p>Therefore, Al addition changes the acidity of the catalysts, which influences coke formation.</p>
<p>In situ Raman spectra results indicate that the catalysts with different Al contents show different coke formation rates.</p>

[1] "In this work, in situ Raman spectra were used to investigate the formation of coke.53,54 Fig. 9 shows the in situ Raman spectra of (a) PtSnAl0/SBA-15, (b) PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 and (c) PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 9a, there is no apparent peak at the beginning of the reaction on PtSnAl0/SBA-15."
[3] "After about 4.5 h, two Raman bands at around 1600 and 1330 cm1 were observed and increased with increasing reaction time."
[4] "The band at 1600 cm1 is called the G band, which is actually the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in CC chains or in aromatic rings."
[5] "The band at 1330 cm1 is ascribed to the D band or disordered band which is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains."
[6] "As shown in Fig. 9a, the Raman bands at around 1330 and 1600 cm1 revealed that carbon deposition on PtSnAl0/SBA-15 took place after about 4.5 h reaction, and its intensity increases with further reaction."
[7] "However, compared with these two catalysts, PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 shows the fastest coke formation rate, which is demonstrated by the early appearance of Raman bands after 3 h reaction."

The in situ Raman spectra were utilized to investigate the formation of coke during the propane dehydrogenation process. The spectra showed that after approximately 4.5 hours of reaction, two Raman bands at around 1600 and 1330 cm1 appeared and increased with time. The band at 1600 cm1, known as the G band, signifies the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in CC chains or in aromatic rings. The band at 1330 cm1 is attributed to the D band or disordered band, which is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains. These bands provided information not only on the amount of coke formed on the catalyst but also on its nature. The Raman bands at around 1330 and 1600 cm1 indicated that carbon deposition on the PtSnAl0/SBA-15 catalyst started after about 4.5 hours of reaction, and the intensity of these bands increased with further reaction. Among the catalysts, PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 showed the fastest coke formation rate, as evidenced by the early appearance of Raman bands after 3 hours of reaction.

利用原位拉曼光谱研究了丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭的形成。谱图显示，在约4.5小时的反应后，出现了两个拉曼带，分别位于约1600和1330 cm1附近，并随着时间增加。1600 cm1的带被称为G带，表示任何一对sp2点的伸缩振动，无论是在CC链中还是在芳香环中。1330 cm1的带被归因于D带或无序带，这是那些仅在环中的sp2点的呼吸模式，而不是在链中。这些带不仅提供了催化剂上焦炭量的信息，也提供了其性质的信息。1330和1600 cm1附近的拉曼带表明，PtSnAl0/SBA-15催化剂开始在约4.5小时的反应后沉积碳，这些带的强度随进一步反应而增加。在各种催化剂中，PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15显示出最快的焦炭形成速率，这从3小时反应后早期出现拉曼带可以证明。

[1] "The addition of aluminum enhances the interaction of the Sn support and consequently stabilizes the oxidation state of Sn during the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The acid centers formed by aluminum addition show close contact with metal centers (Pt), which favors the synergistic effect of the bifunctional active centers."
[3] "High catalytic performance over PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 was obtained, and one-pass propane conversion and propene selectivity are 55.9% and 98.5%, respectively."
[4] "The addition of Al dramatically restrains the formation of Sn0 by enhancing the interaction of SBA-15 and Sn through surface SiOSn or AlOSn, and promotes the transformation of framework Sn(SiO)4 to surface SiOSnOH or AlOSnOH."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The introduction of aluminum into the catalyst system enhances the interaction between tin (Sn) and supports, stabilizing the oxidation state of Sn and promoting the formation of close contacts between acid sites and metal centers, which enhances the synergistic effect of bifunctional active sites. This leads to improved catalytic performance, with one-pass propane conversion reaching 55.9% and propene selectivity at 98.5%. Aluminum addition also restrains the formation of Sn0, facilitating its transformation into surface sites via interactions with silica frameworks. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding influences the conversion of acid sites, affecting the degree of graphitization. Excessive aluminum incorporation increases the density of strong acid sites, which accelerates coke formation and deactivates the catalyst rapidly. These effects collectively impact the overall process efficiency and performance by controlling coke formation, catalyst stability, and the effectiveness of the reaction mechanisms.

氢助剂在丙烷脱氢过程中通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基转换和石墨化程度，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。铝的引入增强了锡（Sn）与载体之间的相互作用，稳定了Sn的氧化状态，并促进了酸基与金属中心之间的紧密接触，从而增强双功能活性中心的协同效应。这导致催化性能的改善，一程丙烷转化率达到55.9%，丙烯选择性为98.5%。铝的添加还限制了Sn0的形成，通过与硅氧骨架的相互作用促进其向表面位点的转变。此外，氢助剂对酸基转换的影响也会影响石墨化的程度。过量铝的加入增加了强酸位的数量，加速了焦炭形成并迅速使催化剂失效。这些效果共同影响整个过程的效率和性能，通过控制焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制的有效性。

[1] "For PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts, different Al loading results in dif- ferent acid amounts and acid strengths, which may lead to different coke formation rates. The formation rate of coke on these catalysts influences the propane dehydrogenation deac- tivation rate."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species was reduced during the reaction and alloyed with Pt. Moreover, the alloying degree increased with decreasing Al content."
[3] "The addition of Al changes the acidity of the catalysts, which influences coke formation. In situ Raman spectra results indicate that the catalysts with different Al contents show different coke formation rates. The addition of excess Al results in the increase in strong acid sites, which is favorable for coke formation, and leads to the fast deactiva- tion of the catalyst."

1. Different aluminum loadings on the PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts lead to varying amounts and strengths of acid sites, which in turn affect the rate of coke formation. This impacts the deactivation rate of the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation.
2. During the reaction, some Sn species were reduced and combined with Pt, and the degree of alloying increased with decreasing aluminum content.
3. Adding aluminum alters the acidity of the catalysts, influencing coke formation. In situ Raman spectra show that catalysts with different aluminum contents exhibit distinct coke formation rates. Excess aluminum introduces more strong acid sites, facilitating coke formation and causing rapid catalyst deactivation.
