[1] "In this work, in situ Raman spectra were used to investigate the formation of coke.53,54 Fig. 9 shows the in situ Raman spectra of (a) PtSnAl0/SBA-15, (b) PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 and (c) PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 9a, there is no apparent peak at the beginning of the reaction on PtSnAl0/SBA-15."
[3] "After about 4.5 h, two Raman bands at around 1600 and 1330 cm1 were observed and increased with increasing reaction time."
[4] "The band at 1600 cm1 is called the G band, which is actually the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in CC chains or in aromatic rings."
[5] "The band at 1330 cm1 is ascribed to the D band or disordered band which is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains."
[6] "As shown in Fig. 9a, the Raman bands at around 1330 and 1600 cm1 revealed that carbon deposition on PtSnAl0/SBA-15 took place after about 4.5 h reaction, and its intensity increases with further reaction."
[7] "However, compared with these two catalysts, PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 shows the fastest coke formation rate, which is demonstrated by the early appearance of Raman bands after 3 h reaction."

The in situ Raman spectra were utilized to investigate the formation of coke during the propane dehydrogenation process. The spectra showed that after approximately 4.5 hours of reaction, two Raman bands at around 1600 and 1330 cm1 appeared and increased with time. The band at 1600 cm1, known as the G band, signifies the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in CC chains or in aromatic rings. The band at 1330 cm1 is attributed to the D band or disordered band, which is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains. These bands provided information not only on the amount of coke formed on the catalyst but also on its nature. The Raman bands at around 1330 and 1600 cm1 indicated that carbon deposition on the PtSnAl0/SBA-15 catalyst started after about 4.5 hours of reaction, and the intensity of these bands increased with further reaction. Among the catalysts, PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15 showed the fastest coke formation rate, as evidenced by the early appearance of Raman bands after 3 hours of reaction.

利用原位拉曼光谱研究了丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭的形成。谱图显示，在约4.5小时的反应后，出现了两个拉曼带，分别位于约1600和1330 cm1附近，并随着时间增加。1600 cm1的带被称为G带，表示任何一对sp2点的伸缩振动，无论是在CC链中还是在芳香环中。1330 cm1的带被归因于D带或无序带，这是那些仅在环中的sp2点的呼吸模式，而不是在链中。这些带不仅提供了催化剂上焦炭量的信息，也提供了其性质的信息。1330和1600 cm1附近的拉曼带表明，PtSnAl0/SBA-15催化剂开始在约4.5小时的反应后沉积碳，这些带的强度随进一步反应而增加。在各种催化剂中，PtSnAl0.4/SBA-15显示出最快的焦炭形成速率，这从3小时反应后早期出现拉曼带可以证明。
