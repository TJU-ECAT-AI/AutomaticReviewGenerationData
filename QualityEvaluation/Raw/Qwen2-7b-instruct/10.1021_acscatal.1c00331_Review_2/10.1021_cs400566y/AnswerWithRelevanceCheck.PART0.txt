      <English>
          The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the activation energy barrier for coke formation, altering coke accumulation patterns to be more uniform, influencing acid site conversions to reduce coke formation, mitigating the formation of large coke structures through graphitization processes. These effects lead to improvements in catalyst stability and efficiency.
