[1] "In the presence of hydrogen, coke formation on the Pt surface is significantly reduced compared to the absence of hydrogen."
[2] "Hydrogen cofeeding leads to a decrease in the activation energy barrier for coke formation."
[3] "Coke accumulation patterns are altered due to hydrogen cofeeding, leading to more uniform coke distribution."
[4] "Acid site conversions are influenced by hydrogen, potentially reducing coke formation."
[5] "Graphitization processes are affected by hydrogen, which can mitigate the formation of large coke structures."
[6] "These effects imply improvements in catalyst stability and efficiency."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the activation energy barrier for coke formation, altering coke accumulation patterns to be more uniform, influencing acid site conversions to reduce coke formation, mitigating the formation of large coke structures through graphitization processes. These effects lead to improvements in catalyst stability and efficiency.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢的共喂料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制的影响包括显著减少铂表面的焦炭形成，降低焦炭形成所需的活化能势垒，改变焦炭积累模式以实现更均匀的分布，影响酸性位点转换以减少焦炭形成，并通过抑制大型焦炭结构的形成来影响石墨化过程。这些效果导致催化剂稳定性和效率的改善。
