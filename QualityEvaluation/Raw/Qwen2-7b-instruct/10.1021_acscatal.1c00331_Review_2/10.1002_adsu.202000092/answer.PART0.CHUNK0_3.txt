1. The presence of coke on the metal site and surface of the catalyst support can lead to deactivation. Characterizing the structure and formation pathway of coke is crucial for addressing this issue. The identification of C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy and the investigation of their production pathways through DFT calculations offer insights into the process. These coke deposits can potentially be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process, providing theoretical guidance for improving propylene yield and catalyst stability.

1. 在催化剂支撑物的金属位点和表面存在的焦炭可能导致催化剂失活。确定焦炭的结构及其形成途径对于解决这个问题至关重要。在PtSn合金表面识别C3物种作为碳沉积物，并通过DFT计算研究其生产途径，提供了对过程的理解。这些焦炭沉积物有可能在PDH过程中氢化为丙烯，从而为提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供理论指导。
