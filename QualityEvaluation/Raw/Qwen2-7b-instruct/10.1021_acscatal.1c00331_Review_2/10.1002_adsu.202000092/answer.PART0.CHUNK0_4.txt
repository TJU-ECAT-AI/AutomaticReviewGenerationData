Characterizing the structure of coke and their formation pathway on PtSn alloy during propane dehydrogenation is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation and improving process efficiency. The coke forms both on the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. A smaller portion of coke accumulates on the metal, which is typically associated with catalyst deactivation. Recent studies have identified specific carbon compounds (C3 species) as coke deposits on the PtSn alloy surface. The formation pathways of these coke deposits have been explored through computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, these coke deposits can be converted to propylene during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, offering potential strategies for enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability.

对于丙烷脱氢过程中PtSn合金上的焦炭结构和形成途径的表征，理解催化剂失活并提高工艺效率至关重要。焦炭在金属点和催化剂支撑表面都可形成。通常认为金属上积累的小部分焦炭与催化剂失活有关。最近的研究已识别出特定的碳化合物（C3物种）作为PtSn合金表面的焦炭沉积物。通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算等方法探索了这些焦炭沉积物的形成途径。此外，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，这些焦炭沉积物可以被氢化为丙烯，这为提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供了潜在策略。
