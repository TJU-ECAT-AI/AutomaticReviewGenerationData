[1] "According to the previous studies, coke could be produced on the metal site and surface of catalyst support, respectively."
[2] "Furthermore, only a small part of coke was located on the metal, which was usually believed to be responsible for deactivation."
[3] "However, qualification on this kind of coke was rather difficult because large amounts of coke were present on the surface of catalyst support, disturbing the analysis."
[4] "Several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of PtSn alloy."
[5] "In addition, several pathways for their production were investigated by DFT calculation as well."
[6] "Further, these coke could be hydrogenated to propylene in PDH process."

The document discusses the structure and formation of coke on a PtSn alloy during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. It highlights that coke can form on both the metal sites and surfaces of catalyst supports, with a focus on its formation on the PtSn alloy. The coke is characterized as containing C3 species and can undergo hydrogenation to produce propylene. The study aims to provide insights into coke formation and its implications for catalyst stability and PDH process efficiency.
