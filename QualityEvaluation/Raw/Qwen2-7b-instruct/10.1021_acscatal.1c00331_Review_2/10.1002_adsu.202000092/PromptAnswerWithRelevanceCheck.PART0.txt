The literature discusses the formation of coke on the metal sites and surfaces of catalyst supports during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. It highlights that while some coke accumulates on the metal sites, which are often associated with deactivation, other coke forms on the surface of the catalyst support. The study identifies several C3 species as carbon deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy and investigates various pathways for their production through DFT calculations. Importantly, it notes that under certain conditions, this coke can be converted to propylene during the PDH process, offering potential theoretical guidance for enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process might influence coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by affecting energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. However, the specific details on how hydrogen cofeeding impacts these aspects are not provided in the document. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are also not elaborated upon within the given literature.

文献讨论了丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中催化剂支撑物表面和金属位点上焦炭的形成。它强调，虽然部分焦炭积累在金属位点上，这些位点通常被认为是导致失活的原因，但其他焦炭则沉积在催化剂支撑物的表面上。研究识别了PtSn合金表面的几种C3物种作为碳沉积物，并通过第一性原理计算调查了它们的生产途径。重要的是，它指出，在特定条件下，这种焦炭可以在PDH过程中被氢化为丙烯，为提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供了潜在的理论指导。

氢共给入PDH过程可能通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基团转换和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。然而，关于氢共给入对这些方面影响的具体细节并未在提供的文献中提及。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响也未在文献中详细阐述。

Characterizing the structure of coke and their formation pathway on PtSn alloy during propane dehydrogenation is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation and improving process efficiency. The coke forms both on the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. A smaller portion of coke accumulates on the metal, which is typically associated with catalyst deactivation. Recent studies have identified specific carbon compounds (C3 species) as coke deposits on the PtSn alloy surface. The formation pathways of these coke deposits have been explored through computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, these coke deposits can be converted to propylene during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, offering potential strategies for enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability.
