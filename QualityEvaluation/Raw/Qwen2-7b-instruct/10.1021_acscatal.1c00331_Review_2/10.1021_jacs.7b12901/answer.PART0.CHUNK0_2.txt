How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?
The hydrogen cofeeding impacts the PDH process by affecting coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It considers the influence on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These effects have implications on the overall process efficiency and performance.
