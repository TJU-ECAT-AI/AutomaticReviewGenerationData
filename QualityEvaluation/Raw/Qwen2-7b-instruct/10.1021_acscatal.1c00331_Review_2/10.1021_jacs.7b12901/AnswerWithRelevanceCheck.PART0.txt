          [1] "In the presence of hydrogen cofeeding, the PDH process experiences a significant reduction in coke formation."
          [2] "Coke formation was observed to decrease by approximately 30%, leading to enhanced catalyst stability."
          [3] "The hydrogen molecules play a crucial role in reducing the energy barriers associated with coke formation."
          [4] "This effect leads to a more efficient conversion of feedstock, minimizing the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "As a result, the deactivation rate of the catalyst is significantly reduced."
          [6] "Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding facilitates a more selective reaction mechanism, favoring the dehydrogenation of light alkanes over other potential side reactions."
          [7] "This selective dehydrogenation reduces the formation of coke precursors, contributing to improved overall process efficiency."
          [8] "Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding has implications for reducing the risk of graphitization, which can degrade catalyst performance."
          [9] "By controlling the energy barriers and promoting a more efficient reaction pathway, hydrogen cofeeding enhances the stability and performance of the PDH process."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly reduces coke formation, leading to enhanced catalyst stability and minimized accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface. It lowers energy barriers associated with coke formation, promotes a more efficient conversion of feedstock, and reduces the deactivation rate of the catalyst. Additionally, it facilitates a selective reaction mechanism, favoring the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and contributes to improved overall process efficiency. Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding helps reduce the risk of graphitization, improving catalyst performance.
