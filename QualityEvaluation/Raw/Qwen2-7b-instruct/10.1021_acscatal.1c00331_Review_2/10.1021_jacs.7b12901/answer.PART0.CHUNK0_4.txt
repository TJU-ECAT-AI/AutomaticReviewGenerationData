[1] "In the presence of hydrogen cofeeding, the dehydrogenation of propane is accompanied by a significant reduction in coke formation."
[2] "This effect leads to an improvement in catalyst stability, as coke deposition is slowed down."
[3] "The hydrogen cofeeding modifies the energy barriers associated with the dehydrogenation reaction, influencing the reaction mechanisms."
[4] "It also affects the patterns of coke accumulation, leading to more controlled and less detrimental coke formation."
[5] "Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding influences the conversion of Brnsted acid sites, which is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process."
[6] "Graphitization, a process related to the formation of carbon structures, is also impacted by hydrogen cofeeding."
[7] "These combined effects have significant implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, enhancing the yield and selectivity of the desired products."
