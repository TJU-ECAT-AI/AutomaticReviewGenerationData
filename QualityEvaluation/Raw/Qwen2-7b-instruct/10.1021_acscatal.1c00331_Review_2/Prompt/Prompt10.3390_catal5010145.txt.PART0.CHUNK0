Abstract: Deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts is a ubiquitous problem that causes loss of catalytic rate with time. This review on deactivation and regeneration of heterogeneous catalysts classifies deactivation by type (chemical, thermal, and mechanical) and by mechanism (poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation, vapor formation, vapor-solid and solid-solid reactions, and attrition/crushing). The key features and considerations for each of these deactivation types is reviewed in detail with reference to the latest literature reports in these areas. Two case studies on the deactivation mechanisms of catalysts used for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch and selective catalytic reduction are considered to provide additional depth in the topics of sintering, coking, poisoning, and fouling. Regeneration considerations and options are also briefly discussed for each deactivation mechanism.
Keywords: heterogeneous catalysis; deactivation; regeneration
1. Introduction
Catalyst deactivation, the loss over time of catalytic activity and/or selectivity, is a problem of great and continuing concern in the practice of industrial catalytic processes. Costs to industry for catalyst replacement and process shutdown total billions of dollars per year. Time scales for catalyst deactivation vary considerably; for example, in the case of cracking catalysts, catalyst mortality may be on the order of seconds, while in ammonia synthesis the iron catalyst may last for 510 years.
However, it is inevitable that all catalysts will decay.

Typically, the loss of activity in a well-controlled process occurs slowly. However, process upsets or poorly designed hardware can bring about catastrophic failure. For example, in steam reforming of methane or naphtha, great care must be taken to avoid reactor operation at excessively high temperatures or at steam-to-hydrocarbon ratios below a critical value. Indeed, these conditions can cause formation of large quantities of carbon filaments that plug catalyst pores and voids, pulverize catalyst pellets, and bring about process shutdown, all within a few hours.
While catalyst deactivation is inevitable for most processes, some of its immediate, drastic consequences may be avoided, postponed, or even reversed. Thus, deactivation issues (i.e., extent, rate,and reactivation) greatly impact research, development, design, and operation of commercial processes. Accordingly, there is considerable motivation to understand and treat catalyst decay. Over the past three decades, the science of catalyst deactivation has been steadily developing, while literature addressing this topic has expanded considerably to include books [14], comprehensive reviews [58], proceedings of international symposia [914], topical journal issues (e.g., [15]), and more than 20,000 U.S. patents for the period of 19762013. (In a U.S. patent search conducted in November 2013 for the keywords catalyst and deactivation, catalyst and life, and catalyst and regeneration, 14,712, 62,945, and 22,520 patents were found respectively.) This area of research provides a critical understanding that is the foundation for modeling deactivation processes, designing stable catalysts, and optimizing processes to prevent or slow catalyst deactivation.
The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the scientific and practical aspects of catalyst deactivation with a focus on mechanisms of catalyst decay, prevention of deactivation, and regeneration of catalysts. Case studies of deactivation and regeneration of Co Fischer-Tropsch catalysts and of commercial catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides in stationary sources have been included.
2. Mechanisms of Deactivation
There are many paths for heterogeneous catalyst decay. For example, a catalyst solid may be poisoned by any one of a dozen contaminants present in the feed. Its surface, pores, and voids may be fouled by carbon or coke produced by cracking/condensation reactions of hydrocarbon reactants,intermediates, and/or products. In the treatment of a power plant flue gas, the catalyst can be dusted or eroded by and/or plugged with fly ash. Catalytic converters used to reduce emissions from gasoline or diesel engines may be poisoned or fouled by fuel or lubricant additives and/or engine corrosion products. If the catalytic reaction is conducted at high temperatures, thermal degradation may occur in the form of active phase crystallite growth, collapse of the carrier (support) pore structure, and/or solid-state reactions of the active phase with the carrier or promoters. In addition, the presence of oxygen or chlorine in the feed gas can lead to formation of volatile oxides or chlorides of the active phase, followed by gas-phase transport from the reactor. Similarly, changes in the oxidation state of the active catalytic phase can be induced by the presence of reactive gases in the feed.
Thus, the mechanisms of solid catalyst deactivation are many; nevertheless, they can be grouped into six intrinsic mechanisms of catalyst decay: (1) poisoning, (2) fouling, (3) thermal degradation, (4) vapor compound formation and/or leaching accompanied by transport from the catalyst surface or particle, (5) vaporsolid and/or solidsolid reactions, and (6) attrition/crushing. As mechanisms 1, 4, Catalysts 2015, 5
147
and 5 are chemical in nature while 2 and 6 are mechanical, the causes of deactivation are basically threefold: chemical, mechanical, and thermal. Each of the six basic mechanisms is defined briefly in Table 1 and treated in some detail in the subsections that follow, with an emphasis on the first three.
Mechanisms 4 and 5 are treated together, since 4 is a subset of 5.

2.1. Poisoning
Poisoning [3,1622] is the strong chemisorption of reactants, products, or impurities on sites otherwise available for catalysis. Thus, poisoning has operational meaning; that is, whether a species acts as a poison depends upon its adsorption strength relative to the other species competing for catalytic sites. For example, oxygen can be a reactant in partial oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide on a silver catalyst and a poison in hydrogenation of ethylene on nickel. In addition to physically blocking of adsorption sites, adsorbed poisons may induce changes in the electronic or geometric structure of the surface [17,21]. Finally, poisoning may be reversible or irreversible. An example of reversible poisoning is the deactivation of acid sites in fluid catalytic cracking catalysts by nitrogen compounds in the feed. Although the effects can be severe, they are temporary and are generally eliminated within a few hours to days after the nitrogen source is removed from the feed. Similar effects have been observed for nitrogen compound (e.g., ammonia and cyanide) addition to the syngas of cobalt Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, although these surface species require weeks to months before the lost activity is regained [23]. However, most poisons are irreversibly chemisorbed to the catalytic surface sites, as is the case for sulfur on most metals, as discussed in detail below. Regardless of whether the poisoning is reversible or irreversible, the deactivation effects while the poison is adsorbed on the surface are the same.
Many poisons occur naturally in feed streams that are treated in catalytic processes. For example,crude oil contains sulfur and metals, such as vanadium and nickel, that act as catalyst poisons for many petroleum refinery processes, especially those that use precious metal catalysts, like catalytic reforming, and those that treat heavier hydrocarbon fractions in which the sulfur concentrates and metals are almost exclusively found, such as fluid catalytic cracking and residuum hydroprocessing.
Catalysts 2015, 5

Coal contains numerous potential poisons, again including sulfur and others like arsenic, phosphorous,and selenium, often concentrated in the ash, that can poison selective catalytic reduction catalysts as discussed later in Section 4.3.3.1. As a final example, some poisons may be added purposefully, either to moderate the activity and/or to alter the selectivity of fresh catalysts, as discussed as the end of this section, or to improve the performance of a product that is later reprocessed catalytically. An example of this latter case is lubricating oils that contain additives like zinc and phosphorous to improve their lubricating properties and stability, which become poisons when the lubricants are reprocessed in a hydrotreater or a fluid catalytic cracking unit.
Mechanisms by which a poison may affect catalytic activity are multifold, as illustrated by a conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning of ethylene hydrogenation on a metal surface shown in Figure 1. To begin with, a strongly adsorbed atom of sulfur physically blocks at least one three- or fourfold adsorption/reaction site (projecting into three dimensions) and three or four topside sites on the metal surface. Second, by virtue of its strong chemical bond, it electronically modifies its nearest neighbor metal atoms and possibly its next-nearest neighbor atoms, thereby modifying their abilities to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (in this case H2 and ethylene molecules),although these effects do not extend beyond about 5 atomic units [21]. A third effect may be the restructuring of the surface by the strongly adsorbed poison, possibly causing dramatic changes in catalytic properties, especially for reactions sensitive to surface structure. In addition, the adsorbed poison blocks access of adsorbed reactants to each other (a fourth effect) and finally prevents or slows the surface diffusion of adsorbed reactants (effect number five).

Catalyst poisons can be classified according to their chemical makeup, selectivity for active sites,and the types of reactions poisoned. Table 2 lists four groups of catalyst poisons classified according to chemical origin and their type of interaction with metals. It should be emphasized that interactions of Group VAVIIA elements with catalytic metal phases depend on the oxidation state of the former,e.g., how many electron pairs are available for bonding and the degree of shielding of the sulfur ion by ligands [16]. Thus, the order of decreasing toxicity for poisoning of a given metal by different sulfur species is H2S, SO2, SO42, i.e., in the order of increased shielding by oxygen. Toxicity also increases with increasing atomic or molecular size and electronegativity, but decreases if the poison can be gasified by O2, H2O, or H2 present in the reactant stream [21]; for example, adsorbed carbon can be gasified by O2 to CO or CO2 or by H2 to CH4.

It is apparent that organic bases (e.g., amines) and ammonia are common poisons for acidic solids, such as silicaaluminas and zeolites in cracking and hydrocracking reactions, while sulfur- and arsenic-containing compounds are typical poisons for metals in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and steam reforming reactions. Metal compounds (e.g., of Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) are poisons in automotive emissions control, catalytic cracking, and hydrotreating. Acetylene is a poison for ethylene oxidation,while asphaltenes are poisons in hydrotreating of petroleum residuum.

Selective poisoning involves preferential adsorption of the poison on the most active sites at low concentrations. If sites of lesser activity are blocked initially, the poisoning is antiselective. If the activity loss is proportional to the Catalysts 2015, 5

concentration of adsorbed poison, the poisoning is nonselective. An example of selective poisoning is the deactivation of platinum by CO for the para-H2 conversion (Figure 3a) [24] while Pb poisoning of CO oxidation on platinum is apparently antiselective (Figure 3b) [25], and arsenic poisoning of cyclopropane hydrogenation on Pt is nonselective (Figure 3c) [26]. For nonselective poisoning, the linear decrease in activity with poison concentration or susceptibility (σ) is defined by the slope of the activity versus poison concentration curve. Several other important terms associated with poisoning are defined in Table 4. Poison tolerance, the activity at saturation coverage of the poison, and resistance (the inverse of deactivation rate) are important concepts that are often encountered in discussions of poisoning including those below.

The activity versus poison concentration patterns illustrated in Figure 2 are based on the assumption of uniform poisoning of the catalyst surface and surface reaction rate controlling, i.e., negligible pore-diffusional resistance. These assumptions, however, are rarely met in typical industrial processes because the severe reaction conditions of high temperature and high pressure bring about a high pore-diffusional resistance for either the main or poisoning reaction or both. In physical terms, this means that the reaction may occur preferentially in the outer shell of the catalysts particle, or that poison is preferentially adsorbed in the outer shell of the catalyst particle, or both. The nonuniformly distributed reaction and/or poison leads to nonlinear activity versus poison concentration curves that mimic the patterns in Figure 2 but do not represent truly selective or antiselective poisoning. For example, if the main reaction is limited to an outer shell in a pellet where poison is concentrated, the drop in activity with concentration will be precipitous. Pore diffusional effects in poisoning (nonuniform poison) are treated later in this review.

As sulfur poisoning is a difficult problem in many important catalytic processes (e.g., hydrogenation,methanation, FischerTropsch synthesis, steam reforming, and fuel cell power production), it merits separate discussion as an example of catalyst poisoning phenomena. Studies of sulfur poisoning in hydrogenation and CO hydrogenation reactions have been thoroughly reviewed [8,21,2731]. Much of the previous work focused on poisoning of nickel metal catalysts by H2S, the primary sulfur poison in many important catalytic processes, and thus provides some useful case studies of poisoning.
Previous adsorption studies [2830] indicate that H2S adsorbs strongly and dissociatively on nickel metal surfaces. The high stability and low reversibility of adsorbed sulfur is illustrated by the data in Figure 4 [28], in which most of the previous equilibrium data for nickel are represented on a single plot of log (PH2S/PH2) versus reciprocal temperature. The solid line corresponds to the equilibrium data for formation of bulk Ni3S2. Based on the equation ΔG = RT ln(PH2S/PH2) = ΔH  TΔS, the slope of this line is ΔH/R, where ΔH = 75 kJ/mol and the intercept is ΔS/R. Most of the adsorption data lie between the dashed lines corresponding to ΔH = 125 and 165 kJ/mol for coverages ranging from
0.5 to 0.9, indicating that adsorbed sulfur is more stable than the bulk sulfide. Indeed, extrapolation of
high temperature data to zero coverage using a Tempkin isotherm [29] yields an enthalpy of adsorption of 250 kJ/mol; in other words, at low sulfur coverages, surface nickelsulfur bonds are a factor of 3 more stable than bulk nickelsulfur bonds. It is apparent from Figure 4 that the absolute heat of adsorption increases with decreasing coverage and that the equilibrium partial pressure of H2S increases with increasing temperature and increasing coverage. For instance, at 725 K (450 C) and θ = 0.5, the values of PH2S/PH2 range from about 108 to 109. In other words, half coverage occurs at 110 ppb H2S, a concentration range at the lower limit of our present analytical capability. At the same temperature (450 C), almost complete coverage (θ > 0.9) occurs at values of PH2S/PH2 of 107106 (0.11 ppm) or at H2S concentrations encountered in many catalytic processes after the gas has been processed to remove sulfur compounds. These data are typical of sulfur adsorption on most catalytic metals. Thus, we can expect that H2S (and other sulfur impurities) will adsorb essentially irreversibly to high coverage in most catalytic processes involving metal catalysts.
Two important keys to reaching a deeper understanding of poisoning phenomena include (1) determining surface structures of poisons adsorbed on metal surfaces and (2) understanding how surface structure and hence adsorption stoichiometry change with increasing coverage of the poison.
Studies of structures of adsorbed sulfur on single crystal metals (especially Ni) [3,28,3238] provide such information. They reveal, for example, that sulfur adsorbs on Ni(100) in an ordered p(2 × 2) overlayer, bonded to four Ni atoms at S/Nis < 0.25 and in a c(2 × 2) overlayer to two Ni atoms for S/Nis = 0.250.50 (see Figure 5; Nis denotes a surface atom of Ni); saturation coverage of sulfur on Ni(100) occurs at S/Nis = 0.5. Adsorption of sulfur on Ni(110), Ni(111), and higher index planes of Ni is more complicated; while the same p(2 × 2) structure is observed at low coverage, complex overlayers appear at higher coveragesfor example, at S/Nis > 0.3 on Ni(111) a (5 3 2)S
overlayer is formed [3234]. In more open surface structures, such as Ni(110) and Ni(210), saturation coverage occurs at S/Nis = 0.74 and 1.09 respectively; indeed, there is a trend of increasing S/Nis with decreasing planar density and increasing surface roughness for Ni, while the saturation sulfur concentration remains constant at 44 ng/cm2 Ni (see Table 5).

Reported saturation stoichiometries for sulfur adsorption on polycrystalline and supported Ni catalysts (S/Nis) vary from 0.25 to 1.3 [28]. The values of saturation coverage greater than S/Nis = 0.5 may be explained by (1) a higher fractional coverage of sites of lower coordination number, i.e., atoms located on edges or corners of rough, high-index planes (Table 5); (2) enhanced adsorption capacity at higher gas phase concentrations of H2S in line with the observed trend of increasing saturation coverage with increasing H2S concentration in Figure 4; and/or (3) reconstruction of planar surfaces to rougher planes by adsorbed sulfur at moderately high coverages and adsorption temperatures.
The first effect would be favored, and in fact is observed, for supported metals of higher dispersion [28].
The second effect may explain the typically lower observed values of S/Nis for single crystal Ni, which are measured at extremely low pressures (high vacuum) relative to the higher values of S/Nis for polycrystalline and supported Ni, typically measured at orders of magnitude higher pressure; thus, in the case of the single crystal studies, the surface is not in equilibrium with gas phase H2S/H2.
The third effect, reconstruction of nickel surfaces by adsorbed sulfur, has been reported by a number of workers [28,32,33,3638]; for example, McCarroll and co-workers [37,38] found that sulfur adsorbed at near saturation coverage on a Ni(111) face was initially in a hexagonal pattern, but upon heating above 700 K reoriented to a distorted c(2 × 2) (100) overlayer. Oudar [36] reported that sulfur adsorbed on a Ni(810) surface caused decomposition to (100) and (410) facets. During adsorption of H2S at RT, Ruan et al. [33] observed surface restructuring of Ni(111) from a p(2 × 2) at low coverage to a missing-row (5 3 2)S
terrace structure (0.4 monolayer) sparsely covered with small, irregular islands composed of sulfur adsorbed on disordered nickel; upon annealing to 460 K for 5 min, the islands ordered to the (5 3 2)S
phase and their size increased, suggesting further diffusion of Ni atoms from the terraces. The reconstruction of Ni (111) involving ejection and migration of Ni atoms was attributed to compressive surface stresses induced by sulfur adsorption; the role of compressive surface stress due to sulfur coverages exceeding 0.3 was confirmed by Grossmann et al. [32]. From these and similar studies, it is concluded that at moderately high temperatures (300600 K) and coverages greater than 0.3, restructuring by sulfur of different facets of Ni to rougher, more open,stable structures is probably a general phenomenon. Thus, reconstruction probably accounts at least in part for observed increases in saturation S coverage with decreasing Ni site density.
The nature of reconstruction of a surface by a poison may depend on its pretreatment. For example,in a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of room temperature H2S adsorption on Ni(110), Ruan and co-workers [40] found that the S/Ni structure at saturation varied with the initial state of the Catalysts 2015, 5

surface, i.e., whether clean or oxygen covered. Beginning with a clean Ni(110) surface, oxygen adsorbs dissociatively to form a (2 × 1)O overlayer at 1/2 monolayer coverage (Figure 6a); this is accompanied by a homogeneous nucleation of low-coordinated -Ni-O- rows along the [001] direction.
As the oxygen-covered surface is exposed stepwise to 3 and then 8 Langmuirs (L) of H2S, oxygen atoms are removed by reaction with hydrogen to water; the surface is first roughened, after which white islands and black troughs having a c(2 × 2) structure are formed as sulfur atoms replace oxygen atoms (Figure 6b). Upon exposure to 25 L of H2S, the c(2 × 2) islands dissolve, while low-coordinated rows (periodicity of 1) form in the [001] direction, developing into ordered regions with a periodicity of 4 in the [1  0] direction (Figure 6c). After exposure to 50 L of H2S (Figure 6d), a stable,well-ordered (4 × 1)S structure appears, a surface clearly reconstructed relative to the original Ni(110).
Moreover, the reconstructed surface in Figure 6d is very different from that observed upon direct exposure of the Ni(110) to H2S at room temperature, i.e., a c(2 × 2)S overlying the original Ni(110) (similar to Figure 5b); in other words, it appears that no reconstruction occurs by direct exposure to H2S at room temperature, rather only in the presence of O2 (or air). This emphasizes the complexities inherent in predicting the structure and stability of a given poison adsorbed on a given catalyst during a specified reaction as a function of different pretreatments or process disruptions, e.g., exposure to air.
In the previous discussion of Figure 4, ΔHads was observed to decrease with increasing sulfur coverage; data in Figure 7 [41] show that ΔHads decreases with increasing gas-phase H2S concentration and coverage. However, in contrast to the data in Figure 4, those in Figure 7 [41] show that at very high H2S concentrations and high adsorption temperatures, ΔHads falls well below the ΔHformation of bulk Ni3S2; at the same time, the S/Nis ratio approaches that of Ni2S3. This is a unique result, since all of the data obtained at lower temperatures and H2S concentrations [28] show ΔHads to be greater than ΔHformation of Ni3S2.

From the above discussion, the structure and stoichiometry of sulfur adsorbed on nickel evidently are complex functions of temperature, H2S concentration, sulfur coverage, and pretreatment,phenomena that account at least in part for the complex nature of nickel poisoning by sulfur. Could one expect similar complexities in the poisoning of other metals? Probably, since poisoning of nickel is prototypical, i.e., similar principles operate and similar poisoning behaviors are observed in other poison/metal systems, although none have been studied to the same depth as sulfur/nickel.
Since one of the necessary steps in a catalytic reaction is the adsorption of one or more reactants,investigation of the effects of adsorbed sulfur on the adsorption of other molecules, can provide useful insights into the poisoning process [21,28]. Previous investigations [28,4248] indicate that both H2 and CO adsorptions on nickel are poisoned by adsorbed sulfur. For example, thermal desorption Catalysts 2015, 5

studies of CO from presulfided Ni(100) [44] reveal a weakening of the CO adsorption bond and a rapid, nonlinear decline in the most strongly bound β2 state (bridged CO) with increasing sulfur coverage, corresponding to a poisoning of about 810 Ni atoms for bridged CO adsorption per adsorbed sulfur atom at low sulfur coverage (see Figure 8); moreover, the β2 CO species is completely poisoned at about 0.20.4 mL of sulfur relative to a saturation coverage of 0.5 mL. Hydrogen adsorption is poisoned in a similar nonlinear fashion. On the other hand, the coverage of the β1 state (linear CO) is constant with increasing sulfur coverage. The sharp nonlinear drop in CO and hydrogen adsorptions at low sulfur coverages has been interpreted in terms of a combination of short-range electronic and steric effects operating over a range of less than 5 atomic units [13]. The different effects of sulfur on β1 and β2 states of CO have important implications for sulfur poisoning in reactions involving CO; that is, sulfur poisoning can affect reaction selectivity as well as activity [28].
Because sulfur adsorbs so strongly on metals and prevents or modifies the further adsorption of reactant molecules, its presence on a catalyst surface usually effects substantial or complete loss of activity in many important reactions. This is illustrated by the data in Figure 9 showing the steady-state methanation activities of Ni, Co, Fe, and Ru relative to the fresh, unpoisoned surface activity as a function of gas phase H2S concentration. These data indicate that Ni, Co, Fe, and Ru all suffer 34 orders of magnitude loss in activity at 15100 ppb of H2S, i.e., their sulfur tolerances are extremely low. Moreover, the sharp drop in activity with increasing H2S concentration suggests highly selective poisoning. Nevertheless, the rate of sulfur poisoning and hence sulfur resistance varies from catalyst to catalyst and is apparently a function of catalyst composition [28] and reaction conditions [49]. Indeed,it is possible to significantly improve sulfur resistance of Ni, Co, and Fe with catalyst additives such as Mo and B that selectively adsorb sulfur. Because the adsorption of sulfur compounds is generally rapid and irreversible, surface sulfur concentrations in catalyst particles and beds are nonuniform, e.g., H2S adsorbs selectively at the entrance to a packed bed and on the outer surface of catalyst particles,making the experimental study and modeling of sulfur poisoning extremely difficult.
There are other complications in the study of sulfur poisoning. For example, the adsorption stoichiometry of sulfur in CO hydrogenation on Ni is apparently a function of the temperature, H2/CO ratio, and water partial pressure [49]. Moreover, at high CO partial pressures sulfur may be removed from the surface as COS, which is not as strongly adsorbed as H2S. At low temperature conditions,e.g., those representative of FischerTropsch synthesis or liquid phase hydrogenations, the gas phase concentration of H2S in poisoning studies must be kept very low, i.e., below 0.15 ppm, to avoid formation of bulk metal sulfidesa phenomenon that seriously compromises the validity of the results. Thus, the importance of studying poisoning phenomena in situ under realistic reaction conditions, at low process-relevant poison concentrations, and over a process-representative range of temperature and concentration conditions is emphasized.
As mentioned earlier, there are a number of industrial processes in which one intentionally poisons the catalyst in order to improve its selectivity. For example, Pt-containing naphtha reforming catalysts are often pre-sulfided to minimize unwanted cracking reactions. On basic Pt/KL zeolite catalysts, these short term, low concentration exposures are beneficial to produce Pt ensemble sizes that promote aromatization, while longer term or higher concentration exposures poison the catalyst both by forming Pt-S bonds and producing large crystallites that block pores, as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and favor only Catalysts 2015, 5

dehydrogenation [5053]. Other examples are sulfur added to Fischer-Tropsch catalysts that have been reported to have either beneficial or negligibly harmful effects, which are important considerations in setting the minimum gas clean-up requirements [27,30,5456]. S and P are added to Ni catalysts to improve isomerization selectivity in the fats and oils hydrogenation industry, while S and Cu are added to Ni catalysts in steam reforming to minimize coking. In catalytic reforming, sulfided Re or Sn is added to Pt to enhance the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins while poisoning hydrogenolysis/coking reactions. V2O5 is added to Pt to suppress SO2 oxidation to SO3 in diesel emissions control catalysts.

2.2. Fouling, Coking, and Carbon Deposition
2.2.1. Fouling
Fouling is the physical (mechanical) deposition of species from the fluid phase onto the catalyst surface,which results in activity loss due to blockage of sites and/or pores. In its advanced stages, it may result in disintegration of catalyst particles and plugging of the reactor voids. Important examples include mechanical deposits of carbon and coke in porous catalysts, although carbon- and coke-forming processes also involve chemisorption of different kinds of carbons or condensed hydrocarbons that may act as catalyst poisons. The definitions of carbon and coke are somewhat arbitrary and by convention related to their origin. Carbon is typically a product of CO disproportionation while coke is produced by decomposition or condensation of hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces and typically consists of polymerized heavy hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, coke forms may vary from high molecular weight hydrocarbons to primarily carbons such as graphite, depending upon the conditions under which the coke was formed and aged. A number of books and reviews treat the formation of carbons and coke on catalysts and the attendant deactivation of the catalysts [1,4,5762].
The chemical structures of cokes or carbons formed in catalytic processes vary with reaction type,catalyst type, and reaction conditions. Menon [62] suggested that catalytic reactions accompanied by carbon or coke formation can be broadly classified as either coke-sensitive or coke-insensitive,analogous to Boudarts more general classification of structure-sensitive and structure-insensitive catalytic reactions. In coke-sensitive reactions, unreactive coke is deposited on active sites, leading to activity decline, while in coke-insensitive reactions, relatively reactive coke precursors formed on active sites are readily removed by hydrogen (or other gasifying agents). Examples of coke-sensitive reactions include catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis; on the other hand, FischerTropsch synthesis,catalytic reforming, and methanol synthesis are examples of coke-insensitive reactions. On the basis of this classification, Menon [62] reasoned that the structure and location of a coke are more important than its quantity in affecting catalytic activity.
Consistent with Menons classification, it is also generally observed that not only structure and location of coke vary but also its mechanism of formation varies with catalyst type, e.g., whether it is a metal or metal oxide (or sulfide, sulfides being similar to oxides). Because of these significant differences in mechanism, formation of carbon and coke is discussed below separately for supported metals and for metal oxides and sulfides.
2.2.2. Carbon and Coke Formation on Supported Metal Catalysts
Possible effects of fouling by carbon (or coke) on the functioning of a supported metal catalyst are illustrated in Figure 10. Carbon may (1) chemisorb strongly as a monolayer or physically adsorb in multilayers and in either case block access of reactants to metal surface sites, (2) totally encapsulate a metal particle and thereby completely deactivate that particle, and (3) plug micro- and mesopores such that access of reactants is denied to many crystallites inside these pores. Finally, in extreme cases,strong carbon filaments may build up in pores to the extent that they stress and fracture the support material, ultimately causing the disintegration of catalyst pellets and plugging of reactor voids. For example, in steam methane reforming (SMR) catalysts, which are typically nickel supported on alumina Catalysts 2015, 5

with alkaline earth oxides, the carbon can diffuse through and begin to grow filaments from the back side of the nickel particles (structural type 3 in Table 6) especially at high reaction temperatures and low steam to methane ratios, which push the nickel particles off the support surface. Thermal or mechanical shock can then cause the carbon filaments to fall off the support, thus permanently deactivating the catalyst [8,60]. However, the behavior is complex because for other reaction conditions and other metals, the filaments may grow from the top surface of the metal particles or the carbon may diffuse into the metal and form bulk carbides [8].
An example of recent interest for biomass reactions that points to the complex interaction between the active metal and the support during carbon deposition is the steam reforming of light alcohols and other oxygenates, in which deactivation occurs primarily through coking. For traditional SMR catalysts (e.g., Ni/MgAl2O4) the coke is believed to originate primarily from alkene formation [63,64].
However, for the case of Ni/La2O3 catalysts, carbon appears to form at the interface between the active metal and the support to block the active phase [65].
Mechanisms of carbon deposition and coke formation on metal catalysts from carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, including methane during SMR for hydrogen production [4,5761], are illustrated in Figures 11 and 12. Different kinds of carbon and coke that vary in morphology and reactivity are formed in these reactions (see Tables 6 and 7). For example, CO dissociates on metals to form Cα, an adsorbed atomic carbon; Cα can react to Cβ, a polymeric carbon film. The more reactive, amorphous forms of carbon formed at low temperatures (e.g., Cα and Cβ) are converted at high temperatures over a period of time to less reactive, graphitic forms [60]

[60].
It should also be emphasized that some forms of carbon result in loss of catalytic activity and some do not. For example, at low reaction temperatures (<300375 C) condensed polymer or β-carbon films and at high temperatures (>650 C) graphitic carbon films encapsulate the metal surfaces of methanation and steam reforming catalysts [60]. Deactivation of steam reforming catalysts at high reaction temperatures (500900 C) may be caused by precipitation of atomic (carbidic) carbon dissolved in the Ni surface layers to a depth of more than 5070 nm [62,66]. If it accumulates on the metal surface (at high or low temperatures), adsorbed atomic carbon can deactivate metal sites for adsorption and/or reaction. For example, Durer and co-workers [67] demonstrated that carbon atoms residing in the fourfold hollow sites of Rh(100) block the adsorption of hydrogen (and hence could block sites for hydrogenation). In the intermediate temperature range of 375650 C, carbon filaments (Figure 13) are formed by precipitation of dissolved carbon at the rear side of metal crystallites,causing the metal particles to grow away from the support [57]. Filament growth ceases when sufficient carbon accumulates on the free surface to cause encapsulation by a carbon layer; however,encapsulation of the metal particles does not occur if H2/CO or H2O/hydrocarbon ratios are sufficiently high. Thus, carbon filaments sometimes formed in CO hydrogenation or steam reforming of hydrocarbons would not necessarily cause a loss of intrinsic catalyst activity unless they are formed in sufficient quantities to cause plugging of the pores [60] or loss of metal occurs as the carbon fibers are removed during regeneration [68,69]. However, in practice, regions of carbon forming potential in steam reforming must be carefully avoided, since once initiated, the rates of filamentous carbon formation are sufficiently high to cause catastrophic pore plugging and catalyst failure within a few hours to days.Catalysts 2015, 5

The rate at which deactivation occurs for a given catalyst and reaction depends greatly on reaction conditionsespecially temperature and reactant composition. A fundamental principle for coke-insensitive reactions on metals (e.g., methanation, FischerTropsch synthesis, steam reforming, catalytic reforming, and methanol synthesis) is that deactivation rate depends greatly on the difference in rates of formation and gasification of carbon/coke precursors, i.e., rd = rf  rg. If the rate of gasification, rg, is equal to or greater than that of formation, rf, carbon/coke is not deposited. Rates of carbon/coke precursor formation and gasification both increase exponentially with temperature, although the difference between them varies a great deal with temperature because of differences in preexponential factors and activation energies. Thus, carbon/coke formation is avoided in regions of temperature in which precursor gasification rate exceeds deposition rate. This is illustrated in Figure 14, an Arrhenius plot for rates of formation and hydrogenation of alpha and beta carbons on nickel during CO methanation. Since at temperatures below 600 K (1/T > 1.66 × 103 K1) the rate of Cα gasification exceeds that of Cα formation, no carbon is deposited. However above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface since the rate of Cα formation exceeds that of Cα gasification. As Cα accumulates (at 600700 K), it is converted to a Cβ polymeric chain or film that deactivates the nickel catalyst; however, above 700 K (1/T < 1.43 × 103 K1), the rate of Cβ hydrogenation exceeds that of formation and no deactivation occurs. Thus, the safe regions of methanation for avoiding deactivation by carbon are below 600 K and above 700 K; of course, these regions will vary somewhat with reactant concentrations and catalyst activity. A similar principle operates in steam reforming, i.e., at a sufficiently low reaction temperature,the rate of hydrocarbon adsorption exceeds the rate of hydrocracking and a deactivating polymer film is formed [70]; accordingly, it is necessary to operate above this temperature to avoid deactivation.Catalysts 2015, 5

In steam reforming, filamentous carbon formation rate is a strong function of reactant hydrocarbon structure; for example, it decreases in the order acetylenes, olefins, paraffins, i.e., in order of decreasing reactivity, although activation energies for nickel are in the same range (125139 kJ) independent of hydrocarbon structure and about the same as those observed for formation of filamentous carbon from decomposition of CO [60]. This latter observation suggests that the reactions of CO and different hydrocarbons to filamentous carbon proceed by a common mechanism and rate-determining stepprobably the diffusion of carbon through the metal crystallites [60].
The rate at which a carbon or coke is accumulated in a given reaction under given conditions can vary significantly with catalyst structure, including metal type, metal crystallite size, promoter, and catalyst support. For example, supported Co, Fe, and Ni are active above 350400 C for filamentous carbon formation from CO and hydrocarbons; the order of decreasing activity is reportedly Fe > Co > Ni [60]. Pt, Ru, and Rh catalysts, on the other hand, while equally or more active than Ni, Co, or Fe in steam reforming, produce little or no coke or carbon. This is attributed to reduced mobility and/or solubility of carbon in the noble metals, thus retarding the nucleation process. Thus, it is not surprising that addition of noble metals to base metals retards carbon formation; for example, addition of Pt in Ni lowers carbon deposition rate during methanation, while addition of Cu or Au to Ni substantially lowers carbon formation in steam reforming [60,71]. In contrast to the moderating effects of noble metal additives, addition of 0.5% Sn to cobalt substantially increases the rate of carbon filament formation from ethylene [72], an effect desirable in the commercial production of carbon filament fibers.
Since carbon formation and gasification rates are influenced differently by modifications in metal crystallite surface chemistry, which are in turn a function of catalyst structure, oxide additives or oxide supports may be used to moderate the rate of undesirable carbon or coke accumulation. For example, Bartholomew and Strasburg [73] found the specific rate (turnover frequency) of filamentous carbon deposition on nickel during methanation at 350 C to decrease in the order Ni/TiO2 > NiAl2O3 > Ni/SiO2, while Vance and Bartholomew [74] observed Cα hydrogenation rates at 170 C to decrease in this same order (the same as for methanation at 225 C). This behavior was explained in terms of promotional or inhibiting effects due to decoration of metal crystallites by the support, for example Catalysts 2015, 5
165
silica, inhibiting both CO dissociation and carbon hydrogenation. This hypothesis is consistent with observations [75,76] that silica evaporated on metal surfaces and supported metals inhibits formation of filamentous carbon. Similarly Bitter and co-workers [77] observed rates of carbon formation in CO2/CH4 reforming to decrease in the order Pt/γ-Al2O3Pt/TiO2 > Pt/ZrO2; while 90% of the carbon deposited on the support, the authors linked deactivation to carbon accumulated on the metal owing to an imbalance between carbon formed by methane dissociation and oxidation by chemisorbed CO2. The rate of formation of coke in steam reforming is delayed and occurs at lower rates in nickel catalysts promoted with alkali or supported on basic MgO [78].
Since formation of coke, graphite, or filamentous carbon involves the formation of C-C bonds on multiple atoms sites, one might expect that coke or carbon formation on metals is structure-sensitive, i.e.,sensitive to surface structure and metal crystallite size. Indeed, Bitter and co-workers [77] found that catalysts containing larger Pt crystallites deactivate more rapidly than those containing small crystallites.
Moreover, a crystallite size effect, observed in steam reforming of methane on nickel [60,78], appears to operate in the same direction, i.e., formation of filamentous carbon occurs at lower rates in catalysts containing smaller metal crystallites.
In summary, deactivation of supported metals by carbon or coke may occur chemically, owing to chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically and mechanically, owing to blocking of surface sites, metal crystallite encapsulation, plugging of pores, and destruction of catalyst pellets by carbon filaments. Blocking of catalytic sites by chemisorbed hydrocarbons, surface carbides, or relatively reactive films is generally reversible in hydrogen, steam, CO2, or oxygen. Further details of the thermodynamics,kinetics, and mechanisms of carbon and coke formation in methanation and steam reforming reactions are available in reviews by Bartholomew [60] and Rostrup-Nielsen [70,78]. In recent reviews addressing deactivation of Co catalysts by carbon during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [79,80], the same or similar carbon species, e.g., α, β, polymeric, and graphitic carbons, are observed on Co surfaces as on Ni;moreover, poisoning or fouling of the Co surfaces with β, polymeric, and graphitic carbon layers are found to be major causes of deactivation.
2.2.3. Coke Formation on Metal Oxide and Sulfide Catalysts
In reactions involving hydrocarbons, coke may be formed in the gas phase and on both noncatalytic and catalytic surfaces. Nevertheless, formation of coke on oxides and sulfides is principally a result of cracking reactions involving coke precursors (typically olefins or aromatics) catalyzed by acid sites [81,82].
Dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions of carbocation intermediates formed on acid sites lead to aromatics, which react further to higher molecular weight polynuclear aromatics that condense as coke (see Figure 15). Reactions 13 in Figure 15 illustrate the polymerization of olefins, reactions 48 illustrate cyclization from olefins, and reactions 914 illustrate chain reaction formation of polynuclear aromatics that condense as coke on the catalyst surface. Because of the high stability of the polynuclear carbocations (formed in reactions 1013), they can continue to grow on the surface for a relatively long time before a termination reaction occurs through the back donation of a proton.
From this mechanistic scheme (Figure 15), it is clear that olefins, benzene and benzene derivatives,and polynuclear aromatics are precursors to coke formation. However, the order of reactivity for coke formation is clearly structure dependent, i.e., decreases in the order polynuclear aromatics > aromatics Catalysts 2015, 5

> olefins > branched alkanes > normal alkanes. For example, the weight percent coke formed on silicaalumina at 500 C is 0.06, 3.8, 12.5, and 23% for benzene, naphthalene, fluoranthene, and anthracene respectively [83].
Coking reactions in processes involving heavy hydrocarbons are very complex; different kinds of coke may be formed and they may range in composition from CH to C and have a wide range of reactivities with oxygen and hydrogen, depending upon the time on stream and temperature to which they are exposed. For example, coke deposits occurring in hydrodesulfurization of residuum have been classified into three types [84]:(1) Type I deposits are reversibly adsorbed normal aromatics deposited during the first part of the cycle at low temperature.
(2) Type II deposits are reversibly adsorbed asphaltenes deposited early in the coking process.
(3) Type III deposits result from condensation of aromatic concentrates into clusters and then crystals that constitute a mesophase. This crystalline phase is formed after long reaction times at high temperature. This hardened coke causes severe deactivation of the catalyst [84].
