3. Suppression and Elimination of Coke Deposition
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
3.1. The Effect of Cofeed
3.1.1. Cofeed of Hydrogen
Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke. (43) The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction. (62) The similar observation is obtained on several Pt surfaces, such as Pt(111) and Pt(100). (48) Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen. (22) In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support. Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. (49) This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature.
Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity. (24,57,63,64) The addition of H2O decreases the apparent activation energy of propane conversion, but also decreases the selectivity of propylene, as shown in Figure 4b. However, the DFT calculation showed that the energy barrier of elementary reactions in PDH are increasing slightly when H2O existed. (63) Therefore, the effect of steam in improving activity could be ascribed to the low coking rate, which leads to a high percentage of free active sites. (63) In particular, the amount of coke decreases significantly on PtSn/CeO2 (decreasing by 82%) and PtSn/Al2O3 (decreasing by 90%) under moisture. (24)
3.2. The Modification of Active Component
3.2.1. Effect of Structure and Size
The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst. For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance. The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. (28,30) The larger surface area of the smaller Pt particles is responsible for the higher coking rate, as shown in Figure 5a. (28) Furthermore, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation. (65) Besides, the energy barrier of CH bond breaking is lower than the energy barrier of propylene desorption at undercoordinated sites, which is leading to the occurrence of deep reaction. (66) Therefore, the geometry and size of Pt has an apparent importance for coke formation. Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH. (28,67)
3.2.2. Effect of Promoter
As mentioned in section 2.1, adding promoter is one of the most effective methods to modify the nature of Pt catalyst. Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports. (40,46,65,6871) The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1. Moreover, the coke precursor adsorbed weakly on PtSn, which enables the easy transfer from metal to support. (72) By this method, the active components are kept intact, which delivers good activity and stability. (45) The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively. The infrared spectroscopy indicated that the Sn blocked the undercoordinated sites and constrained Pt particles into smaller ensembles. (73) Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H2-chemisorption analysis shows that addition of Sn led to higher dispersion of Pt. (45) Hence, the Sn promoter significantly changed the geometry of Pt catalysts. Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed. The X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra showed that the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, indicating Sn withdraws electrons from Pt. (74) Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the oxidized Sn is formed in PtSn/Mg-SBA-15 catalyst. (75) Table 1.

Furthermore, both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations. Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction. The energy barrier and coverage could change the reaction rate as suggested by the rate law. For example, Nyknen and Honkala study the adsorption of propane and propylene on three different PtSn alloy surfaces, Pt3Sn(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111), and PtSn2(111). (76) The results show that the increasing Sn concentrations downshifted the d-band center, which leads to decreasing activity. Bader charge analysis showed that charge transfers from Sn to Pt atoms. Both appear to weaken the adsorption of propylene. In addition, the energy barriers of elementary reactions on the PtSn alloyed surface were investigated by Yang et al. (31) Their results showed that the addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity. It is suggested that the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is the best candidate. Later, the calculations based on Pt3Sn(211) indicate that high selectivity and low coking amount on the PtSn catalyst can be originated from the absence of active Pt step sites. (77) It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading. (78) Besides Sn, other non-noble metals such as Cu, Al, and In have also been studied as promoters. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu. It is suggested that the effects of Cu are similar to Sn. The favorable performance is attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu (entry 4, Table 1). (25) Besides, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy shows a high stability in PDH. The catalyst exhibited a large difference between the energy barrier of desorption and deep dehydrogenation, which is helpful to prevent coke formation and leads to the high selectivity and stability (entry 5, Table 1). (33) Moreover, the addition of In could reduce the acidity strength of the catalyst and form PtIn alloy. The In-modified Pt catalyst shows a lower activity than the counterpart of Sn promoter, but with a better stability (entry 6, Table 1). (80,81) The introduction of Ga forms PtGa alloy on the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst. PtGa alloy decreases the size of Pt ensembles and blocks the defective sites, leading to the higher selectivity (entries 79, Table 1). On the other hand, Ga could also incorporate into CeO2 and enhance the surface oxygen mobility and capacity which is beneficial for stability (entries 1314, Table 1). (79) Both of them reduce the amount of coke as shown in Figure 5b. In our previous work, the Pt cluster which is bonded with inactive spices is helpful to increase stability. (34) Furthermore, the Pt ensembles with connected free sites lower than 3 are unfavorable for deep dehydrogenation. Hence, it seems that the monatomic Pt wire or Pt single atom surrounded by inactive metal is a good candidate for a PDH catalyst. (26,82)
3.2.3. Third Element Based on Sn Promoter
Further elements are introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on PtSn. The performances of a series of PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts show that the higher Al concentration leads to higher coke formation rate. (83) The addition of Al introduces more acid centers, which accelerates the formation of coke. It is determined that the optimal composition is PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15 (entry 10, Table 1). In contrast, the K addition is deemed to block the acid sites and leads to higher selectivity for PtSn/Al2O3. (84) Additionally, the best performance is observed on 0.49 wt % of K loading. By a similar rationale, the addition of Ca and Na also reduces the coke contents significantly as shown in entries 1112 of Table 1. (85,86) However, the excess of these promoters might result in performance degradation. (8486)
3.3. The Modification of Support
3.3.1. Doping of Support
The active components are anchored and dispersed by the support. The interactions between the catalyst and the support often have a direct influence on the activity, such as PDH. (23,44,79) The conventional support of a commercial Pt catalyst in PDH is Al2O3, which is acidic and is inclined to coke deposition. Therefore, the modification of supports is necessary to improve the anticoke ability of the catalyst. Vu et al. found that PtSn/ZnAl2O4 shows higher tolerance for deactivation than PtSn/Al2O3 on PDH due to the different coke mobility from metal to support (entry 15, Table 1). (87) The origin of the mobility of coke is caused by the contents of PtSn and Pt3Sn induced by different support during the reaction. Only PtSn alloy is formed on PtSn/ZnAl2O4 while the PtSn and Pt3Sn are both appeared on PtSn/Al2O3. The higher Sn brings the weaker adsorption of hydrocarbon which consequently increases the mobility of coke. The PtSn/CeAl2O3 catalyst shows a better performance on coking suppression and stability than PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. It is concluded that the synergistic effects between Ce and Sn are working to prevent coking and Ce alone does not bring too much difference. (88) The Ga modification of Mg(Al)O support yields better performance for supported Pt and PtSn catalysts (entries 1617, Table 1). The better performance is ascribed to the formation of PtGa alloy. Moreover, it is hypothesized that Ga could also influence the catalytic performance of Pt at surface in a similar way as Sn, which reduces the amount of coke as shown in Figure 5c. (44) The experiments on the TiO2Al2O3 supported Pt catalyst show that the addition of TiO2 not only increases the electron density of Pt but also introduces the acid centers on the support. The former is helpful for selectivity and coke diffusion from the metal to the support, and the latter facilitates coking accumulation on the support. (89) With the optimal content of TiO2 (10 wt %), the catalyst would have a better performance by transferring coke from the active component to the support and leaving the active component free (entry 18, Table 1).
The metal oxide support usually presents certain acidity; for example, Lewis acid sites formed on the defective AIII site in Al2O3, (90) and Brnsted acid sites could be provided by the additional proton. (83) The both acid sites are active for CH bond activation; however, the Lewis acid site is assumed to be more active for dehydrogenation, and the Brnsted acid site is for cracking. (9092) The acidic strength is usually tested by NH3-TPD experiments, the desorption peaks in the regions of 120200 C, 200350 C, and 350450 C correspond to the weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively. (89) The formation of coke on oxides could be attributed to coke precursors formed by the cracking reaction. (93) The more acid sites and stronger acidity will lead to a significant amount of coke deposition. (72,89,94,95)
