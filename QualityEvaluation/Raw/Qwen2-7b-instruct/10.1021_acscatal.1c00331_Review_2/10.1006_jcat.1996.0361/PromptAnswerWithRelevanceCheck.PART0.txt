[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."
[3] "The latter does not agree with the results of Biswas et al. (38)."
[4] "By treatment with hydrogen at 773 K they succeeded in removing a considerable part of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by cyclohexane conversion at 753 K."
[5] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precurors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38)."
[6] "This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the catalytic activity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hydrogen is highly effective in preserving catalyst activity and inhibiting coke formation. 
2. Unfortunately, hydrogen cannot eliminate coke once it has been formed.
3. Contrary to the findings of Biswas et al., hydrogen cannot effectively remove coke that has already been deposited on the catalyst surface.
4. Biswas et al. managed to remove a significant portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by treating it with hydrogen at 773 K after cyclohexane conversion at 753 K.
5. During the reaction, hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke precursors, allowing reversible coke, as described by Biswas et al., to be eliminated through hydrogenation.
6. This elucidates how hydrogen supports the maintenance of catalyst activity.

The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects the formation of coke and catalyst stability. Hydrogen efficiently maintains the catalyst's activity and prevents coke formation. However, hydrogen cannot remove any coke that has already accumulated on the catalyst, which contrasts with the findings of Biswas et al. (38).

[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects the formation of coke, the stability of the catalyst, and the reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen is highly effective in preserving the catalyst's activity and inhibiting coke formation. However, it is unable to eliminate previously formed coke once the reaction has ceased. This suggests that hydrogen plays a crucial role in preventing the buildup of coke precursors, thereby maintaining the catalyst's performance, but it does not possess the capability to remove established coke deposits from the catalyst surface.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢的存在对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了重大影响。氢气能够非常有效地保持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭生成。然而，在反应结束后，它无法清除已形成的焦炭。这表明氢气在阻止生成焦炭前体方面起着关键作用，并维持催化剂性能，但它不具备从催化剂表面去除已形成的焦炭沉积的能力。

The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects coke formation and catalyst stability. Hydrogen is highly effective in preventing coke formation, thereby maintaining the catalyst's activity. However, hydrogen cannot remove existing coke deposits on the catalyst surface after the reaction has ceased. This contrasts with the findings of Biswas et al. (38), who managed to remove a substantial portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst through hydrogen treatment at 773 K. The coke that forms in the current study might be more deeply dehydrogenated and strongly bonded to the catalyst due to the higher temperature and prolonged exposure during the coking process. The hydrogen treatment method employed by Biswas et al. is capable of removing the coke that is considered reversible, hence explaining why hydrogen helps preserve the catalytic activity by inhibiting the formation of coke precursors, yet it is unable to eliminate the already formed coke on the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性产生了显著影响。氢能够非常有效地防止焦炭形成，从而维持催化剂的活性。然而，在反应结束后，氢不能去除附着在催化剂表面的焦炭沉积物。这与Biswas等人（38）的研究结果不一致，他们通过在773 K下对用环己烷转化形成的Pt/Al2O3催化剂进行氢处理，成功地去除了大部分焦炭。当前研究中形成的焦炭可能由于较高的温度和长时间的接触而被更深入地脱氢，并且与催化剂的结合力更强。Biswas等人所采用的氢处理方法能够去除被认为是可逆的焦炭，因此解释了为什么氢能够通过抑制焦炭前体的形成来帮助保持催化活性，但无法消除已形成的焦炭在催化剂上的沉积。

Hydrogen plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst activity and preventing coke formation during the propane dehydrogenation process. It effectively inhibits the formation of coke precursors, thereby preserving the catalytic efficiency. However, hydrogen is unable to remove existing coke deposits from the catalyst surface. This is in contrast to the findings by Biswas et al., who managed to remove a substantial portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst using hydrogen treatment at 773 K. The coke produced in the experiments documented here is likely more deeply dehydrogenated and strongly attached to the catalyst due to the higher operating temperatures and longer exposure times during the coking phase. Consequently, hydrogen cannot significantly dislodge this type of coke that has already formed on the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中对于维持催化剂活性和抑制结焦形成发挥着关键作用。它能够有效地抑制结焦前体的生成，从而保持催化效率。然而，氢无法从催化剂表面去除已经形成的结焦沉积物。这与Biswas等人的研究结果不同，他们成功地通过在773 K下对通过环己烷转换在753 K下形成的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的结焦进行氢处理来去除大量结焦。这里实验中产生的结焦由于更高的操作温度和更长的烧结时间，可能被更深程度的脱氢化并牢固地附着在催化剂上。因此，氢不能显著去除已形成的结焦，这些结焦已经沉积在催化剂表面上。
