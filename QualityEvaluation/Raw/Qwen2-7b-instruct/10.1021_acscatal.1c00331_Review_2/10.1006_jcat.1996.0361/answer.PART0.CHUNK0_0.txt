[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."
[3] "The latter does not agree with the results of Biswas et al. (38)."
[4] "By treatment with hydrogen at 773 K they succeeded in removing a considerable part of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by cyclohexane conversion at 753 K."
[5] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precurors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38)."
[6] "This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the catalytic activity."

1. Hydrogen is highly effective in preserving catalyst activity and inhibiting coke formation. 
2. Unfortunately, hydrogen cannot eliminate coke once it has been formed.
3. Contrary to the findings of Biswas et al., hydrogen cannot effectively remove coke that has already been deposited on the catalyst surface.
4. Biswas et al. managed to remove a significant portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by treating it with hydrogen at 773 K after cyclohexane conversion at 753 K.
5. During the reaction, hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke precursors, allowing reversible coke, as described by Biswas et al., to be eliminated through hydrogenation.
6. This elucidates how hydrogen supports the maintenance of catalyst activity.

1. 氢气在保持催化剂活性和抑制焦炭形成方面非常有效。
2. 然而，氢气无法去除反应停止后形成的焦炭。
3. 与Biswas等人的发现不同，氢气无法有效地去除已经沉积在催化剂表面的焦炭。
4. Biswas等人通过将Pt/Al2O3催化剂在773 K下用氢气处理，成功地在753 K下由环己烷转化产生的大量焦炭被去除。
5. 在反应过程中，氢气抑制了焦炭前体的形成，允许Biswas等人描述的可逆焦炭通过氢化作用去除。
6. 这解释了氢气如何维持催化剂活性的原因。
