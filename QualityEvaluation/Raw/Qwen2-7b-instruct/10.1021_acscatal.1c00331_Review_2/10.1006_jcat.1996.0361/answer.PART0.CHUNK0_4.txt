[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped. The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."
[3] "By treatment with hydrogen at 773 K they succeeded in removing a considerable part of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by cyclohexane conversion at 753 K. The coke formed in the experiments presented in this study has, because of a higher temperature and longer time on stream during the coking, probably been more deeply dehydrogenated and strongly bound to the catalyst."

Hydrogen plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst activity and preventing coke formation during the propane dehydrogenation process. It effectively inhibits the formation of coke precursors, thereby preserving the catalytic efficiency. However, hydrogen is unable to remove existing coke deposits from the catalyst surface. This is in contrast to the findings by Biswas et al., who managed to remove a substantial portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst using hydrogen treatment at 773 K. The coke produced in the experiments documented here is likely more deeply dehydrogenated and strongly attached to the catalyst due to the higher operating temperatures and longer exposure times during the coking phase. Consequently, hydrogen cannot significantly dislodge this type of coke that has already formed on the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中对于维持催化剂活性和抑制结焦形成发挥着关键作用。它能够有效地抑制结焦前体的生成，从而保持催化效率。然而，氢无法从催化剂表面去除已经形成的结焦沉积物。这与Biswas等人的研究结果不同，他们成功地通过在773 K下对通过环己烷转换在753 K下形成的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的结焦进行氢处理来去除大量结焦。这里实验中产生的结焦由于更高的操作温度和更长的烧结时间，可能被更深程度的脱氢化并牢固地附着在催化剂上。因此，氢不能显著去除已形成的结焦，这些结焦已经沉积在催化剂表面上。
