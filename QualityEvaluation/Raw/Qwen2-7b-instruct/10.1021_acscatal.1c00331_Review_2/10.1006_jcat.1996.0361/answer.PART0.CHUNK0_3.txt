[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped."
[3] "The latter does not agree with the results of Biswas et al. (38)."
[4] "By treatment with hydrogen at 773 K they succeeded in removing a considerable part of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by cyclohexane conversion at 753 K."

The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects coke formation and catalyst stability. Hydrogen is highly effective in preventing coke formation, thereby maintaining the catalyst's activity. However, hydrogen cannot remove existing coke deposits on the catalyst surface after the reaction has ceased. This contrasts with the findings of Biswas et al. (38), who managed to remove a substantial portion of the coke formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst through hydrogen treatment at 773 K. The coke that forms in the current study might be more deeply dehydrogenated and strongly bonded to the catalyst due to the higher temperature and prolonged exposure during the coking process. The hydrogen treatment method employed by Biswas et al. is capable of removing the coke that is considered reversible, hence explaining why hydrogen helps preserve the catalytic activity by inhibiting the formation of coke precursors, yet it is unable to eliminate the already formed coke on the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢过程中对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性产生了显著影响。氢能够非常有效地防止焦炭形成，从而维持催化剂的活性。然而，在反应结束后，氢不能去除附着在催化剂表面的焦炭沉积物。这与Biswas等人（38）的研究结果不一致，他们通过在773 K下对用环己烷转化形成的Pt/Al2O3催化剂进行氢处理，成功地去除了大部分焦炭。当前研究中形成的焦炭可能由于较高的温度和长时间的接触而被更深入地脱氢，并且与催化剂的结合力更强。Biswas等人所采用的氢处理方法能够去除被认为是可逆的焦炭，因此解释了为什么氢能够通过抑制焦炭前体的形成来帮助保持催化活性，但无法消除已形成的焦炭在催化剂上的沉积。
