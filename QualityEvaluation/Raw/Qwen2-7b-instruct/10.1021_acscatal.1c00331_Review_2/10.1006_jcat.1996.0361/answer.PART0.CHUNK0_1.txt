[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."
[3] "The latter does not agree with the results of Biswas et al. (38)."

The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects the formation of coke and catalyst stability. Hydrogen efficiently maintains the catalyst's activity and prevents coke formation. However, hydrogen cannot remove any coke that has already accumulated on the catalyst, which contrasts with the findings of Biswas et al. (38).

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢的存在显著影响焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性。氢可以高效地维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭生成。然而，氢无法去除已经积聚在催化剂上的焦炭，这与Biswas等人的研究结果不同。
