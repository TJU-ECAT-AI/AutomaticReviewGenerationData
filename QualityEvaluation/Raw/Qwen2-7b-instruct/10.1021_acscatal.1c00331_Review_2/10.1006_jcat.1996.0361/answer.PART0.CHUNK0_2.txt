[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[2] "On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped."
[3] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

The presence of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly affects the formation of coke, the stability of the catalyst, and the reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen is highly effective in preserving the catalyst's activity and inhibiting coke formation. However, it is unable to eliminate previously formed coke once the reaction has ceased. This suggests that hydrogen plays a crucial role in preventing the buildup of coke precursors, thereby maintaining the catalyst's performance, but it does not possess the capability to remove established coke deposits from the catalyst surface.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢的存在对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了重大影响。氢气能够非常有效地保持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭生成。然而，在反应结束后，它无法清除已形成的焦炭。这表明氢气在阻止生成焦炭前体方面起着关键作用，并维持催化剂性能，但它不具备从催化剂表面去除已形成的焦炭沉积的能力。
