The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Increasing the In/Pt ratio up to 0.48 leads to a significant decrease in carbon accumulation, improving catalyst stability. This optimal ratio enhances ethene and propene selectivity, reducing methane and ethane production. The coke is mainly accumulated on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, while a portion of it also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. These effects improve the overall process efficiency and performance by maintaining high activity and selectivity while minimizing carbon deposition.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢共喂料影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。将In/Pt比提高到0.48，碳积累显著减少，提高了催化剂稳定性。这一最佳比例增强了乙烯和丙烯的选择性，减少了甲烷和丙烷的生成。在乙烷脱氢过程中，焦炭主要沉积在载体上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，一部分焦炭也沉积在PtIn纳米颗粒上。这些效果通过保持高活性和选择性同时减少碳沉积来改善整体过程效率和性能。
