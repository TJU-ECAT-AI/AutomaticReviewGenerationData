[1] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48."
[2] "The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."
[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation."
[4] "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support,whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

1. The optimal bulk In/Pt ratio for achieving maximum activity in ethane and propane dehydrogenation is 0.48, which corresponds to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. This results in nearly 100% selectivity for ethene and propene production.
2. The accumulation of carbon decreases significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, indicating that the alloying of In with Pt plays a crucial role in reducing carbon deposition.
3. During both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, small domains of graphitic carbon are formed, but their accumulation locations differ depending on the alkane being dehydrogenated.
4. Carbon accumulates primarily on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, whereas a portion of it also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation.

1. 最大活性的最优In/Pt比例为0.48，对应的PtIn合金含In量为12%，这能实现乙烯和丙烯接近100%的选择性。
2. 当In/Pt比例从0增加到0.48时，碳沉积显著减少，表明In与Pt的合金化在减少碳沉积中起着关键作用。
3. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中，形成了小尺寸的石墨碳域，但它们的积累位置取决于被脱氢的烷烃。
4. 在乙烷脱氢过程中，碳主要积累在支撑上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，一部分碳也积累在PtIn纳米颗粒上。
