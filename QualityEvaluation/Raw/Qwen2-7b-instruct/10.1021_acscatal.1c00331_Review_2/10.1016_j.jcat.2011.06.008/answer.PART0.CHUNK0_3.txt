1. For ethane dehydrogenation, the rate of C2H4 production per gram of catalyst increases with In/Pt ratio up to 0.48, then sharply decreases as the In/Pt ratio increases further.
2. The selectivities to ethene and propene reach nearly 100% when the bulk In/Pt ratio is 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy containing 12% In.
3. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is mainly accumulated on the support, while during propane dehydrogenation, a portion of carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles.

1. 对于乙烷脱氢，催化剂每克的C2H4生成速率随In/Pt比例增加至0.48时增加，然后随着In/Pt比例进一步增加而急剧下降。
2. 当In/Pt比例为0.48时，乙烯和丙烯的选择性接近100%，形成含12% In的PtIn合金。
3. 在乙烷脱氢过程中，碳主要积累在支撑体上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，部分碳也积累在PtIn纳米颗粒上。
