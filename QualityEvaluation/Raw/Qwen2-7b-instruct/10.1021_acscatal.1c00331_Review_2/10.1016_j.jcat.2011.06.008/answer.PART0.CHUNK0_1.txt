[1] "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support,whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."
[2] "The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."
[3] "Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon."
[4] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The location of coke accumulation varies between ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with carbon primarily accumulating on the support during ethane dehydrogenation and a portion also accumulating on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. As the bulk In/Pt ratio increases, the accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly from 0 to 0.48, and the rate slows for higher In/Pt ratios. Catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon, as the size of the PtIn nanoparticles remains unaffected by catalyst use. Small domains of graphitic carbon form during both processes, with the accumulation location depending on the alkane composition. These effects impact overall process efficiency and performance by altering reaction kinetics, catalyst stability, and product selectivity.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，考虑到它对能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，以及这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的含义？

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共喂养通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。焦炭积累的位置在乙烷和丙烷脱氢之间有所不同，在乙烷脱氢中主要积累在支撑上，在丙烷脱氢中一部分也积累在PtIn纳米颗粒上。随着In/Pt比例的增加，从0到0.48碳的积累显著减少，对于更高的In/Pt比率，速度变慢。催化剂失活归因于碳积累，因为PtIn纳米颗粒的大小不受催化剂使用的影响。在催化剂使用过程中，小尺寸的石墨碳域形成，其积累位置取决于所使用的烷烃的组成。这些效果通过改变反应动力学、催化剂稳定性以及产物选择性来影响整体过程效率和性能。
