[1] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
[2] "The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation."
[4] "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reactions, facilitating the conversion of propane to propene. It also helps in controlling coke formation by providing hydrogen to compete with alkyl radicals, preventing their aggregation and thus minimizing coke formation. The hydrogen can also convert acid sites on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for coke formation, into less reactive sites. Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the graphitization process of the coke deposits, affecting their size and distribution. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance include improved catalyst stability, higher propene selectivity, and reduced coke accumulation, leading to enhanced productivity and longer catalyst life.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，考虑其对能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，并探讨这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义？

氢共喂养在PDH过程中通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢共喂养可以降低脱氢反应的能量壁垒，促进丙烷转化为丙烯。它还可以通过提供氢气与烷基自由基竞争，防止它们聚合并减少焦炭形成，从而控制焦炭形成。氢气还可以将催化剂表面负责焦炭形成的酸性位点转化为活性较低的位点。此外，氢共喂养还可以影响焦炭沉积的石墨化过程，影响其大小和分布。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义包括提高催化剂稳定性、更高丙烯选择性以及减少焦炭积累，从而增强生产能力和延长催化剂寿命。
