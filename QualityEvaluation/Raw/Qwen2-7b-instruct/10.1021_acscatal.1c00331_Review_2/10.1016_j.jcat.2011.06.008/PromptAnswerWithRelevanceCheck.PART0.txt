[1] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48."
[2] "The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."
[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation."
[4] "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support,whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

1. The optimal bulk In/Pt ratio for achieving maximum activity in ethane and propane dehydrogenation is 0.48, which corresponds to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. This results in nearly 100% selectivity for ethene and propene production.
2. The accumulation of carbon decreases significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, indicating that the alloying of In with Pt plays a crucial role in reducing carbon deposition.
3. During both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, small domains of graphitic carbon are formed, but their accumulation locations differ depending on the alkane being dehydrogenated.
4. Carbon accumulates primarily on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, whereas a portion of it also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation.

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The location of coke accumulation varies between ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with carbon primarily accumulating on the support during ethane dehydrogenation and a portion also accumulating on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. As the bulk In/Pt ratio increases, the accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly from 0 to 0.48, and the rate slows for higher In/Pt ratios. Catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon, as the size of the PtIn nanoparticles remains unaffected by catalyst use. Small domains of graphitic carbon form during both processes, with the accumulation location depending on the alkane composition. These effects impact overall process efficiency and performance by altering reaction kinetics, catalyst stability, and product selectivity.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，考虑到它对能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，以及这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的含义？

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共喂养通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。焦炭积累的位置在乙烷和丙烷脱氢之间有所不同，在乙烷脱氢中主要积累在支撑上，在丙烷脱氢中一部分也积累在PtIn纳米颗粒上。随着In/Pt比例的增加，从0到0.48碳的积累显著减少，对于更高的In/Pt比率，速度变慢。催化剂失活归因于碳积累，因为PtIn纳米颗粒的大小不受催化剂使用的影响。在催化剂使用过程中，小尺寸的石墨碳域形成，其积累位置取决于所使用的烷烃的组成。这些效果通过改变反应动力学、催化剂稳定性以及产物选择性来影响整体过程效率和性能。

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reactions, facilitating the conversion of propane to propene. It also helps in controlling coke formation by providing hydrogen to compete with alkyl radicals, preventing their aggregation and thus minimizing coke formation. The hydrogen can also convert acid sites on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for coke formation, into less reactive sites. Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the graphitization process of the coke deposits, affecting their size and distribution. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance include improved catalyst stability, higher propene selectivity, and reduced coke accumulation, leading to enhanced productivity and longer catalyst life.

氢共喂养在PDH过程中通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢共喂养可以降低脱氢反应的能量壁垒，促进丙烷转化为丙烯。它还可以通过提供氢气与烷基自由基竞争，防止它们聚合并减少焦炭形成，从而控制焦炭形成。氢气还可以将催化剂表面负责焦炭形成的酸性位点转化为活性较低的位点。此外，氢共喂养还可以影响焦炭沉积的石墨化过程，影响其大小和分布。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义包括提高催化剂稳定性、更高丙烯选择性以及减少焦炭积累，从而增强生产能力和延长催化剂寿命。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Increasing the In/Pt ratio up to 0.48 leads to a significant decrease in carbon accumulation, improving catalyst stability. This optimal ratio enhances ethene and propene selectivity, reducing methane and ethane production. The coke is mainly accumulated on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, while a portion of it also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. These effects improve the overall process efficiency and performance by maintaining high activity and selectivity while minimizing carbon deposition.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢共喂料影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。将In/Pt比提高到0.48，碳积累显著减少，提高了催化剂稳定性。这一最佳比例增强了乙烯和丙烯的选择性，减少了甲烷和丙烷的生成。在乙烷脱氢过程中，焦炭主要沉积在载体上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，一部分焦炭也沉积在PtIn纳米颗粒上。这些效果通过保持高活性和选择性同时减少碳沉积来改善整体过程效率和性能。
