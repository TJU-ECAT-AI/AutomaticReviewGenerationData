The surface properties of catalyst supports are important in regulating the catalytic properties of heterogeneous
catalysts. Herein, we studied the eﬀect of acid-base properties of alumina on metal-support interaction and coke
deposition, and investigated the stability of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using PtSn/Al2O3. We
prepared γ-Al2O3 (A750) from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) and compared it with a
commercial sample (Sasol Puralox SBA-200; P200). We loaded 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn on alumina then
conducted propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C (WHSV = 5.2 h−1). PtSn/A750 and PtSn/P200 showed com-
patible initial activity (conversion = ˜50%) and selectivity (> 95%). After 20 h of reaction, PtSn/A750 showed a
slight decrease in activity (39.9%) while the activity of PtSn/P200 dropped signiﬁcantly (28.4%). Spent catalysts
showed diﬀerent metal sintering behavior and coke deposition which are well known causes for catalyst de-
activation. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in A750 (higher Td in ethanol TPD) prevented the sintering of
metal by strong metal-support interaction. Also, the lower number of Lewis acid sites in A750 than that of P200
reduced deposited coke on the catalysts (PtSn/A750: 1.8 wt% and PtSn/P200: 8.6 wt%). Furthermore, diﬀuse
reﬂectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 °C clearly demonstrated that
coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at
these sites. These results suggested that strong metal-support interactions to hold metal particles and less re-
sidual Lewis acid sites after metal loading to reduce coke deposition are important factors for designing stable
and coke-resistant PtSn on alumina catalysts. Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the
acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability.
1. Introduction
Recently, the demand for light oleﬁns including propylene has in-
creased because of their applications as raw materials in polypropylene,
propylene oxide, oxo-alcohol, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid in petro-
chemicals [1–12]. In general, steam cracking and ﬂuid catalytic
cracking (FCC) of oil supply light oleﬁns. However, these processes are
insuﬃcient for meeting the growing demand for propylene because of
their high energy consumptions and low selectivity. Hence, propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained attention for propylene production
by utilizing propane gas.
Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in the PDH industrial ﬁeld
due to their excellent activity and thermal stability. However, PDH,
which aﬀords high yields of propylene, is an endothermic reaction. It
requires high reaction temperatures causing severe catalyst deactiva-
tion by metal sintering and coke deposition formed through undesired
side reactions like hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, and aromatization
of light alkanes.
To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies
attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal
components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the
electronic properties of Pt particles [13–16]. Moreover, alkali (Li, Na,
K), alkali earth (Mg, Ca), and rare earth (La, Ce) metals were employed
to modify the properties of the support [17–26]. For instance, Yu et al.
reported that the addition of Ce to PtSn on alumina catalysts improved
its stability by promoting strong metal-support interactions [23].
Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid
sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from
the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal
surface to support surfaces [1,8,13,14]. However, a fundamental un-
derstanding of the acid-base properties of Al2O3 for improving catalytic
reactivity in alumina-based PDH catalysts has been yet to be developed.

By extension, the role of the support has been considered important
as much as the supported metal, and so, various supports have been
synthesized and used in PDH reaction to obtain high stability
[3–6,27,28]. Recently, Shi et al. reported a novel nanosheet alumina for
PDH, resulting in a highly stable catalyst. The improved stability of the
catalysts were attributed to large amounts of penta-coordinated Al3+
sites (Alp) observed from 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic
resonance (MAS-NMR) studies which are known for Pt anchoring sites
[6,44]. However, there was a lack of explanation of the location of
abundant Alp sites and acid-base properties of the alumina surface.
Here, to clarify the eﬀect of the acid-base properties of alumina on
catalyst stability, we synthesized high-surface area γ-Al2O3 derived
from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH). The synthe-
sized
γ-Al2O3
exhibited
signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent
surface
properties
(stronger and less amounts of Lewis acid sites) from commercial γ-
Al2O3, despite both having the same bulk properties. PDH was con-
ducted after loading Pt-Sn on these two diﬀerent γ-Al2O3. The catalytic
stability of PtSn/Al2O3 derived from AACH was improved by suppres-
sing sintering of the PtSn alloy particles and coke accumulation.
Moreover, we provided the direct evidence of the relation between
Lewis acid sites and coke behavior and investigated the locations of
abundant Alp sites. We intended to contribute to improving the activity,
selectivity, and stability of catalysts by characterizing and controlling
the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces.
2. Experimental section
2.1. AACH synthesis
Fibrous AACH was synthesized following a slightly modiﬁed pro-
cedure from the previous study [29]. AACH precursor was ﬁrst pre-
pared. Al(NO3)3·9H2O and urea ((NH2)2CO3) in 1:9 M ratio were dis-
solved in distilled water (100 mL) with 0.17 M Al3+. The mixture was
transferred to a 125 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and
maintained at 100 °C in an oven for 24 h. After cooling to room tem-
perature, the resultant white precipitate was ﬁltered, washed with
distilled water and isopropyl alcohol several times, and then dried at
80 °C for 24 h. To obtain γ-Al2O3, the as-prepared AACH powders were
calcined at diﬀerent temperatures (600 °C and 750 °C) for 5 h. The ﬁnal
powder products were labeled A600 and A750, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
PtSn/Al2O3 was synthesized by the incipient wetness co-impregna-
tion method with optimum amounts of 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn.
Accordingly, the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O were dis-
solved in ethanol. The metal precursor was then impregnated in Al2O3
three times to obtain a homogenized metal loading. The catalysts were
dried for 12 h in an electrical oven at 60 °C, followed by calcination in
20% O2/He (total 100 sccm) at 500 °C for 4 h, and then reduced in 10%
H2/He (total 60 sccm) at 590 °C for 2 h. Puralox SBA-200 (Sasol, γ-
Al2O3) was used as reference alumina in this study. The synthesized
catalysts were labeled as PtSn/A600, PtSn/A750, and PtSn/P200, cor-
respondingly.
2.3. Characterization
XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 in-
strument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) and step size of 0.02°/s,
operated at 40 kV and 20 mA. The speciﬁc surface area was determined
by measuring the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at −196 °C using
ASAP 2420. Pore size distributions were determined by using the
Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The morphology of the synthe-
sized alumina was examined with an S-4800 ﬁeld emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi, Japan) at 10 kV. Solid-state 27Al
MAS-NMR experiments were performed at room temperature on a
Varian VNMRS 600 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer operating at a magnetic
ﬁeld
of
14.4 T.
The
corresponding
27Al
Larmor
frequency
was
156.3 MHz. All spectra were acquired using a 1.6-mm pencil-type MAS
probe at spinning rate 25 kHz. Each spectrum was obtained from
512 scans with recycle delay time of 2 s. All spectra were externally
referenced (i.e., the 0 ppm position) to the NMR peak of 1 M Al(NO3)3
aqueous solution. Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
experiments for the characterization of alumina surfaces were per-
formed following a similar procedure as that found in our previous
reports (Supporting Information) [30,31]. The size distribution of Pt
particulates on Pt/Al2O3 (fresh and reacted) was conﬁrmed by high-
angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) imaging using a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope oper-
ated at 200 kV. H2/O2 titration was performed using a Belcat-B with
thermal conductivity detector (Supporting Information). Raman spectra
to detect coke species were obtained at room temperature under am-
bient conditions using a confocal Raman spectrophotometer (Alpha
300, WITec) with 532 nm laser and objective lens (50×). Temperature-
programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments for exhausted PtSn catalysts
were conducted in a ﬁxed bed reactor by gas chromatography with
ﬂame ionization detector (GC-FID, Agilent 7820 A) directly connected
to ﬂame ionization detector (Supporting Information).
2.4. Catalytic activity evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation tests were performed at atmospheric
pressure and 590 °C in a quartz ﬂow reactor using 50 mg of sample.
Prior to tests, the samples were reduced in situ under 10% H2/He
(1.0 mL/s) ﬂow at 590 °C for 2 h and then purged with He for 10 min to
minimize the eﬀects of the remaining H2. Afterward, a PDH reaction
mixture of C3H8:H2:He = 1:1.25:4 (volume ratio) was fed to the re-
actor. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was
5.2 h−1. The outlet gases were analyzed by a GC (Agilent 7820 A) using
Al2O3-S column and FID (see detailed calculations and reaction condi-
tion tests in the Supporting Information).
3. Results and discussion
This work aims to understand the eﬀect of alumina surface char-
acteristics on PDH. Therefore, two γ-Al2O3 samples, one commercially
purchased (Puralox SBA 200; P200) and the other synthesized from
AACH (ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide), were investigated.
Figs. 1(a) and S1(a) display the XRD patterns of alumina, conﬁrming
that
the
as-prepared
samples
contained
the
AACH
phase
(NH4AlCO3(OH)2, JCPDS no. 42-250). After heat treatment at 600 °C,
the γ-Al2O3 phase appeared in A600 (2θ = 46° and 47°). AACH was
completely converted to γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS no. 10-425) at 750 °C, which
had the same structure as commercial γ-Al2O3 (P200). SEM images
revealed that the as-prepared AACH exhibited ﬁbrous morphology,
which persisted through thermal treatment at 600 °C and 750 °C, as
shown in Fig. S2. The surface areas of A600, A750, and P200 were
comparable to each other (Table 1) and all alumina had very little
micropores (N2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions are in
Fig. S3).
Solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR experiments and ethanol TPD were per-
formed to characterize the prepared alumina. Fig. 1(b) shows the data
of solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR experiments, which provided the relative
ratio of various Al3+ sites in bulk alumina. Interestingly, A600 con-
tained numerous penta-coordinated Al3+ sites (Alp) (approximately 32
at% which was calculated from solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR data), similar
to the alumina obtained by Shi. et al.6 However, after complete con-
version of AACH to γ-Al2O3 at 750 °C, A750 displayed similar levels of
Alp sites and ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sites (1:2) as P200, in-
dicating their identical bulk structures.
Recently, we reported that ethanol TPD was highly eﬀective for
characterizing acidic sites on the alumina surface [30–33]. Fig. 1(c)

displays the ethanol desorption proﬁles and Table 1 summarizes the
temperature of the maximum desorption rate (Td) and the corre-
sponding desorption amounts. Td values were diﬀerent in P200, A750,
and A600 at 220.8, 262, and 293 °C, respectively. Remarkably, even
though P200 and A750 showed the same bulk structures as conﬁrmed
by XRD and solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR they presented signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent ethanol desorption proﬁles, especially based on acid-base
properties. Here, a higher value of Td means that the newly produced
Lewis acid sites on alumina after dehydroxylation during pretreatment
are unstable. So, those unstable sites hold dissociatively adsorbed
ethanol strongly [37]. Additionally, the amounts of dissociatively ad-
sorbed ethanol were 1.13, 1.04, and 1.48 site/nm2 in A600, A750, and
P200 (Table 1), respectively. This indicates that the number of acid sites
were signiﬁcantly smaller in A600 and A750 than that in P200. Evi-
dently, the surface properties (the number and strength of acid sites) of
the diﬀerent types of γ-Al2O3 were diﬀerent despite their identical bulk
structures. Then, we prepared PtSn-loaded catalysts for A750 and P200
to investigate the inﬂuences of diﬀerent surface properties on PDH.
To determine the optimal Pt:Sn ratio, we performed PDH tests using
the synthesized catalysts with various levels of Sn and the Pt content
ﬁxed at 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. S5). The combination of 0.5 wt% Pt
and 0.9 wt% Sn (Sn/Pt = 3.0) loaded on γ-Al2O3 showed the highest
activity, selectivity, and stability while 0.1 wt% Sn (Sn/Pt = 0.3)
showed the highest activity for silica supported samples (Fig. S4). These
results implied that a considerable amount of Sn was used to modify the
alumina surface, consistent with the results of other studies that re-
ported the main alloy phase of PtSn on alumina surface was Pt3Sn
[12,34–36]. STEM images of the fresh PtSn catalysts in Figs. 2(a–c) il-
lustrate that the metal particulates were highly dispersed in the alumina
supports. The mean size of these Pt-Sn particles was measured to be
about 1 nm from 200 metal particles (Figs. 2(d–f)). H2/O2 titration
experiments were conducted for dispersion measurement of PtSn/
Al2O3, with the results summarized in Table 2 [4]. Despite slightly
lower dispersion in PtSn on P200 (H/Pt = 0.78), all catalysts showed
good dispersion in accordance with the size of the metal particles
measured from STEM.
PDH was performed at 590 °C for 20 h with WHSV = 5.2 h−1
(detailed protocols of the reaction are in SI). Figs. 3(a) and (b) reveal
the conversion and selectivity proﬁles of PtSn on alumina as functions
of reaction time. The initial conversions were comparable among the
PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (48.5% in PtSn/A600, 48.3% in PtSn/A750, and
46.6% in PtSn/P200) owing to similar PtSn metal dispersion and
properties, as discussed in SI 5. However, notably, diﬀerent stabilities
were displayed depending on alumina support. Catalyst deactivations
were barely observed in PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750. Their conversions
were 42.5 and 39.9%, respectively, after 20 h of PDH reaction. How-
ever, the PtSn/P200 catalyst experienced a dramatic decline in con-
version during the ﬁrst 3 h. Thereafter, its reactivity gradually de-
creased, resulting in 28.4% conversion after 20 h. The propylene
selectivity, shown in Fig. 3(b), suggested no remarkable change to any
of the catalysts. The selectivity of PtSn/P200 catalyst started at 94.2%
for the ﬁrst 3 h and stabilized at 96% thereafter; those of PtSn/A600
and PtSn/A750 remained at 96.9 and 97.1%, respectively, for the entire
reaction. To evaluate the deactivation proﬁles quantitatively, we cal-
culated the ﬁrst-order deactivation values (details are described in SI)
of
kd
to
be
0.011 h−1(PtSn/A600),
0.017 h−1(PtSn/A750),
and
0.041 h−1(PtSn/P200). Also, PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750 showed higher
stabilities than PtSn/P200 during repeated regeneration cycles, as
shown in Fig. S10. Recently, Shi et al. reported alumina nanosheets
with plenty of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites that showed superior ac-
tivity, selectivity, and stability on the PDH reaction [6]. In our study,
A600 displayed similar bulk structure and PtSn/A600 showed com-
parable reactivity proﬁle to their alumina. However, it is noteworthy
that PtSn/A750 showed equally outstanding activity and stability as
PtSn/A600, although A750 had less penta-coordinated Al3+ sites than
A600 and the same bulk structure as P200.
There are two main causes of catalyst deactivation during the PDH
reaction: the aggregation of metal particles and coke deposition during
the reaction. We veriﬁed the sintering of PtSn metal particles by HAADF
STEM and H2/O2 titration for the spent catalysts. Observably, PtSn
metal particles had similar sizes on A600 and A750 supports even after
20 h reaction at 590 °C, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) (low magniﬁcation
STEM images are in Fig. S8). The mean sizes of the reacted PtSn par-

1.0 ± 0.2 nm, respectively) were comparable with those of the freshly
prepared catalysts (1.1 ± 0.3 nm and 1.0 ± 0.3 nm, respectively), as
shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e). However, the spent PtSn/P200 showed large
sintered PtSn clusters with a maximum size of ˜10 nm and broad size
distribution with a mean size of 1.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (f).
These results revealed that PtSn on A600 and A750 showed better
sinter-resistances due to stronger interactions with alumina than that of
P200. This could be explained with the ethanol TPD results. As dis-
cussed in Fig. 1(c), the unstable Lewis acid sites produced in A600 and
A750 could be stabilized by PtSn metal particles, showing strong metal-

support interaction during PDH [37]. H2/O2 titration experiments were
performed on the spent samples to measure the dispersion of metal
particulates, as shown in Table 2. The metal dispersion of PtSn/P200
was considerably decreased to H/Pt = 0.5 after the reaction, which was
consistent with the TEM images. Considering the stability of the cata-
lysts, PtSn/A750 showed a distinctively diﬀerent proﬁle for metal sin-
tering than PtSn/P200, despite their identical bulk structures, which
originated from strong interaction with the alumina surface.
To investigate coke deposition during PDH, we characterized the
amounts and species of coke on the spent catalysts by TPO with the
results being shown in Fig. 5 and Table S1. PtSn/A600 (0.6 wt%) and
PtSn/A750 (1.8 wt%) showed signiﬁcantly lower amounts of deposited
coke than PtSn/P200 (8.6 wt%). Interestingly, the coke content of PtSn/
P200 was about ﬁve times that of PtSn/A750, despite their same bulk
structures. Therefore, we attributed part of the relatively fast deacti-
vation on PtSn/P200 to coke deposition, which was inﬂuenced by the
alumina surface properties.
For PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750 samples, no signiﬁcant aggregation
of metal particulates was observed during the reaction, indicating that
catalyst deactivation was mainly due to coke deposition. We observed
deposited cokes at varying reaction times and investigated their cor-
relation with speciﬁc acid sites on alumina. PtSn/A750 samples were
subjected to PDH and collected after 3 min, 10 min, 1 h, and 2 h for
systematic understanding of coke deposition on the alumina-based
catalyst. Fig. 6(a) presents TPO proﬁles of PtSn/A750 at diﬀerent re-
action times, conﬁrming that the amount of coke increased with reac-
tion time. We conﬁrmed that the properties of PtSn clusters on A750
did not change signiﬁcantly during the reaction, as shown in Fig. S11.
This suggests that the coke precursor is easily desorbed from PtSn metal
and favors to be deposited on alumina support rather than the metal
active sites [2].
We performed DRIFTS experiments after CO adsorption at −150 °C
to investigate the interaction of coke with the alumina surface. Fig. 6(b)
displays the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on spent PtSn/A750 samples
with varying reaction times (detailed peak assignments are listed in
Table S2). Interestingly, the CO adsorbed on Lewis acid sites of A750
corresponding to 2194–2186 cm−1 disappeared immediately after the
ﬁrst 3 min of reaction then gradually increased as the reaction

progressed. This suggests that coke deposition was initiated at the Lewis
acid sites of A750. However, the Lewis acid sites reappeared as the
reaction progressed. We hypothesized that the Lewis acid sites were
aﬀected by the transformation of coke species with increase in coke
deposition. Fig. 6(c) displays the Raman spectra of spent PtSn/A750
samples with various reaction times to identify the coke species (de-
tailed peak assignments are described in Table S3). Observably, the
intensity of band between 2300–3300 cm−1 decreased with increasing
reaction time, as shown in Fig. 6(c) (each spectrum was normalized to
the band at 1598 cm−1). This indicates that aliphatic hydrocarbon
content decreased and the coke species gradually transformed to aro-
matic hydrocarbons. To summarize DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy
results (Fig. 6(b) and (c)), the coke precursors (aliphatic alkyl hydro-
carbons) were initially induced at Lewis acid sites on the alumina
surface and gradually were transformed to aromatic compounds. This
follows the same mechanism as that reported for internal defects of
zeolite that initially induced coke deposition [38–40]. However, it was
interesting that the Lewis acid sites increased with the transformation
of deposited coke species that simultaneously aﬀected the adsorption of
CO molecules at those sites, which needs to be further investigated
[41–45].
Overall, we clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated
from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface. According to previous
studies, coke precursor is initially formed at the Pt metal surface and
then transferred to the support surface [44,45]. However, the DRIFT
study demonstrated the absence of metal sintering and that the PtSn
cluster surface remained unchanged signiﬁcantly by coke deposition
due to the eﬀects of Sn addition. To understand why the amount of
deposited coke on PtSn/P200 was ﬁve times higher than that on PtSn/
A750, we performed alumina surface analysis. Fig. 6(d) provides the
spectra from DRIFTS experiments after CO adsorption at −150 °C. In-
terestingly, the relative ratios of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were
signiﬁcantly reduced in A600 and A750 compared to that in P200. This
was consistent result with the spectra of pyridine adsorption which is
widely used for characterizing the acid sites of alumina surface as
shown in Fig. S13 shows two distinctive peaks at 1623 cm−1 and
1614 cm−1. According to the assignment, pyridine adsorbs on Lewis

to P200, suggesting that lower amounts of Lewis acid sites were pro-
duced in A600 and A750, as discussed in ethanol TPD (Fig. 1(c)). This
was an apparent evidence for the diﬀerence in the amounts of cokes
deposited on A750 and P200, where coke deposition was induced on
the Lewis acid sites of alumina. Moreover, to conﬁrm the relationship
between coke deposits and Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface
without surface modiﬁcation by metal additives, we conducted TPO
experiments with cokes on bare alumina formed by propylene (the
condition of coke formations on bare alumina is described in the Sup-
porting Information). As shown in Fig. S14, interestingly, quantiﬁcation
results of coke deposits on bare alumina from the TPO proﬁle were
1.8 wt% (A600), 2.0 wt% (A750), and 10.9 wt% (P200), respectively,
which were consistent with the results in Fig. 5. In sum up, such re-
duced Lewis acid sites, which can be eﬀectively neutralized by small
additions of Sn, lead to less deposition of coke, and hence better sta-
bility.
Additionally, these results (Figs. 1(c) and 6(d)) demonstrated the
roles of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites (Alp) in A600. Kwak et al. pre-
viously proposed that penta-coordinated sites on alumina surfaces sta-
bilize the metal [47]. Recently, Alp-rich sites of alumina were synthe-
sized using various methods. However, meaningful amounts of penta-
coordinated Al3+ sites which seize metal particles are still under debate
because Alp sites exist not only on the surface of alumina but also in the
bulk. Previously, Shi et al. and Tang et al. reported that considerable
amounts of Alp sites were present on synthesized Al2O3 that were
capable of anchoring the metal [6,48]. Moreover, Zhang et al. reported
the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with many penta-coordinated Al3+
sites but revealed that most of them existed in the bulk [49]. Here, the
results of DRIFTS study shown in Fig. 6(d) suggested that the dehy-
droxylation of Alo-OH is diﬃcult to produce Alp sites (Lewis acid sites)
on the surface. Also, PtSn on A750 which had signiﬁcant lower amounts
of Alp sites showed comparable stability with PtSn/A600. Thus, al-
though A600 had abundant penta-coordinated Al3+ sites as conﬁrmed
by solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR analysis (Fig. 1(b)), the majority of these
sites existed in bulk, leading to strong acid sites on alumina surface and
low crystallinity of the bulk.
In summary, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the strong surface acid sites
suppressed metal sintering and the reduced number of residual Lewis
acid sites after metal loading led to reduced coke deposition. Therefore,
strong acid sites on the alumina surface and less residual Lewis acid
sites are desirable for high activity and superior stability during the
PDH reaction. Finally, to design active and stable alumina-based PDH
catalysts, various analyses on alumina should be performed ﬁrst for
precise understanding of the surface properties of alumina.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we revealed that the alumina surface properties (the
number and strength of acid sites) strongly inﬂuence the activity and
stability of catalysts used in the PDH reaction by investigating both
AACH-derived γ-Al2O3 (A750) and commercial γ-Al2O3 (P200). We
were able to classify each alumina based on its surface properties using
various techniques including ethanol TPD analysis and DRIFTS. From
the results of ethanol TPD, A750 (Td = 262 °C, 1.04 site/nm2) showed
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent surface properties than P200 (Td = 220.8 °C, 1.48
site/nm2), despite their similar bulk structures. Furthermore, the com-
bined results of DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the
coke precursor was initially induced on Lewis acid sites on the alumina
surface. Subsequently, the Lewis acid sites were gradually opened as the
deposited coke species transformed to aromatic compounds from ali-
phatic hydrocarbons. Consequently, the strong Lewis acid sites formed
after dehydroxylation and reduced number of acid sites in A750 led to
suppression of metal sintering and coke deposition, which is helpful for
reducing the number of regeneration steps of the catalyst. Therefore, it
is important to control the Lewis acid sites on alumina surface for su-
perior stability. In addition, a large number of penta-coordinated Al3+
sites of A600, as evidenced by solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR, were mostly
present in the bulk, and not on the surface. This study provided the
direct evidences of the relation between Lewis acid sites and coke be-
havior and distinguished the two main causes of catalyst deactivation
(metal sintering and coke deposition) even at high reaction tempera-
tures. Furthermore, it will contribute to the development of alumina-
based catalysts with high activity and superior stability for desired re-
actions by accurately understanding and classifying the surface prop-
erties of alumina.
