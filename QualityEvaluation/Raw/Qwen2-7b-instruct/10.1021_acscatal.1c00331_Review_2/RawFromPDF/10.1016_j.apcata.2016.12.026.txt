Abstract:  
A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated 
SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x=0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot 
hydrothermal synthesis method. The resulting materials were used to disperse Pt, Sn 
particles and further studied the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. 
The physicochemical properties of the supports and catalysts were characterized by 
XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD and TG-DTA 
techniques. Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the 
xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific 
surface area. It was found that incorporation of appropriate amounts of Mg promoted 
the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles and facilitated the transfer of the carbon 
deposits from the active metal to the support. Such a modification of support not only 
enhanced the interaction of the Sn-support, but also stabilized the oxidation state of 
Sn species, leading to the improvement of catalytic activity and stability. The 
significant increases in conversion and selectivity were obtained on the modified 
catalysts with appropriate content of Mg. The best catalytic performances were 
obtained on PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% of magnesium, showing a higher 
than 98% selectivity toward propene at a 38.0% conversion of propane even after 6 h 
reaction.

1. Introduction 
As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented 
in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, 
and acrylic acid etc. At present, the effective routes for producing propene mainly 
contain steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha.[1, 2] Since the 
traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for 
propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained 
much attention.[3, 4] Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding 
value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance.[5] Propane 
dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning 
higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a 
considerable propene yield.[6] Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate 
side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of 
catalysts. Therefore, the development of new types of catalysts with high efficiency 
under these severe reaction conditions is an important subject in this field. 
Pt-based catalyst has been broadly applied in alkane dehydrogenation reaction, 
owing to its excellent ability in activating C-H bonds and conserving simultaneously 
the C-C bonds.[7, 8] However, carbon deposition and metallic sintering are still the 
crucial issues in affecting the long term catalytic stability. Coke deposits derive from 
polymerization of propene or carbon intermediates, which usually occurs at acidic 
sites located on the support and metal nanoparticles.[9] To our best knowledge, 
supported PtSn catalyst displays good catalytic performances in propane 
dehydrogenation process and attracts widely attention. Generally, the properties of 
PtSn catalysts closely related to the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state 
of Sn and the features of support.[10, 11] The specific functions of tin were expressed 
as geometric and electronic modification of platinum phase.[12] It was proposed that 
Sn promoter decreased the size of surface Pt ensembles, therefore restraining the deep 
dehydrogenation reactions. On the other hand, the electronic effect of Sn can either 
favor the charge transfer from Snn+ to Pt or create a disparate electronic environment 
6 
 
in Pt-Sn alloys.[13] With regard to support, it plays a substantial role for the 
dispersion of Pt, Sn active sites. PtSn catalysts supported on various materials such as 
Al2O3, SiO2, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 have been extensively studied for 
dehydrogenation of propane.[14-16] Recently, the SBA-15 shows its potential 
application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well 
defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very 
well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is 
beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles 
from agglomeration.[17] Therefore, SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts may be a 
promising prospect for the dehydrogenation of propane. 
The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of oleﬁns product and 
extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and 
carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.[18] 
The secondary dehydrogenation reaction must be suppressed to improve the 
selectivity of the desired product propene. It is well established that improved propene 
yield can be achieved by adding alkaline or alkaline earth metals to the catalyst 
formulation for propane dehydrogenation.[19] A. Bliek et al.[20] reported that the 
existence of alkali-earth metals in Pt-Sn catalyst could not only adapt the acid sites, 
but also embellish the interaction between the support and the active sites. The 
addition of Mg on PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was described by Shi et al.[21], showing 
that Mg promoter could improve the distribution of Pt particles and strengthen the 
interaction among Pt, Sn, and support, leading to an enhanced catalytic performance.

Scheme 1. - Schematic synthesis procedures for the Mg-incorporated/supported 
SBA-15 mesoporous materials  
The introduction of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal in the published 
literature was mostly loaded through the post-synthesis procedure.[22] This process 
needed two stages calcination to get the final product, which could cause a 
non-uniform dispersion of Mg component on the support and a loss in the efﬁciency 
of the Mg promoter. Moreover, the additive promoter might clog the mesoporous 
channel thus decrease the surface area and pore size of SBA-15.[23] In the present 
paper, we prepared the Mg-incorporated SBA-15 with different magnesium loadings 
by one-pot method (Scheme 1) and used them as supports to disperse Pt, Sn particles. 
The catalytic activity of these catalysts was tested by propane dehydrogenation. 
Mg/SBA-15 sample was synthesized using the traditional impregnation method as the 
referential sample. The differences between these samples on structure-activity 
relationships were identified and discussed. This can provide us with important 
information to identify the influence of magnesium promoter on the physicochemical 
characteristics 
and 
catalytic 
properties 
of 
PtSn/SBA-15 
in 
the 
propane 
dehydrogenation.

2.1. Catalyst preparation 
The silica mesoporous support SBA-15 and Mg-incorporated SBA-15 were 
synthesized using a triblock copolymer, Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Aldrich) as a 
template according to the procedure reported in the literature.[24] The silica source 
was the tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%). In a typical synthesis, 2 g of P123 was 
first dissolved in 60 ml of 2M HNO3 and 15 ml of deionized water to form a clear 
solution at room temperature. Then a calculated amount of magnesium acetate 
(Mg(CH3COO)2) was added to the previous solution under stirring. After 3 h, 4.25 g 
of TEOS was added dropwise to the solution and continuously stirred for 24 h at 40 
oC. The resulting suspension was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave to undergo 
hydrothermal treatment at 100 oC for 24 h. Finally, the mixture was evaporated under 
80 oC with stirring and dried at 80 oC for 12 h, then calcined at 550 oC for 6 h to 
remove the surfactant and release the pores. The received samples were denoted as 
xMg-SBA-15 (the nominal mass fraction x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) hereinafter. Another 
sample was synthesized by the incipient-wetness impregnation method and denoted as 
xMg/SBA-15-IM. First, the calcined SBA-15 powder was introduced into a calculated 
amount of Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solutions. After impregnation for 12 h, the final 
mixture was evaporated under 80 oC and then dried and calcined by the same 
procedure as previously mentioned. 
PtSn catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method. 
SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6·6H2O precursors were dissolved in deionized water to form 
a solution and the solution was impregnated with the support powder. Then, the 
mixture was sonicated for 30 min and then under static condition for 12 h. After that, 
the solution was dried at 80 oC for 12 h and calcined at 500 oC for 4 h. The nominal 
compositions of these catalysts were 1 wt.% Pt and 2 wt.% Sn. 
2.2. Catalyst characterization 
Low-angle XRD patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 0.5-10°  with a step 
size of 0.02°  using an EMPYREAN diffractometer. Wide-angle XRD patterns were 
obtained by an X-ray diffraction apparatus (Philips X’ pert PRO) using Cu Kα (45 kV, 
50 mA) radiation. 
9 
 
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at -196 oC on an 
automated surface area & pore size analyzer (Quadrasorb SI apparatus). Before each 
measurement, the samples were outgassed under vacuum at 300 oC for 3 h. 
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 
27 Fourier transform spectrometer at room temperature. The spectra were collected in 
the range of 4000-400 cm-1 and KBr was used as background. 
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were achieved on the XSAM800 
spectrometer with an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source and the binding energies 
were amended by using C (1 s) at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. 
The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurements 
were implemented by a Micromeritics AUTOChem II2920 instrument to analyze the 
acidity of the catalysts. The sample (100 mg) was pretreated at 250 °C for 2 h under a 
helium ﬂow (30 ml/min) before being cooled to 50 °C and saturated with adsorbed 
ammonia. During desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to 
record the TPD proﬁles from 50 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min. 
The temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (H2-TPD) was measured 
over a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument equipped with a TCD detector. The 
catalyst (100 mg) was first reduced in situ in a 10 % H2/N2 mixture gas flow of 30 
ml/min, with a 10 °C/min ramping rate from 30 °C to 500 °C and maintained at that 
temperature for 1 h. After that, the catalyst was cooled to 30 °C and subjected to 
H2-saturation in a stream of 10 % H2/N2. Then, the sample was purged with nitrogen 
for 3 h to remove H2 in the gas phase, and then was heated from 30 °C to 800 °C with 
a ramping rate of 10 °C /min. 
Transmission electron micro-scope (TEM) images were taken on JEOL JEM 
2010 electron micro-scope at an acceleration voltage of 120.0 kV. The samples were 
ultrasonic treatment and well suspended in ethanol. Drops of the suspension were 
employed and well dispersed on a copper grid. 
The thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a TGA Q500 
thermogravimetric analyzer. The samples were heated under air atmosphere from 
room temperature to 750 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C /min.

2.3. Catalytic performance 
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a fix-bed quartz tubular 
reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed into the center 
of the reactor and reduced in H2 at 500 oC for 1 h before catalytic evaluation. The 
reaction conditions were as follows: 580 oC of reaction temperature, atmospheric 
pressure, C3H8/Ar= 7:3 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity 
(WHSV) is 8.25 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed on-line using a GC-3000B 
model gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The 
conversion of propane and the selectivity for propene were defined using following

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Characterization of Mg-modified SBA-15 supports 
11 
 
 
Fig. 1 - (a) Low-angle and (b) wide-angle XRD patterns of different supports: (A) 
SBA-15, (B) 1Mg-SBA-15, (C) 2Mg-SBA-15, (D) 4Mg-SBA-15, (E) 6Mg-SBA-15, 
and (F) 2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
The low-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and Mg-modified SBA-15 samples are 
shown in Fig. 1(a). The XRD pattern of SBA-15 showed a sharp peak at about 0.92° 
together with two additional weak peaks, which were indexed to (100), (110), and 
(200) reflections, respectively. The XRD proﬁle veriﬁed the formation of typical 
hexagonally-structured SBA-15 silica with highly ordered mesoporous channels as 
reported by Zhao et al.[24] All of the patterns of xMg-SBA-15 exhibited these three 
peaks with high intensity, indicating that the hexagonal mesostructure was intact even 
if magnesium was introduced. Wei et al.[25] succeeded in synthesizing the 
well-ordered structure MgO/SBA-15 composites since Mg2+ ions were known to 
12 
 
interact strongly with the non-ionic surfactant P123. The intensity of diffraction peaks 
showed gradual decrease with the introduction of Mg component, suggesting that 
there was a deterioration of the ordered pore structures.[26] The calculated unit cell 
parameters (a0) corresponding to the d100 spacings in the XRD pattern are listed in 
Table 1. It could be observed that the unit cell parameter a0 of SBA-15 was 10.7 nm 
while that was 10.7-10.9 nm for the magnesium-doped samples, indicating the 
symmetry of pore structure did not significantly alter. 
The wide-angle XRD patterns for these materials are depicted in Fig. 1(b). All of 
the patterns showed a broad peak in 2θ region of 20-30°, corresponding to the typical 
reflection of amorphous silica.[27] Except the typical patterns of SBA-15, the peaks at 
2θ of 42.9° and 62.3° were observed in 2Mg/SBA-15-IM sample, which indexed to 
reflections of magnesium oxide (PDF Card No. 45-0946).[28] The absence of these 
XRD diffractions indicated a better dispersion of magnesium species for the 
xMg-SBA-15 samples synthesized by one-pot method.

(D) 4Mg-SBA-15, (E) 6Mg-SBA-15, and (F) 2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
The textural properties of the samples were investigated by nitrogen 
adsorption-desorption and the corresponding isotherms and pore size distributions are 
shown in Fig. 2. All the samples exhibited typical isotherm of type IV with hysteresis 
loops of type H1 according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the characteristic 
of mesoporous materials.[29] It should be noted that the isotherms of Mg-modified 
SBA-15 samples were very similar to that of SBA-15 in shape, suggesting that these 
materials retained the initial mesoporous texture. The pore size distributions of the 
support materials (Fig. 2(b)) displayed the pore size with high uniformity and mainly 
distributed in the range of 4-7 nm. The results showed that all of the support materials 
14 
 
exhibited highly ordered mesoporous of the cylindrical channels with a narrow pore 
size distribution, which was in good consistent with the results obtained by low-angle 
XRD. 
The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of SBA-15 
and Mg-modified SBA-15 materials are summarized in Table 1. The surface areas 
and total pore volumes of xMg-SBA-15 mesoporous materials decreased gradually 
with the increasing amount of magnesium in the supports. Magnesium species 
interacted with silanol groups and formed the Si-O-Mg monolayer, the residual 
magnesium species covered on the top and converted to the smooth MgOx layer after 
calcination, thus decreasing both the surface area and pore volume.[30] Davidson et 
al.[31] reported that the silica walls structure of SBA-15 materials was more complex 
and showed a “corona” region with microporous around the cylindrical organic 
aggregates due to the partial occlusion of the PEO chains in the silica matrix. 
Magnesium species incorporated in SBA-15 would partly fill the “microporous 
corona”. Therefore, the average pore diameter increased while the micropore volume 
decreased when magnesium amount changed from 1wt.% to 6wt.%. Meanwhile, 
2Mg/SBA-15-IM possessed the lowest surface area and pore volume value, indicating 
that the one-pot method was better able to maintain the mesoporous structure of silica 
materials.

Infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface property of the 
as-made materials, the spectra were collected in Fig. 3. It could be clearly seen that 
the framework vibrations of xMg-SBA-15 were characteristically similar to those of 
SBA-15 structure. The symmetric stretching mode showed at 804 cm-1, while the 
band at 463 cm-1 was assigned to the Si-O-Si bending mode.[32] The band in the 
range of 1050-1100cm-1 was related to characteristic of Si-O-Si vibrational stretching, 
and the peak in the samples was somewhat red-shifted as the amount of incorporated 
magnesium increased, which indicated the interaction between magnesium and 
silicon.[33]

taken along the [110] directions; (c and d) HAADF-STEM image of 2Mg-SBA-15 
and EDS elemental mapping images of O, Si, and Mg 
To investigate the morphology of Mg-incorporated SBA-15 and the distribution 
of magnesium species, TEM analyses were carried out. 2Mg-SBA-15 sample (Fig. 
4(a, b)) exhibited highly ordered hexagonal structure with narrow pore diameter size 
distribution, which was in accordance with the XRD and N2 adsorption-desorption 
16 
 
results. There was no MgO particles observed on the 2Mg-SBA-15 material surface or 
pores, indicating the well dispersion of magnesium on the support. The homogeneous 
dispersion of Mg species in SBA-15 led to the less-blocked mesopores, consequently 
these samples prepared by in situ incorporating method displayed the higher surface 
area, pore diameter and pore volume than the impregnated sample. Distribution of Mg 
on the support was confirmed by means of HAADF-STEM combined with EDS 
elemental mapping analysis. From the elemental mapping images, it was clear that O, 
Si and Mg were evenly distributed in mesoporous structure. 
3.2. Characterization of PtSn catalysts

PtSn/4Mg-SBA-15, (E) PtSn/6Mg-SBA-15, and (F) PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
XRD patterns of reduced PtSn/xMg-SBA-15 and PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM samples 
are shown in Fig. 5. From low-angle XRD patterns, the features of all the samples 
were rather similar, with three well-resolved diffraction peaks that indexed to (100), 
(110) and (200) reﬂections, indicating the hexagonal mesostructure was intact even 
after loading Pt and Sn. Wide-angle XRD patterns showed the typical peak of 
amorphous silica at 2θ = 23.5°. The XRD reflections of 40.0°, 46.3°, 67.4° and 80.8° 
at 2θ could be assigned to inter-planar spacing (111), (200), (220) and (311) of cubic 
Pt metal structure, respectively.[34] There was no peak of Sn or SnOx, probably due to 
the highly-dispersed Sn species or the formation of amorphous SnOx phases. 
 
Fig. 6 - TEM images of the reduced samples: (a, b) PtSn/SBA-15, 
(c)PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15, and (d) PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
To further investigate the morphology of the catalysts and the effect of Mg on the 
modification of catalysts, the TEM experiments were implemented. The TEM images 
of the corresponding samples (Fig. 6) showed that all catalysts remained the highly 
ordered structure after Pt and Sn loading. For PtSn/SBA-15 sample, metallic particles 
18 
 
were irregularly distributed on the whole support and some particles were confined in 
the porous channel appeared in Fig. 6(a), while some agglomerated particles 
distributed on the external surface of the catalyst and the ends of mesopores were 
partially blocked by the large particles. The movement of Pt particles within the pore 
channels or from pores to the surface of support could occur under the reduction 
conditions because of the weak interaction between Pt and support. The 
agglomeration of metallic particles resulted in the low accessible metal surface area, 
which in consequence suppressed the catalytic ability to adsorb the hydrogen at low 
temperature.[35] Meanwhile, for the Mg-decorated samples, no large aggregates of 
the metals on the external surface were observed, indicating a high distribution 
throughout the pores of Pt and Sn metallic particles. The results suggested that the 
modification of Mg could markedly influence metallic nanoparticles distribution. This 
could be explained by that suitable content of magnesium additives could prevent the 
agglomeration of dispersed Pt into discrete particles, thus an increase in platinum 
dispersion was observed.[36] It was noted that the surfaces of PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
sample seemed to be covered by dark clouds, which could be caused by the unequally 
dispersion of Mg species and be further responsible for the decline in both pore 
volume and surface area. The results were in accord with the textural properties 
characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption (Table 1).

Fig. 7 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of different catalysts. There were two 
desorption peaks for each sample: the first desorption peak at about 60-230 °C and the 
second one at above 230 °C. The first peak was attributed to the desorption of the 
adsorbed NH3 on the weak acid sites, whereas the second peak was assigned to the 
moderate acid sites.[37] In a comparison, a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption at 
low temperature and the sharply decreased ammonia desorption peak at high 
temperature were observed after loading of magnesium component. This phenomenon 
showed that the catalyst acidity decreased with the addition of magnesium, which 
could increase catalytic selectivity and stability.

PtSn/xMg-SBA-15 catalysts to further study the electronic properties of the surface 
elements. Fig. 8(a) shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Pt 4f of the reduced 
catalysts. The binding energies at 71.2 and 74.5 eV could be assigned to Pt0, only 
metallic Pt species presented on the catalysts. A slight shift to higher binding energy 
was appeared as magnesium incorporated, which could be due to the strong 
metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and xMg-SBA-15 supports, it was 
conducive to make Pt species with better resistance of sintering. Fig. 8(b) shows the 
XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 region. Three peaks were obtained at 485.9, 
486.6 and 487.2 eV after deconvolution treatment, corresponding to different types of 
tin species. The binding energy at 485.9 eV was associated with a reduced tin phase, 
either in the metallic (Sn0) or in the alloy state.[38] While the second and third peak 
were attributed to different types of oxidized Sn i.e. Sn2+ and/or Sn4+. It was well 
established that Sn2+ and Sn4+ could not be discriminated since their binding energies 
were very close.[10]

The binding energies of surface elements Pt 4f, Sn3d5/2, Mg 2p, Si 2p and O 1s 
for various catalysts were summarized in Table 2. Mostly amount of the Sn species 
were in the oxidized state. What's more, the content of Sn0 species in PtSn/SBA-15 
catalyst (14.1%) was much more than that of the Mg-modified samples, indicating 
that more amounts of tin existed in a non-metallic state (Sn2+ or Sn4+) after 
magnesium was added. However, an excess of Mg loading (6 wt.%) weakened the 
interaction between Sn species and support, resulting in the increase of metallic tin 
content. Thus, it could be concluded that a proper amount of Mg addition would 
strengthen the Sn-support interaction, then inhibit the exhaustive reduction of tin 
species and stabilize the oxidized tin species. It was found that the oxidative Sn 
species (Sn4+ or Sn2+) could modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt 
species, leading to the great reactivity and stability.[39] The mass percent of surface 
Pt and Sn (Table 2) showed that incorporation of magnesium in SBA-15 enhanced 
the dispersion of Pt and Sn species on the catalysts surface.[40] Meanwhile, much 
stronger interactions of Pt, Sn and supports were observed over PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 in 
comparison with the impregnated sample. In addition, the binding energy of Mg 2p 
over PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM was smaller than that over PtSn/xMg-SBA-15, while it 
was opposite for Si 2p. This might be caused by the formation of MgSiO3 over 
PtSn/xMg-SBA-15 samples.[41]

PtSn/4Mg-SBA-15, (E) PtSn/6Mg-SBA-15, and (F) PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
The H2-TPD proﬁles of the reduced catalysts are displayed in Fig. 9, where two 
hydrogen desorption peaks could be observed in the profiles. In general, the 
desorption peak at low temperature (84-125 oC) was attributed to the hydrogen on 
metallic Pt, whereas the high temperature desorption peaks at 650 oC could be 
assigned to spillover hydrogen.[22, 42] The amount of H2 desorption for different 
catalysts is shown in Table 3. In the case of magnesium promoted catalysts, the main 
difference originated from the hydrogen desorption at low temperature, as the amount 
of hydrogen was up to 94 μl/gcat. regardless of the magnesium content in the catalysts. 
Meanwhile, the corresponding temperature moved towards the higher temperature, 
revealing that the capacity of absorbing H2 became much stronger at low temperature. 
It was worthy noting that the PtSn/SBA-15 sample showed the least amounts of 
hydrogen adsorbed compared with that of the Mg-SBA-15 based catalysts, which was 
probably caused by the diminished Pt particles because of sintering. Generally, the 
main reason for the decrease in amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt was the sintering 
of particles.[43] According to the hydrogen desorption behaviour at low temperature, 
one can conclude that Pt particles dispersed well on catalyst surface, which would 
provide accessible metal surface area for the dehydrogenation of propane.[35] 
Nevertheless, when the concentration of magnesium was excessive (6 wt.%), more 
amounts of magnesium species might block the platinum particles, which led to the 
decrease of the metal dispersion. [44, 45] These results suggested that the promoter 
Mg could make a signiﬁcant difference in metallic distribution. Moreover, the catalyst 
with modified Mg species by the one-pot method possessed higher metal dispersion 
than that by the impregnation method.

Fig. 10 - (a) Propane conversion and (b) propene selectivity as functions of time 
on stream for different catalysts (reaction conditions: T = 580 oC, C3H8:Ar = 7:3 
(molar ratio), 0.1 MPa, WHSV = 8.25 h-1; m(cat) = 0.2 g) 
Fig. 10 shows the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation over the 
different catalysts. For PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, the initial conversion of propane was 
35.7% and then reduced to 27.2% after 6 h reaction. The catalytic activity and 
stability were clearly enhanced when 1-4 wt.% Mg was introduced into the catalysts. 
Nevertheless, the catalytic activity declined rapidly with the further increase of Mg, 
suggesting that excess Mg content would suppress the propane dehydrogenation 
25 
 
reaction. The promotion effect of Mg on the catalytic performance could be related to 
the better metallic particle distribution and stabilized effect of nonmetallic state Sn 
species. The influence of preparation method was also dramatic, PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 
prepared 
by 
one-pot 
method 
exhibited 
better 
catalytic 
activity 
than 
PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM. At the same time, the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the 
most excellent catalytic activity with a maximum initial propane conversion of 43.0% 
among all the samples. 
Fig. 10(b) shows propene selectivity versus reaction time for different catalysts. 
It could be observed that the propene selectivity kept stable for 6 h propane 
dehydrogenation reaction. With the incorporation of Mg (1-4 wt.%), the propene 
selectivity for other catalysts were markedly higher than that of PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, 
and stabilized at above 95.0%. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the highest 
propene selectivity reached 99.2% among all catalysts. As for PtSn/SBA-15 sample, 
some metal particles were agglomerated due to the weak interaction among Pt, Sn and 
support (Fig. 6(a)). Hydrogenolysis reaction would be carried out easily since this 
unwanted side reaction needed relatively large platinum ensemble, which resulted in a 
low selectivity of propene.[46] However, the continuous addition of Mg (6 wt.%) 
resulted in the decreased propene selectivity compared with that of the PtSn/SBA-15 
catalyst. 
It is known that platinum was the only active metal in PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst and 
propene was formed only by dehydrogenation on the metallic sites, while the main 
by-products (C1-C2 hydrocarbons) were mainly from propane cracking on the 
support.[47] Therefore, the changes of acidity and Pt active sites were responsible for 
the selectivity of propene. The addition of Mg promoted metal dispersion and 
decreased the acidity of the catalyst, inhibiting the side reactions, so a better catalyst 
performance was obtained. On the other hand, it was widely reported that two types of 
Pt active sites existed in the PtSn catalyst, denoted as M1 sites and M2 sites.[48] 
Platinum directly anchored on the support surface formed multiple Pt centers i.e. M1 
sites, while Pt particles attached to the SnOx surface with a “sandwich structure” were 
assigned to the M2 sites. Generally, M1 sites were connected with the side reactions 
26 
 
such as hydrogenolysis and coking, whereas the M2 sites were responsible for the 
dehydrogenation of propane. According to the XPS results, the presence of Mg 
dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states 
of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were 
produced and better catalytic performance was realized.  
Concerning the PtSn/6Mg-SBA-15 sample with an excess of Mg loading and 
PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM introducing of Mg by impregnation method, the decrease in 
catalytic performance might be due to the changed balance metallic function and a 
lower percentage of the SnOx species. However, with the continuous addition of Mg 
and the impregnation method both led to a deterioration of the ordered pore structure 
and decreased the surface area of catalyst, which were damage to the catalytic 
performance. Table S1 shows the carbon balance for different catalysts, and good 
balances were obtained.

It could be observed that appropriate amount of Mg-incorporated in SBA-15 (1 wt.% 
~ 4 wt.%) was good to improve the catalytic stability, whereas an excess of Mg 
loading (6 wt.%) played a negative effect on stability. The stability of the catalysts 
decreased in the following sequence: PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 > PtSn/1Mg-SBA-15 > 
PtSn/4Mg-SBA-15 = PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM > PtSn/6Mg-SBA-15 = PtSn/SBA-15. 
The initial major by-product selectivity is shown in Table 4. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 
catalyst exhibited the lowest by-product selectivity. With the continuous increase of 
magnesium from 1 to 4 wt.%, the selectivity of by-products significantly decreased, 
suggesting that the side reactions were well restrained. These results were well in 
accordance with propene selectivity in Fig. 10(b). Table S2 lists some related 
literature data over the different Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Despite 
differences in catalyst compositions and reaction conditions, the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 
catalyst used in this study showed better catalytic performance than most catalysts.

The TEM images for the spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 11, all of the samples 
maintained ordered meso-porous structure after 6 h reaction. For the spent 
PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, some porous channels were blocked by the deposited 
carbonaceous species, resulting in the activity loss. The coke formed on catalyst 
surface not only covered the active sites but also plugged up the channel where the 
propene outflowed.[11] There was no obvious carbon species was observed on the 
spent Mg-modified catalysts, and most of the metallic particles were confined within 
the channels of the porous. The confinement eﬀect from the channel of the SBA-15 
29 
 
molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the 
sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane 
dehydrogenation reaction.[49]

PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15, (C) PtSn/6-MgSBA-15, and (D) PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM 
As far as catalytic deactivation was concerned, coke deposition was an inevitable 
issue. The deposited coke could be easily identified and quantified under the help of 
TG analysis. As shown in Fig. 12, there were two successive weight loss regions on 
the spent Mg-modified catalysts, representing two different coke deposits. The first 
weight loss at around 250 °C was assigned to the coke deposited on the metal surface, 
while the weight loss at high temperature (520 °C) corresponded to the coke located 
on the support.[50] It was clear that for the spent PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, most of 
carbon deposits covered the active metal and only a small proportion of them located 
the external surface of the carrier. In addition, it was important to note that the 
combustion temperature for the coke on Mg-modified catalysts shifted to the lower 
temperature, suggesting that the deposited carbon on the surface of metal became 
more active. These phenomena suggested that the presence of Mg in the catalyst 
promoted the migration of the coke deposits from the metal sites to the support. 
30 
 
Namely, with the presence of Mg, the role of tin promoter could be reﬂected more 
sufﬁciently. As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the 
size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was 
unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was 
more active and could more easily transfer to the support.[12]  
The amount of deposited coke followed the order PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 (3.9%) < 
PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15-IM (6.3%) < PtSn/6Mg-SBA-15 (8.0%) < PtSn/SBA-15 (8.4%). 
In general, olefin was the primary precursor in the mechanism of coke formation and 
the acid sites of the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst would result in the increase of carbon 
deposition.[51] Obviously, the change of Pt active sites and catalyst acidity would 
inﬂuence the coke formation. As commented before, suitable addition of magnesium 
into SBA-15 decreased the catalyst acidity, promoted the dispersion of metallic 
particles and also strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and 
support. Under the circumstances, the presence of Mg could suppress the side 
reactions. However, not only the catalyst acidity but also the high proportion of M1 
active sites on the catalyst surface was responsible for the coking reaction. Therefore, 
the more coke formation was formed since excess introduction of Mg resulted in 
decreased of these M1 active sites. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Well-ordered mesoporous structures Mg-incorporated SBA-15 materials with 1-6 
wt.% of magnesium were prepared by the one-pot synthesis. Compared with 
Mg/SBA-15-IM from the impregnation method, one-pot synthesized Mg-SBA-15 
behaved more stable mesoporous structure of SBA-15 and better Mg species 
distribution. These materials were further used as PtSn catalyst supports for propane 
dehydrogenation. It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg 
modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the 
interactions between platinum, tin species and support. Meanwhile, the presence of 
magnesium facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the 
31 
 
support surface. In addition, the existence of Mg enhanced the Sn-support interaction 
and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which would heighten the effect of tin 
promoter. While excessive Mg weakened the Sn-support interaction and decreased the 
catalytic performance. In our experiment, the PtSn catalysts with 1-4 wt.% Mg dopant 
exhibited better catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation than PtSn/SBA-15 
sample. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample with 2 wt.% Mg synthesized by one-pot 
method showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a propane conversion of 
43.0% and a propene selectivity of 99%.
