[1] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream."
[2] "As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream."
[3] "The formation rate of propylene only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 even after 120 h on stream for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3."
[4] "This supports the slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA compared with Pt(111) identified in the DFT studies."
[5] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[6] "Although DFT calculations predict slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA, its higher propylene formation rate can be attributed to its better Pt dispersion compared with 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Pt dispersion = 29%)."
[7] "The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3."
[8] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g−1Pt h−1 is presented (dash line)."
[9] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g−1Pt h−1 is presented (dash line)."
[10] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles."
[11] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehy- drogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."
[12] "The ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by influencing the energy barriers, leading to different coke accumulation patterns. It also impacts acid site conversions and graphitization, affecting overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The PDH process involves the conversion of propane to propylene. Hydrogen cofeeding modifies the reaction pathway, potentially reducing the formation of coke by altering the energy barriers involved in the dehydrogenation process. This modification can lead to more efficient use of the catalyst and improved selectivity towards the desired product, propylene.

3. The process efficiency is enhanced by hydrogen cofeeding as it prevents the accumulation of coke, which is a common issue in PDH processes. Coke formation is a result of unwanted side reactions, and by controlling these reactions through hydrogen cofeeding, the catalyst's lifetime is extended, leading to higher productivity.

4. The performance of the catalyst is improved by hydrogen cofeeding as it reduces the formation of coke, allowing for better selectivity towards propylene. This results in a more stable catalyst, which can operate for longer periods without deactivation, contributing to a more efficient and cost-effective process.

5. The coke resistance of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is demonstrated by its ability to maintain a high propylene formation rate over time, even in the presence of hydrogen cofeeding. This is attributed to the catalyst's unique structure and the reduced dehydrogenation barriers associated with coke formation.

6. The enhanced propylene formation rate for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, despite the slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier, indicates an improved reaction mechanism facilitated by hydrogen cofeeding. This mechanism allows for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene, optimizing the PDH process.

7. The stability of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is quantified by its low deactivation rate, which is crucial for maintaining high productivity in the PDH process. The stability ensures that the catalyst can operate effectively over extended periods, minimizing the need for frequent replacements or regeneration.

8. The thermodynamic conversion, as indicated by the dash line in the provided data, reflects the efficiency of the PDH process. Hydrogen cofeeding contributes to a higher conversion rate, demonstrating the positive impact on the overall process.

9. The coke resistance of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is further evidenced by its ability to maintain high propylene formation rates, even under hydrogen cofeeding conditions. This highlights the catalyst's effectiveness in preventing coke formation and maintaining optimal performance.

10. The consistency between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal provides insights into the catalyst's performance under hydrogen cofeeding. This information is crucial for understanding the catalyst's stability and efficiency in the PDH process.

11. Hydrogen cofeeding plays a role in mitigating the effects of coke deposition on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the catalyst's lifetime and overall process efficiency. By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain the catalyst's active surface area and promotes a more effective PDH process.

12. The increase in the ID/IG ratio for the catalysts under hydrogen cofeeding conditions indicates a modified dehydrogenation process. This modification leads to a more selective conversion of propane to propylene, enhancing the process's efficiency and effectiveness.
