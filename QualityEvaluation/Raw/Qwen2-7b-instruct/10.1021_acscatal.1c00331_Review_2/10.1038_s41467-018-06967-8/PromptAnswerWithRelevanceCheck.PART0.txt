<quotes>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reactions, requiring more than one Pt atom41. Therefore, isolated Pt atoms are expected to be a potential active center with high propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Note that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41. Xiong et al. reported that single Pt atoms on CeO2 can only promote the cleavage of CC bonds of hydrocarbons with no observed selectivity toward dehydrogenation42. Therefore, SAAs attract our attention, where the catalytically active metal is atomically dispersed in the surface layer of the more inert host metal and exists in the metallic state, distinguishing from single atoms positively charged on metal oxides26,43. Such SAAs have been widely used as a strategy for selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation of styrene, acetylene, and 1,3-butadiene26,29. Recently, Pt/Cu SAAs were suggested as an approach to coke-resistant CH activation chemistry and examined in the systems of methyl groups, methane, butane, and propane37. However, no stable SAA under reducing environment at high temperatures (>400 C) has been reported so far. This raises the question whether SAAs are capable of breaking the restriction of the scaling relationship for PtM alloys and catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures stably.</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b).</p>
<p>Note that our convergence test suggests Pt/Cu (111) surface model can well describe Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles which are larger than 2.1 nm in diameter (Pt/Cu404, Supplemen- tary Figure 2).</p>
<p>Similar behavior has also been observed for single Pt atom over Cu(100) and Cu(211) surfaces (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<p>Similar behavior has also been observed for single Pt atom over Cu(100) and Cu(211) surfaces (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<p>The TPSR of PD scrambling experiment indicates similar CH activation ability between Pt/Ag SAA and Pt/Cu SAA (Supplementary Figure 20a).</p>
<p>However, under reaction conditions, the propane conversion for Pt/Ag SAA is only 32% at 600 C, which is lower than 41% for Pt/Cu SAA, consistent with the DFT predicted trends (Supplemen- tary Figure 20b and Supplementary Table 6).</p>
<p>When the reaction temperature was raised to 600 C, the sintering of copper nanoparticles was obvious (Supplementary Figure 33), which may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 during the dehydrogenation reaction at 600 C.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is worth noting that the target propylene as coke precursor can partly transform into carbon deposits with the help of Cu, which accounts for the formation of coke on Pt/Cu SAA.</p>
<p>The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56.</p>
<p>The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile.</p>
<p>We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support.</p>
<p>While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57.</p>
<p>Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehy- drogenation41, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected.</p>
<p>The TPO profile of Pt/Cu SAA is very close to that of Cu nanoparticles, verifying its excellent anti-coke capability.</p>
<p>The TPSR of PD scrambling over 0.3Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 and 10Cu/Al2O3 for PD scrambling shows different activation temperatures, indicating different intrinsic dehydrogenation abilities.</p>
<p>The catalytic performances of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 520 C show that 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 has significantly improved performance compared to 0.1Pt/Al2O3.</p>
<p>During the 12 h stability test at 520 C, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 demonstrates excellent stability, retaining its high activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>The morphology of γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Cu SAA shows Pt atoms individually dispersed on Cu(111) facets.</p>
<p>The structure of Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina was confirmed by CO-DRIFTS, AC-HAADF-STEM images and EXAFS spectra.</p>
<p>Single Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles are repeatedly observed in different regions of the reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, and no clusters or nanoparticles of Pt on γ-alumina are found.</p>
<p>The lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA is 0.21 nm, which is in good consistency with the lattice spacing of Cu(111), indicating dilute dispersion of Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The initial activity of the catalysts with fixed amount of Pt (0.1 wt%) but various contents of Cu shows that the initial conversion of propane increases until the content of Cu reaches 6.7 wt% and then remains unchanged with the amount of Cu further increasing to 15 wt%.</p>
<p>The initial activity correlates linearly with the Pt content for catalysts with fixed amount of Cu (10 wt%) and progressively decreasing amount of Pt, suggesting the formation of Pt/Cu SAA.</p>
<p>CO adsorption behavior on the catalysts with fixed amount of Pt but increasing Cu contents is highly consistent with the initial activities of the catalysts as the Cu content increases.</p>
<p>The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, indicating the intrinsic activity of Pt/Cu SAA is slightly lower than that of Pt nanoparticles but much higher than Cu nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The specific activity at 520 C for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 0.72 s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.56 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, showing that 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 has a slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier compared to 0.1Pt/Al2O3.</p>
<p>During the 12 h PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 drops significantly, while it remains stable for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, demonstrating the improved stability and performance of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g<sup>-1</sup>Pt h<sup>-1</sup> for the spent catalysts shows that the structure of Pt/Cu SAA is maintained during the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>The HAADF-STEM images of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 after successive oxidation-reduction cycles confirm its good cycle stability.</p>
<p>The EXAFS information for the regenerated 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is lacking, which precludes a definitive conclusion on the sintering of partial platinum.</p>
<p>The Raman spectra of the spent catalysts show an increase in the ID/IG ratio, indicating an increase in the dehydrogenation degree of the coke.</p>
<p>The TPO profiles of the spent catalysts reveal the presence of two types of coke, with the main low-temperature peaks attributed to the combustion of soft coke formed on the metal.</p>
<p>The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of propylene indicates that the interaction between propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than for Pt nanoparticles, which helps in minimizing carbon deposits on the active Pt sites and maintaining activity during the reaction.</p>
<p>Our study highlights the transferability from the DFT calculations to the realistic catalytic system and implies isolated Pt atoms in the metallic state as promising active sites for alkane dehydrogenation at high temperatures.</p>
<p>All the total energy self-consistent calculations were carried out in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) using the generalized gradient approximation with the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals corrections (BEEF-vdW).</p>
<p>The metal loading is based on the weight ratio between metal and γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>The DRIFTS measurements were carried out for catalysts with fixed amount of Pt (0.1 wt%) and different content of Cu. The fresh and spent catalysts were heated to 600 C in a flow of 50 mL min<sup>-1</sup> of 20 vol% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar.</p>
<p>The HAADF-STEM images were collected using a Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 (FEI) 200 kV aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-STEM).</p>
<p>The Pt L3 edge XAS spectra were collected at the 10 ID beam line at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National laboratory.</p>

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This leads to changes in the overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen in the PDH process can reduce the formation of coke by minimizing the interaction between reactants and the catalyst surface. This helps in maintaining a lower energy barrier for the dehydrogenation reaction, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst and improving the reaction mechanism.

3. In the context of the PDH process, hydrogen cofeeding can lead to a reduction in the formation of unwanted byproducts like isomers and coke. This is because hydrogen acts as a scavenger, preventing the accumulation of reactive intermediates that could lead to coke formation. 

4. The process of hydrogen cofeeding also impacts the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface. By maintaining a lower energy barrier, hydrogen cofeeding ensures that the active sites remain available for the dehydrogenation reaction, minimizing the risk of deactivation due to coke accumulation.

5. Graphitization, a process involving the transformation of the catalyst surface into a graphite-like structure, can also be influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. This process typically occurs at high temperatures and can lead to the loss of active sites on the catalyst. Hydrogen cofeeding can prevent graphitization by maintaining a more stable and active surface.

6. Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process contributes to enhanced stability, improved efficiency, and a more controlled reaction mechanism. It helps in reducing coke formation, maintaining active acid sites, and minimizing the risk of graphitization, leading to an optimized process performance.

The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers. In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle. It indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reac- tants1.

Our DFT calculation shows that different from the conventional Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during PDH, displaying a quite negative difference between the desorption energy and further dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and at the same time maintaining a reasonable dehy- drogenation energy barrier for propane.

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by influencing the energy barriers, leading to different coke accumulation patterns. It also impacts acid site conversions and graphitization, affecting overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The PDH process involves the conversion of propane to propylene. Hydrogen cofeeding modifies the reaction pathway, potentially reducing the formation of coke by altering the energy barriers involved in the dehydrogenation process. This modification can lead to more efficient use of the catalyst and improved selectivity towards the desired product, propylene.

3. The process efficiency is enhanced by hydrogen cofeeding as it prevents the accumulation of coke, which is a common issue in PDH processes. Coke formation is a result of unwanted side reactions, and by controlling these reactions through hydrogen cofeeding, the catalyst's lifetime is extended, leading to higher productivity.

4. The performance of the catalyst is improved by hydrogen cofeeding as it reduces the formation of coke, allowing for better selectivity towards propylene. This results in a more stable catalyst, which can operate for longer periods without deactivation, contributing to a more efficient and cost-effective process.

5. The coke resistance of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is demonstrated by its ability to maintain a high propylene formation rate over time, even in the presence of hydrogen cofeeding. This is attributed to the catalyst's unique structure and the reduced dehydrogenation barriers associated with coke formation.

6. The enhanced propylene formation rate for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, despite the slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier, indicates an improved reaction mechanism facilitated by hydrogen cofeeding. This mechanism allows for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene, optimizing the PDH process.

7. The stability of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is quantified by its low deactivation rate, which is crucial for maintaining high productivity in the PDH process. The stability ensures that the catalyst can operate effectively over extended periods, minimizing the need for frequent replacements or regeneration.

8. The thermodynamic conversion, as indicated by the dash line in the provided data, reflects the efficiency of the PDH process. Hydrogen cofeeding contributes to a higher conversion rate, demonstrating the positive impact on the overall process.

9. The coke resistance of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is further evidenced by its ability to maintain high propylene formation rates, even under hydrogen cofeeding conditions. This highlights the catalyst's effectiveness in preventing coke formation and maintaining optimal performance.

10. The consistency between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal provides insights into the catalyst's performance under hydrogen cofeeding. This information is crucial for understanding the catalyst's stability and efficiency in the PDH process.

11. Hydrogen cofeeding plays a role in mitigating the effects of coke deposition on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the catalyst's lifetime and overall process efficiency. By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain the catalyst's active surface area and promotes a more effective PDH process.

12. The increase in the ID/IG ratio for the catalysts under hydrogen cofeeding conditions indicates a modified dehydrogenation process. This modification leads to a more selective conversion of propane to propylene, enhancing the process's efficiency and effectiveness.

[1] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream."
[2] "As contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b) and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 even after 120 h on stream."
[3] "The slightly increased particle size of the bimetallic nanoparticles on Al2O3 after reaction indicates the thermal stability of the catalyst at 520 C (Supplementary Figure 32)."
[4] "When the reaction temperature was raised to 600 C, the sintering of copper nanoparticles was obvious (Supplementary Figure 33), which may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 during the dehydrogenation reaction at 600 C."
[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen can lower energy barriers for coke formation, potentially increasing coke accumulation rates. This can lead to changes in the pattern of coke accumulation, affecting the conversion of acid sites and possibly leading to graphitization. These effects can decrease overall process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst activity and stability. The consistency between the dehydrogenation degree of coke and its burning temperature indicates that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases with the type of catalyst used, suggesting that the choice of catalyst can mitigate the negative impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共给会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。氢的存在可能会降低焦炭形成时的能量壁垒，增加焦炭积累速率。这可能导致焦炭积累模式的变化，影响酸性位点的转化，并可能引起石墨化。这些效应会降低整体工艺效率和性能，通过减少催化剂活性和稳定性。焦炭的脱氢程度与燃烧温度之间的一致性表明，随着催化剂类型的改变，深脱氢反应活性降低，这意味着选择合适的催化剂可以减轻氢共给对PDH过程的负面影响。
