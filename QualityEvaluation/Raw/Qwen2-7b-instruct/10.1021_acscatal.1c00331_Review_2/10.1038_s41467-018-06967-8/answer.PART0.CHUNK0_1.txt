The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers. In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle. It indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reac- tants1.

Researchers aim to develop catalysts that enhance both activity and selectivity. The Sabatier principle guides catalyst screening by suggesting that the ideal catalyst binds reactive intermediates with a moderate interaction strength, preventing surface poisoning or insufficient reagent activation.

Our DFT calculation shows that different from the conventional Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during PDH, displaying a quite negative difference between the desorption energy and further dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and at the same time maintaining a reasonable dehy- drogenation energy barrier for propane.

Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that unlike conventional Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA disrupts the scaling relationship in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It exhibits a notably negative disparity between the propylene desorption energy and subsequent dehydrogenation barrier, while still preserving a suitable dehydrogenation energy barrier for propane.

The interaction between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to help remain the activity during reaction.

The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles.

The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Figure 5f) show that each spent catalyst contains two types of coke due to the presence of two peaks in each profile. The small, high-temperature peaks centered around 500°C are attributed to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. Meanwhile, the primary, low-temperature peaks represent the combustion of the softer coke formed on the metal, with temperatures decreasing in the sequence of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles.
