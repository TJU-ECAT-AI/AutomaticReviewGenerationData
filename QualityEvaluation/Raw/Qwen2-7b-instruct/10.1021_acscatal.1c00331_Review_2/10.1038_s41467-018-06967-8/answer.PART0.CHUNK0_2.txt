[1] "The DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b)."
[2] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[3] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[4] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b). As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b) and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 even after 120 h on stream."
[5] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/ IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."

1. The DFT calculations indicate that the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the scaling relationship for PDH, differing from conventional Pt alloys.
2. The synthesized Pt/Cu SAA demonstrates exceptional stability, lasting for at least 120 hours at 520°C.
3. The propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is notably higher (3.2 times) than for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, while the selectivity to propylene significantly improves to 90%.
4. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst maintains high propylene formation rates with minimal deactivation over 120 hours at 520°C, contrasting with the rapid deactivation of the Pt nanoparticle catalyst.
5. The Raman spectra reveal that the dehydrogenation degree of coke follows the order: 0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3, as indicated by the increasing ID/IG ratio.

1. 动态泛函理论计算表明，Pt/Cu SAA确实打破了PDH过程中PtM合金的缩放关系，与常规的Pt合金不同。
2. 合成的Pt/Cu SAA显示出出色的稳定性，在520°C下持续至少120小时。
3. 对于0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂，丙烯生成速率比0.1Pt/Al2O3高3.2倍，同时丙烯选择性显著提高到90%，而0.1Pt/Al2O3在5.8%转化时仅为70%。
4. 在520°C下进行PDH时，0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂的丙烯生成速率保持稳定，几乎没有失活，持续120小时，而0.1Pt/Al2O3催化剂的丙烯生成速率迅速下降。
5. Raman光谱显示，随着ID/IG比率的增加，焦炭的脱氢程度按照以下顺序排列：0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3。
