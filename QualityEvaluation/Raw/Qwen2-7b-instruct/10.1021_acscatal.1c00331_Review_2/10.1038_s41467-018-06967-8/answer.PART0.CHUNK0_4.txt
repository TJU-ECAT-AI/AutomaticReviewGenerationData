[1] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream."
[2] "As contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b) and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 even after 120 h on stream."
[3] "The slightly increased particle size of the bimetallic nanoparticles on Al2O3 after reaction indicates the thermal stability of the catalyst at 520 C (Supplementary Figure 32)."
[4] "When the reaction temperature was raised to 600 C, the sintering of copper nanoparticles was obvious (Supplementary Figure 33), which may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 during the dehydrogenation reaction at 600 C."
[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen can lower energy barriers for coke formation, potentially increasing coke accumulation rates. This can lead to changes in the pattern of coke accumulation, affecting the conversion of acid sites and possibly leading to graphitization. These effects can decrease overall process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst activity and stability. The consistency between the dehydrogenation degree of coke and its burning temperature indicates that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases with the type of catalyst used, suggesting that the choice of catalyst can mitigate the negative impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共给会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。氢的存在可能会降低焦炭形成时的能量壁垒，增加焦炭积累速率。这可能导致焦炭积累模式的变化，影响酸性位点的转化，并可能引起石墨化。这些效应会降低整体工艺效率和性能，通过减少催化剂活性和稳定性。焦炭的脱氢程度与燃烧温度之间的一致性表明，随着催化剂类型的改变，深脱氢反应活性降低，这意味着选择合适的催化剂可以减轻氢共给对PDH过程的负面影响。
