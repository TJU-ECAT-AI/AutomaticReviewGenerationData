1. The global demand for propylene is growing faster than ethylene, leading to a shortage in propylene supply from steam cracking processes.

2. Adding tin to platinum (Pt) catalyst systems has been extensively studied in the paraffin dehydrogenation process, enhancing the stability and olefin selectivity of the catalyst.

3. Tin modifies the electronic and geometric properties of platinum (Pt) by forming PtSn alloys and diluting Pt sites.

4. Zinc (Zn) is commonly used as an additive and support material due to its neutral properties, high thermal stability, and robust mechanical strength.

5. Wang et al.'s research found that zinc oxide (ZnO) modifies the dispersion of platinum and the interaction between metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, contributing to high catalytic performance in terms of stability and selectivity.

6. The method of synthesizing supports significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and coke tolerance in paraffin dehydrogenation.

7. During the reaction, the formation and transformation of PtSn alloy phases were observed differently on catalysts with Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports.

8. The varying PtSn alloy phases resulted in distinct coke mobility patterns across the catalysts, significantly affecting their overall stability.
