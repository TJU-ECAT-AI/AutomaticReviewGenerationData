[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[3] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the different influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[4] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[5] "This study reveals that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, relating to the coke transport phenomena, as evidenced by XPS."

1. The global demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene, leading to a shortage in propylene supply from steam cracking processes.

2. Zinc is utilized as an additive and support material because of its neutral properties, high thermal stability, and robust mechanical strength.

3. The changes and transformations of the PtSn alloy phases were visibly tracked during the reaction process across both catalyst types. The behavior of the PtSn alloy phases varied significantly based on the influence of the alumina and zinc aluminate supports.

4. The accumulation of coke on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst was marginally less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst. The transportation of coke from metal sites to the support on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst was more straightforward than on the PtSn/Al catalyst.

5. The stability of the PtSn/support catalyst system is contingent upon the type of PtSn alloy. This fact is substantiated by XPS studies, highlighting the importance of coke transport dynamics in influencing catalyst stability.

1. 全球丙烯需求的增长速度超过了乙烯，导致蒸汽裂解过程中丙烯供应不足。

2. 锌被用作添加剂和支撑材料，因为它具有中性特性、高热稳定性和高强度机械性能。

3. 在两种催化剂类型上，可以明显观察到PtSn合金相的变化和转化过程。这两种支持材料对PtSn合金行为的影响显著不同。

4. PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上的焦炭积累量略少于PtSn/Al催化剂。在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上，从金属点向支撑的焦炭运输比在PtSn/Al催化剂上更为容易。

5. PtSn/support催化剂系统的稳定性依赖于PtSn合金的类型。这一点通过XPS研究得到了证实，强调了焦炭运输动力学在影响催化剂稳定性方面的重要性。
