[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[3] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[4] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the coke generation."
[5] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The global demand for propylene is outpacing ethylene production, leading to a shortage in propylene supply from steam cracking processes.
2. Zinc is utilized as an additive and support due to its neutral properties, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength.
3. Wang et al. found that zinc oxide modifies the dispersion of platinum and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, enhancing its stability and selectivity.
4. The incorporation of tin as a promoter significantly reduces coke formation.
5. The accumulation of coke on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst was lower compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of coke from metallic sites to the support was more efficient on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst.

1. 全球丙烯需求的增长速度超过了乙烯，导致蒸汽裂解过程中丙烯供应不足。
2. 锌因其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度而被用作添加剂和支撑材料。
3. 王等人发现锌氧化物可以改善铂和支持物在PtSn催化剂中的分散性，从而提高其稳定性和选择性。
4. 添加锡作为促进剂显著减少了焦炭的生成。
5. PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上的焦炭积累量低于PtSn/Al催化剂，且从金属位点到支撑的焦炭运输效率在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上更高。
