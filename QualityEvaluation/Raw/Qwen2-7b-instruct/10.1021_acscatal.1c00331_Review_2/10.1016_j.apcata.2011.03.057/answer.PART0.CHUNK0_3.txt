[1] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[2] "Coke located on the supports resulted in the attenuation of Al and SnS signals; however, coke located on metallic sites led to the attenuation of the Pt and Snal(0) signal."
[3] "Consequently, the bond strength between Pt and coke precursors in the PtSn alloy weakens and results in the high mobility of coke."

1. The amount of coke formed on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst was less compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst. The coke could move more easily from metallic sites to the support on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst, indicating a faster transport mechanism.
2. The presence of coke on the support diminished the signals of aluminum and tin sulfide (SnS), whereas coke on the metallic sites attenuated the signals of platinum (Pt) and tin in its zero-valence state (Snal(0)).
3. The strong electron transfer from tin (Sn) to the d-orbital of platinum (Pt) in the PtSn alloy makes the bond between Pt and coke precursors weaker. This leads to enhanced mobility of coke, as the PtSn alloy facilitates easier transport of coke compared to other PtSn alloys.

1. PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上的焦炭积累量少于PtSn/Al催化剂，焦炭从金属位点向支持物的传输在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上比在PtSn/Al催化剂上更容易。
2. 支持物上的焦炭导致铝和SnS信号减弱，而金属位点上的焦炭导致Pt和Snal(0)信号衰减。
3. PtSn合金中，Sn向Pt的d轨道的强电子转移使Pt与焦炭前体之间的键变弱，导致焦炭的高流动性。这使得PtSn合金比其他PtSn合金更有利于焦炭的运输。
