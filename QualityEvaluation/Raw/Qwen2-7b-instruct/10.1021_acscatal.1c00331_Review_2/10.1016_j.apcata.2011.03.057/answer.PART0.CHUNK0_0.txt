<quotes>
[1] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The coke buildup on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst was slightly less than on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and coke transport from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO was more straightforward than on the PtSn/Al catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上的焦炭积累略少于PtSn/Al催化剂，从金属位点到支持的焦炭运输在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上比在PtSn/Al催化剂上更容易。

[1] "This study reveals that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, relating to the coke transport phenomena, as evidenced by XPS."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This research shows that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst is influenced by the type of PtSn alloy, which relates to the coke transport processes, as demonstrated by XPS analysis.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这项研究揭示了PtSn/support催化剂的稳定性取决于PtSn合金的类型，这与焦炭运输现象有关，正如通过XPS分析所证实的那样。
