[1] "Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion."
[2] "Compared with our previous work (catalyst activated by reduction for 1h at 600C in H2), the optimized activation conditions developed in the current work lead to a sevenfold decrease in the deactivation constant."

The introduction of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process might lead to slower deactivation and a longer lifetime of the catalyst, albeit with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion. The optimized activation conditions in this research, involving longer reduction times at higher temperatures, resulted in a significant decrease in the deactivation constant, up to seven times lower compared to previous methods.

引入氢气在丙烷脱氢过程中可能会导致催化剂的降解速度变慢和使用寿命延长，尽管这会牺牲部分平衡转化率。本研究中优化的激活条件，通过延长在较高温度下的还原时间，导致了催化剂降解常数显著降低，最高可达七倍之多，相较于以往的方法。
