[1] "Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion."
[2] "The specific activities were calculated using the initial activities shown in af."
[3] "The specific activities were amongst the highest, at the same time that the deactivation rate was amongst the lowest."
[4] "It should be noted that, due to the complexity of the structures of the PtSn clusters, the models proposed in this Figure could be over simplified."
[5] "The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite is also reflected by comparison of the initial reactivity for propane dehydrogenation with results reported in the literature."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process might lead to slower deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime, albeit with a trade-off in equilibrium conversion. The specific activities of the catalyst, calculated based on the initial activities, were the highest among the samples, coinciding with the lowest deactivation rates. It's important to acknowledge that the models proposed in the figure might oversimplify the complexity of the PtSn clusters' structures. The high initial activity and stability of the Pt species, confined within the 10R channels of MFI zeolite, as compared to literature-reported results, highlights the catalyst's superior performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The deactivation constant for the various K-PtSn@MFI catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600C was calculated based on the data presented in figures 7a-f. The formula used for this calculation was: ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial], where Xfinal and Xinitial are the final and initial propane conversions, respectively, T is the lifetime of the catalyst measured in the catalytic test and kd is the deactivation constant. The errors in the initial specific activities and deactivation constants are within 6 and 12%, respectively, for all the samples.
