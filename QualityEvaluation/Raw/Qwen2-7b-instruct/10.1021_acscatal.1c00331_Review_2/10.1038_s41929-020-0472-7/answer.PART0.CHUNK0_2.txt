The introduction of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process might lead to slower deactivation and a longer lifetime of the catalyst, albeit with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion. The specific activities of the catalyst, calculated using the initial activities, were found to be amongst the highest, coinciding with the lowest deactivation rate.
