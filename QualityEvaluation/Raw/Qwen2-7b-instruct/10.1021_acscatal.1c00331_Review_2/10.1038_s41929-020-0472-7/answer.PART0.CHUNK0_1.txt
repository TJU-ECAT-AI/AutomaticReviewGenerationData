The introduction of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation process might lead to slower deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime, albeit with a trade-off in equilibrium conversion. The specific activities of the catalyst, calculated based on the initial activities, were the highest among the samples, coinciding with the lowest deactivation rates. It's important to acknowledge that the models proposed in the figure might oversimplify the complexity of the PtSn clusters' structures. The high initial activity and stability of the Pt species, confined within the 10R channels of MFI zeolite, as compared to literature-reported results, highlights the catalyst's superior performance in propane dehydrogenation.

引入氢气可能会导致脱丙烷化过程中的催化剂降解更慢和使用寿命更长，尽管这会牺牲平衡转化率。根据初始活性计算得到的特定活性在所有样品中最高，并且与最低的降解速率相匹配。需要注意的是，图中提出的模型可能过分简化了PtSn簇结构的复杂性。将Pt物种限制在MFI沸石的10R通道内的良好性能，在与文献报告的结果进行比较时，也反映了催化剂在脱丙烷化反应中的出色表现。
