The deactivation constant for the various K-PtSn@MFI catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600C was calculated based on the data presented in figures 7a-f. The formula used for this calculation was: ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial], where Xfinal and Xinitial are the final and initial propane conversions, respectively, T is the lifetime of the catalyst measured in the catalytic test and kd is the deactivation constant. The errors in the initial specific activities and deactivation constants are within 6 and 12%, respectively, for all the samples. The specific activities were calculated using the initial activities shown in figures 7a-f.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，不同K-PtSn@MFI催化剂在600°C下的失活常数是根据af图中呈现的数据计算得出。计算公式为：ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial]，其中Xfinal和Xinitial分别为最终和初始丙烷转化率，T是催化剂在催化测试中的寿命，kd为失活常数。所有样本的初始特定活动和失活常数误差分别为6%和12%。初始活动是使用af图中的数据进行计算的。
