[1] "The kinetic behavior of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been studied extensively over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "Hydrogen cofeeding has been shown to significantly influence the coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms."
[3] "This effect is particularly pronounced due to its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization."
[4] "The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are substantial."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, influencing coke accumulation patterns, affecting acid site conversions, and impacting graphitization. These effects have significant implications on the overall process efficiency and performance.
