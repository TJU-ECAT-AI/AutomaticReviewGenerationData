<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an industrial process used to produce propylene. Hydrogen cofeeding is suggested as a method to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability. Coke buildup impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting the overall process efficiency and performance. Energy barriers, acid site transformations, and graphitization are key factors in coke formation and elimination. Studying the kinetics of the process is essential for improving its optimization.
