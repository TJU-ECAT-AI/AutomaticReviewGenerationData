<quotes>
[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites can activate the C-H bond, and exhibits high catalytic performance in the PDH."
[2] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[3] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[4] "The direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

[1] "The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "It is found that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction."
[3] "The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is helpful for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
[5] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. In the PDH process, hydrogen cofeeding reduces the energy barrier for dehydrogenation reactions, leading to faster and more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This reduction in energy barrier also helps in minimizing the formation of coke, a major byproduct that can lead to catalyst deactivation. The stability of the catalyst is improved as coke accumulation is reduced, allowing for longer operational periods without the need for frequent regeneration. Acid site conversions, specifically the transformation of Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, enhance the dehydrogenation activity by providing more active sites for the reaction. The reduction in energy barriers also mitigates the graphitization process, which can occur at high temperatures during PDH, by maintaining a more controlled reaction environment. The overall process efficiency and performance are thus enhanced through the optimization of energy pathways, reduced byproduct formation, and improved catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢的共喂料通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基团转化和石墨化过程，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。在PDH过程中，氢的共喂料降低了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，导致丙烷向丙烯的更快更有效的转化。这降低了能量壁垒也有助于减少焦炭的形成，焦炭是可能导致催化剂失活的主要副产品。催化剂的稳定性得到了提高，因为焦炭积累被减少，从而无需频繁再生就可以实现更长的操作期。酸基团的转化，特别是从Brnsted酸性基团到Lewis酸性基团的转化，通过提供更多的活性位点以促进反应来增强脱氢活性。通过优化能量路径、减少副产品的形成以及提高催化剂稳定性，减少了能量壁垒也减轻了在高温下PDH过程中的石墨化过程，通过维持一个更可控的反应环境。因此，通过优化能量途径、减少副产品的形成以及提高催化剂稳定性，整体过程效率和性能得到了增强。
