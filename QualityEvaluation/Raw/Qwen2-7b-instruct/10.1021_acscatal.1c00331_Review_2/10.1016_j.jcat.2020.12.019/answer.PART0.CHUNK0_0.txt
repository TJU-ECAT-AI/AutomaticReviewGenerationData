[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites can activate the C-H bond, and exhibits high catalytic performance in the PDH."
[2] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[3] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[4] "The direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1. The Sn-Beta zeolite is capable of activating the C-H bond and demonstrates high catalytic efficiency in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, featuring the highest concentration of Lewis acid and the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, performs best in PDH, achieving a propane conversion rate of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%.

3. According to theoretical calculations, propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites resulting from the single-site Sn within the zeolite framework.

4. The direct pathway, as opposed to the indirect pathway, is more favorable for propane dehydrogenation, and open sites seem to exhibit greater reactivity than closed sites based on the degree of hydroxylation.

1. Sn-Beta沸石可以通过激活C-H键并在PDH中表现出高催化性能。

2. Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂，具有最高的Lewis酸含量和最低的Brnsted/Lewis比值，在PDH中表现最佳，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。

3. 根据理论计算，丙烷脱氢作用于Zeolite框架中单个Sn原子形成的Lewis酸位点。

4. 直接途径相比于间接途径在丙烷脱氢中更可行，开放位点似乎在不同羟基化程度下比封闭位点更具反应性。
