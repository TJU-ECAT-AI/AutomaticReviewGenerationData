[1] "The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites."
[2] "The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure."
[3] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation."
[4] "Open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1. The addition of Sn species alters the acidity of Beta zeolite, introducing Lewis acid sites.
2. The effectiveness of Sn-Beta catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation process is influenced by its acidity characteristics.
3. According to theoretical calculations, the direct pathway through primary C3H7 motifs is more efficient for propane dehydrogenation in Sn-Beta.
4. Open sites, particularly those with hydroxylation, are more reactive than closed sites in terms of propane dehydrogenation.
