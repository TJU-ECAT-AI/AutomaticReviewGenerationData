          [1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites can activate the C-H bond, and exhibits high catalytic performance in the PDH."
          [2] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [3] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [4] "The direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

          The Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites enhances the activation of the C-H bond in the PDH process, showing high catalytic performance. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acid content and the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, achieves a 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity. Theoretical studies indicate that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from single-site Sn within the zeolite framework. Kinetic analysis suggests the direct pathway is more feasible for dehydrogenation, with open sites being more reactive than closed ones based on hydroxylation levels.

          含有Lewis酸位点的Sn-Beta沸石能够促进PDH过程中C-H键的活化，表现出高的催化性能。具有最高Lewis酸含量和最低Brnsted/Lewis比的Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂，在PDH中实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。理论研究表明，丙烷脱氢作用于Zeolite框架中单个Sn原子产生的Lewis酸位点。动力学分析表明，直接途径对于脱氢更为可行，开放位点基于羟基化程度比封闭位点更具有反应性。

          [1] "The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites."
          [2] "The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure."
          [3] "According to theoretical calculations, the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

          The addition of Sn species into the zeolite structure alters the acidity properties of Beta zeolite, generating Lewis acid sites. The effectiveness of Sn-Beta catalysts is fundamentally tied to the acidity characteristics within its structure. Theoretical studies confirm that the direct pathway is more energetically favorable for dehydrogenation compared to the indirect pathway. Open sites display higher reactivity than closed ones, contingent upon the hydroxylation levels.

          将Sn物种引入沸石结构会改变Beta沸石的酸性特性，并由此产生Lewis酸位点。Sn-Beta催化剂的性能与结构内的酸性性质密切相关。理论研究表明，直接途径相对于间接途径在脱氢过程中更加有利。开放位点的反应性高于封闭位点，这取决于羟基化程度。

          [1] "The literature does not contain specific quotes related to hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, nor does it discuss the implications of these effects on process efficiency and performance."
          [2] "The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [3] "It is found that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction."
          [4] "The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is helpful for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [6] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

          There are no specific quotes addressing hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process, coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. However, it is established that the presence of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction, with the isolated Sn atoms playing a crucial role. The Lewis acid acts as the active site for dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid is responsible for the cracking process. An increased L/B ratio correlates positively with the dehydrogenation rate, enhancing the propane conversion. The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites demonstrate remarkable stability, remaining unaffected under severe reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations support the direct pathway being more energetically advantageous for dehydrogenation, with open sites exhibiting higher reactivity compared to closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation levels.

          文献中没有具体引用讨论氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢过程、焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机制、能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基团转化和石墨化方面的影响。然而，已知在Sn-Beta沸石中存在Lewis酸有助于脱氢反应，孤立的Sn原子在此过程中发挥关键作用。Lewis酸作为脱氢反应的活性中心，而Brnsted酸负责裂解过程。L/B比例的增加与脱氢速率正相关，从而提高丙烷转化率。Na-Sn-Beta沸石在严苛的反应条件下保持极高的稳定性，72小时内未出现明显的失活现象。理论计算支持直接途径在脱氢过程中更为有利，开放位点相较于封闭位点在不同程度的羟基化下显示出更高的反应性。
