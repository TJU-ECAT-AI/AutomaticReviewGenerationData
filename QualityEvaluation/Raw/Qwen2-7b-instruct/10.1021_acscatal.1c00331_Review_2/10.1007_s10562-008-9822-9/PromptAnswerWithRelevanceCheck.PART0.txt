<Answer>

<quotes>
<p>As known, the carbonaceous deposit is mainly produced by the polymerization of olefins formed during the dehydrogenation process. The polymerization is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites.</p>
<p>The coke content over PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst was 12.8%, whereas over PtSnCa(0.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst was 5.9%. This implies that the addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to catalyst could greatly reduce coke deposit.</p>
<p>In all catalysts, the TPO profiles also exhibited some differences in the temperature and shape of peaks. The combustion peak area both in low and high temperature decreased with the Ca loading.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can enhance the coke formation on metallic surfaces, as evidenced by the combustion peak areas decreasing with the addition of calcium. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the formation of coke on both metal and support sites, affecting the overall process efficiency and performance negatively. The calcium addition helps in reducing the amount of carbon deposits on catalysts, improving catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。氢的加入可能促进金属表面的焦炭形成，这可以从燃烧峰区随钙添加而降低的现象中看出。这表明氢共喂养促进了在金属和支撑位点上焦炭的形成，从而影响整个过程的效率和性能。钙的添加有助于减少催化剂上的碳沉积，提高催化剂稳定性并增加丙烯的选择性。

<quotes>
The presence of calcium in the catalysts improved the selectivity to propylene but also decreased the amount of carbon deposits on catalyst. The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity. However an excessive Ca loading caused that a large amount of oxidized tin species were reduced to metallic state, which could interact with Pt to produce high percentage of PtSn alloy, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.
</quotes>

Answer: The addition of calcium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts enhances propylene selectivity and reduces carbon deposition. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition provides optimal catalytic activity, while higher calcium loads lead to the formation of PtSn alloy, which diminishes activity.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
添加钙到PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中可以提高丙烯选择性并减少碳沉积。在0.9 wt%的钙添加下，可以获得最佳的催化活性，而更高的钙负载会导致PtSn合金的形成，从而降低活性。

<quotes>
<p>Propylene is one of the most important materials in the modern petrochemical industry, largely used as an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, refinery feed stock to improve the octane rating of gasoline.</p>
<p>In the case of propane dehydrogenation process, side reactions like hydrogenolysis, cracking and coke formation compete with dehydrogenation reaction. Propylene is the major product of the reaction, whereas methane, ethane and ethylene are by-products.</p>
<p>The addition of calcium could not only modify the characteristics and properties of both acid and metal function but also suppress coke deposits on the catalyst.</p>
<p>The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 prompted catalytic activity. However, the incorporation of excessive Ca resulted in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Coke on some used catalysts was characterized by TPO and thermogravimetric experiments. Thermogravimetric analysis can be used for quantitative analysis of coke.</p>
<p>Our TPR results showed that part of Sn species could be reduced to metallic Sn, which may be alloyed with platinum. The formation of PtSn alloy resulted in an increase in the electronic density of surface Pt, which would weaken the strength of the Pt(C=C) bond and repulse the coke precursors.</p>

[1] "The goal here is to investigate the modifying effect of Ca addition to ZSM-5 supported PtSn catalysts on the physicochemical characteristics and the catalytic behavior in the propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "In terms of location of coke deposits on catalyst surface, results of TPO analysis seem to be of special interest."
[3] "The combustion peak area both in low and high temperature decreased with the Ca loading. This suggests that Ca addition to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst inhibits the formation of both types of coke."

The presence of calcium in the catalysts improved the selectivity to propylene but also decreased the amount of carbon deposits on catalyst. The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity. However, an excessive Ca loading caused a large amount of oxidized tin species to be reduced to metallic state, which could interact with Pt to produce high percentage of PtSn alloy, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. TPO analysis has shown that two different types of coke were deposited on the ZSM-5: a fraction deposited on the metallic surface, and another one adsorbed on the support. The Ca addition to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst inhibited the formation of both types of coke.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
钙的存在提高了催化剂对丙烯的选择性，但减少了催化剂上的碳沉积量。向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中添加0.9 wt%的钙表现出更好的催化活性。然而，过高的钙负载导致大量氧化锡物种被还原为金属状态，这可能与Pt相互作用产生高比例的PtSn合金，从而降低催化活性。TPO分析表明，在ZSM-5上沉积了两种不同类型的焦炭：一部分沉积在金属表面，另一部分吸附在支撑物上。向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中添加钙抑制了两种类型焦炭的形成。
