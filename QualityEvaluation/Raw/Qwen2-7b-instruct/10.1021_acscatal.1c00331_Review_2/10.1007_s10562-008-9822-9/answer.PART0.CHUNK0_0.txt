<p>As known, the carbonaceous deposit is mainly produced by the polymerization of olefins formed during the dehydrogenation process. The polymerization is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites.</p>
<p>The coke content over PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst was 12.8%, whereas over PtSnCa(0.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst was 5.9%. This implies that the addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to catalyst could greatly reduce coke deposit.</p>
<p>In all catalysts, the TPO profiles also exhibited some differences in the temperature and shape of peaks. The combustion peak area both in low and high temperature decreased with the Ca loading.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can enhance the coke formation on metallic surfaces, as evidenced by the combustion peak areas decreasing with the addition of calcium. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding facilitates the formation of coke on both metal and support sites, affecting the overall process efficiency and performance negatively. The calcium addition helps in reducing the amount of carbon deposits on catalysts, improving catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。氢的加入可能促进金属表面的焦炭形成，这可以从燃烧峰区随钙添加而降低的现象中看出。这表明氢共喂养促进了在金属和支撑位点上焦炭的形成，从而影响整个过程的效率和性能。钙的添加有助于减少催化剂上的碳沉积，提高催化剂稳定性并增加丙烯的选择性。
