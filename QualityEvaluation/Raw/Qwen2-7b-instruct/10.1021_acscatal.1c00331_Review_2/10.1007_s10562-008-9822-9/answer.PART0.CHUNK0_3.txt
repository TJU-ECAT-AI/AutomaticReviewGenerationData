[1] "The goal here is to investigate the modifying effect of Ca addition to ZSM-5 supported PtSn catalysts on the physicochemical characteristics and the catalytic behavior in the propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "In terms of location of coke deposits on catalyst surface, results of TPO analysis seem to be of special interest."
[3] "The combustion peak area both in low and high temperature decreased with the Ca loading. This suggests that Ca addition to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst inhibits the formation of both types of coke."

The presence of calcium in the catalysts improved the selectivity to propylene but also decreased the amount of carbon deposits on catalyst. The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity. However, an excessive Ca loading caused a large amount of oxidized tin species to be reduced to metallic state, which could interact with Pt to produce high percentage of PtSn alloy, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. TPO analysis has shown that two different types of coke were deposited on the ZSM-5: a fraction deposited on the metallic surface, and another one adsorbed on the support. The Ca addition to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst inhibited the formation of both types of coke.

钙的存在提高了催化剂对丙烯的选择性，但减少了催化剂上的碳沉积量。向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中添加0.9 wt%的钙表现出更好的催化活性。然而，过高的钙负载导致大量氧化锡物种被还原为金属状态，这可能与Pt相互作用产生高比例的PtSn合金，从而降低催化活性。TPO分析表明，在ZSM-5上沉积了两种不同类型的焦炭：一部分沉积在金属表面，另一部分吸附在支撑物上。向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中添加钙抑制了两种类型焦炭的形成。
