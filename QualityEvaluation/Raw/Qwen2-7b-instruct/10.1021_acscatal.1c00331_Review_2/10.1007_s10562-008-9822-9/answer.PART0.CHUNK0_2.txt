<p>Propylene is one of the most important materials in the modern petrochemical industry, largely used as an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, refinery feed stock to improve the octane rating of gasoline.</p>
<p>In the case of propane dehydrogenation process, side reactions like hydrogenolysis, cracking and coke formation compete with dehydrogenation reaction. Propylene is the major product of the reaction, whereas methane, ethane and ethylene are by-products.</p>
<p>The addition of calcium could not only modify the characteristics and properties of both acid and metal function but also suppress coke deposits on the catalyst.</p>
<p>The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 prompted catalytic activity. However, the incorporation of excessive Ca resulted in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Coke on some used catalysts was characterized by TPO and thermogravimetric experiments. Thermogravimetric analysis can be used for quantitative analysis of coke.</p>
<p>Our TPR results showed that part of Sn species could be reduced to metallic Sn, which may be alloyed with platinum. The formation of PtSn alloy resulted in an increase in the electronic density of surface Pt, which would weaken the strength of the Pt(C=C) bond and repulse the coke precursors.</p>

1. Propylene plays a crucial role in various industries, including polypropylene production, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, and refining gasoline octane ratings.
2. Side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and coke formation occur alongside the primary dehydrogenation process. Propylene is the main product, while methane, ethane, and ethylene are by-products.
3. Calcium addition modifies the properties of the catalyst, enhancing its selectivity towards propylene while suppressing coke formation.
4. Incorporating 0.9 wt% of calcium into the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst improves its catalytic activity. However, excessive calcium leads to catalyst deactivation.
5. Thermogravimetric analysis quantitatively measures coke deposition on the catalyst.
6. The formation of a PtSn alloy through the reduction of tin species to metallic state increases the electronic density of the Pt surface, weakening the Pt-C bond and repelling coke precursors.

1. 丙烯在聚丙烯生产、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸、甘油、异丙醇和汽油辛烷值改进等领域扮演着重要角色。
2. 烯烃脱氢过程中的副反应包括氢解、裂化和焦炭形成。丙烯是主要产物，而甲烷、乙烷和乙烯是副产品。
3. 钙的添加能够修改催化剂的特性和性能，提高其丙烯选择性并抑制焦炭沉积。
4. 将0.9 wt%的钙添加到PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂中可以提升其催化活性。然而，过量的钙会导致催化剂失活。
5. 热重分析可用于定量测量催化剂上的焦炭沉积量。
6. 通过将锡物种还原为金属状态形成PtSn合金增加了Pt表面的电子密度，削弱了Pt-C键并排斥焦炭前体。
