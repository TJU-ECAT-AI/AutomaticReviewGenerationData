The presence of calcium in the catalysts improved the selectivity to propylene but also decreased the amount of carbon deposits on catalyst. The addition of 0.9 wt% Ca to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity. However an excessive Ca loading caused that a large amount of oxidized tin species were reduced to metallic state, which could interact with Pt to produce high percentage of PtSn alloy, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.

Answer: The addition of calcium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts enhances propylene selectivity and reduces carbon deposition. A 0.9 wt% calcium addition provides optimal catalytic activity, while higher calcium loads lead to the formation of PtSn alloy, which diminishes activity.
