[1] "The post-transition metal alloys showed the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species."
[2] "At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affected binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered."
[3] "At higher alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions."
[4] "Selectivity was found to be dependent on alloy coverage."
[5] "When  of surface sites were occupied by post-transition metal atoms, Pb, Bi, and Tl were predicted to be more selective than Pt or even than PtSn."
[6] "While alloys with Sb, In, and Hg showed less promise than PtSn at low coverage, at  ML coverage they were predicted to have higher selectivity."

1. Post-transition metal alloys demonstrated the strongest capability to reduce the binding energy of carbon-based substances.
2. At low coverage, these elements primarily altered binding energies via electronic effects without changing the geometries.
3. At higher coverage, geometric impacts became crucial in influencing surface-adsorbate interactions.
4. Selectivity was determined by the alloy coverage.
5. At a low coverage of alloy sites, lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), and thallium (Tl) were forecasted to exhibit higher selectivity compared to platinum (Pt) or even platinum tin (PtSn).
6. Although antimony (Sb), indium (In), and mercury (Hg) showed less potential than PtSn at low coverage, they were predicted to have higher selectivity at a higher coverage.

1. 过渡后金属合金显示出最强的能力来降低碳基物质的结合能。
2. 在低覆盖度下，这些元素主要通过电子效应改变结合能，而不改变几何结构。
3. 在高覆盖度下，几何效应在影响表面吸附剂相互作用中扮演了重要角色。
4. 选择性依赖于合金覆盖度。
5. 在低覆盖度时，铅（Pb）、铋（Bi）和铊（Tl）被预测比铂（Pt）或甚至铂锡（PtSn）具有更高的选择性。
6. 虽然锑（Sb）、铟（In）和汞（Hg）在低覆盖度下的潜力小于PtSn，但在高覆盖度时，它们被预测具有更高的选择性。
