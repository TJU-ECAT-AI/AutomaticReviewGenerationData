[1] "The post-transition metal alloys showed the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species. At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affected binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. At higher alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions."
[2] "Selectivity was found to be dependent on alloy coverage. When  of surface sites were occupied by post-transition metal atoms, Pb, Bi, and Tl were predicted to be more selective than Pt or even than PtSn."
[3] "However, this work predicts that PtSn is the prevailing industrial catalyst because it shows good performance for both alloy ratios, an important property when synthetic control over precise alloy ratio in each metal particle is difficult or impractical to attain."

1. Post-transition metal alloys demonstrated the strongest capability to reduce the binding energy of carbon-based species. At a low alloy coverage (ML), these elements impacted binding energies mainly through electronic effects, maintaining unchanged binding geometries. At a higher alloy coverage (ML), geometric influences became crucial in the interactions between surfaces and adsorbates.

2. Selectivity was identified as being contingent upon alloy coverage. When a fraction of surface sites were occupied by post-transition metal atoms, lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), and thallium (Tl) were forecasted to exhibit superior selectivity compared to pure platinum (Pt) or even platinum-selenium (PtSn).

3. This research suggests that platinum-selenium (PtSn) is the prevailing industrial catalyst. It maintains satisfactory performance across various alloy proportions, an advantageous characteristic when achieving precise alloy ratios in individual metal particles becomes challenging or unfeasible.

1. 后过渡金属合金在降低碳基物种的结合能方面表现出最强的能力。在低合金覆盖度（ML）下，这些元素主要通过电子效应影响结合能，保持了不变的结合几何形状。在高合金覆盖度（ML）下，表面和吸附剂之间的相互作用变得重要起来。

2. 选择性被发现依赖于合金覆盖度。当表面的一小部分被后过渡金属原子占据时，铅（Pb）、铋（Bi）和铊（Tl）预测比纯铂（Pt）或甚至铂硒（PtSn）更具有选择性。

3. 本研究预测，铂硒（PtSn）是占主导地位的工业催化剂。它在不同合金比例下都表现良好，这是一个优势特性，尤其是在实现单个金属粒子中精确合金比例时变得困难或不切实际的情况下。
