<p>The post-transition metal alloys showed the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species. At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affected binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. At higher alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions.</p>

The post-transition metal alloys are effective in reducing the binding energy of carbon species, especially at low alloy coverages. Their impact is mainly electronic, with minimal alteration to binding geometries. At higher coverages, geometric effects become significant in influencing surface-adsorbate interactions.

后过渡金属合金在降低碳物种的结合能方面非常有效，尤其是在低合金覆盖度下。其影响主要为电子性质，对结合几何结构的影响较小。在较高覆盖率时，几何效应开始在表面-吸附剂相互作用中扮演重要角色。
