<p>The effects of alloying platinum with transition and post-transition metals on the kinetics and thermodynamics of dehydrogenation and coke formation pathways during light alkane dehydrogenation have been studied using density functional theory.</p>
<p>Supported Pt catalysts are known to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation, but the high temperatures required by these endothermic reactions leads to significant coke formation and deactivation. A limited set of Pt alloys have been investigated experimentally previously, with decreases coke formation and deactivation.</p>
<p>Using periodic density functional theory we have investigated a wider range of Pt-alloy compositions, including metals from Groups 7-15, to better understand the reduction in surface carbon formation and enhanced selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation. The post-transition metal alloys show the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species.</p>
<p>At low alloy coverage (ML), these elements affect binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. A scaling relation was developed between simple CHx species and the barriers for ethene reactions to predict selectivity for ethene desorption vs. dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>At higher alloy coverage (ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions. There is no global optimum alloying element. Rather, the best alloy depends on the alloy coverage.</p>
<p>PtPb and PtSb show the most promise at low and high alloy coverages respectively. However, this work predicts that PtSn is the prevailing industrial catalyst because it shows good performance for both alloy coverages, an important property when synthetic control over precise alloy ratio in each metal particle is difficult or impractical to attain.</p>

The document discusses the use of density functional theory to investigate the effects of alloying platinum with transition and post-transition metals on the dehydrogenation and coke formation pathways of light alkanes. The study aims to understand how alloying reduces surface carbon formation and improves selectivity. Post-transition metal alloys are found to decrease the binding energy of carbon species more effectively. At low alloy coverages, electronic effects dominate, while at higher coverages, geometric effects become significant. The document concludes that PtSn is the most promising industrial catalyst due to its good performance at both low and high alloy ratios, which is crucial when precise control over the alloy ratio is challenging.
