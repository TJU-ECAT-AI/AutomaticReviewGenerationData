[1] "Density functional theory was applied to determine the effects of alloying Pt with various transition and post-transition metals on the selectivity towards ethene during ethane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The post-transition metal alloys showed the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species."
[3] "At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affected binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered."
[4] "At higher alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions."
[5] "Selectivity was found to be dependent on alloy coverage."

The document explains that density functional theory is utilized to investigate how alloying platinum with various transition and post-transition metals impacts the selectivity for ethene production during ethane dehydrogenation. Post-transition metal alloys are found to notably reduce the binding energy of carbonaceous species. At low coverage (ML), electronic effects dominate, preserving binding geometries. At higher coverage (ML), geometric influences become significant. Selectivity is shown to vary with alloy coverage.

文档说明，密度泛函理论被应用来研究在乙烷裂解过程中，通过与各种过渡金属和后过渡金属合金化铂对乙炔选择性的影响。后过渡金属合金显示出显著降低碳化物物种结合能的能力。在低覆盖度（ML）下，电子效应起主导作用，保持了结合几何形状。在较高覆盖度（ML）下，几何影响变得重要。选择性发现与合金覆盖度有关。
