The document explains that density functional theory is utilized to investigate how alloying platinum with various transition and post-transition metals impacts the selectivity for ethene production during ethane dehydrogenation. Post-transition metal alloys are found to notably reduce the binding energy of carbonaceous species. At low coverage (ML), electronic effects dominate, preserving binding geometries. At higher coverage (ML), geometric influences become significant. Selectivity is shown to vary with alloy coverage.

1. Post-transition metal alloys demonstrated the strongest capability to reduce the binding energy of carbon-based species. At a low alloy coverage (ML), these elements impacted binding energies mainly through electronic effects, maintaining unchanged binding geometries. At a higher alloy coverage (ML), geometric influences became crucial in the interactions between surfaces and adsorbates.

2. Selectivity was identified as being contingent upon alloy coverage. When a fraction of surface sites were occupied by post-transition metal atoms, lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), and thallium (Tl) were forecasted to exhibit superior selectivity compared to pure platinum (Pt) or even platinum-selenium (PtSn).

3. This research suggests that platinum-selenium (PtSn) is the prevailing industrial catalyst. It maintains satisfactory performance across various alloy proportions, an advantageous characteristic when achieving precise alloy ratios in individual metal particles becomes challenging or unfeasible.

1. 后过渡金属合金在降低碳基物种的结合能方面表现出最强的能力。在低合金覆盖度（ML）下，这些元素主要通过电子效应影响结合能，保持了不变的结合几何形状。在高合金覆盖度（ML）下，表面和吸附剂之间的相互作用变得重要起来。

2. 选择性被发现依赖于合金覆盖度。当表面的一小部分被后过渡金属原子占据时，铅（Pb）、铋（Bi）和铊（Tl）预测比纯铂（Pt）或甚至铂硒（PtSn）更具有选择性。

3. 本研究预测，铂硒（PtSn）是占主导地位的工业催化剂。它在不同合金比例下都表现良好，这是一个优势特性，尤其是在实现单个金属粒子中精确合金比例时变得困难或不切实际的情况下。

<p>The effects of alloying platinum with transition and post-transition metals on the kinetics and thermodynamics of dehydrogenation and coke formation pathways during light alkane dehydrogenation have been studied using density functional theory.</p>
<p>Supported Pt catalysts are known to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation, but the high temperatures required by these endothermic reactions leads to significant coke formation and deactivation. A limited set of Pt alloys have been investigated experimentally previously, with decreases coke formation and deactivation.</p>
<p>Using periodic density functional theory we have investigated a wider range of Pt-alloy compositions, including metals from Groups 7-15, to better understand the reduction in surface carbon formation and enhanced selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation. The post-transition metal alloys show the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous species.</p>
<p>At low alloy coverage (ML), these elements affect binding energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. A scaling relation was developed between simple CHx species and the barriers for ethene reactions to predict selectivity for ethene desorption vs. dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>At higher alloy coverage (ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions. There is no global optimum alloying element. Rather, the best alloy depends on the alloy coverage.</p>
<p>PtPb and PtSb show the most promise at low and high alloy coverages respectively.

The document discusses the use of density functional theory to investigate the effects of alloying platinum with transition and post-transition metals on the dehydrogenation and coke formation pathways of light alkanes. The study aims to understand how alloying reduces surface carbon formation and improves selectivity. Post-transition metal alloys are found to decrease the binding energy of carbon species more effectively. At low alloy coverages, electronic effects dominate, while at higher coverages, geometric effects become significant. The document concludes that PtSn is the most promising industrial catalyst due to its good performance at both low and high alloy ratios, which is crucial when precise control over the alloy ratio is challenging.
