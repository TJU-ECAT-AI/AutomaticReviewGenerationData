[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[2] "Coke formation on the support mainly involves polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, hydride transfer, etc."
[3] "The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and then undergoes subsequent polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on."
[4] "Propane is firstly dissociated on the metal and the coke precursor is formed through dehydrogenation; then the soft coke is generated on the metal from the coke precursor."
[5] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process has minimal impact on coke formation on the metal surface, but it significantly affects the coke accumulation on the support by reducing its acidity. This leads to decreased coke formation on the support.
2. Coke formation on the support occurs through a series of reactions including polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer.
3. The coke precursor produced on the metal surface can migrate to the support, where it undergoes additional reactions leading to hard coke formation.
4. Propane dehydrogenation on the metal surface generates a coke precursor that is converted into soft coke on the metal surface.
5. Hydrogen reduces the acidity of the support, thereby decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites.

1. 在PDH过程中，氢共喂料对金属表面的焦炭形成影响较小，但显著影响支持面上的焦炭积累，通过降低其酸性。这导致支持面上焦炭形成的减少。
2. 支持面上的焦炭形成涉及一系列反应，包括聚合、缩合、环化和氢转移。
3. 金属表面上生成的焦炭前体可以迁移到支持上，随后进行额外的反应导致硬焦炭形成。
4. 烷烃在金属表面的脱氢作用生成焦炭前体，在金属表面上转化为软焦炭。
5. 氢通过将Brnsted酸位点转化为Lewis酸位点，降低了支持面的酸性，从而减少了支持面上焦炭形成的速率。
