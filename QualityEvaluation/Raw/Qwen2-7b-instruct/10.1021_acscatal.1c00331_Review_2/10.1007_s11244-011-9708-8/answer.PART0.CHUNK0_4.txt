[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."
[2] "Coke formation on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristics, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support."
[3] "Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."
[4] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure."
[5] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."
[6] "A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."
[7] "In addition, the propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal and increasing it on the support. This impacts catalyst stability positively by reducing coke accumulation on the metal, enhancing its lifetime, while negatively affecting the support, potentially leading to decreased performance.

2. The mechanism for coke formation on the metal involves the reaction between two strong adsorbed C3H6*, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, which is identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

3. Coke on the support is formed through polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, hydride transfer, and other reactions. The presence of hydrogen reduces the coke formation rate on the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites.

4. The propylene in the gas phase can adsorb on the support and form coke through various reactions, contributing to the overall coke formation mechanism on the support.

5. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process impacts the energy barriers by reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal, thereby extending the catalyst's lifetime. However, it may also affect the graphitization of coke, depending on the specific conditions and interactions within the catalytic system.

6. The overall process efficiency and performance are influenced by the coke formation patterns. The reduction in coke accumulation on the metal enhances the process efficiency, while the formation of coke on the support may require additional steps for removal or regeneration, impacting the overall performance.

7. The implications of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process include optimized catalyst stability, tailored coke formation patterns, and potential adjustments in the reaction mechanisms to improve process efficiency and performance.
