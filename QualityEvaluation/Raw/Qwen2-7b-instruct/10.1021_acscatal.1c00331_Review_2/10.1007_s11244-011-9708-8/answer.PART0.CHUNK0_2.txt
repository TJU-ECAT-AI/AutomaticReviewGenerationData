[1] "The addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."
[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."
[3] "A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."
[4] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by weakening the acidity of the support, which reduces the coke formation rate. Hydrogen also reduces the amount of coke formed, particularly when its concentration is increased. A portion of the coke precursor migrates to the acid site, contributing to the formation of coke on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is influenced by propane pressure, whereas the rate on the support is affected by both propane and propylene pressures. This implies that hydrogen has a minimal effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal but significantly impacts the hydrogen content in the coke.

氢共喂料在PDH过程中通过减弱支持体的酸性，减少了焦炭形成速率。氢还可以减少形成的焦炭量，特别是当其浓度增加时。一部分焦炭前体迁移到酸位，参与支持体上的焦炭形成。金属上焦炭形成的速率受丙烷压力影响，而支持体上的焦炭形成速率同时受丙烷和丙烯压力影响。这表明氢对金属上焦炭形成速率的影响较小，但显著影响焦炭中的氢含量。
