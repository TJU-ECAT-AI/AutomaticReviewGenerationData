[1] "The addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."
[2] "It is noted that for sample S4 or S5, the decrease in the total amount of coke, denoted by the areas of Peak I and Peak II, is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, as seen from Table 3."
[3] "Moreover, Peak II shifts to higher temperature, from 385.3 to 389.6 and then to 398.0 C, as the partial pressure of propylene increases (Fig. 1) and shifts to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases (Fig. 2)."
[4] "The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[5] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. When hydrogen is added to the feed, it notably suppresses coke formation, leading to a decrease in the total amount of coke produced. Specifically, in sample S4 with 1.9% hydrogen, the total coke amount reached 3.80 wt%, whereas increasing the hydrogen content to 13.6 wt% in sample S5 reduced the total coke amount to 1.44 wt%. The decrease in the total amount of coke is primarily attributed to the reduction of the area of Peak II, indicating a decrease in the coke formed on the metal. As the partial pressure of propylene increases, the peak shifts to higher temperatures, while an increase in hydrogen pressure causes the peak to shift to lower temperatures. The coke formed on the metal is softer and contains more hydrogen than that formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly influenced by propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with propane pressure. Conversely, the rate of coke formation on the support increases with propane and propylene pressures and decreases with hydrogen pressure. The kinetic analysis proposes a mechanism for coke formation, identifying the reaction between two strong adsorbed C3H6* intermediates formed by propane dehydrogenation as the key step in coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生显著影响。当向原料中添加氢时，显著抑制了焦炭形成，导致总焦炭生成量降低。具体来说，在样本S4中，含1.9%氢的条件下，总焦炭量达到了3.80 wt%，而将氢含量增加到样本S5的13.6 wt%，总焦炭量降至1.44 wt%。焦炭总量的减少主要归因于峰II面积的减少，表明金属上的焦炭生成量减少。随着丙烯分压的增加，峰向更高温度移动，而氢分压的增加导致峰向更低温度移动。金属上形成的焦炭较软且含有更多氢，而支持物上形成的焦炭则不同。金属上焦炭的生成速率受丙烯和氢分压的影响较小，但随丙烷分压增加而增加。相反，支持物上焦炭的生成速率随丙烷和丙烯分压增加而增加，并随氢分压下降而减少。基于动力学分析提出的机制，识别了由丙烷脱氢产生的两个强吸附C3H6*中间体之间的反应作为Pt表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。

2. Coke formation on the support occurs through a series of reactions including polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer.
3. The coke precursor produced on the metal surface can migrate to the support, where it undergoes additional reactions leading to hard coke formation.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by weakening the acidity of the support, which reduces the coke formation rate. Hydrogen also reduces the amount of coke formed, particularly when its concentration is increased. A portion of the coke precursor migrates to the acid site, contributing to the formation of coke on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is influenced by propane pressure, whereas the rate on the support is affected by both propane and propylene pressures. This implies that hydrogen has a minimal effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal but significantly impacts the hydrogen content in the coke.

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal and increasing it on the support. This impacts catalyst stability positively by reducing coke accumulation on the metal, enhancing its lifetime, while negatively affecting the support, potentially leading to decreased performance.

2. The mechanism for coke formation on the metal involves the reaction between two strong adsorbed C3H6*, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, which is identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

3. Coke on the support is formed through polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, hydride transfer, and other reactions. The presence of hydrogen reduces the coke formation rate on the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites.

4. The propylene in the gas phase can adsorb on the support and form coke through various reactions, contributing to the overall coke formation mechanism on the support.

5. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process impacts the energy barriers by reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal, thereby extending the catalyst's lifetime. However, it may also affect the graphitization of coke, depending on the specific conditions and interactions within the catalytic system.

6. The overall process efficiency and performance are influenced by the coke formation patterns. The reduction in coke accumulation on the metal enhances the process efficiency, while the formation of coke on the support may require additional steps for removal or regeneration, impacting the overall performance.

7. The implications of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process include optimized catalyst stability, tailored coke formation patterns, and potential adjustments in the reaction mechanisms to improve process efficiency and performance.
