[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure."
[2] "Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has greatly suppressed coke formation."
[3] "Coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[4] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis."
[5] "The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation by significantly reducing the amount of coke produced, thus improving catalyst stability and overall process efficiency.
2. The presence of hydrogen in the PDH process reduces the rate of coke formation, particularly on the metal surfaces of the catalyst, leading to better maintenance of the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
3. The accumulation of coke on the support of the catalyst is influenced by the gas composition, with an increase in propane and propylene pressures promoting coke formation, while hydrogen pressure has the opposite effect.
4. A detailed mechanism explaining how coke forms on the catalyst surface has been established, which helps in understanding the fundamental processes involved in coke formation.
5. The key step in coke formation on the Pt surfaces is the reaction between two strongly adsorbed C3H6*, which is formed through the dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 烷基化（PDH）过程中，氢的加入会显著减少焦炭生成，从而提高催化剂稳定性并提升整个过程的效率。
2. 在PDH过程中添加氢气可以大大抑制焦炭形成，特别是在金属催化剂表面，这有助于维持催化剂的活性和选择性。
3. 支持上的焦炭积累受到气体组成的影响，增加丙烷和丙烯压力会促进焦炭形成，而氢压力则有相反的效果。
4. 已经建立了一种详细的机制来解释催化剂表面上焦炭形成的过程，这对于理解焦炭形成的基本过程非常有帮助。
5. 在铂表面焦炭形成的关键步骤是通过脱氢形成的两个强烈吸附的C3H6*之间的反应。
