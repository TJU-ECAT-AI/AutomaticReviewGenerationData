The literature discusses the use of rhodium in catalytic applications, particularly its ability to enhance the low-temperature reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO) and improve the selectivity for nitrogen (N3) over ammonia (NH3). Rhodium may also contribute to better low-temperature oxidation performance. Enhanced low-temperature CO oxidation activity is reported over a Pt/Rh bimetallic catalyst compared to separate Pt and Rh monometallic catalysts, especially during the initial warm-up period. However, this synergistic activity enhancement is specific to catalysts prepared through stepwise metal impregnation, not simultaneous impregnation. The study focuses on infrared results for CO/O2 reactions over Pt-Rh/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via single-step and two-stage impregnation methods.

文献讨论了铑在催化剂应用中的使用，尤其是它促进低温氮氧化物（NO）还原的能力，并提高氮（N3）选择性而非氨（NH3）。铑也可能改善低温氧化性能。在初始暖机期间，Pt/Rh双金属催化剂比单独的铂和铑单金属催化剂表现出增强的低温CO氧化活性。然而，这种协同作用的增强仅存在于通过分步金属浸渍制备的催化剂中，而不是同时浸渍。研究重点是单步和两阶段浸渍方法制备的Pt-Rh/Al2O3催化剂上CO/O2反应的红外结果。
