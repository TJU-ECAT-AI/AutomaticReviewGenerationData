[1] "Rhodium is used because it promotes the low temperature reduction of NO and gives improved selectivity to N3, rather than NH3."
[2] "However, no attempt was made to relate differences in catalytic activity with differences in surface structure of the two types of bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "The formation of2stable platinum I ) carbonyl species for catalyst prepared by stepwise impregnation of alumina by salts of the two metals was not observed for catalysts prepared by a simultaneous impregnation method."
[4] "Rhodium-type carbonyl spectrum of the Pt-Rh(SIM) catalyst is in contrast to the platinum-like carbonyl spectrum of either the Pt-Rh (STEP) catalyst or the Pt-Rh physical mixture."

The use of rhodium in automotive catalysts is due to its ability to promote the low temperature reduction of NO, leading to better selectivity towards N2 rather than NH3. There was no attempt to correlate the catalytic activity differences with the surface structure differences between bimetallic catalysts prepared through stepwise and simultaneous impregnation methods. The stepwise impregnation method led to the formation of stable platinum carbonyl species, unlike the simultaneous impregnation method. The carbonyl spectrum of the Pt-Rh(SIM) catalyst contrasts with those of the Pt-Rh(STEP) catalyst and the physical mixture, highlighting differences in their surface properties and reactivity.

在汽车催化剂中使用铑的原因是它能够促进NO的低温还原，从而提高N2的选择性，而不是NH3。没有尝试将催化活性差异与通过分步和同时浸渍方法制备的双金属催化剂表面结构差异联系起来。分步浸渍方法导致形成稳定的铂羰基物种，而同时浸渍方法则不是这样。Pt-Rh(SIM)催化剂的羰基谱与其STEP催化剂或物理混合物的铂羰基谱不同，这突出了它们表面性质和反应性的差异。
