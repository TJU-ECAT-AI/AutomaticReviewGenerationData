[1] "Rhodium is used because it promotes the low temperature reduction of NO and gives improved selectivity to N3, rather than NH3."
[2] "However,rhodium may also improve low temperature oxidation performance."
[3] "This synergistic activity enhancement was found only for Pt/Rh catalysts prepared by stepwise metal impregnation,and not when the components were impregnated simultaneously."
[4] "Additionally,since the presence of hydrogen enhances this agglomeration effect 13 (reduces the temperature at which the dicarbonyl to linear carbonyl transition occurs),a clear link exists between reduction of rhodium and the spectroscopic changes observed."
[5] "The onset wavenumber IcnPl pig.1 Spectra of R/AzOS at (a) 303, (b) 323, (c) 373, (d) 423, (e) 473,(f) 523, (g) 573 and evacuation at (h) 573 K (1 min)."
[6] "The spectrum of the catalyst prepared by simultaneous salt impregnation and then exposed to 02 and CO was again similar to the result for the Pt-Rh (STEP) catalyst with bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl (2096,2025 cm-l) and platinum bridged species (1845 cm-') at 303 K [fig. 5(a)]."
[7] "Although spectra of catalyst at 473 K bear resemblance to those for the STEP catalysts with bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and a maximum -1 at 2125 cm , spectra recorded above this temperature were significantly different."
[8] "Several authors have reported that such a species is not active in the CO oxidation reaction 19,24,25 confirming that only chemisorbed atomic oxygen (and not incorporated oxygen which is formed in parallel to Pt2+ surface sites) is the active species."

1. Rhodium is utilized in catalysts due to its capability to promote the reduction of NO at low temperatures and enhance the selectivity towards N3 over NH3.
2. Rhodium might also contribute to improved performance in low temperature oxidation processes.
3. Enhanced activity synergy was observed only in bimetallic catalysts prepared through a stepwise metal impregnation method, not when the components were simultaneously impregnated.
4. Hydrogen's presence can accelerate the agglomeration effect, lowering the temperature at which the dicarbonyl to linear carbonyl transition occurs, linking it to the reduction of rhodium and the observed spectroscopic changes.
5. The onset wavenumber for the spectra of Rh/A1203 at various temperatures is illustrated in figure 1.
6. The spectrum of the catalyst prepared by simultaneous salt impregnation showed similarities to the Pt-Rh (STEP) catalyst, featuring rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and platinum bridged species.
7. Above 473 K, the spectra displayed differences from those of the STEP catalyst, indicating distinct behavior.
8. It has been reported by several authors that such a carbonyl species is inactive in CO oxidation reactions, affirming that only chemisorbed atomic oxygen serves as the active species, not the incorporated oxygen formed alongside Pt2+ surface sites.

1. 铑用于催化剂，因为它能够在低温下促进NO的还原，并且增强向N3而不是NH3的选择性。
2. 铑也可能提高低温氧化性能。
3. 只有通过分步金属浸渍方法制备的双金属催化剂中观察到了增强的活性协同作用，而不是同时浸渍组分的情况。
4. 氢的存在可以加速凝聚效应，降低二羰基到线性羰基转换所需的温度，这与铑的减少和观察到的光谱变化之间存在明确的联系。
5. 图1显示了在不同温度下Rh/A1203的光谱的起始波数。
6. 通过同时盐浸渍制备的催化剂的光谱与Pt-Rh (STEP) 催化剂相似，含有铑的二羰基和铂桥接物种。
7. 在473 K以上，光谱显示出与STEP催化剂的差异，表明了不同的行为。
8. 多位作者报告称，这样的羰基物种在CO氧化反应中是不活跃的，证实只有化学吸附的原子氧（而不是形成于Pt2+表面位点并行形成的氧）才是活性物种。

The literature discusses the use of rhodium in catalytic applications, particularly its ability to enhance the low-temperature reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO) and improve the selectivity for nitrogen (N3) over ammonia (NH3). Rhodium may also contribute to better low-temperature oxidation performance. Enhanced low-temperature CO oxidation activity is reported over a Pt/Rh bimetallic catalyst compared to separate Pt and Rh monometallic catalysts, especially during the initial warm-up period. However, this synergistic activity enhancement is specific to catalysts prepared through stepwise metal impregnation, not simultaneous impregnation. The study focuses on infrared results for CO/O2 reactions over Pt-Rh/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via single-step and two-stage impregnation methods.

文献讨论了铑在催化剂应用中的使用，尤其是它促进低温氮氧化物（NO）还原的能力，并提高氮（N3）选择性而非氨（NH3）。铑也可能改善低温氧化性能。在初始暖机期间，Pt/Rh双金属催化剂比单独的铂和铑单金属催化剂表现出增强的低温CO氧化活性。然而，这种协同作用的增强仅存在于通过分步金属浸渍制备的催化剂中，而不是同时浸渍。研究重点是单步和两阶段浸渍方法制备的Pt-Rh/Al2O3催化剂上CO/O2反应的红外结果。

The use of rhodium in automotive catalysts is due to its ability to promote the low temperature reduction of NO, leading to better selectivity towards N2 rather than NH3. There was no attempt to correlate the catalytic activity differences with the surface structure differences between bimetallic catalysts prepared through stepwise and simultaneous impregnation methods. The stepwise impregnation method led to the formation of stable platinum carbonyl species, unlike the simultaneous impregnation method. The carbonyl spectrum of the Pt-Rh(SIM) catalyst contrasts with those of the Pt-Rh(STEP) catalyst and the physical mixture, highlighting differences in their surface properties and reactivity.

在汽车催化剂中使用铑的原因是它能够促进NO的低温还原，从而提高N2的选择性，而不是NH3。没有尝试将催化活性差异与通过分步和同时浸渍方法制备的双金属催化剂表面结构差异联系起来。分步浸渍方法导致形成稳定的铂羰基物种，而同时浸渍方法则不是这样。Pt-Rh(SIM)催化剂的羰基谱与其STEP催化剂或物理混合物的铂羰基谱不同，这突出了它们表面性质和反应性的差异。

The document discusses the use of rhodium in catalysts, particularly for promoting low temperature reduction of NO and improving the selectivity of nitrogen trioxide (N3) production over ammonia (NH3). Rhodium might also enhance the low temperature oxidation performance. The paper reports infrared study results on CO/O2 reactions over Pt-Rh/Al2O3 catalysts prepared through single-step and two-stage impregnation methods. Oxygen removal appears insufficient to allow the re-establishment of CO absorption sites in the bridged mode. Hydrogen's presence enhances the agglomeration effect, linking it to the spectroscopic changes observed in the catalyst. Spectral analysis can determine the temperatures at which oxygen removal starts and the onset of CO oxidation. The oxygen associated with the adsorbent platinum is suggested to be incorporated rather than chemisorbed on the platinum surface. The catalyst prepared through simultaneous salt impregnation shows similar results to the one prepared via two-stage impregnation method, exhibiting bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and platinum bridged species at 303 K.

文档讨论了在催化剂中使用钯金，特别是促进低温度下NO的还原和提高氮三氧化物（N3）生成的选择性，而不是氨（NH3）。钯金也可能改善低温氧化性能。论文报告了在单步和两步浸渍方法制备的Pt-Rh/Al2O3催化剂上进行的CO/O2反应的红外研究结果。氧去除似乎不足以允许CO吸收位点的恢复。氢的存在增强了团聚效应，将其与观察到的催化效果联系起来。光谱分析可以确定氧气去除开始和CO氧化开始的温度。与吸附剂铂相关的氧气被建议是整合在铂上，而不是化学吸附。通过同时盐浸渍制备的催化剂显示出与分步浸渍方法制备的催化剂相似的结果，在303 K时表现出铑的二羰基物种和铂桥接物种的带。
