[1] "Rhodium is used because it promotes the low temperature reduction of NO and gives improved selectivity to N3, rather than NH3."
[2] "However,rhodium may also improve low temperature oxidation performance."
[3] "This synergistic activity enhancement was found only for Pt/Rh catalysts prepared by stepwise metal impregnation,and not when the components were impregnated simultaneously."
[4] "Additionally,since the presence of hydrogen enhances this agglomeration effect 13 (reduces the temperature at which the dicarbonyl to linear carbonyl transition occurs),a clear link exists between reduction of rhodium and the spectroscopic changes observed."
[5] "The onset wavenumber IcnPl pig.1 Spectra of R/AzOS at (a) 303, (b) 323, (c) 373, (d) 423, (e) 473,(f) 523, (g) 573 and evacuation at (h) 573 K (1 min)."
[6] "The spectrum of the catalyst prepared by simultaneous salt impregnation and then exposed to 02 and CO was again similar to the result for the Pt-Rh (STEP) catalyst with bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl (2096,2025 cm-l) and platinum bridged species (1845 cm-') at 303 K [fig. 5(a)]."
[7] "Although spectra of catalyst at 473 K bear resemblance to those for the STEP catalysts with bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and a maximum -1 at 2125 cm , spectra recorded above this temperature were significantly different."
[8] "Several authors have reported that such a species is not active in the CO oxidation reaction 19,24,25 confirming that only chemisorbed atomic oxygen (and not incorporated oxygen which is formed in parallel to Pt2+ surface sites) is the active species."

1. Rhodium is utilized in catalysts due to its capability to promote the reduction of NO at low temperatures and enhance the selectivity towards N3 over NH3.
2. Rhodium might also contribute to improved performance in low temperature oxidation processes.
3. Enhanced activity synergy was observed only in bimetallic catalysts prepared through a stepwise metal impregnation method, not when the components were simultaneously impregnated.
4. Hydrogen's presence can accelerate the agglomeration effect, lowering the temperature at which the dicarbonyl to linear carbonyl transition occurs, linking it to the reduction of rhodium and the observed spectroscopic changes.
5. The onset wavenumber for the spectra of Rh/A1203 at various temperatures is illustrated in figure 1.
6. The spectrum of the catalyst prepared by simultaneous salt impregnation showed similarities to the Pt-Rh (STEP) catalyst, featuring rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and platinum bridged species.
7. Above 473 K, the spectra displayed differences from those of the STEP catalyst, indicating distinct behavior.
8. It has been reported by several authors that such a carbonyl species is inactive in CO oxidation reactions, affirming that only chemisorbed atomic oxygen serves as the active species, not the incorporated oxygen formed alongside Pt2+ surface sites.

1. 铑用于催化剂，因为它能够在低温下促进NO的还原，并且增强向N3而不是NH3的选择性。
2. 铑也可能提高低温氧化性能。
3. 只有通过分步金属浸渍方法制备的双金属催化剂中观察到了增强的活性协同作用，而不是同时浸渍组分的情况。
4. 氢的存在可以加速凝聚效应，降低二羰基到线性羰基转换所需的温度，这与铑的减少和观察到的光谱变化之间存在明确的联系。
5. 图1显示了在不同温度下Rh/A1203的光谱的起始波数。
6. 通过同时盐浸渍制备的催化剂的光谱与Pt-Rh (STEP) 催化剂相似，含有铑的二羰基和铂桥接物种。
7. 在473 K以上，光谱显示出与STEP催化剂的差异，表明了不同的行为。
8. 多位作者报告称，这样的羰基物种在CO氧化反应中是不活跃的，证实只有化学吸附的原子氧（而不是形成于Pt2+表面位点并行形成的氧）才是活性物种。
