The document discusses the use of rhodium in catalysts, particularly for promoting low temperature reduction of NO and improving the selectivity of nitrogen trioxide (N3) production over ammonia (NH3). Rhodium might also enhance the low temperature oxidation performance. The paper reports infrared study results on CO/O2 reactions over Pt-Rh/Al2O3 catalysts prepared through single-step and two-stage impregnation methods. Oxygen removal appears insufficient to allow the re-establishment of CO absorption sites in the bridged mode. Hydrogen's presence enhances the agglomeration effect, linking it to the spectroscopic changes observed in the catalyst. Spectral analysis can determine the temperatures at which oxygen removal starts and the onset of CO oxidation. The oxygen associated with the adsorbent platinum is suggested to be incorporated rather than chemisorbed on the platinum surface. The catalyst prepared through simultaneous salt impregnation shows similar results to the one prepared via two-stage impregnation method, exhibiting bands due to rhodium gem-dicarbonyl and platinum bridged species at 303 K.

文档讨论了在催化剂中使用钯金，特别是促进低温度下NO的还原和提高氮三氧化物（N3）生成的选择性，而不是氨（NH3）。钯金也可能改善低温氧化性能。论文报告了在单步和两步浸渍方法制备的Pt-Rh/Al2O3催化剂上进行的CO/O2反应的红外研究结果。氧去除似乎不足以允许CO吸收位点的恢复。氢的存在增强了团聚效应，将其与观察到的催化效果联系起来。光谱分析可以确定氧气去除开始和CO氧化开始的温度。与吸附剂铂相关的氧气被建议是整合在铂上，而不是化学吸附。通过同时盐浸渍制备的催化剂显示出与分步浸渍方法制备的催化剂相似的结果，在303 K时表现出铑的二羰基物种和铂桥接物种的带。
