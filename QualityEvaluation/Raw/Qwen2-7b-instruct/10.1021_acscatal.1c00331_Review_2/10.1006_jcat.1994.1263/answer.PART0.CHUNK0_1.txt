Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
The elimination of stronger adsorption sites may be caused by preferential blocking of sites by tin or weakening of sites due to ligand effects.
However, strong adsorption sites are present on a Pt/Sn catalyst that exhibits high dehydrogenation selectivity.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures around 700 K. This is because Sn interacts with Pt to form a Pt/Sn alloy, which reduces the number of sites strongly interacting with hydrogen or carbon monoxide. The elimination of these stronger adsorption sites might be due to either preferential blocking by tin or weakening of the sites due to ligand effects. However, high dehydrogenation selectivity is achieved by Sn addition to Pt, likely because it decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles. Additionally, Sn addition inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species during ethylene adsorption studies.

添加Sn到Pt催化剂中，在约700 K的温度下增强了异丁烯形成的选择性。这是因为Sn与Pt形成Pt/Sn合金，减少了强烈与氢或一氧化碳相互作用的位点的数量。这些较强吸附位点的消除可能是由于锡的优先阻塞或由于配体效应减弱位点所致。然而，通过添加Sn到Pt，可以实现高脱氢选择性，这可能是因为它减小了表面Pt簇的大小。此外，在乙烷吸附研究中，Sn的添加抑制了高度脱氢表面物种的形成。
