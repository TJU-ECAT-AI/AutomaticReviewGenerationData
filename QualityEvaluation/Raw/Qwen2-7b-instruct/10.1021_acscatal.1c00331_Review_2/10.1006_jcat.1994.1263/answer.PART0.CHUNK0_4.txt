Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation, reduces the number of sites strongly interacting with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species. This leads to an increase in the size of surface Pt ensembles, contributing to high dehydrogenation selectivity.

添加Sn到Pt催化剂中，可以增强异丁烯形成的选择性，在接近700K的温度下。这减少了强烈与氢或一氧化碳相互作用的位点数量，并抑制了高度脱氢表面物种的形成。这导致表面Pt簇的大小增加，从而提高了脱氢选择性。
