The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures around 700 K, as per kinetic studies. Mssbauer spectroscopy reveals that Sn interacts with Pt to form a Pt/Sn alloy. Microcalorimetric analysis indicates that the inclusion of Sn decreases the number of sites strongly interacting with hydrogen or carbon monoxide. High dehydrogenation selectivity is observed on a Pt/Sn catalyst, which contains strong adsorption sites. Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption demonstrate that adding Sn impedes the creation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.

添加Sn到Pt催化剂中，在约700 K的温度下，增加了异丁烯形成的选择性，根据动力学研究。Mssbauer光谱表明Sn与Pt结合形成Pt/Sn合金。微热容量研究表明，Sn的加入减少了与氢或一氧化碳强烈相互作用的位点的数量。具有高脱氢选择性的Pt/Sn催化剂包含强吸附位点。微热容量研究显示，添加Sn抑制了高度脱氢表面物种的形成。
