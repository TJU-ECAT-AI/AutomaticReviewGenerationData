<quotes>
[1] "The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[2] "γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%."
[3] "Among these three samples, γ-Al2O3 exhibits higher activity than θ-Al2O3."
[4] "The propane conversion decreases gradually after the propane conversion reaches the highest level."
[5] "The regenerability is of vital importance for their practical applications."
[6] "Therefore, it is believed that the propane dehydrogenation takes place at the defective AlIII sites."
[7] "In the initial step, a single CH bond in propane breaks occurring through the abstraction of a proton by a surface oxygen atom, which leads to the propyl group bonding to the surface aluminum to give an AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[8] "Next, the β-hydrogen elimination from AlIVC3H7 results in the generation of H2 and propylene."

The active site for the catalytic cycle in propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 arises from the unsaturated AlIII site. γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst demonstrates the highest yield, achieving an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%. γ-Al2O3 exhibits greater activity compared to θ-Al2O3. The propane conversion rate decreases after reaching its peak. The regenerability of these catalysts is crucial for their practical use. It is hypothesized that propane dehydrogenation occurs at the defective AlIII sites. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the breaking of a CH bond in propane, followed by β-hydrogen elimination from the resulting AlIVC3H7 surface species, yielding H2 and propylene.

催化循环中的活性位点来源于Al2O3结构中的不饱和AlIII位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂显示出最高的产率，初始转化率为48%，选择性为83%。γ-Al2O3的活性高于θ-Al2O3。在达到峰值后，丙烷转化率逐渐降低。这些催化剂的再生能力对于其实际应用至关重要。推测丙烷脱氢作用发生在AlIII缺陷位点上。反应机理涉及丙烷中CH键的断裂，随后从生成的AlIVC3H7表面物种中进行β-氢消除，产生H2和丙烯。

[1] "α-Al2O3 was also investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. S6), and it shows low performance in the reaction."
[2] "Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."
[3] "Based on the results above, it can be reasonably inferred that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, which leads to the formation of the corresponding AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[4] "Therefore, a hypothesis is reasonable that the propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 occurs via the stepwise pathway."
[5] "As confirmed in our study, the AlIVC3H7 surface species can be formed at a low temperature. Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance. The coke formation at high temperatures reduces catalyst activity, necessitating a recovery process through calcination. The activation of propane occurs at the defective AlIII sites, leading to the formation of AlIVC3H7 surface species via a stepwise pathway. The β-hydrogen elimination is identified as the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process, indicating a favorable kinetic process for CH bond activation.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，对催化剂活性、稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。这直接影响到过程的整体效率和性能。高温下产生的焦炭导致催化剂活性下降，需要通过煅烧过程进行恢复。丙烷的激活发生在缺陷的AlIII位点上，通过步进路径形成AlIVC3H7表面物种。β-氢消除被确认为丙烷转化过程中的决定性步骤，表明CH键活化的动力学有利过程。

[1] "These unmodified Al2O3 catalysts are intrinsically active in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The low activity in α-Al2O3 is mainly due to its highly crystalline structure with few defective AIII sites."
[3] "Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."
[4] "The in situ IR of propane adsorbed on the Al2O3 samples was carried out in order to elucidate the propane activation and transformation mechanism."
[5] "Therefore, it is believed that the propane dehydrogenation takes place at the defective AlIII sites."
[6] "Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

1. Unmodified Al2O3 catalysts are inherently active in propane dehydrogenation.
2. Low activity in α-Al2O3 is primarily due to its crystalline structure lacking defective AIII sites.
3. Deactivation in the Al2O3 catalyst is reversible, caused by coke formation at high temperatures, and can be restored through calcination.
4. The mechanism of propane activation and transformation was elucidated through in situ IR spectroscopy.
5. Propane dehydrogenation is believed to occur at the defective AlIII sites within the Al2O3 structure.
6. Kinetic favorability of CH bond activation suggests β-hydrogen elimination is the rate-determining step in propane transformation.

[1] "This economically viable and eco-friendly material without any modification exhibits high performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The Lewis acid site arising from the defective AlIII site is the active site responsible for the catalytic cycle."
[3] "The studied Al2O3 catalysts deliver high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and their catalytic performances can be fully restored in each catalytic cycle."
[4] "As confirmed in our study, the AlIVC3H7 surface species can be formed at a low temperature. Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

The document does not provide specific details on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does discuss the use of unmodified bulk alumina as an efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, highlighting the role of the Lewis acid site in the catalytic cycle and the ability of the catalyst to deliver high propane conversion and propylene selectivity with restorable catalytic performance. It also proposes a reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over alumina, suggesting that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the process.
