[1] "This economically viable and eco-friendly material without any modification exhibits high performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The Lewis acid site arising from the defective AlIII site is the active site responsible for the catalytic cycle."
[3] "The studied Al2O3 catalysts deliver high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and their catalytic performances can be fully restored in each catalytic cycle."
[4] "As confirmed in our study, the AlIVC3H7 surface species can be formed at a low temperature. Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

The document does not provide specific details on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does discuss the use of unmodified bulk alumina as an efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, highlighting the role of the Lewis acid site in the catalytic cycle and the ability of the catalyst to deliver high propane conversion and propylene selectivity with restorable catalytic performance. It also proposes a reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over alumina, suggesting that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the process.

文档没有提供关于氢共喂养如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机理、能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化在丙烷脱氢过程中的具体细节。但是，它确实讨论了无修饰的氧化铝作为丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂的应用，强调了活性位点在催化循环中的作用，并指出催化剂能够实现高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及可恢复的催化性能。它还提出了在氧化铝上进行丙烷脱氢的反应机制，表明在该过程中，氢原子消除而不是CH键激活是决定性的步骤。
