[1] "These unmodified Al2O3 catalysts are intrinsically active in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The low activity in α-Al2O3 is mainly due to its highly crystalline structure with few defective AIII sites."
[3] "Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."
[4] "The in situ IR of propane adsorbed on the Al2O3 samples was carried out in order to elucidate the propane activation and transformation mechanism."
[5] "Therefore, it is believed that the propane dehydrogenation takes place at the defective AlIII sites."
[6] "Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

1. Unmodified Al2O3 catalysts are inherently active in propane dehydrogenation.
2. Low activity in α-Al2O3 is primarily due to its crystalline structure lacking defective AIII sites.
3. Deactivation in the Al2O3 catalyst is reversible, caused by coke formation at high temperatures, and can be restored through calcination.
4. The mechanism of propane activation and transformation was elucidated through in situ IR spectroscopy.
5. Propane dehydrogenation is believed to occur at the defective AlIII sites within the Al2O3 structure.
6. Kinetic favorability of CH bond activation suggests β-hydrogen elimination is the rate-determining step in propane transformation.

1. 未经修改的Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中具有内在活性。
2. α-Al2O3的低活性主要归因于其晶体结构中缺乏缺陷AIII位点。
3. 催化剂的失活是可逆的，由高温下的焦炭形成引起，并可通过在空气流中进行550°C的6小时煅烧过程恢复。
4. 通过原位红外光谱法对丙烷吸附在Al2O3样品上的机制进行了阐明。
5. 认为丙烷脱氢发生在Al2O3结构中的缺陷AlIII位点。
6. 动力学上有利的CH键激活表明，在丙烷转化过程中，β-氢消除是决定性的步骤。
