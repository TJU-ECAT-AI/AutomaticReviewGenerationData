[1] "α-Al2O3 was also investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. S6), and it shows low performance in the reaction."
[2] "Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."
[3] "Based on the results above, it can be reasonably inferred that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, which leads to the formation of the corresponding AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[4] "Therefore, a hypothesis is reasonable that the propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 occurs via the stepwise pathway."
[5] "As confirmed in our study, the AlIVC3H7 surface species can be formed at a low temperature. Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance. The coke formation at high temperatures reduces catalyst activity, necessitating a recovery process through calcination. The activation of propane occurs at the defective AlIII sites, leading to the formation of AlIVC3H7 surface species via a stepwise pathway. The β-hydrogen elimination is identified as the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process, indicating a favorable kinetic process for CH bond activation.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，对催化剂活性、稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。这直接影响到过程的整体效率和性能。高温下产生的焦炭导致催化剂活性下降，需要通过煅烧过程进行恢复。丙烷的激活发生在缺陷的AlIII位点上，通过步进路径形成AlIVC3H7表面物种。β-氢消除被确认为丙烷转化过程中的决定性步骤，表明CH键活化的动力学有利过程。
