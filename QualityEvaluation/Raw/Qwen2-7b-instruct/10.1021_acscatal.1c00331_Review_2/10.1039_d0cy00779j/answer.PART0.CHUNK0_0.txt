[1] "The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[2] "γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%."
[3] "Among these three samples, γ-Al2O3 exhibits higher activity than θ-Al2O3."
[4] "The propane conversion decreases gradually after the propane conversion reaches the highest level."
[5] "The regenerability is of vital importance for their practical applications."
[6] "Therefore, it is believed that the propane dehydrogenation takes place at the defective AlIII sites."
[7] "In the initial step, a single CH bond in propane breaks occurring through the abstraction of a proton by a surface oxygen atom, which leads to the propyl group bonding to the surface aluminum to give an AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[8] "Next, the β-hydrogen elimination from AlIVC3H7 results in the generation of H2 and propylene."

The active site for the catalytic cycle in propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 arises from the unsaturated AlIII site. γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst demonstrates the highest yield, achieving an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%. γ-Al2O3 exhibits greater activity compared to θ-Al2O3. The propane conversion rate decreases after reaching its peak. The regenerability of these catalysts is crucial for their practical use. It is hypothesized that propane dehydrogenation occurs at the defective AlIII sites. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the breaking of a CH bond in propane, followed by β-hydrogen elimination from the resulting AlIVC3H7 surface species, yielding H2 and propylene.

催化循环中的活性位点来源于Al2O3结构中的不饱和AlIII位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂显示出最高的产率，初始转化率为48%，选择性为83%。γ-Al2O3的活性高于θ-Al2O3。在达到峰值后，丙烷转化率逐渐降低。这些催化剂的再生能力对于其实际应用至关重要。推测丙烷脱氢作用发生在AlIII缺陷位点上。反应机理涉及丙烷中CH键的断裂，随后从生成的AlIVC3H7表面物种中进行β-氢消除，产生H2和丙烯。
