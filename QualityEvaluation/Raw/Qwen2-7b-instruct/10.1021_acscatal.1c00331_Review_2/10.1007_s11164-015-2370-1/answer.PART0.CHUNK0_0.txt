[1] "The 0.14 wt% K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst suppressed the coke formation on the 00-KPtSn significantly, but K addition at more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the coke formation."
[2] "The addition of potassium mainly reduces the formation of higher hydrocarbons, which improves the C3 = selectivity in PDH."
[3] "The blocking of the acid sites on PtSn catalyst improved both the selectivity and the stability further."
[4] "The main cause of the deactivation was due to the formation of coke."
[5] "On the other hand, K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide on the support."
[6] "The enhanced Sn oxide reduction resulted in enriching the reduced Sn metal."
[7] "The high amount K addition rather weakened the PtSn interaction similarly to PtSn catalysts with high Sn contents."
[8] "Resulting in large Pt particles, as shown in TEM images."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The addition of 0.14 wt% potassium significantly suppressed the coke formation on the 00-KPtSn catalyst, but beyond 0.49 wt%, the coke formation increased significantly.
2. Potassium addition primarily decreases the formation of higher hydrocarbons, enhancing the selectivity for C3 products in PDH.
3. Blocking the acid sites on the PtSn catalyst enhances both selectivity and stability.
4. The main cause of catalyst deactivation in this process is coke formation.
5. Potassium addition promotes the reduction of Sn oxide on the support.
6. This leads to an enrichment of reduced Sn metal.
7. High levels of potassium addition weaken the interaction between Pt and Sn, similar to catalysts with high Sn content.
8. This results in larger Pt particles, as indicated by TEM images.

1. 添加0.14 wt%的钾显著抑制了00-KPtSn催化剂上的焦炭形成，但超过0.49 wt%，焦炭形成明显增加。
2. 钾添加主要减少较高碳氢化合物的生成，增强PDH中C3产品的选择性。
3. 阻止酸位在PtSn催化剂上的作用提高了选择性和稳定性。
4. 催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭的形成。
5. 钾添加促进支持物上Sn氧化物的还原。
6. 这导致还原Sn金属的富集。
7. 高水平的钾添加削弱了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，类似于高Sn含量的催化剂。
8. 这导致较大的Pt颗粒，如TEM图像所示。
