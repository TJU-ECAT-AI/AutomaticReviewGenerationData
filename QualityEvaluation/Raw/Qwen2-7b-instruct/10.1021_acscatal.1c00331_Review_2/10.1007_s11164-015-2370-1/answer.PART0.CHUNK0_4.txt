<p>It was known that the olefinic precursors on the metal active sites migrated to the supports, which were converted to polyolefinic or polyaromatic types of coke through condensation and polymerization reactions.</p>
<p>The coke formation on the 00-KPtSn) catalyst (the Sn addition to Pt) was much lower than that on the 13-KPt catalyst (the K addition to Pt).</p>
<p>The high stability of KPtSn catalyst with low potassium content is ascribed to the suppression of the acid sites on the 00-KPtSn catalyst, while the low stability of KPtSn catalysts with high potassium contents (more than 0.49 wt%) can be due to large Pt particle sizes, as shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>Additionally, the high selectivity to C1C2 of 72-KPtSn and 96-KPtSn indicates that PtSn interaction was weakened by the potassium addition at a high content.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It minimizes higher hydrocarbon formation and coke amount by blocking acid sites on the PtSn catalysts, thus enhancing selectivity and stability. However, further potassium addition promotes the reduction of Sn oxide, enriches reduced Sn metal, and weakens the interaction between Pt and Sn, leading to large Pt particles. This results in increased cracking products and coke formation, impacting the overall process efficiency and performance negatively.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。它通过阻塞PtSn催化剂上的酸性位点来最小化高碳化合物的形成和焦炭量，从而增强选择性和稳定性。然而，进一步的钾添加促进了Sn氧化物的还原，丰富了还原的Sn金属，并削弱了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，导致大颗粒Pt的形成。这导致裂解产物和焦炭形成增加，对整体过程效率和性能产生负面影响。
