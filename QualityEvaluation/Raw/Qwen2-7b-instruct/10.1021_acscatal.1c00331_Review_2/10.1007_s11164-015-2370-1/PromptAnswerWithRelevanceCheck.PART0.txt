The addition of Sn to Pt-supported catalyst has been widely investigated in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to light olefins. The roles of Sn were proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt. The sizes of platinum ensembles were decreased by the geometric effect of Sn, which reduced hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Sn could also modify the electronic density of Pt, either by positive charge transfer from Snn? species or by the different electronic structures of PtSn alloys. The electronic modification was responsible for changes in the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates participating in the reaction.

The 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported h-Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest C3 = yield and the catalyst was stable among the other samples for PDH.

When potassium was added to the 00-KPtSn catalyst up to 0.49 wt%, both of the selectivity to the higher hydrocarbons and the coke amount were minimized to 1.01.1 % and 0.40.12 wt%, respectively. Further potassium addition rather increased the selectivity to C1C2 of 6.4 %, the selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of 4.6 % and the coke amount. 

From these experimental results, Sn addition suppressed the cracking sites on the Pt catalysts, while the potassium addition blocked the acid sites on the PtSn catalysts. The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst minimized the higher hydrocarbon formation by blocking the acid sites. On the other hand, the K addition more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the cracking products, indicating that the interaction between Pt and Sn was weakened by the K addition. The K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and the enriched Sn metal weakened the interaction between Pt and Sn similarly to the PtSn catalysts with the high amount of Sn.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts overall process efficiency and performance by modifying the selectivity towards desired products and the stability of the catalyst. The addition of tin (Sn) to the palladium (Pt) catalyst modifies the electronic and geometric properties of the Pt, decreasing the size of platinum ensembles and reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Additionally, Sn can modify the electronic density of Pt, affecting the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates involved in the reaction.

The 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported h-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates high C3 = yield and stability compared to other samples for PDH. Potassium (K) addition up to 0.49 wt% minimizes the formation of higher hydrocarbons and coke, enhancing selectivity and stability. However, beyond this point, K addition increases the formation of higher hydrocarbons and coke, weakening the interaction between Pt and Sn.

Sn addition suppresses cracking sites on the Pt catalysts, while K addition blocks acid sites on the PtSn catalysts. The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst reduces the formation of higher hydrocarbons by blocking acid sites. Conversely, excessive K addition increases cracking products, indicating a weakened Pt-Sn interaction. K addition facilitates the reduction of Sn oxide, enriching Sn metal and weakening the Pt-Sn interaction, similar to PtSn catalysts with high Sn content.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。这进而影响整体过程效率和性能，通过调整所需产品的选择性和催化剂稳定性。锡（Sn）的添加修改了钯（Pt）催化剂的电子和几何性质，减少了铂簇的尺寸并降低了氢解离和结焦反应。此外，Sn还可以修改Pt的电子密度，影响参与反应的不同吸附剂的吸附热。

质量分数为0.5%的Pt和0.75%的Sn支持的h-Al2O3催化剂在PDH中显示出高的C3 = 收率和稳定性，与其他样品相比。钾（K）添加至0.49%可以最小化较高烃类和焦炭的形成，增强选择性和稳定性。然而，超过这个点，K的添加增加了较高烃类和焦炭的形成，削弱了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用。

Sn的添加抑制了Pt催化剂上的裂解位点，而K的添加则阻止了PtSn催化剂上的酸性位点。K添加到00-KPtSn催化剂上通过阻止酸性位点来减少较高烃类的形成。相反，过量的K添加增加了裂解产物的形成，表明Pt-Sn相互作用被削弱。K添加促进了Sn氧化物的还原，富集了Sn金属，进一步削弱了Pt-Sn相互作用，类似于含高Sn含量的PtSn催化剂。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by decreasing the energy barriers for coke formation, altering the coke accumulation patterns, facilitating the conversion of acid sites, and influencing the graphitization process. These effects lead to improvements in overall process efficiency and performance by reducing coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and optimizing the selectivity towards desired products. Specifically, the addition of potassium to the PtSn catalysts decreases the acid sites, blocks the acid sites, minimizes higher hydrocarbon formation, and weakens the interaction between Pt and Sn, thus reducing coke formation and enhancing stability and selectivity.

The addition of potassium to the PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalyst significantly decreased the acid sites on the PtSn catalyst. The blocking of the acid sites on PtSn catalyst improved both the selectivity and the stability further. The main cause of the deactivation was due to the formation of coke. The coke formation came from the cracking sites on the Pt component and the acid sites. The addition of 0.15 and 0.25 wt% K to PtSn reduced the amount of coke, but further K addition rather promoted coke formation. Therefore, formation of coke by further K addition to the PtSn catalysts is not related to the acid sites, but to the cracking sites on the PtSn component.
On the other hand, K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide on the support. The enhanced Sn oxide reduction resulted in enriching the reduced Sn metal. The high amount K addition rather weakened the PtSn interaction similarly to PtSn catalysts with high Sn contents, resulting in large Pt particles, as shown in TEM images.

The addition of potassium to the PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalyst led to a decrease in acid sites, enhancing both selectivity and stability. The primary cause of deactivation was coke formation, originating from cracking sites on the Pt component and acid sites. Adding potassium up to 0.25 wt% reduced coke formation, but further addition promoted coke formation, which was associated with cracking sites rather than acid sites. Potassium also facilitated the reduction of Sn oxide, enriching reduced Sn metal, weakening the PtSn interaction, and leading to larger Pt particles.

向PtSn/h-Al2O3催化剂中添加钾导致酸性位点减少，进一步提高了选择性和稳定性。催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成，来源于Pt成分上的裂解位点和酸性位点。将钾添加至0.25 wt%可减少焦炭形成，但进一步添加则促进焦炭形成，这与裂解位点而非酸性位点相关。钾还促进了Sn氧化物的还原，增加了还原的Sn金属含量，削弱了PtSn之间的相互作用，并导致了更大的Pt颗粒。

<p>It was known that the olefinic precursors on the metal active sites migrated to the supports, which were converted to polyolefinic or polyaromatic types of coke through condensation and polymerization reactions.</p>
<p>The coke formation on the 00-KPtSn) catalyst (the Sn addition to Pt) was much lower than that on the 13-KPt catalyst (the K addition to Pt).</p>
<p>The high stability of KPtSn catalyst with low potassium content is ascribed to the suppression of the acid sites on the 00-KPtSn catalyst, while the low stability of KPtSn catalysts with high potassium contents (more than 0.49 wt%) can be due to large Pt particle sizes, as shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>Additionally, the high selectivity to C1C2 of 72-KPtSn and 96-KPtSn indicates that PtSn interaction was weakened by the potassium addition at a high content.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It minimizes higher hydrocarbon formation and coke amount by blocking acid sites on the PtSn catalysts, thus enhancing selectivity and stability. However, further potassium addition promotes the reduction of Sn oxide, enriches reduced Sn metal, and weakens the interaction between Pt and Sn, leading to large Pt particles. This results in increased cracking products and coke formation, impacting the overall process efficiency and performance negatively.
