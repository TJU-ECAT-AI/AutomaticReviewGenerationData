The addition of potassium to the PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalyst significantly decreased the acid sites on the PtSn catalyst. The blocking of the acid sites on PtSn catalyst improved both the selectivity and the stability further. The main cause of the deactivation was due to the formation of coke. The coke formation came from the cracking sites on the Pt component and the acid sites. The addition of 0.15 and 0.25 wt% K to PtSn reduced the amount of coke, but further K addition rather promoted coke formation. Therefore, formation of coke by further K addition to the PtSn catalysts is not related to the acid sites, but to the cracking sites on the PtSn component.
On the other hand, K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide on the support. The enhanced Sn oxide reduction resulted in enriching the reduced Sn metal. The high amount K addition rather weakened the PtSn interaction similarly to PtSn catalysts with high Sn contents, resulting in large Pt particles, as shown in TEM images.

The addition of potassium to the PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalyst led to a decrease in acid sites, enhancing both selectivity and stability. The primary cause of deactivation was coke formation, originating from cracking sites on the Pt component and acid sites. Adding potassium up to 0.25 wt% reduced coke formation, but further addition promoted coke formation, which was associated with cracking sites rather than acid sites. Potassium also facilitated the reduction of Sn oxide, enriching reduced Sn metal, weakening the PtSn interaction, and leading to larger Pt particles.

向PtSn/h-Al2O3催化剂中添加钾导致酸性位点减少，进一步提高了选择性和稳定性。催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成，来源于Pt成分上的裂解位点和酸性位点。将钾添加至0.25 wt%可减少焦炭形成，但进一步添加则促进焦炭形成，这与裂解位点而非酸性位点相关。钾还促进了Sn氧化物的还原，增加了还原的Sn金属含量，削弱了PtSn之间的相互作用，并导致了更大的Pt颗粒。
