The addition of Sn to Pt-supported catalyst has been widely investigated in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to light olefins. The roles of Sn were proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt. The sizes of platinum ensembles were decreased by the geometric effect of Sn, which reduced hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Sn could also modify the electronic density of Pt, either by positive charge transfer from Snn? species or by the different electronic structures of PtSn alloys. The electronic modification was responsible for changes in the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates participating in the reaction.

The 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported h-Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest C3 = yield and the catalyst was stable among the other samples for PDH.

When potassium was added to the 00-KPtSn catalyst up to 0.49 wt%, both of the selectivity to the higher hydrocarbons and the coke amount were minimized to 1.01.1 % and 0.40.12 wt%, respectively. Further potassium addition rather increased the selectivity to C1C2 of 6.4 %, the selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of 4.6 % and the coke amount. 

From these experimental results, Sn addition suppressed the cracking sites on the Pt catalysts, while the potassium addition blocked the acid sites on the PtSn catalysts. The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst minimized the higher hydrocarbon formation by blocking the acid sites. On the other hand, the K addition more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the cracking products, indicating that the interaction between Pt and Sn was weakened by the K addition. The K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and the enriched Sn metal weakened the interaction between Pt and Sn similarly to the PtSn catalysts with the high amount of Sn.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts overall process efficiency and performance by modifying the selectivity towards desired products and the stability of the catalyst. The addition of tin (Sn) to the palladium (Pt) catalyst modifies the electronic and geometric properties of the Pt, decreasing the size of platinum ensembles and reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Additionally, Sn can modify the electronic density of Pt, affecting the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates involved in the reaction.

The 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported h-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates high C3 = yield and stability compared to other samples for PDH. Potassium (K) addition up to 0.49 wt% minimizes the formation of higher hydrocarbons and coke, enhancing selectivity and stability. However, beyond this point, K addition increases the formation of higher hydrocarbons and coke, weakening the interaction between Pt and Sn.

Sn addition suppresses cracking sites on the Pt catalysts, while K addition blocks acid sites on the PtSn catalysts. The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst reduces the formation of higher hydrocarbons by blocking acid sites. Conversely, excessive K addition increases cracking products, indicating a weakened Pt-Sn interaction. K addition facilitates the reduction of Sn oxide, enriching Sn metal and weakening the Pt-Sn interaction, similar to PtSn catalysts with high Sn content.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。这进而影响整体过程效率和性能，通过调整所需产品的选择性和催化剂稳定性。锡（Sn）的添加修改了钯（Pt）催化剂的电子和几何性质，减少了铂簇的尺寸并降低了氢解离和结焦反应。此外，Sn还可以修改Pt的电子密度，影响参与反应的不同吸附剂的吸附热。

质量分数为0.5%的Pt和0.75%的Sn支持的h-Al2O3催化剂在PDH中显示出高的C3 = 收率和稳定性，与其他样品相比。钾（K）添加至0.49%可以最小化较高烃类和焦炭的形成，增强选择性和稳定性。然而，超过这个点，K的添加增加了较高烃类和焦炭的形成，削弱了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用。

Sn的添加抑制了Pt催化剂上的裂解位点，而K的添加则阻止了PtSn催化剂上的酸性位点。K添加到00-KPtSn催化剂上通过阻止酸性位点来减少较高烃类的形成。相反，过量的K添加增加了裂解产物的形成，表明Pt-Sn相互作用被削弱。K添加促进了Sn氧化物的还原，富集了Sn金属，进一步削弱了Pt-Sn相互作用，类似于含高Sn含量的PtSn催化剂。
