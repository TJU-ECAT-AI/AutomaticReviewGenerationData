<p>The addition of potassium to the PtSn catalyst significantly decreased the acid sites on the PtSn catalyst (Fig. 3; Table 2).</p>
<p>The blocking of the acid sites on PtSn catalyst improved both the selectivity and the stability further (Fig. 6; Table 5).</p>
<p>The main cause of the deactivation was due to the formation of coke (Table 4).</p>
<p>The coke formation came from the cracking sites on the Pt component and the acid sites.</p>
<p>The addition of 0.15 and 0.25 wt% K to PtSn reduced the amount of coke, but further K addition rather promoted coke formation.</p>
<p>From these experimental results, Sn addition suppressed the cracking sites, while the potassium addition blocked the acid sites.</p>
<p>The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst minimized the higher hydrocarbon formation by blocking the acid sites.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the K addition more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the cracking products, indicating that the interaction between Pt and Sn was weakened by the K addition.</p>
<p>The K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and the enriched Sn metal weakened the interaction between Pt and Sn similarly to the PtSn catalysts with the high amount of Sn.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by decreasing the energy barriers for coke formation, altering the coke accumulation patterns, facilitating the conversion of acid sites, and influencing the graphitization process. These effects lead to improvements in overall process efficiency and performance by reducing coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and optimizing the selectivity towards desired products. Specifically, the addition of potassium to the PtSn catalysts decreases the acid sites, blocks the acid sites, minimizes higher hydrocarbon formation, and weakens the interaction between Pt and Sn, thus reducing coke formation and enhancing stability and selectivity.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过降低焦炭形成能垒、改变焦炭积累模式、促进酸性位点的转化以及影响石墨化过程，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。这些影响提高了整体工艺效率和性能，通过减少焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性以及优化目标产物的选择性。具体而言，向铂锡催化剂中添加钾降低了酸性位点、阻塞了酸性位点、减少了高碳化合物的形成，并减弱了铂与锡之间的相互作用，从而减少了焦炭形成并增强了稳定性和选择性。
