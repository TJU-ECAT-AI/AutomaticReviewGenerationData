The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site. As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support. Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation.

The addition of Indium (In) to the Platinum (Pt) catalyst reduced the acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites. Impregnation of In on the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst resulted in the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which significantly improved the catalyst's activity and reduced coke formation on the support. However, too much In loading (such as 1.0 wt%) led to a decline in catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In catalyst, possibly due to the large amount of metallic In that hindered propane dehydrogenation.

向铂催化剂中添加铟（In）可以降低酸性强度，特别是强酸位点。通过浸渍在Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂上的铟导致形成了金属铟和PtIn合金，这显著提高了催化剂的活性并减少了支持物上的焦炭形成。然而，过量的In负载（如1.0 wt%）导致与负载0.8%的Pt相比，催化剂活性下降，这可能是由于大量形成的金属In阻碍了丙烷脱氢作用。

All the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts exhibited higher propane conversion and lower amount of coke deposited, compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O. The best catalytic performances for propane dehydrogenation were obtained on the Pt0.8In catalyst exhibits with 97.5% propylene selectivity and 27.5% yield at 550 C and 5 h TOS.
