[1] "The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site."
[2] "As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support."
[3] "Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Coke formation on the support is the main factor for catalyst deactivation over the PtIn catalysts."
[5] "It has been also reported that most of carbon deposits cover on the active metal and coke formation is related to the olefin absorption behavior on the active sites."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, modifying coke accumulation patterns, influencing acid site conversions, and affecting graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance by potentially reducing catalyst activity and increasing deactivation rates. The addition of indium (In) to the monometallic platinum (Pt) catalyst reduces acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites. This leads to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, enhancing catalyst activity and reducing coke formation on the support. However, excessive In loading can lead to a descending trend in catalyst activity due to the formation of large amounts of metallic In, which is disadvantageous for propane dehydrogenation. Coke formation on the support is a significant factor for catalyst deactivation in PtIn catalysts. Carbon deposits often cover the active metal and are related to olefin absorption behavior on active sites, affecting the catalyst's stability and performance.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、调整焦炭积累模式、影响酸性位点转化和影响石墨化，影响催化剂稳定性、反应机制以及整体过程的效率与性能。添加铟（In）到单金属铂（Pt）催化剂中可以降低酸性强度，特别是强酸位点。这导致形成金属态In和PtIn合金，显著提高催化剂活性并减少支持物上的焦炭生成。然而，过量的In负载可能导致催化剂活性下降的趋势，这是由于大量形成金属态In，对丙烷脱氢不利。支持物上的焦炭形成是PtIn催化剂失活的主要因素。碳沉积通常覆盖在活性金属上，并且与活性位点上的烯烃吸附行为相关，影响催化剂的稳定性和性能。
