Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, modifying coke accumulation patterns, influencing acid site conversions, and affecting graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance by potentially reducing catalyst activity and increasing deactivation rates. The addition of indium (In) to the monometallic platinum (Pt) catalyst reduces acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites. This leads to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, enhancing catalyst activity and reducing coke formation on the support. However, excessive In loading can lead to a descending trend in catalyst activity due to the formation of large amounts of metallic In, which is disadvantageous for propane dehydrogenation. Coke formation on the support is a significant factor for catalyst deactivation in PtIn catalysts. Carbon deposits often cover the active metal and are related to olefin absorption behavior on active sites, affecting the catalyst's stability and performance.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、调整焦炭积累模式、影响酸性位点转化和影响石墨化，影响催化剂稳定性、反应机制以及整体过程的效率与性能。添加铟（In）到单金属铂（Pt）催化剂中可以降低酸性强度，特别是强酸位点。这导致形成金属态In和PtIn合金，显著提高催化剂活性并减少支持物上的焦炭生成。然而，过量的In负载可能导致催化剂活性下降的趋势，这是由于大量形成金属态In，对丙烷脱氢不利。支持物上的焦炭形成是PtIn催化剂失活的主要因素。碳沉积通常覆盖在活性金属上，并且与活性位点上的烯烃吸附行为相关，影响催化剂的稳定性和性能。

The addition of Indium (In) to the Platinum (Pt) catalyst reduced the acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites. Impregnation of In on the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst resulted in the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which significantly improved the catalyst's activity and reduced coke formation on the support. However, too much In loading (such as 1.0 wt%) led to a decline in catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In catalyst, possibly due to the large amount of metallic In that hindered propane dehydrogenation.

向铂催化剂中添加铟（In）可以降低酸性强度，特别是强酸位点。通过浸渍在Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂上的铟导致形成了金属铟和PtIn合金，这显著提高了催化剂的活性并减少了支持物上的焦炭形成。然而，过量的In负载（如1.0 wt%）导致与负载0.8%的Pt相比，催化剂活性下降，这可能是由于大量形成的金属In阻碍了丙烷脱氢作用。

The addition of Indium (In) to Platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 wt%, improves the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation by reducing the acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites.

The addition of indium (In) to the palladium (Pt) catalysts, specifically at a loading of 0.8 wt%, significantly enhances their performance in propane dehydrogenation. This enhancement leads to higher propane conversion rates and lower amounts of coke formation, compared to the monometallic Pt catalysts. The improved catalytic activity is attributed to the reduction of acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites, which is facilitated by the introduction of In. The formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy through impregnation on the Mg(Al)O support further boosts the catalyst's activity while mitigating coke formation. However, the addition of excessive amounts of In (1.0 wt%) results in a larger fraction of metallic In, which is detrimental to the propane dehydrogenation process. The optimal catalyst, Pt0.8In, demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance, achieving 97.5% propylene selectivity and 27.5% yield after 5 hours of operation at 550°C.

添加铟（In）到钯（Pt）催化剂中，特别是在0.8 wt%的负载下，显著提高了丙烷脱氢过程中的性能。这种增强导致更高的丙烷转化率和更少的焦炭形成，与单金属Pt催化剂相比。提高的催化活性归因于酸性强度的降低，尤其是强酸位点的减少，这得益于In的引入。通过浸渍在Mg(Al)O支持上形成金属态In和PtIn合金进一步增强了催化剂的活性，同时减少了焦炭的形成。然而，In的过量添加（1.0 wt%）会导致更大的金属态In比例，这对丙烷脱氢过程不利。最佳催化剂，Pt0.8In，在550°C下运行5小时后表现出卓越的催化性能，实现了97.5%的丙烯选择性和27.5%的产率。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process influences coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, the addition of hydrogen reduces the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reactions, facilitating the formation of lighter olefins and minimizing the risk of side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. This leads to a more efficient conversion of propane to propene with less coke formation.

Secondly, hydrogen cofeeding affects the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst. In the context of the study, the introduction of indium (In) into the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst system resulted in a reduction of strong acid sites. This alteration in acidity is beneficial as it decreases the likelihood of olefin absorption and subsequent coke formation, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

Thirdly, hydrogen cofeeding promotes the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy through the reduction process. This not only enhances the catalytic activity by providing a more active surface for the PDH reaction but also reduces coke formation on the support. The metallic In and alloy formation likely lower the surface energy and improve the dispersion of the catalyst, contributing to better reaction kinetics and stability.

However, excessive hydrogen cofeeding can lead to coke formation, particularly on the support. In the study, an excessive amount of indium (1.0 wt%) resulted in a higher fraction of metallic In, which was disadvantageous for propane dehydrogenation. This indicates that there is an optimal level of hydrogen cofeeding that maximizes catalyst performance while minimizing coke formation.

Finally, the optimal hydrogen cofeeding strategy depends on the specific catalyst composition and operating conditions. The study found that the Pt0.8In catalyst, with a moderate amount of hydrogen cofeeding, achieved the highest propylene selectivity (97.5%) and yield (27.5%) at 550°C and 5 hours of time-on-stream. This highlights the importance of balancing the cofeeded hydrogen concentration to achieve the best performance in terms of both product selectivity and catalyst longevity.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of the catalyst by affecting energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and the formation of metallic components on the catalyst surface. Optimal cofeeding strategies can lead to higher propene yields and improved catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂养对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机理产生影响，主要体现在以下几个方面：

首先，氢气共喂养降低了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，促进了轻烯烃的生成，并减少了裂解和氢化裂解等副反应的发生。这使得丙烷更高效地转化为丙烯，同时减少了焦炭的形成。

其次，氢气共喂养影响了催化剂上酸性位点的转化。研究中发现，向Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂系统中添加铟（In）能够降低强酸性位点的比例。这种酸性变化有助于减少烯烃的吸附和随后的焦炭形成，从而增强催化剂的稳定性。

第三，氢气共喂养促进金属In和PtIn合金的形成。这种合金不仅提高了催化剂活性，提供了更活跃的表面进行PDH反应，而且减少了支持物上的焦炭形成。金属In和合金的形成可能降低了表面能并改善了催化剂的分散，从而提高了反应动力学和稳定性。

然而，过量的氢气共喂养可能导致焦炭形成，尤其是在支持物上。研究中发现，过量的铟加载（1.0 wt%）导致大量金属In的形成，这对丙烷脱氢不利。这表明，存在一个最佳的氢气共喂养浓度，可以最大化催化剂性能，同时最小化焦炭形成。

最后，氢气共喂养策略取决于催化剂组成和操作条件。研究发现，Pt0.8In催化剂，在适度的氢气共喂养下，实现了最高的丙烯选择性（97.5%）和产率（27.5%），在550°C和5小时时间-on-stream下。这强调了平衡共喂养氢浓度的重要性，以实现最佳性能，包括产物选择性和催化剂寿命。

综上所述，氢气共喂养在PDH过程中可以通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和催化剂表面金属成分的形成，显著影响催化剂效率和性能。最佳的共喂养策略可以提高丙烯产率并延长催化剂寿命。
