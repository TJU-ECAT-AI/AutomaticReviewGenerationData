[1] "All the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts showed higher propane conversion and propene selectivity than the Pt/Mg(Al)O."
[2] "The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site."
[3] "As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support."
[4] "Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process influences coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, the addition of hydrogen reduces the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reactions, facilitating the formation of lighter olefins and minimizing the risk of side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. This leads to a more efficient conversion of propane to propene with less coke formation.

Secondly, hydrogen cofeeding affects the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst. In the context of the study, the introduction of indium (In) into the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst system resulted in a reduction of strong acid sites. This alteration in acidity is beneficial as it decreases the likelihood of olefin absorption and subsequent coke formation, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

Thirdly, hydrogen cofeeding promotes the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy through the reduction process. This not only enhances the catalytic activity by providing a more active surface for the PDH reaction but also reduces coke formation on the support. The metallic In and alloy formation likely lower the surface energy and improve the dispersion of the catalyst, contributing to better reaction kinetics and stability.

However, excessive hydrogen cofeeding can lead to coke formation, particularly on the support. In the study, an excessive amount of indium (1.0 wt%) resulted in a higher fraction of metallic In, which was disadvantageous for propane dehydrogenation. This indicates that there is an optimal level of hydrogen cofeeding that maximizes catalyst performance while minimizing coke formation.

Finally, the optimal hydrogen cofeeding strategy depends on the specific catalyst composition and operating conditions. The study found that the Pt0.8In catalyst, with a moderate amount of hydrogen cofeeding, achieved the highest propylene selectivity (97.5%) and yield (27.5%) at 550°C and 5 hours of time-on-stream. This highlights the importance of balancing the cofeeded hydrogen concentration to achieve the best performance in terms of both product selectivity and catalyst longevity.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of the catalyst by affecting energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and the formation of metallic components on the catalyst surface. Optimal cofeeding strategies can lead to higher propene yields and improved catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂养对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机理产生影响，主要体现在以下几个方面：

首先，氢气共喂养降低了脱氢反应的能量壁垒，促进了轻烯烃的生成，并减少了裂解和氢化裂解等副反应的发生。这使得丙烷更高效地转化为丙烯，同时减少了焦炭的形成。

其次，氢气共喂养影响了催化剂上酸性位点的转化。研究中发现，向Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂系统中添加铟（In）能够降低强酸性位点的比例。这种酸性变化有助于减少烯烃的吸附和随后的焦炭形成，从而增强催化剂的稳定性。

第三，氢气共喂养促进金属In和PtIn合金的形成。这种合金不仅提高了催化剂活性，提供了更活跃的表面进行PDH反应，而且减少了支持物上的焦炭形成。金属In和合金的形成可能降低了表面能并改善了催化剂的分散，从而提高了反应动力学和稳定性。

然而，过量的氢气共喂养可能导致焦炭形成，尤其是在支持物上。研究中发现，过量的铟加载（1.0 wt%）导致大量金属In的形成，这对丙烷脱氢不利。这表明，存在一个最佳的氢气共喂养浓度，可以最大化催化剂性能，同时最小化焦炭形成。

最后，氢气共喂养策略取决于催化剂组成和操作条件。研究发现，Pt0.8In催化剂，在适度的氢气共喂养下，实现了最高的丙烯选择性（97.5%）和产率（27.5%），在550°C和5小时时间-on-stream下。这强调了平衡共喂养氢浓度的重要性，以实现最佳性能，包括产物选择性和催化剂寿命。

综上所述，氢气共喂养在PDH过程中可以通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和催化剂表面金属成分的形成，显著影响催化剂效率和性能。最佳的共喂养策略可以提高丙烯产率并延长催化剂寿命。
