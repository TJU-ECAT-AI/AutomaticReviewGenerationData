The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site. As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support. Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation.

The addition of Indium (In) to Platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 wt%, improves the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation by reducing the acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites. This leads to the formation of metallic Indium and PtIn alloys, which enhances catalyst activity and decreases coke formation on the support. However, an excessive amount of Indium, such as 1.0 wt%, results in a decrease in catalyst activity due to the formation of a large amount of metallic Indium, which is disadvantageous for propane dehydrogenation.

将Indium（In）添加到铂（Pt）催化剂中，特别是在0.2至0.8 wt％的范围内，可以改善丙烷脱氢的催化性能，通过减少酸性强度，特别是强酸位点。这导致形成金属Indium和PtIn合金，从而增强催化剂活性并减少支持上的焦炭形成。然而，Indium的过量添加，如1.0 wt％，会导致催化剂活性下降，原因是形成了大量金属Indium，这对丙烷脱氢不利。
