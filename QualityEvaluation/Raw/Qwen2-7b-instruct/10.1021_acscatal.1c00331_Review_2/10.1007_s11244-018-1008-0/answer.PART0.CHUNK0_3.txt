[1] "All the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts exhibited higher propane conversion and lower amount of coke deposited, compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O."
[2] "The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site."
[3] "As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support."
[4] "However, excessive amount of In (i.e., 1.0 wt%) resulted in larger fraction of metallic state (In0), which is disadvantageous to the propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The best catalytic performances for propane dehydrogenation were obtained on the Pt0.8In catalyst exhibits with 97.5% propylene selectivity and 27.5% yield at 550 C and 5 h TOS."

The addition of indium (In) to the palladium (Pt) catalysts, specifically at a loading of 0.8 wt%, significantly enhances their performance in propane dehydrogenation. This enhancement leads to higher propane conversion rates and lower amounts of coke formation, compared to the monometallic Pt catalysts. The improved catalytic activity is attributed to the reduction of acidity strength, particularly the strong acid sites, which is facilitated by the introduction of In. The formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy through impregnation on the Mg(Al)O support further boosts the catalyst's activity while mitigating coke formation. However, the addition of excessive amounts of In (1.0 wt%) results in a larger fraction of metallic In, which is detrimental to the propane dehydrogenation process. The optimal catalyst, Pt0.8In, demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance, achieving 97.5% propylene selectivity and 27.5% yield after 5 hours of operation at 550°C.

添加铟（In）到钯（Pt）催化剂中，特别是在0.8 wt%的负载下，显著提高了丙烷脱氢过程中的性能。这种增强导致更高的丙烷转化率和更少的焦炭形成，与单金属Pt催化剂相比。提高的催化活性归因于酸性强度的降低，尤其是强酸位点的减少，这得益于In的引入。通过浸渍在Mg(Al)O支持上形成金属态In和PtIn合金进一步增强了催化剂的活性，同时减少了焦炭的形成。然而，In的过量添加（1.0 wt%）会导致更大的金属态In比例，这对丙烷脱氢过程不利。最佳催化剂，Pt0.8In，在550°C下运行5小时后表现出卓越的催化性能，实现了97.5%的丙烯选择性和27.5%的产率。
