[1] "Coke formation on the catalyst usually involves several processes: (1) successive dehydrogenation/cyclization of alkyl chains; (2) n-alkane oligomerization; (3) Diels-Alder type reactions."
[2] "Olefins are primary precursors of the mechanism of coke formation and the intrinsic acidity of the support can promote the undesirable reactions such as cracking/isomerization, thus increasing the carbon deposits."
[3] "Compared with the -Al2O3 supported catalyst, the catalytic capacity to adsorb H2 at high temperature becomes stronger after the use of MA support."
[4] "The existence of spillover hydrogen and the porous character of the catalyst may also affect the coking behaviors."
[5] "The mesoporous character of MA makes the support have a certain pore volume, which can accommodate the coke that formed or migrated, and then is beneficial to the reaction stability."

1. Coke formation on the catalyst involves dehydrogenation/cyclization of alkyl chains, oligomerization of n-alkanes, and Diels-Alder reactions. Olefins are primary precursors, and the intrinsic acidity of the support promotes undesirable reactions like cracking/isomerization, increasing carbon deposits.
2. Compared to -Al2O3-supported catalysts, the use of MA support enhances the catalytic capacity to adsorb hydrogen at high temperatures.
3. Spillover hydrogen and the porous nature of the catalyst impact coking behaviors.
4. The mesoporous nature of MA supports accommodates formed or migrating coke, benefiting reaction stability.

1. 催化剂上的焦炭形成涉及烷基链的脱氢/环化、烷烃的寡聚化和迪尔斯-阿尔德反应。烯烃是主要前体，支持的内在酸性促进不希望的反应如裂解/异构化，从而增加碳沉积。
2. 相比于-Al2O3支持的催化剂，使用MA支持提高了催化剂在高温下吸附氢的能力。
3. 泄露氢和催化剂的多孔性质影响焦炭形成的行为。
4. MA支持的多孔特性容纳形成的或迁移的焦炭，有利于反应稳定性。
