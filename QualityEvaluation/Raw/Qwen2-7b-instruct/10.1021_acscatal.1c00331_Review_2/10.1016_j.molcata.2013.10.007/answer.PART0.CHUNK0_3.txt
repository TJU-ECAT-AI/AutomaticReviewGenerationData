[1] "In this work, the influences of different supports (ZSM-5, -Al2O3, mesoporous alumina (MA), SBA-15 zeolites) on catalytic structure and reaction performances of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts were investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support material plays an important role in determining the textual properties and the acid content of the catalysts."
[3] "The use of the different supports causes an obvious change in the distribution of metallic particles and the interfacial character between the platinum and the support."
[4] "Among these investigated catalysts, the PtSn/MA one exhibits the relatively high reaction stability and selectivity."
[5] "TEM analysis establishes the narrow distribution of metallic particles and the acidity measurement confirms the existence of suitable acid content."
[6] "Moreover, the use of MA material results in the strong interactions between Sn species and the support."
[7] "In this case, the active sites of the catalyst can also be stabilized because of the promoted spillover hydrogen."
[8] "As a result of this, the strengthened interactions of Pt with SnOx species exist, which is beneficial to improve the reaction properties."
[9] "Unfortunately, the presence of the strong acid sites in PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and the porous character of PtSn/-Al2O3 sample make them are easy to be covered by the coke."
[10] "Meantime, the use of SBA-15 support decreases the ability of metallic particles to resist agglomeration and cannot stabilize the oxidative state of Sn effectively."

1. The study investigates how different supports impact the structure and performance of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process.
2. The characteristics of the support material significantly affect the catalyst's textural properties and acidity.
3. Using various supports alters the distribution of metal particles and the interaction between platinum and the support.
4. The PtSn/MA catalyst demonstrates notably high stability and selectivity in PDH.
5. TEM analysis reveals a narrow particle distribution, and acidity measurements validate appropriate acid content.
6. The MA support enhances interactions between Sn species and the catalyst, stabilizing active sites.
7. Increased interactions between Pt and SnOx species improve catalyst properties, thanks to promoted spillover hydrogen.
8. However, strong acid sites in the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and the porous structure of the PtSn/-Al2O3 sample promote coke formation.
9. The use of SBA-15 reduces the resistance of metal particles against aggregation and fails to stabilize Sn's oxidation state effectively.
