[1] "The nature of the support material plays an important role in determining the textual properties and the acid content of the catalysts."
[2] "Furthermore, the use of the different supports causes an obvious change in the distribution of metallic particles and the interfacial character between the platinum and the support."
[3] "It is found that the relatively large surface area and the uniform pore size distribution of the support are favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles."
[4] "In addition, the presence of the different supports can affect the reduction behaviors of tin species, the location of platinum active sites and also the coking behavior effectively."
[5] "Among these investigated catalysts, the PtSn/MA one exhibits the relatively high reaction stability and selectivity."
[6] "TEM analysis establishes the narrow distribution of metallic particles and the acidity measurement confirms the existence of suitable acid content."
[7] "Moreover, the use of MA material results in the strong interactions between Sn species and the support."
[8] "In this case, the active sites of the catalyst can also be stabilized because of the promoted spillover hydrogen."
[9] "As a result of this, the strengthened interactions of Pt with SnOx species exist, which is beneficial to improve the reaction properties."
[10] "Unfortunately, the presence of the strong acid sites in PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and the porous character of PtSn/-Al2O3 sample make them are easy to be covered by the coke."
[11] "Meantime, the use of SBA-15 support decreases the ability of metallic particles to resist agglomeration and cannot stabilize the oxidative state of Sn effectively."
