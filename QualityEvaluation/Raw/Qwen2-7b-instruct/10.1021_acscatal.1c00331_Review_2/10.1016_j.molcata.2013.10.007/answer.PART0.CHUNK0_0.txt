<p>Considering that the side reactions are mainly catalyzed by strong acid centers [8], it can be concluded that the undesirable side reactions can very easy to occur over the PtSn/ZSM-5 sample.</p>
<p>Taking into account that the side reactions are mainly catalyzed by strong acid centers [8], it can be concluded that the undesirable side reactions can very easy to occur over the PtSn/ZSM-5 sample.</p>
<p>In the case of the PtSn/SBA-15 sample, although the acid amount is the low-est, the agglomerated particles may promote the side reactions to be carried out since the unwanted reactions require relatively large platinum ensembles [43].</p>
<p>Compared with this, over the PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst, it is worth mentioning that most of carbon deposits cover the active metal and the temperature shifts towards the higher range (480 C), which suggests that the deposited carbon on the metal surface is more inactive.</p>
<p>In this way, the presence of spillover hydrogen and the porous character of the catalyst may also affect the coking behaviors. Compared with the -Al2O3 supported catalyst, the catalytic capacity to adsorb H2 at high temperature becomes stronger after the use of MA support (Fig. 6), which means that the existence of MA promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen.</p>

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, the presence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can lead to the easy occurrence of undesirable side reactions, such as cracking, which contributes to coke formation. For example, the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, with its high acidity, facilitates cracking reactions, leading to increased coke formation. Secondly, agglomerated particles on the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst promote side reactions, which can also result in coke formation, especially when the reactions require larger platinum ensembles. Thirdly, the temperature shift towards higher ranges during the reaction on the PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst suggests that the deposited carbon on the metal surface is more inactive, affecting the overall process efficiency. Fourthly, the existence of spillover hydrogen and the porous character of the catalyst, such as the mesoporous alumina (MA) support, can reduce coke accumulation by facilitating the migration of coke from metal sites to support surfaces. This is beneficial for maintaining catalyst stability and enhancing the overall process performance.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了一系列影响。首先，催化剂中的强酸中心可以促进不希望的副反应发生，如裂解，从而导致焦炭形成。例如，PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂由于其高酸性，促进了裂解反应的发生，增加了焦炭的生成。其次，PtSn/SBA-15催化剂上的聚集颗粒促进副反应的进行，尤其是当这些反应需要较大的铂合金时，这也会导致焦炭的形成。第三，PtSn/-Al2O3催化剂上温度向较高范围的转变表明，金属表面沉积的碳更为不活跃，影响了整体过程效率。第四，氢溢流和催化剂的多孔性质，特别是使用多孔氧化铝（MA）支持时，可以通过促进焦炭从金属位点到支撑表面的迁移来减少焦炭积累。这对于维持催化剂稳定性并增强整体过程性能是有益的。
