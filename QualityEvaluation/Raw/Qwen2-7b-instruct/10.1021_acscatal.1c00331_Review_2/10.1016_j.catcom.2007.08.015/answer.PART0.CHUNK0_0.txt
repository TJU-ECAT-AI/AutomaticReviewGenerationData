[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "The initial C3H8 conversion values correspond to the analysis of reaction products after 5 min on stream. Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles."
[5] "However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%)."
[6] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[7] "Consequently, selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
[8] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Smaller particles, with an average size of 3 nm, lead to increased activity and coke formation, whereas larger particles, averaging 21 nm, exhibit lower activity but enhanced selectivity towards propene formation. The initial rate of coking is notably higher on the catalyst with smaller particles, and the initial selectivity to coke is almost two orders of magnitude greater. The TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on the activity, selectivity, and coking during the PDH reaction, highlighting the importance of particle size in determining the reaction's efficiency and performance. The selectivity to propene depends on the balance between CH and CC bond activation, with smaller particles being more active for CC bond activation, leading to increased coke formation and a decrease in propene selectivity.

氢助剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。较小的颗粒，平均直径为3纳米，导致活性和焦炭形成增加，而较大颗粒，平均直径为21纳米，则表现出较低的活性但提高了丙烯选择性。较小颗粒催化剂的初始焦炭生成速率明显更高，初始焦炭选择性几乎高两个数量级。TEOM/GC系统提供了PDH反应期间活性、选择性和焦炭生成的全面信息，突出了颗粒大小对反应效率和性能的重要性。丙烯的选择性取决于CH和CC键激活的平衡，较小颗粒更有利于CC键激活，导致焦炭生成增加和丙烯选择性的下降。
