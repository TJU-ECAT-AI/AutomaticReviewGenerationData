[1] "However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
[2] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
[3] "An example of this kind, PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding mono-metallic Pt catalysts [2,3]."
[4] "Moreover, DHP is not known to depend on the Pt particle size and there are no reports in the literature dealing with this issue."
[5] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
[6] "The coke content was determined from the mass change measured during the reaction."
[7] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[8] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. It can influence the energy barriers involved in the PDH process, potentially accelerating coke accumulation. The hydrogen can interact with the catalyst surface, leading to changes in the catalyst's acidity and the behavior of active sites, which in turn affects the selectivity of propene formation. The hydrogen may promote the rearrangement or modification of Pt sites during the time on stream, impacting the reaction dynamics. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance include reduced selectivity to propene, increased coke formation, and altered catalyst stability. These changes can lead to decreased productivity and increased operational costs due to the necessity of frequent regeneration of the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的添加会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，主要体现在以下几个方面。它可能影响PDH过程的能量壁垒，加速焦炭积累。氢与催化剂表面的相互作用可能导致催化剂酸性变化和活性位点行为的变化，从而影响丙烯选择性。氢可能促进Pt位点随时间的重排或修改，影响反应动力学。这些变化对整体过程效率和性能的影响包括丙烯选择性的降低、焦炭形成的增加以及催化剂稳定性的改变。这些改变会导致生产效率下降和运营成本增加，因为需要频繁再生催化剂。
