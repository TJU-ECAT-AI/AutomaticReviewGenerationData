[1] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[2] "However, despite extensive studies the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive [1,3]."
[3] "Consequently, smaller particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation while, larger particles are less active for both the reactions but more selective for propene formation."

This study reveals that the particle size of the Pt catalyst significantly affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Smaller particles (3 nm) are found to be more active and less selective, leading to a higher rate of coking, coke formation, and the amount of coke produced. Conversely, larger particles (21 nm) exhibit lower activity but greater selectivity for propene formation. The role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains unclear, despite extensive research. The findings suggest that controlling the particle size can optimize PDH processes by balancing activity and selectivity, potentially impacting the role of other components like Sn in bimetallic catalysts.

这项研究表明，铂催化剂的颗粒大小对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程有显著影响。较小的颗粒（3纳米）表现出更高的活性和更低的选择性，导致焦炭生成速率、焦炭形成选择性和焦炭形成的量显著增加。相反，较大的颗粒（21纳米）在反应中活性较低但对丙烯形成的选择性更高。Sn在双金属催化剂中的作用仍然不明，尽管进行了大量研究。研究结果表明，通过控制颗粒大小可以优化PDH过程，平衡活性和选择性，可能影响Sn等其他成分在双金属催化剂中的作用。
