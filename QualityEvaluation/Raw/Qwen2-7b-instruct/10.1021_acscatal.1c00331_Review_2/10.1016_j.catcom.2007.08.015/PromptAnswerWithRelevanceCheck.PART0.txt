[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "The initial C3H8 conversion values correspond to the analysis of reaction products after 5 min on stream. Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles."
[5] "However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%)."
[6] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[7] "Consequently, selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
[8] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Smaller particles, with an average size of 3 nm, lead to increased activity and coke formation, whereas larger particles, averaging 21 nm, exhibit lower activity but enhanced selectivity towards propene formation. The initial rate of coking is notably higher on the catalyst with smaller particles, and the initial selectivity to coke is almost two orders of magnitude greater. The TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on the activity, selectivity, and coking during the PDH reaction, highlighting the importance of particle size in determining the reaction's efficiency and performance. The selectivity to propene depends on the balance between CH and CC bond activation, with smaller particles being more active for CC bond activation, leading to increased coke formation and a decrease in propene selectivity.

氢助剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。较小的颗粒，平均直径为3纳米，导致活性和焦炭形成增加，而较大颗粒，平均直径为21纳米，则表现出较低的活性但提高了丙烯选择性。较小颗粒催化剂的初始焦炭生成速率明显更高，初始焦炭选择性几乎高两个数量级。TEOM/GC系统提供了PDH反应期间活性、选择性和焦炭生成的全面信息，突出了颗粒大小对反应效率和性能的重要性。丙烯的选择性取决于CH和CC键激活的平衡，较小颗粒更有利于CC键激活，导致焦炭生成增加和丙烯选择性的下降。

[1] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
[2] "An example of this kind, PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding mono-metallic Pt catalysts."
[3] "However, despite extensive studies the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive."
[4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
[5] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."
[6] "Differently, in larger particles the surface is mostly terminated by terraces and planes where Pt atoms are relatively coordinatively saturated."
[7] "Furthermore,taking into account the pore diameter of the samples as evidenced by N2 physisorption data, it can be assumed that the Pt particles may reside inside or outside the pores depending on their sizes (Fig. 1)."
[8] "By contrast, the average Pt particle size determined by H2-chemisorption is significantly different from that by TEM and/or XRD as shown in Table 1."
[9] "By comparison, the average Pt particle size determined by H2-chemisorption is significantly differ- ent from that by TEM and/or XRD."
[10] "Consequently, surface site heterogeneity (i.e., the fraction of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms, for example at edges, steps, kinks, terraces, etc.) of Pt particles in the catalysts is expected to be different."
[11] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
[12] "This is due to the fact that true initial TOF is difficult to determine over Pt-SBA-15-DP due to rapid deac- tivation of Pt sites by coke as evidenced by the above results."

The dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) process is influenced by hydrogen cofeeding, affecting coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen cofeeding lowers the energy barriers for the cracking reactions, accelerating coke formation. The coke accumulation pattern and the conversion of acid sites are impacted, leading to a shift in the reaction mechanism towards more cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation. Graphitization may occur as a result of the increased carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. These effects reduce the overall process efficiency and performance by decreasing catalyst stability and product selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。氢气共喂料降低了裂解反应的能量壁垒，加速了焦炭形成。焦炭积累模式和酸性位点的转化影响了反应机制，导致更多裂解反应而非脱氢反应。可能会发生石墨化，这是由于催化剂表面碳沉积的结果。这些效果降低了整体过程效率和性能，减少了催化剂稳定性与产品选择性。

This study reveals that the particle size of the Pt catalyst significantly affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Smaller particles (3 nm) are found to be more active and less selective, leading to a higher rate of coking, coke formation, and the amount of coke produced. Conversely, larger particles (21 nm) exhibit lower activity but greater selectivity for propene formation. The role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains unclear, despite extensive research. The findings suggest that controlling the particle size can optimize PDH processes by balancing activity and selectivity, potentially impacting the role of other components like Sn in bimetallic catalysts.

这项研究表明，铂催化剂的颗粒大小对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程有显著影响。较小的颗粒（3纳米）表现出更高的活性和更低的选择性，导致焦炭生成速率、焦炭形成选择性和焦炭形成的量显著增加。相反，较大的颗粒（21纳米）在反应中活性较低但对丙烯形成的选择性更高。Sn在双金属催化剂中的作用仍然不明，尽管进行了大量研究。研究结果表明，通过控制颗粒大小可以优化PDH过程，平衡活性和选择性，可能影响Sn等其他成分在双金属催化剂中的作用。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. It can influence the energy barriers involved in the PDH process, potentially accelerating coke accumulation. The hydrogen can interact with the catalyst surface, leading to changes in the catalyst's acidity and the behavior of active sites, which in turn affects the selectivity of propene formation. The hydrogen may promote the rearrangement or modification of Pt sites during the time on stream, impacting the reaction dynamics. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance include reduced selectivity to propene, increased coke formation, and altered catalyst stability. These changes can lead to decreased productivity and increased operational costs due to the necessity of frequent regeneration of the catalyst.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的添加会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，主要体现在以下几个方面。它可能影响PDH过程的能量壁垒，加速焦炭积累。氢与催化剂表面的相互作用可能导致催化剂酸性变化和活性位点行为的变化，从而影响丙烯选择性。氢可能促进Pt位点随时间的重排或修改，影响反应动力学。这些变化对整体过程效率和性能的影响包括丙烯选择性的降低、焦炭形成的增加以及催化剂稳定性的改变。这些改变会导致生产效率下降和运营成本增加，因为需要频繁再生催化剂。
