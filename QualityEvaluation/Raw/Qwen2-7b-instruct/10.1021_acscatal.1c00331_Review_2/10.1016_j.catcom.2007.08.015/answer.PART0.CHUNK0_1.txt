[1] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
[2] "An example of this kind, PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding mono-metallic Pt catalysts."
[3] "However, despite extensive studies the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive."
[4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
[5] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."
[6] "Differently, in larger particles the surface is mostly terminated by terraces and planes where Pt atoms are relatively coordinatively saturated."
[7] "Furthermore,taking into account the pore diameter of the samples as evidenced by N2 physisorption data, it can be assumed that the Pt particles may reside inside or outside the pores depending on their sizes (Fig. 1)."
[8] "By contrast, the average Pt particle size determined by H2-chemisorption is significantly different from that by TEM and/or XRD as shown in Table 1."
[9] "By comparison, the average Pt particle size determined by H2-chemisorption is significantly differ- ent from that by TEM and/or XRD."
[10] "Consequently, surface site heterogeneity (i.e., the fraction of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms, for example at edges, steps, kinks, terraces, etc.) of Pt particles in the catalysts is expected to be different."
[11] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
[12] "This is due to the fact that true initial TOF is difficult to determine over Pt-SBA-15-DP due to rapid deac- tivation of Pt sites by coke as evidenced by the above results."

The dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) process is influenced by hydrogen cofeeding, affecting coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen cofeeding lowers the energy barriers for the cracking reactions, accelerating coke formation. The coke accumulation pattern and the conversion of acid sites are impacted, leading to a shift in the reaction mechanism towards more cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation. Graphitization may occur as a result of the increased carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. These effects reduce the overall process efficiency and performance by decreasing catalyst stability and product selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。氢气共喂料降低了裂解反应的能量壁垒，加速了焦炭形成。焦炭积累模式和酸性位点的转化影响了反应机制，导致更多裂解反应而非脱氢反应。可能会发生石墨化，这是由于催化剂表面碳沉积的结果。这些效果降低了整体过程效率和性能，减少了催化剂稳定性与产品选择性。
