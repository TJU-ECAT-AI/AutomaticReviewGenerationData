[1] "The identified transition states for the formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are shown in Fig. 5."
[2] "For gas-phase propane, it is known that the energy barrier for the CH bond activation at the methyl group is higher than that at the methylene group (4.35 and 4.17 eV, respectively) [5]."
[3] "The activation energies, however, can be dramatically lowered with the introduction of Pt catalyst."
[4] "On Pt(1 0 0), the energy barriers for the initial activation of the CH bonds at the methyl (Step 1) and methylene groups (Step 2) are calculated to be 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively."
[5] "As shown in Fig. 5, propane is dissociated over the top of a Pt atom with the detached H atom adsorbed at the Bridge site."
[6] "The activation energies for the first and second dehydrogenation steps (Steps 14) on Pt(1 0 0) are lower than those on Pt(1 1 1)."

1. The transition states for propylene formation from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are illustrated in Figure 5.
2. In gas-phase propane, the energy barrier for CH bond activation at the methyl group surpasses that at the methylene group (4.35 and 4.17 eV respectively).
3. Incorporating Pt catalyst can markedly decrease these energy barriers.
4. On Pt(1 0 0), the activation energies for the initial CH bond activation at the methyl and methylene groups are 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively.
5. As depicted in Figure 5, propane dissociates over a Pt atom, with the detached H atom adsorbed at the Bridge site.
6. The activation energies for the first and second dehydrogenation steps on Pt(1 0 0) are lower than those on Pt(1 1 1).

1. 图5展示了丙烯从丙烷在Pt(1 0 0)上的形成过渡态。
2. 在气相丙烷中，甲基组的CH键激活能高于甲基组（4.35和4.17 eV分别）。
3. 引入铂催化剂可以显著降低这些能量壁垒。
4. 在Pt(1 0 0)上，甲基和甲基组的初始CH键激活能分别为0.43和0.42 eV。
5. 如图5所示，丙烷在Pt原子顶部解离，脱氢H原子吸附于桥位。
6. Pt(1 0 0)上的前两个脱氢步骤的活化能低于Pt(1 1 1)。
