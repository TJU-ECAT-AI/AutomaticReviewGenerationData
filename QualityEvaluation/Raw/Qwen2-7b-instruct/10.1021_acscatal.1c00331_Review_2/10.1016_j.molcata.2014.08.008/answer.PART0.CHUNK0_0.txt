[1] "The identified transition states for the formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are shown in Fig. 5."
[2] "The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observation that the cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) shows higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity than the octahedral particles that are dominated by Pt(1 1 1)."

The formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) is shown in Fig. 5. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) explain why cubic particles, dominated by Pt(1 0 0), exhibit higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity compared to octahedral particles, which are dominated by Pt(1 1 1). Selectivity towards propylene is significantly influenced by the relative rates of propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption. The Arrhenius equation underscores the critical role of activation energy in setting the reaction rate constant.

丙烯从丙烷在Pt(1 0 0)上的形成如图5所示。丙烷和丙基在Pt(1 0 0)上的脱氢作用的更低活化能解释了为何立方体颗粒，由Pt(1 0 0)主导，表现出更高的催化脱氢活性与八面体粒子，由Pt(1 1 1)主导。丙烯的选择性很大程度上取决于丙烯深脱氢和丙烯脱附的相对速率。阿伦尼乌斯方程强调了活化能在决定反应速率常数中的关键作用。
