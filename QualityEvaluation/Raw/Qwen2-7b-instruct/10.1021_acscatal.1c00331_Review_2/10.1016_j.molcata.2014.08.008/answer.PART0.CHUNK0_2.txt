[2] "Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface have higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability than cubic particles (11.5 nm) that are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface."
[3] "The weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1) contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene."

[10] "The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observation that the cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) shows higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity than the octahedral particles that are dominated by Pt(1 1 1)."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by enhancing the selectivity towards propylene production and improving stability. Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) with a Pt(1 1 1) surface dominate offer higher selectivity and stability compared to cubic particles (11.5 nm) with a Pt(1 0 0) surface. The weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage on the Pt(1 1 1) surface contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene. Coke formation leads to the deactivation of Pt catalyst through shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms below the Fermi level. The cubic particles show higher activity and cracking rates than octahedral ones, while octahedral particles have a lower selectivity for propylene. The rates for coke formation are faster on cubic particles than on octahedral ones. Propylene adsorption on Pt(1 0 0) has a more negative energy in the di-mode than in the mode. The initial activation of CH bonds at the methyl and methylene groups on Pt(1 0 0) has lower energy barriers (0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively). These lower activation energies explain why cubic particles with a Pt(1 0 0) surface show higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity compared to octahedral particles dominated by Pt(1 1 1).

氢助剂在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过增强丙烯选择性和提高稳定性，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。八面体颗粒（12.0纳米）以Pt(1 1 1)表面为主导，比立方颗粒（11.5纳米）以Pt(1 0 0)表面为主导时具有更高的选择性和稳定性。丙烯与Pt(1 1 1)表面之间的较弱结合强度和丙烯脱氢时增加的CH键断裂能贡献了较高的丙烯选择性。焦炭的形成导致Pt催化剂失活，因为周围Pt原子的d带被更大地拉低至费米能级以下。立方颗粒的活性和裂解速率高于八面体颗粒，而八面体颗粒对丙烯的选择性较低。立方颗粒中焦炭形成的速率比八面体颗粒快。丙烯在Pt(1 0 0)表面上的吸附能量在di模式下比在模式下更为负值。甲基和甲基团上CH键的初始激活在Pt(1 0 0)上的能垒分别为0.43和0.42电子伏特。这些较低的能垒解释了为什么立方颗粒以Pt(1 0 0)表面为主导时显示更高的催化脱氢活性，与主要由Pt(1 1 1)表面主导的八面体颗粒相比。
