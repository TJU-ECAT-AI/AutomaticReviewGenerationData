[1] "Propane dehydrogenation was carried out under atmospheric pressure at 813 K in a flow reactor."
[2] "The surface-specific activities, turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene was calculated by normalizing the mass activity to the number of surface Pt atoms (Pts) determined by H2 chemisorption, which is a measure of the activity for selective CH bond cleavage in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "As shown in Fig. 2, the activity for dehydrogenation and cracking on the cubic particles is remarkably higher than that on the octahedral ones."
[4] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propylene is lower on the cubic particles than that on the octahedral ones."
[5] "On Pt(1 0 0), the adsorption energy of propylene in the di- mode is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than that in the mode."
[6] "The length of the C-C bond in the di- adsorption mode is elongated to 1.49 A, which is close to the CC interatomic distance in molecular propane (1.54 A)."
[7] "In the case of the di-bonding on both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0), propylene undergoes a significant distortion upon adsorption."
[8] "The identified transition states for the formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are shown in Fig. 5."
[9] "The energy barriers for the initial activation of the CH bonds at the methyl (Step 1) and methylene groups (Step 2) are calculated to be 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively."
[10] "The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observation that the cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) shows higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity than the octahedral particles that are dominated by Pt(1 1 1)."

1. Propane dehydrogenation was conducted under atmospheric pressure at 813 K in a flow reactor.
2. The specific surface activity and propylene turnover frequency (TOF) were determined by normalizing the mass activity to the number of surface Pt atoms through H2 chemisorption, indicating the activity for selective CH bond cleavage in the dehydrogenation reaction.
3. The activity for dehydrogenation and cracking on cubic particles was notably higher than that on octahedral particles.
4. The selectivity towards propylene was lower on cubic particles compared to octahedral particles.
5. The adsorption energy of propylene in the di-mode on Pt(1 0 0) was 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than in the mode.
6. The C-C bond length in the di-adsorption mode was elongated to 1.49 A, closely resembling the molecular propane C-C interatomic distance (1.54 A).
7. Both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) showed significant distortions in propylene adsorption during di-bonding.
8. The transition states for propylene formation from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are depicted in Figure 5.
9. The activation energies for the initial methyl (Step 1) and methylene (Step 2) CH bond activations were calculated to be 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively.
10. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) justify the observed higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity of cubic particles over octahedral particles.

1. 在813 K的常压下，丙烷脱氢在流动反应器中进行。
2. 表面特定活性和丙烯转速频率（TOF）通过H2化学吸附归一化到表面Pt原子的数量来确定，这表示脱氢反应中选择性CH键断裂的活性。
3. 棱柱形颗粒的脱氢化和裂解活动明显高于八面体颗粒。
4. 与八面体颗粒相比，棱柱形颗粒的丙烯选择性较低。
5. 在Pt(1 0 0)上，丙烯在di-模式下的吸附能为1.22 eV，比在模式下多0.15 eV。
6. di-吸附模式下，丙烯C-C键长度延伸至1.49 A，接近分子丙烷中的C-C键间距（1.54 A）。
