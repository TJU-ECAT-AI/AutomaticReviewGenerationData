1. The performance of the Pt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation varies depending on the crystal morphology. Cubic particles show higher activity, while octahedral particles display higher selectivity.
2. Propane dehydrogenation experiments were conducted at 813 K under atmospheric pressure in a flow reactor, using a feed consisting of 3 kPa propane, 3 kPa hydrogen, and balanced helium.
3. The observed shape effect on catalytic performance is consistent across different temperatures, specifically at 753 K as indicated in supplementary figure S-Fig. 1.
4. Adsorption energies (Eads) of adsorbates on surfaces are calculated using the formula Eads = Eadsorbate+surface (Eadsorbate + Esurface).
5. The configuration of propylene adsorption on Pt(1 0 0) resembles that on Pt(1 1 1), yet the adsorption energy on Pt(1 0 0) is 0.25 eV more negative.
6. The introduction of a Pt catalyst significantly reduces the activation energies for chemical reactions.
7. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) explain why cubic particles, which are dominated by this surface, exhibit higher catalytic activity.
8. The initial activation energies for methyl and methylene groups on Pt(1 0 0) are 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively.
9. The reason for the higher catalytic activity of cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) is due to the lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation.
10. The selectivity towards propylene is heavily influenced by the relative rates of propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption.

1. 不同晶体形态的Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能存在差异。立方体颗粒表现出更高的活性，而八面体颗粒则显示出更高的选择性。
2. 在813 K下，在流化反应器中在大气压力下进行了丙烷脱氢实验，使用的原料气包括3 kPa丙烷、3 kPa氢气和平衡氦气。
3. 观察到的形状效应催化性能的一致性，特别是在753 K时，如补充图S-Fig. 1所示。
4. 表面吸附剂的吸附能（Eads）通过公式Eads = Eadsorbate+surface (Eadsorbate + Esurface)进行计算。
5. 丙烯在Pt(1 0 0)上的配置类似于在Pt(1 1 1)上，然而在Pt(1 0 0)上的吸附能比在Pt(1 1 1)上高0.25 eV。
6. Pt催化剂的引入显著降低了化学反应的活化能。
7. 碳链和丙烯在Pt(1 0 0)上的活化能降低解释了为什么由该表面主导的立方体颗粒表现出更高的催化活性。
8. Pt(1 0 0)上甲基和亚甲基的初始激活能分别为0.43和0.42 eV。
9. 由于碳链和丙烯的活化能降低，立方体颗粒由Pt(1 0 0)主导的原因是其表现出更高的催化活性。
10. 丙烯的选择性很大程度上取决于丙烯深脱氢和丙烯脱附的相对速率。
