          "[1] The identified transition states for the formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are shown in Fig. 5."
          "[2] The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observation that the cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) shows higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity than the octahedral particles that are dominated by Pt(1 1 1)."
          "[3] The selectivity toward propylene depends strongly on the relative rate between propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption."

          The formation of propylene from propane on Pt(1 0 0) is illustrated in Fig. 5. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) provide a rational explanation for the experimentally observed higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity of cubic particles dominated by Pt(1 0 0) compared to octahedral particles dominated by Pt(1 1 1). Propylene selectivity is significantly influenced by the relative rates of propylene deep dehydrogenation and propylene desorption. The Arrhenius equation highlights the pivotal role of activation energy in defining the reaction rate constant.

          丙烯从丙烷在Pt(1 0 0)上的形成如图5所示。丙烷和丙基在Pt(1 0 0)上的脱氢作用的更低活化能为立方体颗粒，由Pt(1 0 0)主导，表现出高于八面体颗粒，由Pt(1 1 1)主导的催化脱氢活性提供了合理的解释。丙烯的选择性很大程度上取决于丙烯深脱氢和丙烯脱附的相对速率。阿伦尼乌斯方程强调了活化能在决定反应速率常数中的关键作用。

          Propane dehydrogenation was performed under atmospheric pressure at 813 K in a flow reactor. The specific surface activity and propylene turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated by normalizing the mass activity to the number of surface Pt atoms determined by H2 chemisorption, indicating the activity for selective CH bond cleavage in the dehydrogenation reaction. The activity for dehydrogenation and cracking on cubic particles is notably higher than that on octahedral particles. The selectivity towards propylene is lower on cubic particles compared to octahedral particles. The adsorption energy of propylene in the di-mode on Pt(1 0 0) is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than in the mode. The C-C bond length in the di-adsorption mode is extended to 1.49 A, closely matching the molecular propane C-C interatomic distance of 1.54 A. Both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) display significant deformations in propylene adsorption during di-bonding. The transition states for propylene formation from propane on Pt(1 0 0) are depicted in Fig. 5. The activation energies for the initial methyl (Step 1) and methylene (Step 2) CH bond activations are 0.43 and 0.42 eV, respectively. The lower activation energies for propane and propyl dehydrogenation on Pt(1 0 0) explain the observed higher catalytic dehydrogenation activity of cubic particles over octahedral particles.

          在813 K的大气压力下，在流动反应器中进行了丙烷脱氢实验。通过H2化学吸附归一化到表面Pt原子的数量，计算出了特定表面活性和丙烯转速频率（TOF），这表明脱氢反应中选择性CH键断裂的活性。立方体颗粒的脱氢化和裂解活动明显高于八面体颗粒。与八面体颗粒相比，立方体颗粒的丙烯选择性较低。在Pt(1 0 0)上的丙烯在di-模式下的吸附能为1.22 eV，比在模式下多0.15 eV。di-吸附模式下，丙烯C-C键长度延伸至1.49 A，接近分子丙烷中的C-C键间距（1.54 A）。在di-结合期间，Pt(1 1 1)和Pt(1 0 0)均显示出丙烯的显著变形。从丙烷到丙烯的过渡状态在Pt(1 0 0)上显示在图5中。甲基（步骤1）和亚甲基（步骤2）的CH键初始激活的能量分别是0.43和0.42 eV。丙烷和丙基在Pt(1 0 0)上的脱氢化较低的活化能解释了立方体颗粒相对于八面体颗粒的更高催化脱氢活性。
