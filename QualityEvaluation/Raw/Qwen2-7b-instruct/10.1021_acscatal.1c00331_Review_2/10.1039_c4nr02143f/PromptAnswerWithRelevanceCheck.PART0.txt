The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The PtCu bimetallic interaction enhances propylene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation. By inhibiting propylene adsorption, it decreases the possibility of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions toward lighter hydrocarbons. This leads to a more efficient and stable PDH process, as propylene is preferentially converted into desired products rather than being involved in undesired side reactions. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst are crucial for improving overall process performance and efficiency.
