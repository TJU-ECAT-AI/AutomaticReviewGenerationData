1. Copper introduces a higher energy barrier for carbon-carbon bond rupture by weakening the interaction between the Pt surface and adsorbed molecules, due to the alteration of the electronic environment of the surface Pt atoms.
2. The copper addition leads to a reduction in metal dispersion.
3. TEM images depict well-dispersed, uniform metal particles on the surface of the reduced Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
4. The Cu particles display a larger particle size than the Pt particles.
5. Carbon monoxide bonding occurs through electron donation from the CO 5s orbital to the empty d orbital of the metal, and back-donation from the filled metal d orbital to the CO 2p* antibonding orbital of the CO molecule.
6. The Cu addition shifts the CO band to lower frequencies, and a weak CO adsorption peak appears at 2160 cm1, which is assigned to CO/Cu bands.
