[1] "The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[2] "An increased selectivity of the catalyst is also observed at the beginning of the reaction and reaches a steady state after 100 min."
[3] "Despite a decrease in the initial propane conversion, the Cu addition in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst clearly suppresses the deactivation rate."
[4] "The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."
[5] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions."
[6] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which results in a propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%."

1. The addition of copper to the platinum-alumina catalyst enhances propylene selectivity and yield while reducing the rate of catalyst deactivation.
2. The catalyst's selectivity for propylene increases at the start of the reaction and stabilizes after 100 minutes.
3. Despite a reduction in initial propane conversion, adding copper to the platinum-alumina catalyst effectively slows down the deactivation process.
4. The interaction between platinum and copper increases the energy barrier for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and reduces propylene adsorption.
5. The easy desorption of propylene from the platinum-copper/alumina catalyst prevents the formation of coke and other unwanted side reactions, ensuring high propylene selectivity.
6. The optimal copper loading is 0.5 wt%, achieving a propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%.

1. 铜添加到铂-氧化铝催化剂中，提高了丙烯选择性和产率，同时降低了催化剂失活速率。
2. 催化剂在反应开始时对丙烯的选择性增加，并在100分钟后达到稳定状态。
3. 尽管初始丙烷转化率有所下降，但在铂-氧化铝催化剂中添加铜明显减慢了催化剂失活过程。
4. 铂和铜之间的相互作用增加了碳-碳键断裂的能量壁垒并减少了丙烯吸附。
5. 从铂-铜/氧化铝催化剂中容易脱除丙烯防止了焦炭和其他不希望的副反应形成，确保了高丙烯选择性。
6. 最佳的铜负载量为0.5 wt%，实现了90.8%的丙烯选择性和36.5%的丙烯产率。
