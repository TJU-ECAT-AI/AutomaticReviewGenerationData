[1] "The promotional eff ect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was described."
[2] "The PtCu interaction inhibits the propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."
[3] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3."
[4] "A higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
[5] "The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu,which is confirmed by the change of particle morphology and atomic electronic environment of the catalyst."
[6] "Propylene, employed as the electron donors,30 forms the bonding between the propylene molecule and the metal atom by transferring its electron to the empty d orbital of the metal.35"
[7] "The interaction between d-orbital filled Cu and Pt weakens the electronic interaction between Pt and propylene molecules,36 leading to the consequent weakened propylene adsorption."
[8] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selec- tivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation18,26,47,48 and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocar- bons (Fig. 9)."
[9] "The PtCu interaction increases the propylene selectivity and minimizes coke formation by suppressing the propylene adsorption on the metal."

1. The addition of copper to the palladium catalyst enhances its performance in propane dehydrogenation by inhibiting propylene adsorption and increasing the energy barrier for carbon-carbon bond rupture. This reduces the likelihood of coke formation and light hydrocarbon production.
2. The interaction between copper and palladium modifies the electronic environment of the catalyst, weakening the adsorption of propylene molecules. This leads to easier propylene desorption, thereby minimizing the formation of coke and other undesired side reactions.

1. 铜的添加提高了钯催化剂在丙烷裂解中的性能，通过抑制丙烯吸附和增加碳-碳键断裂的能量壁垒。这减少了焦炭形成的可能性，并降低了轻质烃类的产生。
2. 铜和钯之间的相互作用修改了催化剂的电子环境，减弱了丙烯分子的吸附。这导致丙烯更容易脱附，从而最小化了焦炭和其他不希望的副反应的形成。
