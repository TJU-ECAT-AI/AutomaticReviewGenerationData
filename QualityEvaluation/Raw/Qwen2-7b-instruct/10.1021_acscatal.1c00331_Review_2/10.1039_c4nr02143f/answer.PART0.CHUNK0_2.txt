[1] "The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."
[2] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3."
[3] "The PtCu interaction increases the propylene selectivity and minimizes coke formation by suppressing the propylene adsorption on the metal."
[4] "Propylene, employed as the electron donors, forms the bonding between the propylene molecule and the metal atom by transferring its electron to the empty d orbital of the metal."
[5] "The interaction between d-orbital filled Cu and Pt weakens the electronic interaction between Pt and propylene molecules, leading to the consequent weakened propylene adsorption."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The PtCu bimetallic interaction enhances propylene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation. By inhibiting propylene adsorption, it decreases the possibility of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions toward lighter hydrocarbons. This leads to a more efficient and stable PDH process, as propylene is preferentially converted into desired products rather than being involved in undesired side reactions. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst are crucial for improving overall process performance and efficiency.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共喂料，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。PtCu双金属相互作用提高了丙烯选择性和降低了催化剂失活率。通过抑制丙烯吸附，它减少了焦炭形成的可能性，并抑制了向轻质烃的裂解反应。这导致了一个更高效稳定的PDH过程，因为丙烯被优先转化为目标产物，而不是参与不希望的副反应。增强的稳定性和选择性是提高整体过程性能和效率的关键。
