[1] "The addition of d-orbital filled Cu resulted in a weakened interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules as well as a higher energy barrier for CC rupture, since the Cu addition altered the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms."
[2] "The propylene adsorption is weakened on the metal surface of PtCu/Al2O3 since a lower uptake of propylene is presented (Fig. 10), which suggests that the Cu addition facilitates propylene desorption."
[3] "The promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was described."
[4] "The PtCu interaction inhibits the propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."
[5] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3."

1. Copper, with its d-orbital filled, weakens the interaction between platinum and adsorbed molecules and raises the energy barrier for carbon-carbon bond rupture, altering the electronic environment of surface platinum atoms.
2. The addition of copper facilitates propylene desorption, indicated by a reduced uptake of propylene on the metal surface of PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts.
3. Copper promotes the catalytic performance of platinum catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.
4. The interaction between platinum and copper inhibits propylene adsorption and enhances the energy barrier for carbon-carbon bond cleavage.
5. This inhibition reduces the chance of coke formation and curtails cracking reactions leading to the production of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3 catalysts.

1. 铜，由于其充满d轨道，减弱了铂与吸附分子之间的相互作用，并提高了碳-碳键断裂的能量壁垒，改变了表面铂原子的电子环境。
2. 铜的添加促进了丙烯脱附，表现为PtCu/Al2O3催化剂表面上丙烯吸附量的减少。
3. 铜促进了铂催化剂在丙烷裂解中的催化性能。
4. 铂和铜之间的相互作用抑制了丙烯吸附并增强了碳-碳键断裂的能量壁垒。
5. 这种抑制减少了焦炭形成的机会，并限制了向轻质烃生产的方向进行的裂解反应在Pt-Cu/Al2O3催化剂上。
