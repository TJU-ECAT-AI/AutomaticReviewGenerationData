The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects the reaction mechanism, kinetics, coke formation, and catalyst stability by altering energy barriers, influencing coke accumulation patterns, converting acid sites, and affecting graphitization. These impacts lead to significant implications for the process's overall efficiency and performance.
