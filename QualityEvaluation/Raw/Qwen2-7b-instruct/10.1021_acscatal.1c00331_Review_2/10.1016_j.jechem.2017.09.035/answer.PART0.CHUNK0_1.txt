[1] "The catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers."
[3] "Whereas nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke."
[4] "Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface."

1. Hydrogen regeneration is more effective in maintaining the stability of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction compared to nitrogen regeneration or coke-burning treatment.
2. Hydrogen regeneration not only removes the low dense components of coke but also alters the coke's property through hydrogenation, enhancing the mobility and accessibility of metal active centers.
3. Nitrogen regeneration only removes the low dense components of coke, without altering its property.
4. Repeated redox treatment leads to poor stability of the catalyst due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and formation of a large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface.

1. 氢再生是保持丙烷裂解反应中Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3催化剂性能的有效方法，与氮再生或焦炭燃烧处理相比效果更好。
2. 氢再生不仅去除低密度的焦炭成分，还能通过氢化改变焦炭的性质，增加活性中心的可接近性。
3. 氮再生仅去除低密度的焦炭成分，不改变其性质。
4. 反复的氧化还原处理导致催化剂性能变差，因为金属聚集、相分离和形成较大的Pt3Sn颗粒以及富含Sn的核壳结构。
