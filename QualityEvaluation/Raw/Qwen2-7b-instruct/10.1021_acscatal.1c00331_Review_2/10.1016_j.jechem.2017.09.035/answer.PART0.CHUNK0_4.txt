[1] "The catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers."
[3] "Whereas nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke. Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface."

Hydrogen regeneration leads to improved stability in the propane dehydrogenation process by removing low dense coke components and altering the coke's property through hydrogenation, thus increasing the mobility and accessibility of metal active centers. In contrast, nitrogen regeneration only removes low dense coke components, while coke-burning regeneration results in poor catalyst stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and the formation of a large Pt3Sn particle with a Sn-rich surface.

氢再生在丙烷裂解过程中通过移除低密度焦炭成分并使焦炭属性通过氢化改变，从而增加金属活性中心的移动性和可访问性，从而提高稳定性。相比之下，氮气再生仅去除低密度焦炭成分，而燃烧焦炭再生会导致催化剂稳定性差，由于金属聚集、相分离和形成含有Sn富表面的大Pt3Sn颗粒。
