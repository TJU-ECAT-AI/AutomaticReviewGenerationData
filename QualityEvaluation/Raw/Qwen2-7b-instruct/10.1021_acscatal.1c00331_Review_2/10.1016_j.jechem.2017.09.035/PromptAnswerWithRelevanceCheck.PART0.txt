[1] "The catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment."
[2] "Using hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst."
[3] "Hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers."
[4] "Although nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke."
[5] "Coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation by removing the low dense components of the coke, altering the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, which leads to a higher mobility of coke. This increases the accessibility of the metal active centers, contributing to better catalyst stability and performance.

2. The hydrogen regeneration process maintains the size and structure of the metal active center, preserving the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst. This ensures minimal impact on the catalytic activity.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding not only removes the low dense components of the coke but also modifies the residual coke through hydrogenation, increasing its mobility. This transformation enhances the accessibility of the metal active centers, improving the overall process efficiency.

4. Nitrogen regeneration only removes the low dense components of the coke, without altering the coke's properties or mobility.

5. Coke-burning regeneration leads to complete coke removal. However, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox conditions exhibits poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and the formation of large Pt3Sn particles and core-shell structures with a Sn-rich surface.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢共喂养通过去除焦炭中的低密度成分，并通过氢化改变剩余焦炭的性质，从而提高焦炭的流动性。这增加了活性金属中心的可接近性，有助于催化剂稳定性与性能的改善。

2. 氢再生过程保持了金属活性中心的尺寸和结构，保留了有效的PtSn相在催化剂上的存在。这意味着对催化剂活性的影响最小。

3. 氢共喂养不仅移除了焦炭中的低密度成分，还通过氢化改变了剩余焦炭的性质，提高了焦炭的流动性。这种转变增强了活性金属中心的可接近性，提高了整体工艺效率。

4. 氮再生仅移除了焦炭中的低密度成分，而没有改变焦炭的性质或流动性。

5. 焦炭燃烧再生导致完全的焦炭移除。然而，在反复氧化还原条件下使用的催化剂显示出较差的稳定性，由于金属聚集、相分离和形成较大的Pt3Sn颗粒以及表面富含Sn的核心壳结构。

The hydrogen regeneration process in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen regeneration leads to the removal of low-density coke components and alters the coke's properties through hydrogenation. This results in an increase in coke mobility, thereby enhancing the accessibility of the metal active centers. This process improves catalyst stability and efficiency. In contrast, nitrogen regeneration only removes the low-density components of coke without altering its properties. Coke-burning regeneration, while thoroughly removing coke, causes catalyst instability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and the formation of large Pt 3 Sn particles and core-shell structures with a Sn-rich surface. These factors negatively impact the catalyst's performance and stability.

氢再生过程在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中显著影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢再生不仅去除低密度焦炭成分，还通过氢化改变焦炭的性质，从而增加焦炭的流动性，进而提高金属活性中心的可接近性。这一过程改善了催化剂的稳定性和效率。相比之下，氮再生仅去除低密度的焦炭成分，并不改变其性质。燃烧再生虽然能彻底去除焦炭，但会导致催化剂不稳定，因为金属团聚、相分离以及形成大的Pt 3 Sn颗粒和具有富锡表面的核心壳结构。这些因素对催化剂性能和稳定性产生负面影响。
