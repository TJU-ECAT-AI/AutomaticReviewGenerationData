[1] "The catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers."
[3] "Using hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst."
[4] "Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by removing low dense components of coke and altering the property of residual coke through hydrogenation. This leads to a higher mobility of coke, increasing the accessibility of metal active centers. Hydrogen regeneration maintains the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts without impacting the size and structure of metal active centers. However, repeated redox regeneration causes metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and results in a large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface, leading to poor catalyst stability.

氢共给在丙烷脱氢过程中，通过去除焦炭的低密度成分并利用氢化改变剩余焦炭的性质，提高了焦炭的流动性，从而增加了金属活性中心的可接近性。氢再生能够维持铂锡/γ-氧化铝催化剂的性能，而不会影响金属活性中心的大小和结构。然而，反复还原氧化导致金属团聚、相分离，并产生较大的Pt3Sn颗粒和具有Sn富集表面的核心壳结构，导致催化剂稳定性变差。
