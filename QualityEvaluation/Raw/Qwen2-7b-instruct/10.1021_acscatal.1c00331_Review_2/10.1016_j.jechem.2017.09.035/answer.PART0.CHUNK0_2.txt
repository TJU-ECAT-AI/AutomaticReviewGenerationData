[1] "The characterization results demonstrated that using hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst."
[2] "Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers."
[3] "Whereas nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke."
[4] "Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt 3 Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface."

The hydrogen regeneration process in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen regeneration leads to the removal of low-density coke components and alters the coke's properties through hydrogenation. This results in an increase in coke mobility, thereby enhancing the accessibility of the metal active centers. This process improves catalyst stability and efficiency. In contrast, nitrogen regeneration only removes the low-density components of coke without altering its properties. Coke-burning regeneration, while thoroughly removing coke, causes catalyst instability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation, and the formation of large Pt 3 Sn particles and core-shell structures with a Sn-rich surface. These factors negatively impact the catalyst's performance and stability.

氢再生过程在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中显著影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢再生不仅去除低密度焦炭成分，还通过氢化改变焦炭的性质，从而增加焦炭的流动性，进而提高金属活性中心的可接近性。这一过程改善了催化剂的稳定性和效率。相比之下，氮再生仅去除低密度的焦炭成分，并不改变其性质。燃烧再生虽然能彻底去除焦炭，但会导致催化剂不稳定，因为金属团聚、相分离以及形成大的Pt 3 Sn颗粒和具有富锡表面的核心壳结构。这些因素对催化剂性能和稳定性产生负面影响。
