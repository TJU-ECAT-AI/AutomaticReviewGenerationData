[1] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."
[2] "With the addition of 1 wt % Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst."
[3] "With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt %), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to superfluous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually."
[4] "The optimal loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation."

1. The addition of Gallium (Ga) to the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst enhances the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by increasing propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.
2. Adding 1 wt % of Ga leads to unsatisfactory composition of the PtGa alloy and reduced reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2, causing low catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst.
3. Excessive addition of Ga, such as 5 wt %, results in a higher ratio of Ga/Pt, which blocks Pt active sites, causing decreased activity and stability in the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst.
4. The optimal Ga loading is approximately 3 wt %, which achieves the highest propylene selectivity and best catalytic stability against coke accumulation in the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst.

1. 添加镓（Ga）到Pt/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂中可以提高PDH过程中的催化性能，包括增加丙烯选择性和增强催化稳定性。
2. 添加1 wt %的Ga导致PtGa合金组成不佳和Ga修饰的CeO2还原性降低，造成Pt1Ga/CeAl催化剂的低催化稳定性和丙烯选择性。
3. 过量添加Ga，例如5 wt %，导致Ga/Pt比例过高，阻塞Pt活性位点，使Pt5Ga/CeAl催化剂的活性和稳定性下降。
4. 最佳的Ga加载量约为3 wt %，这可以在Pt3Ga/CeAl催化剂中实现最高的丙烯选择性和最好的抗结焦催化稳定性。
