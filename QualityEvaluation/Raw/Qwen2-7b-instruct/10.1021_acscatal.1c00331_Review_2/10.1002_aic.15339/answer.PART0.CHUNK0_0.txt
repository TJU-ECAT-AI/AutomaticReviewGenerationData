[1] "In comparison to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivities toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) decrease severely over the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, meaning that the Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively."
[2] "With respect to the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst, an increased propylene selectivity of the catalyst was observed throughout the course of reaction."
[3] "Addition of Ga shifts the reduction peak of CeO2 from 620 °C (Pt/CeAl) to lower temperatures, 596-609 °C (PtxGa/CeAl). Moreover, the peak area dramatically increased after addition of Ga, indicating more lattice O can be reduced from CeO2."
[4] "The amount of coke deposits on catalysts is in accordance with the catalytic stability. Note that the addition of CeO2 have negligible influence to the Pt:Ga ratio, 1:1 mol ratio, in the alloy particles as indicated by TEM/EDX experiment (Figure 10)."

1. The addition of gallium (Ga) in the Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst effectively suppresses the formation of light hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, enhancing propylene selectivity.
2. The introduction of Ga leads to a reduction peak shift of ceria (CeO2) at lower temperatures, facilitating its reduction and improving catalytic stability.
3. Ga addition increases the lattice oxygen (O) in ceria, enhancing its reducibility and thus preventing coke formation.
4. The addition of Ga does not significantly alter the Pt:Ga ratio in alloy particles, ensuring consistent catalytic performance across different catalyst formulations.

1. 铟（Ga）添加到Pt/Ga/Al2O3催化剂中，有效地抑制了轻烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的生成，提高了丙烯的选择性。
2. Ga的引入使氧化铈（CeO2）的还原峰温度降低，促进其还原，从而提高催化稳定性。
3. Ga添加增加了氧化铈的晶格氧含量，增强其可还原性，防止结焦形成。
4. Ga的添加不会显著改变合金颗粒中的Pt:Ga比例，确保不同催化剂配方的一致性能。
