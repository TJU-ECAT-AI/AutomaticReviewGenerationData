[1] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."
[2] "With the addition of 1 wt % Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst."
[3] "With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt %), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to superfluous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually. Therefore, the decreased activity and considerably low stability are obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst."
[4] "The optimal loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation."

1. The addition of Gallium (Ga) enhances the performance of Platinum (Pt) catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), increasing propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.

2. Adding 1% Ga did not provide optimal results. It failed to achieve a suitable composition of PtGa alloy and satisfactory reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2, resulting in lower catalytic stability and propylene selectivity.

3. Excessive Ga addition, particularly to 5% content, led to an imbalance in the Ga/Pt ratio. This caused superfluous Ga atoms to block Pt active sites, decreasing activity and stability.

4. The best catalytic performance was achieved with a Ga loading of approximately 3%. This resulted in maximum propylene selectivity and the highest stability against coke accumulation.

1. 添加镓（Ga）可以提高铂（Pt）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的性能，增加丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。

2. 添加1%的Ga未能提供满意的结果。它既没有达到合适的PtGa合金组成，也没有实现Ga改性CeO2的满意还原性，导致催化稳定性降低和丙烯选择性较差。

3. 过量的Ga添加，特别是到5%的含量，导致了Ga/Pt比例的失衡。这导致多余的Ga原子阻塞了Pt活性位点，降低了活性和稳定性。

4. 最佳的催化性能是在大约3%的Ga负载下实现的。这导致最大丙烯选择性和最高的抗结焦稳定性。
