[1] "In comparison to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivities toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) decrease severely over the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, meaning that the Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively."
[2] "With respect to the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst, an increased propylene selectivity of the catalyst was observed throughout the course of reaction."
[3] "Addition of Ga shifts the reduction peak of CeO2 from 620 °C (Pt/CeAl) to lower temperatures, 596-609 °C (PtxGa/CeAl). Moreover, the peak area dramatically increased after addition of Ga, indicating more lattice O can be reduced from CeO2."
[4] "The amount of coke deposits on catalysts is in accordance with the catalytic stability. Note that the addition of CeO2 have negligible influence to the Pt:Ga ratio, 1:1 mol ratio, in the alloy particles as indicated by TEM/EDX experiment (Figure 10)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The addition of gallium (Ga) in the Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst effectively suppresses the formation of light hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, enhancing propylene selectivity.
2. The introduction of Ga leads to a reduction peak shift of ceria (CeO2) at lower temperatures, facilitating its reduction and improving catalytic stability.
3. Ga addition increases the lattice oxygen (O) in ceria, enhancing its reducibility and thus preventing coke formation.
4. The addition of Ga does not significantly alter the Pt:Ga ratio in alloy particles, ensuring consistent catalytic performance across different catalyst formulations.

How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?

The literature does not provide specific information about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. It focuses on the effects of gallium (Ga) doping on Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts. Gallium doping improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing catalytic stability. XRD results show that Ga31 cations are incorporated into the host lattice structure of ceria (CeO2), enhancing the redox property of the catalysts. The doping of Ga enhances the redox property of catalysts and modifies the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles. The addition of Ga forms PtGa alloys, which have a combination of geometric and electronic effects that contribute to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles, blocking low-coordinated defect active sites, and suppressing structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. The electronic effect of the promoter lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors, hindering their adsorption on metal sites and decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking. These effects imply improvements in the overall process efficiency and performance by enhancing propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，考虑到其对能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有何影响？

文献没有提供关于氢共喂养如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。它主要关注了镓（Ga）掺杂对Pt/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂的影响。镓掺杂提高了Pt催化剂在PDH过程中的催化性能，增加了丙烯选择性和增强了催化剂稳定性。X射线衍射（XRD）结果表明，Ga31阳离子被整合到氧化铈（CeO2）的主晶格结构中，增强了催化剂的还原性质。镓掺杂增强了催化剂的还原性质并修改了铂纳米颗粒的催化特性。添加Ga形成PtGa合金，这具有几何和电子效应的组合，有助于减少铂簇的尺寸，阻塞低配位缺陷活性位点，并抑制结构敏感侧反应如氢解离和深度脱氢。电子效应的促进剂降低了烯烃和焦炭前体的脱附壁垒，阻碍了它们在金属位点上的吸附，从而减少了氢解离和结焦的可能性。这些效果意味着通过提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性来增强整体过程效率和性能。

[1] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."
[2] "With the addition of 1 wt % Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst."
[3] "With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt %), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to superfluous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually. Therefore, the decreased activity and considerably low stability are obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst."

1. The addition of Gallium (Ga) enhances the performance of Platinum (Pt) catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), increasing propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.

2. Adding 1% Ga did not provide optimal results. It failed to achieve a suitable composition of PtGa alloy and satisfactory reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2, resulting in lower catalytic stability and propylene selectivity.

3. Excessive Ga addition, particularly to 5% content, led to an imbalance in the Ga/Pt ratio. This caused superfluous Ga atoms to block Pt active sites, decreasing activity and stability.

4. The best catalytic performance was achieved with a Ga loading of approximately 3%. This resulted in maximum propylene selectivity and the highest stability against coke accumulation.

4. 最佳的催化性能是在大约3%的Ga负载下实现的。这导致最大丙烯选择性和最高的抗结焦稳定性。

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance in several ways:

1. **Energy Barriers**: By modifying the energy barriers associated with various reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the rates at which molecules react, potentially reducing the likelihood of unwanted side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, which contribute to coke formation.

2. **Coke Accumulation Patterns**: Hydrogen cofeeding can alter the patterns of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. By influencing the balance between reaction rates and coke removal mechanisms, it can either slow down coke buildup or facilitate its removal, thus impacting catalyst stability.

3. **Acid Site Conversions**: The presence of hydrogen can affect the nature of acid sites on the catalyst surface. These sites play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reactions and can be influenced by hydrogen, potentially changing the reaction pathways and affecting the selectivity towards desired products.

4. **Graphitization**: Hydrogen cofeeding can impact the degree of graphitization of the catalyst material, which is another factor affecting both the efficiency and longevity of the catalyst. Graphitization can lead to a loss of active sites and increased coke formation.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes can lead to changes in the kinetic behavior of the reactions, the distribution and reactivity of coke, and the overall stability of the catalyst, all of which are critical factors determining the efficiency and performance of the PDH process.

氢共喂料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，进而影响整个过程的效率和性能：

1. **能量壁垒**：通过调整各种反应的相关能量壁垒，氢共喂料可以影响反应速率，可能降低氢解和深度脱氢等导致焦炭形成的副反应的几率。

2. **焦炭积累模式**：氢共喂料可以改变焦炭沉积在催化剂表面的模式。通过调节反应速率与焦炭去除机制之间的平衡，它既可以减缓焦炭积聚的速度，也可以促进其去除，从而影响催化剂稳定性。

3. **酸性位点转化**：氢的存在可以影响催化剂表面的酸性位点性质。这些位点对于脱氢反应至关重要，并且受氢的影响，可能会改变反应路径并影响目标产物的选择性。

4. **石墨化**：氢共喂料可以影响催化剂材料的石墨化程度，这是决定催化剂效率和寿命的另一个关键因素。石墨化会导致活性位点的损失和焦炭形成增加。

综上所述，氢共喂料在PDH过程中可以导致反应动力学行为的变化、焦炭分布和活性的调整，以及催化剂的整体稳定性变化，这些都是决定PDH过程效率和性能的关键因素。
