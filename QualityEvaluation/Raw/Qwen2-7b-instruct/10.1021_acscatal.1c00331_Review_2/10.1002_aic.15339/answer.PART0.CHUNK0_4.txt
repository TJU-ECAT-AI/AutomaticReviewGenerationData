[1] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."
[2] "The OSC and OM results reveal that the doping of Ga enhances the redox property of catalysts. The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[3] "Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys."
[4] "The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation."
[5] "The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This impacts the overall process efficiency and performance in several ways:

1. **Energy Barriers**: By modifying the energy barriers associated with various reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can influence the rates at which molecules react, potentially reducing the likelihood of unwanted side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, which contribute to coke formation.

2. **Coke Accumulation Patterns**: Hydrogen cofeeding can alter the patterns of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. By influencing the balance between reaction rates and coke removal mechanisms, it can either slow down coke buildup or facilitate its removal, thus impacting catalyst stability.

3. **Acid Site Conversions**: The presence of hydrogen can affect the nature of acid sites on the catalyst surface. These sites play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reactions and can be influenced by hydrogen, potentially changing the reaction pathways and affecting the selectivity towards desired products.

4. **Graphitization**: Hydrogen cofeeding can impact the degree of graphitization of the catalyst material, which is another factor affecting both the efficiency and longevity of the catalyst. Graphitization can lead to a loss of active sites and increased coke formation.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes can lead to changes in the kinetic behavior of the reactions, the distribution and reactivity of coke, and the overall stability of the catalyst, all of which are critical factors determining the efficiency and performance of the PDH process.

氢共喂料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，进而影响整个过程的效率和性能：

1. **能量壁垒**：通过调整各种反应的相关能量壁垒，氢共喂料可以影响反应速率，可能降低氢解和深度脱氢等导致焦炭形成的副反应的几率。

2. **焦炭积累模式**：氢共喂料可以改变焦炭沉积在催化剂表面的模式。通过调节反应速率与焦炭去除机制之间的平衡，它既可以减缓焦炭积聚的速度，也可以促进其去除，从而影响催化剂稳定性。

3. **酸性位点转化**：氢的存在可以影响催化剂表面的酸性位点性质。这些位点对于脱氢反应至关重要，并且受氢的影响，可能会改变反应路径并影响目标产物的选择性。

4. **石墨化**：氢共喂料可以影响催化剂材料的石墨化程度，这是决定催化剂效率和寿命的另一个关键因素。石墨化会导致活性位点的损失和焦炭形成增加。

综上所述，氢共喂料在PDH过程中可以导致反应动力学行为的变化、焦炭分布和活性的调整，以及催化剂的整体稳定性变化，这些都是决定PDH过程效率和性能的关键因素。
