The study reveals the Janus character of the coke precursor in propane direct dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts through kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. It examines how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The simulations consider energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, providing insights into their implications on process efficiency and performance.
