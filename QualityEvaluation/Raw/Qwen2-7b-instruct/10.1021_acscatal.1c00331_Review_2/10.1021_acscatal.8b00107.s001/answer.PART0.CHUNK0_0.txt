The document explores the impact of hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. It considers the effects on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. These factors influence the overall process efficiency and performance. The study utilizes kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to analyze the processes involved in propane direct dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts. It examines the energy pathways for C-H and C-C bond breaking, the coverage of adsorption species over time, and the count of reactions under varying pressures of hydrogen. Additionally, it investigates the flow direction of carbon species during PDH at specific time points and the geometries of transition states in the C-H breaking reactions of C2 and C1 species.
