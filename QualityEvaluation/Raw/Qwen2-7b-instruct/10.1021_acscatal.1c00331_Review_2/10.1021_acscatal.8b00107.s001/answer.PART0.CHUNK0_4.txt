The coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process are significantly influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the energy barriers for C-H and C-C breaking reactions, potentially affecting the rate and pattern of coke accumulation. It also impacts the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which could lead to changes in the catalyst's reactivity and stability. The flow direction of carbon species within the PDH process at specific times can reveal insights into the dynamics of the reaction. Moreover, the geometries of transition states in C-H breaking reactions for both C2 and C1 species can provide information about the activation energies and reaction pathways involved in the PDH process. These effects collectively influence the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process by altering the kinetics, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system.
