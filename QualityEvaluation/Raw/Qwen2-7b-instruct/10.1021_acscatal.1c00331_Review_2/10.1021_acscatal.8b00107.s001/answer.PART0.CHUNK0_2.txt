The literature provides detailed calculations for the pre-exponential factor in various surface reactions, including activated, non-activated adsorption reactions, and lateral interactions of co-adsorption species on Pt(111). It also includes data on the count of reactions under different pressures of hydrogen, as well as visual representations of the minimum energy pathways for C-H and C-C breaking, coverage of adsorption species over time, reaction counts under different hydrogen pressures, and the flow direction of C species during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at specific time points. However, the document does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications on process efficiency and performance. The information provided focuses more on the fundamental aspects of the PDH process and related thermodynamic and kinetic calculations rather than the specific impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on the mentioned aspects.

文献提供了各种表面反应，包括活化、非活化吸附反应和Pt(111)上的共吸附物种横向相互作用的预指数因子的详细计算。它还包括在不同氢气压力下反应计数的数据，以及C-H和C-C断裂的最小能量路径的视觉表示，吸附物种覆盖随时间的变化，不同氢气压力下的反应计数，以及PDH过程中特定时间点C物种的流动方向。然而，文档并未直接探讨氢气共给料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机制、能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位转换、石墨化以及过程效率和性能的影响。提供的信息更侧重于PDH过程的基本方面以及相关的热力学和动力学计算，而不是上述方面的具体影响。
