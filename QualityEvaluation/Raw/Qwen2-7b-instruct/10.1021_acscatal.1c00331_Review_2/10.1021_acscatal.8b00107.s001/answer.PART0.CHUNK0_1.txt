The literature provides detailed calculations and analysis regarding the propane direct dehydrogenation process on Pt catalysts. It explains how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by examining energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The document offers insights into the overall process efficiency and performance through these examinations.
