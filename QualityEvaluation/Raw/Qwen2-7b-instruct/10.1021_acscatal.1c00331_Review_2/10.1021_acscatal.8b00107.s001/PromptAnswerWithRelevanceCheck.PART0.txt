The literature provides detailed calculations for the pre-exponential factor in various surface reactions, including activated, non-activated adsorption reactions, and lateral interactions of co-adsorption species on Pt(111). It also includes data on the count of reactions under different pressures of hydrogen, as well as visual representations of the minimum energy pathways for C-H and C-C breaking, coverage of adsorption species over time, reaction counts under different hydrogen pressures, and the flow direction of C species during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at specific time points. However, the document does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications on process efficiency and performance. The information provided focuses more on the fundamental aspects of the PDH process and related thermodynamic and kinetic calculations rather than the specific impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on the mentioned aspects.

文献提供了各种表面反应，包括活化、非活化吸附反应和Pt(111)上的共吸附物种横向相互作用的预指数因子的详细计算。它还包括在不同氢气压力下反应计数的数据，以及C-H和C-C断裂的最小能量路径的视觉表示，吸附物种覆盖随时间的变化，不同氢气压力下的反应计数，以及PDH过程中特定时间点C物种的流动方向。然而，文档并未直接探讨氢气共给料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机制、能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位转换、石墨化以及过程效率和性能的影响。提供的信息更侧重于PDH过程的基本方面以及相关的热力学和动力学计算，而不是上述方面的具体影响。

The coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process are significantly influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen cofeeding can reduce the energy barriers for C-H and C-C breaking reactions, potentially affecting the rate and pattern of coke accumulation. It also impacts the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which could lead to changes in the catalyst's reactivity and stability. The flow direction of carbon species within the PDH process at specific times can reveal insights into the dynamics of the reaction. Moreover, the geometries of transition states in C-H breaking reactions for both C2 and C1 species can provide information about the activation energies and reaction pathways involved in the PDH process. These effects collectively influence the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process by altering the kinetics, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过氢气共喂料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了显著影响。氢气共喂料可以降低C-H和C-C断裂反应的能量壁垒，可能影响焦炭积累的速度和模式。它还会影响催化剂表面酸性位点的转化，这可能导致催化活性和稳定性的变化。在PDH过程中的特定时间点上碳物种的流动方向可以揭示反应动力学的见解。此外，C2和C1物种中C-H断裂反应的过渡态几何形状提供了关于PDH过程中激活能和反应途径的信息。这些效应共同影响PDH过程的整体效率和性能，通过改变动力学、选择性和催化系统的稳定性。
