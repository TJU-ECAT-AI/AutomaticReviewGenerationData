How do bimetallic catalysts containing Pt and a second metal, specifically Pt-Sn catalysts, exhibit modified properties?

</questions>

<quotes>
"In Pt-Re catalysts it has been observed that the Re is reduced to the zero-valent state, and the formation of Pt-Re alloy particles has been postulated to explain the modification of the catalytic properties (I ). Pt-Sn catalysts also exhibit modified properties and it has been suggested that the formation of Pt-Sn alloy particles is again responsible (24)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In Pt-Re catalysts, Ruthenium is observed to be reduced to the zero-valent state, and the creation of Pt-Re alloy particles is theorized to account for the modification of catalytic properties. Similarly, Pt-Sn catalysts display altered properties, with the hypothesis that the formation of Pt-Sn alloy particles is the cause.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在Pt-Re催化剂中，观察到Ruthenium被还原至零价状态，并且形成了Pt-Re合金颗粒，这一现象被解释为催化性能改变的原因（I）。Pt-Sn催化剂也表现出修改后的性质，有人提出Pt-Sn合金颗粒的形成是再次导致这种变化的原因（24）。

What is the main advantage of bimetallic catalysts containing Pt and a second metal?

</questions>

<quotes>
"The major advantage of the bimetallic catalysts seems to be their lower rates of deactivation and their higher selectivity to aromatic products."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary benefit of bimetallic catalysts containing Pt and a second metal appears to be their slower deactivation rates and higher selectivity for aromatic products.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
双金属催化剂中含有的Pt和第二金属的主要优势似乎是它们较低的失活速率和更高的芳烃选择性。

What are the key findings regarding the activity and selectivity of the Pt-Sn catalysts in the conversion of n-hexane?

</questions>

<quotes>
"Under steady-state conditions the bimetallic catalyst is much more likely to isomerise the C5 ring to a Cs ring than it is to open the ring: benzene is formed at the expense of C6 paraffins."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Under steady-state conditions, the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst significantly favors the isomerization of the C5 ring to a Cs ring over ring opening, leading to the formation of benzene at the expense of C6 paraffins.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在稳态条件下，Pt-Sn双金属催化剂更倾向于将C5环异构化为Cs环而非开环：苯的形成导致C6烷基的损失。

What is the role of tin in Pt-Sn catalysts according to the experimental findings?

</questions>

<quotes>
"We conclude that tin modifies the properties of a Pt/alumina catalyst in two ways. It modifies the acidity of the support, and it modifies the Pt electronically with the result that self-poisoning is reduced, and selectivity for nondestructive reactions is increased."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We conclude that tin in Pt-Sn catalysts modifies the catalyst in two aspects: it alters the acidity of the support, and it electronically modifies the Pt, thus decreasing self-poisoning and enhancing selectivity for non-destructive reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
我们得出结论，锡在Pt-Sn催化剂中的作用是在两个方面进行修改：它改变了支持物的酸度，并通过电子方式修改了Pt，从而减少了自我中毒并提高了非破坏性反应的选择性。
