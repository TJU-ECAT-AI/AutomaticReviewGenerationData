[1] "Under these experimental conditions it has been established that the conversion of n-hexane into branched aliphatic isomers is catalysed by a bifunctional mechanism, but excess acidity gives lower selectivity due to enhanced cracking."
[2] "Benzene and methylcyclopentane are formed directly from n-hexane on metal sites and do not require acidic sites."
[3] "The results show that when tin is present the catalysts are much more stable, and have much higher selectivities for isomerisation and aromatisation reactions."
[4] "Taking account of the fact that the tin is mainly present in these catalysts as Sn(II) (see Part I), stabilised by the alumina, it is concluded that the catalytic results cannot be rationalised on the basis of current geometrical models for bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "It is concluded that tin modifies the acidity of the support,resulting in higher selectivity for isomerisation and lower selectivity for cracking, and also modifies the properties of the Pt, resulting in less self-poisoning."

1. Under certain conditions, the conversion of n-hexane into branched aliphatic isomers occurs through a bifunctional mechanism. Excess acidity, however, leads to lower selectivity due to enhanced cracking.
2. Benzene and methylcyclopentane are formed directly from n-hexane on metal sites, without needing acidic sites.
3. The presence of tin in the catalysts significantly improves their stability and selectivity for isomerisation and aromatisation reactions.
4. Considering that tin is mainly present as Sn(II) stabilized by alumina, the catalytic outcomes cannot be explained by existing geometric models for bimetallic catalysts.
5. Tin alters the acidity of the support, enhancing isomerisation selectivity while reducing cracking selectivity. Additionally, it modifies the Pt properties, decreasing self-poisoning.

1. 在某些条件下，正庚烷转化为支链直链异构体通过双功能机制进行。过量酸性导致选择性降低，因为裂解增强。
2. 苯和甲基环戊烷直接在金属位点上从正庚烷形成，不需要酸性位点。
3. 锡的存在显著提高了催化剂的稳定性和异构化反应、芳构化反应的选择性。
4. 考虑到锡主要以Sn(II)形式存在，并且被氧化铝稳定，催化结果不能用现有双金属催化剂的几何模型来解释。
5. 锡改变了支持物的酸性，提高了异构化选择性同时减少了裂解选择性。此外，它还改变了铂的性质，降低了自我中毒。
