[1] "Under these experimental conditions it has been established that the conversion of n-hexane into branched aliphatic isomers is catalysed by a bifunctional mechanism, but excess acidity gives lower selectivity due to enhanced cracking."
[2] "Benzene and methylcyclopentane are formed directly from n- hexane on metal sites and do not require acidic sites."
[3] "The results show that when tin is present the catalysts are much more stable, and have much higher selectivities for isomerisation and aromatisation reactions."
[4] "The Pt-Sn catalysts produce more benzene from methylcyclopentane, they dehydrogenate faster, and they hydrogenate more slowly."
[5] "Taking account of the fact that the tin is mainly present in these catalysts as Sn(II) (see Part I), stabilised by the alumina, it is concluded that the catalytic results cannot be rationalised on the basis of current geometrical models for bimetallic catalysts."

1. Under certain experimental conditions, n-hexane conversion into branched aliphatic isomers is facilitated by a dual-function mechanism, yet excessive acidity diminishes selectivity due to accelerated cracking.
2. Benzene and methylcyclopentane are synthesized directly from n-hexane on metallic sites without needing acidic sites.
3. Incorporating tin enhances the stability of the catalysts, leading to higher selectivity for isomerization and aromatization reactions.
4. Pt-Sn catalysts yield more benzene from methylcyclopentane, exhibit faster dehydrogenation, and slower hydrogenation compared to single-metal catalysts.
5. Considering that tin primarily exists as Sn(II) stabilized by alumina, the observed catalytic outcomes cannot be explained by existing models for bimetallic catalysts.

1. 在某些实验条件下，n-己烷转化为支链烷烃是由双功能机制催化的，但过高的酸性会导致选择性降低，因为裂解加速。
2. 苯和甲基环戊烷直接在金属位点上由n-己烷合成，不需要酸性位点。
3. 添加锡可以提高催化剂的稳定性，并显著提升异构化和芳构化反应的选择性。
4. Pt-Sn催化剂从甲基环戊烷中产生更多的苯，表现出更快的脱氢和更慢的氢化速率与单一金属催化剂相比。
5. 鉴于锡主要以Sn(II)形式存在，稳定于氧化铝中，所观察到的催化结果无法用现有双金属催化剂模型来解释。
