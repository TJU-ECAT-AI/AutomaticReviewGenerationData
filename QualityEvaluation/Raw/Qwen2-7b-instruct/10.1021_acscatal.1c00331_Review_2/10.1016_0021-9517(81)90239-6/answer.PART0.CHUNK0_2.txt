Under these experimental conditions it has been established that the conversion of n-hexane into branched aliphatic isomers is catalysed by a bifunctional mechanism, but excess acidity gives lower selectivity due to enhanced cracking. Benzene and methylcyclopentane are formed directly from n- hexane on metal sites and do not require acidic sites. The conversion of methylcyclopentane into benzene is bifunctional. The results show that when tin is present the catalysts are much more stable, and have much higher selectivities for isomerisation and aromatisation reactions. The Pt-Sn catalysts produce more benzene from methylcyclopentane, they dehydrogenate faster, and they hydrogenate more slowly. At a given conversion the bimetallic catalysts produce much lower concentrations of cracked products. It is concluded that tin modifies the acidity of the support,resulting in higher selectivity for isomerisation and lower selectivity for cracking, and also modifies the properties of the Pt, resulting in less self-poisoning.

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It leads to higher selectivity for isomerization and aromatization reactions, and increases the stability and activity of the catalysts. The presence of tin modifies the acidity of the support, enhancing isomerization and reducing cracking. This results in higher selectivity for isomerization and lower selectivity for cracking, leading to less self-poisoning of the Pt catalyst. The Pt-Sn catalysts produce more benzene from methylcyclopentane, dehydrogenate faster, and hydrogenate more slowly compared to the base catalyst. This results in lower concentrations of cracked products at a given conversion.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢的共喂养影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化。它导致异构化和芳构化反应的选择性更高，并且提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。锡的存在改变了支持物的酸性，增强了异构化并减少了裂解。这导致异构化选择性更高，裂解选择性更低，从而减少了铂催化剂的自中毒。含锡的Pt催化剂从甲基环戊烷中产生更多的苯，脱氢速度更快，氢化速度更慢，与基催化剂相比，在给定转化率下产生的裂解产物浓度更低。
