[1] "To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the electronic properties of Pt particles [1316]."
[2] "Moreover, alkali (Li, Na, K), alkali earth (Mg, Ca), and rare earth (La, Ce) metals were employed to modify the properties of the support [1726]."
[3] "Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces [1,8,13,14]."
[4] "However, there was a lack of explanation of the location of abundant Alp sites and acid-base properties of the alumina surface."
[5] "We intended to contribute to improving the activity,selectivity, and stability of catalysts by characterizing and controlling the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces."

The document explains how modifying platinum-based catalysts with additives such as tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), alkali metals (Li, Na, K), alkali earth metals (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metals (La, Ce) can enhance their properties. Specifically, tin is noted to neutralize acid sites on alumina surfaces, aiding in hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitating the migration of coke precursors from metal surfaces to support surfaces. The study aims to improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability by characterizing and controlling the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces.

文档解释了如何通过添加如锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、碱金属（Li、Na、K）、碱土金属（Mg、Ca）和稀土金属（La、Ce）等添加剂来增强铂基催化剂的性能。具体来说，锡被指出可以中和氧化铝表面的酸性位点，帮助烃类从金属表面脱附，并促进碳沉积前体从金属表面迁移到支撑表面。研究旨在通过表征和控制氧化铝表面的酸碱性质来提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
