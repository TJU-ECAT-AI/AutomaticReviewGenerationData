[1] "To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the electronic properties of Pt particles [1316]."
[2] "Moreover, alkali (Li, Na, K), alkali earth (Mg, Ca), and rare earth (La, Ce) metals were employed to modify the properties of the support [1726]."
[3] "Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces [1,8,13,14]."
[4] "However, there was a lack of explanation of the location of abundant Alp sites and acid-base properties of the alumina surface."

[1] "However, PDH,which affords high yields of propylene, is an endothermic reaction. It requires high reaction temperatures causing severe catalyst deactiva- tion by metal sintering and coke deposition formed through undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, and aromatization of light alkanes."
[2] "Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces."
[3] "Moreover, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 C clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at these sites."
[4] "Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen can help neutralize acid sites on the alumina surface, facilitate hydrocarbon desorption from the metal, and promote the migration of coke precursors from the metal surface to support surfaces. This leads to a reduction in coke deposition. The initiation of coke deposition starts from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, and subsequent aromatization occurs at these sites. Precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina contribute to the development of catalysts with high stability.

The study found that the addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically in PtSn/Al2O3 systems, aids in the neutralization of acid sites on the alumina surface. This property is crucial for improving the catalytic reactivity in PDH reactions. The researchers discovered that by modifying the acid-base properties of alumina, they could enhance the stability of the catalysts. Specifically, they noted that the gamma-Al2O3 derived from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) exhibited stronger and fewer Lewis acid sites compared to a commercial sample. This resulted in improved stability by suppressing metal sintering and coke accumulation. The study also provided direct evidence linking Lewis acid sites to coke behavior and explored the locations of abundant Alp sites on the alumina surface. These findings contribute to the development of more active, selective, and stable catalysts by controlling the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces.

研究发现，锡（Sn）添加到铂（Pt）催化剂中，特别是PtSn/Al2O3系统中，有助于中和氧化铝表面的酸性位点。这一特性对于提高丙烷脱氢反应中的催化活性至关重要。研究人员发现，通过调整氧化铝的酸碱性质，可以增强催化剂的稳定性。具体而言，他们注意到由铵铝碳酸氢盐（AACH）合成的γ-Al2O3具有更强、更少的路易斯酸位点，与商业样本相比。这导致了通过抑制金属团聚和焦炭积累而改善了稳定性。研究还提供了直接证据，证明路易斯酸位点与焦炭行为之间的关系，并探索了氧化铝表面的丰富Alp位点的位置。这些发现通过控制氧化铝表面的酸碱性质，为开发更活跃、选择性和稳定的催化剂做出了贡献。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This leads to implications on overall process efficiency and performance. By understanding the acid-base properties of alumina, researchers can develop catalysts with high stability and reduced coke deposition. The presence of alkali and alkali earth metals, as well as rare earth metals, modifies the properties of the support, enhancing stability through strong metal-support interactions. Sn in PtSn catalysts neutralizes acid sites on the alumina surface, aiding in hydrocarbon desorption and coke precursor migration. However, the exact location of abundant Alp sites and their acid-base properties remain unclear. Through the synthesis of high-surface area γ-Al2O3 from AACH, researchers aimed to improve catalyst stability by reducing sintering of PtSn alloy particles and coke accumulation, thus contributing to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH catalysts.
