The study found that the addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically in PtSn/Al2O3 systems, aids in the neutralization of acid sites on the alumina surface. This property is crucial for improving the catalytic reactivity in PDH reactions. The researchers discovered that by modifying the acid-base properties of alumina, they could enhance the stability of the catalysts. Specifically, they noted that the gamma-Al2O3 derived from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) exhibited stronger and fewer Lewis acid sites compared to a commercial sample. This resulted in improved stability by suppressing metal sintering and coke accumulation. The study also provided direct evidence linking Lewis acid sites to coke behavior and explored the locations of abundant Alp sites on the alumina surface. These findings contribute to the development of more active, selective, and stable catalysts by controlling the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces.

研究发现，锡（Sn）添加到铂（Pt）催化剂中，特别是PtSn/Al2O3系统中，有助于中和氧化铝表面的酸性位点。这一特性对于提高丙烷脱氢反应中的催化活性至关重要。研究人员发现，通过调整氧化铝的酸碱性质，可以增强催化剂的稳定性。具体而言，他们注意到由铵铝碳酸氢盐（AACH）合成的γ-Al2O3具有更强、更少的路易斯酸位点，与商业样本相比。这导致了通过抑制金属团聚和焦炭积累而改善了稳定性。研究还提供了直接证据，证明路易斯酸位点与焦炭行为之间的关系，并探索了氧化铝表面的丰富Alp位点的位置。这些发现通过控制氧化铝表面的酸碱性质，为开发更活跃、选择性和稳定的催化剂做出了贡献。
