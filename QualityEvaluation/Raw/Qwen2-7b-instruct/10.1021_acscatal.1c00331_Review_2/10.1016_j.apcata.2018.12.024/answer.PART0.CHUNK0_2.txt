[1] "To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the electronic properties of Pt particles."
[2] "Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces."
[3] "However, a fundamental understanding of the acid-base properties of Al2O3 for improving catalytic reactivity in alumina-based PDH catalysts has been yet to be developed."
[4] "Moreover, we provided the direct evidence of the relation between Lewis acid sites and coke behavior and investigated the locations of abundant Alp sites."

The document explains that modifying Pt-based catalysts with additives such as Sn, Ga, or Zn aims to enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. Specifically, for PtSn catalysts, Sn is known to neutralize acid sites on the alumina surface, aiding in hydrocarbon desorption and facilitating the movement of coke precursors from the metal surface to the support surfaces. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding regarding how the acid-base properties of alumina can improve catalytic reactivity in alumina-based PDH catalysts. The research provides evidence linking Lewis acid sites to coke behavior and investigates the locations of abundant Alp sites on the alumina surface.

文档说明，通过将添加剂如Sn、Ga或Zn添加到Pt基催化剂中以分散Pt团簇并改变Pt粒子的电子性质，可以提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。对于PtSn催化剂，Sn能中和氧化铝表面的酸性位点，促进烃类脱附，并有助于从金属表面到支撑表面的焦炭前体的迁移。然而，关于如何通过氧化铝的酸碱性质来改善基于氧化铝的PDH催化剂的催化活性，目前还缺乏基础的理解。研究提供了Lewis酸性位点与焦炭行为之间的直接证据，并调查了氧化铝表面丰富Alp位点的位置。
