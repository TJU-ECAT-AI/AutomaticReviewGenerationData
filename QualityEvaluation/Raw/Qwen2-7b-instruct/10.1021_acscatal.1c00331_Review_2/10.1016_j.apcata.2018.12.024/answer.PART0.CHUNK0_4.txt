Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. This leads to implications on overall process efficiency and performance. By understanding the acid-base properties of alumina, researchers can develop catalysts with high stability and reduced coke deposition. The presence of alkali and alkali earth metals, as well as rare earth metals, modifies the properties of the support, enhancing stability through strong metal-support interactions. Sn in PtSn catalysts neutralizes acid sites on the alumina surface, aiding in hydrocarbon desorption and coke precursor migration. However, the exact location of abundant Alp sites and their acid-base properties remain unclear. Through the synthesis of high-surface area γ-Al2O3 from AACH, researchers aimed to improve catalyst stability by reducing sintering of PtSn alloy particles and coke accumulation, thus contributing to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH catalysts.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的加入会影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸基转换和石墨化，从而对整体工艺效率和性能产生影响。通过理解氧化铝的酸碱性质，研究人员可以开发出具有高稳定性和减少焦炭沉积的催化剂。碱金属、碱土金属以及稀土金属的存在通过促进金属与支持物之间的强相互作用来修改支持物的性质，从而增强稳定性。在PtSn催化剂中，Sn中和了氧化铝表面的酸基，并有助于烃类脱附和焦炭前体从金属表面向支持表面迁移。然而，大量Alp位点的确切位置及其酸碱性质仍然不清楚。通过从AACH合成高表面积γ-Al2O3，研究者旨在通过减少PtSn合金颗粒的结块和焦炭积累来改善催化剂稳定性，从而为PDH催化剂提供增强的活性、选择性和稳定性，进而贡献于提高PDH工艺的整体效率和性能。
