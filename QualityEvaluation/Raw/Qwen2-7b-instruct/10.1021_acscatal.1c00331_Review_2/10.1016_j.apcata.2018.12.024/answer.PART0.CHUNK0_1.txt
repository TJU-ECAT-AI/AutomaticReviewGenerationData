[1] "However, PDH,which affords high yields of propylene, is an endothermic reaction. It requires high reaction temperatures causing severe catalyst deactiva- tion by metal sintering and coke deposition formed through undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, and aromatization of light alkanes."
[2] "Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces."
[3] "Moreover, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 C clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at these sites."
[4] "Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by influencing energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. Hydrogen can help neutralize acid sites on the alumina surface, facilitate hydrocarbon desorption from the metal, and promote the migration of coke precursors from the metal surface to support surfaces. This leads to a reduction in coke deposition. The initiation of coke deposition starts from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, and subsequent aromatization occurs at these sites. Precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina contribute to the development of catalysts with high stability.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过影响能量壁垒、焦炭沉积模式、酸位转换和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性及反应机制。氢可以中和氧化铝表面的酸位，促进金属中的烃类脱附，并促进焦炭前体从金属表面向支撑表面的迁移。这导致焦炭沉积减少。焦炭沉积从氧化铝表面的Lewis酸位开始，随后在这些位置发生芳香化。精确表征和理解氧化铝的酸碱性质有助于开发稳定性高的催化剂。
