[1] "The formation of single-atom Pt1 sites in PtZn IMAs significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."
[2] "No obvious deactivation was observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."
[3] "Based on in situ X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by significantly improving selectivity and stability. It prohibits coke side reactions, leading to a decrease in coke accumulation patterns and preventing acid site conversions. This results in a lower graphitization degree, enhancing overall process efficiency and performance.
