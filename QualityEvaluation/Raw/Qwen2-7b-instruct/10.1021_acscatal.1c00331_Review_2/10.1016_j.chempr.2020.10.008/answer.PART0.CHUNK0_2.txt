[1] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[2] "Isolating the active metal components into single atoms can maximize atomic efficiency, and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions with unprecedented selectivity."
[3] "In situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering."
[4] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.

2. The use of single-site intermetallic catalysts can enhance the efficiency of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. These catalysts isolate active metal components into single atoms, which can maximize atomic efficiency and inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation. The resulting catalysts exhibit unprecedented selectivity for the desired products.

3. The active site structures responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane are surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110). These ensembles are characterized by geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt sites, which readily promote the desorption of surface-bound propylene. This mechanism improves the stability of the catalyst by preventing coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms through structural ordering.

4. The long-term stability of the PtZn IMA catalysts under industrial conditions is demonstrated by minimal deactivation over a 160-hour test. The propylene selectivity remains high, with values reaching up to 97.2%. This indicates that the catalyst maintains its efficiency and stability under prolonged operation, outperforming other catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 in terms of deactivation rate and propylene productivity.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共喂养可以通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化来影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。它可能减少焦炭形成并抑制表面束缚丙烯进一步脱氢，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。具体影响取决于氢气和反应物之间的平衡，影响去活率和丙烯产率。

2. 单一网站金属间化合物的使用可以增强在高温下烷烃脱氢的效率。这些催化剂将活性金属成分隔离为单原子，可以最大化原子效率，并抑制结构敏感的副反应，如裂解和深度脱氢。由此产生的催化剂表现出前所未有的产物选择性。

3. 负责丙烷脱氢的活性位点结构是Pt1Zn1（110）表面上的[PtZn4]簇。这些簇由几何上孤立且电子富集的Pt位点组成，能够迅速促进表面束缚丙烯的脱附。这种机制通过结构排列防止焦炭形成和Pt和Zn原子的分离，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

4. 在工业条件下运行长达160小时的测试中，PtZn IMA催化剂显示出极小的去活率，仅为每小时0.04%。同时，丙烯选择性高达97.2%。这表明催化剂在长期运行中保持其效率和稳定性，优于其他催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3，在去活率和丙烯产率方面表现出色。
