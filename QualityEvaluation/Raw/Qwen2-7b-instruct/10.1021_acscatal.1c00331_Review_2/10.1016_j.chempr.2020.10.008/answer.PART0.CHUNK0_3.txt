[1] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
[2] "However, due to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations."
[3] "In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3"
[4] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
[5] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process can significantly reduce coke formation, as the isolated Pt1 site prevents further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby inhibiting coke side reactions. This leads to improved catalyst stability and enhanced selectivity towards propylene.

2. The hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects energy barriers by lowering them, facilitating easier desorption of surface-bound propylene. It also reduces the accumulation of acid sites, preventing their conversion into coke and inhibiting graphitization, which are detrimental to the overall process efficiency and performance.

3. In comparison to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the PtZn IMAs exhibit superior stability and selectivity, with a slight deactivation rate of 0.04% per hour after 160 hours of operation. This indicates that hydrogen cofeeding maintains the catalyst's performance over extended periods, enhancing the overall process efficiency.

4. The propylene selectivity maintained at 97.2% after 160 hours of operation signifies the high stability and selectivity of the PtZn IMAs under hydrogen cofeeding conditions. This high selectivity is crucial for maintaining optimal propylene production rates and minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

1. 在PDH过程中，氢共给可以显著减少焦炭形成。孤立的Pt1位点仅与深脱氢的C3H5（焦炭形成模型前体）上的单个Pt原子相互作用，而不是在Pt（111）上的3个更稳定的PtC交互作用，从而减少了碳沉积。

2. 氢共给影响能量壁垒，降低它们，使表面束缚丙烯更容易脱附。它也减少了酸位的积累，防止它们转化为焦炭并抑制石墨化，这对整个过程效率和性能至关重要。

3. 相比于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，PtZn IMAs表现出更高的稳定性和选择性，在160小时的操作后，仅出现了微小的降解率（0.04%每小时）。这表明氢共给保持了催化剂的性能，延长了操作时间，提高了整体过程效率。

4. 在160小时的操作后，保持97.2%的丙烯选择性，这表明在氢共给条件下，PtZn IMAs具有高稳定性和选择性。这种高选择性对于保持最佳丙烯生产速率和减少副产品形成至关重要。
