[1] "To further obtain information about different surface Pt ensembles over Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO adsorption. For Pt/SiO2, one CO adsorption peak appeared in CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) (Figure S5) at 2,075 cm−1, which was assigned to stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Pt ensembles with on-top modes."
[2] "Comparatively, for PtZn/SiO2, upon the increase of reduction temperatures, the CO adsorption band corresponding to Pt ensembles (2,075 cm−1) disappeared with an appearance of a new band feature at around 2,047 cm−1 (Figure S6)."
[3] "Noticeably, no position changes of this band was observed with the decrease of CO coverage during the 60 min purge (Figure 1D), indicating that the band at 2,047 cm−1 might have been assigned to the on-top CO adsorbed on the single-atom Pt1 site."
[4] "When testing for PDH, we evaluated the influence of Pt and Zn additions, H2 pressures, weight hourly velocity (WHSV) of propane, and reaction temperatures on propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[5] "Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h−1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is significantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2A) and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14)."
[6] "Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2B), indicating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs."
[7] "Moreover, the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with little deactivation at 520C (Figure S18) and 575C (Figure S19), respectively."
[8] "To further evaluate the stability of this PtZn IMA catalyst, we performed the long-term test under industrial operating conditions (600C, WHSV of C3H8=11 h−1, C3H8/H2 = 2/1, no inert gas dilution) and compared with the representative PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (see Experimental Procedures)."
[9] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
[10] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test (Figure 2C)."
