[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[3] "However, the loading of Pt is relatively high with about 9.53 wt %, which is far higher than that of the industrial Pt-based catalysts with the Pt loading of about 0.3 wt % in PtSn/Al2O3. This induces low olefin productivity and atom utilization."
[4] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[5] "No obvious deactivation was observed within the 160-h industrial PDH test. We reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can reduce the energy barrier for coke formation, facilitating its accumulation on the catalyst surface. This can lead to a decrease in alkene selectivity and catalyst stability, as coke accumulates and blocks active sites. Additionally, hydrogen can affect the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst, potentially leading to a shift in the reaction mechanism towards coke formation rather than the desired alkene production. Graphitization, a process where the catalyst structure becomes more ordered and less active, can also be influenced by hydrogen, affecting the catalyst's overall performance and efficiency.

In the context of the PtZn4 intermetallic catalyst described in the document, the use of hydrogen cofeeding might have implications for coke formation and catalyst stability. The high selectivity and stability of the catalyst, enabling more than 95% propylene selectivity over a broad temperature range and withstanding 160 hours of industrial testing without significant deactivation, suggests that the catalyst is robust against the potential negative effects of hydrogen. The active site structures, particularly the surface [PtZn4] ensembles, play a crucial role in promoting the desorption of surface-bound propylene and improving stability by inhibiting coke side reactions. This indicates that the catalyst design effectively manages the competing reactions, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity even under hydrogen cofeeding conditions.

The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance depend on the specific operational parameters, such as reaction temperature, hydrogen-to-propane ratio, and catalyst loading. The ability to maintain high propylene selectivity and stability under hydrogen cofeeding conditions suggests that the PtZn4 catalyst could be advantageous in PDH processes where hydrogen is used as a cofeed, potentially enhancing the economic viability and environmental footprint of the process by reducing the need for expensive hydrogen removal steps or by enabling the use of lower-quality feedstocks.

氢在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中会通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生影响。氢的存在可能降低形成焦炭的能量壁垒，促进其在催化剂表面的积累。这可能导致烯烃选择性的下降和催化剂稳定性的降低，因为焦炭积聚并堵塞活性位点。此外，氢还可能影响催化剂上的酸性位点转化，导致反应机制从预期的烯烃生成转向焦炭形成。石墨化过程，即催化剂结构变得更加有序且活性降低，也可能受氢的影响，从而影响催化剂的整体性能和效率。

根据文档中描述的PtZn4互金属催化剂，氢的共喂料可能会对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性产生影响。该催化剂能够实现超过95%的丙烯选择性，在广泛的温度范围内，并在长达160小时的工业测试中没有明显的失活迹象，这表明催化剂具有抵抗氢存在时潜在负面影响的强健性。表面[PtZn4]簇集作为稳定活性位点结构起着关键作用，通过促进表面吸附丙烯的脱附并抑制焦炭副反应来提高稳定性。这表明催化剂设计有效地管理了竞争反应，即使在氢共喂料条件下也能保持高效率和选择性。

这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响取决于特定的操作参数，如反应温度、氢与丙烷的比例和催化剂负载量。能够在氢共喂料条件下保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性的能力表明，PtZn4催化剂在使用氢作为共喂料的PDH过程中可能具有优势，有可能通过减少昂贵的氢去除步骤的需求或允许使用质量较低的原料来增强过程的经济可行性和环境足迹。

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.

[1] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
[2] "However, due to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations."
[3] "In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3"
[4] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."

[1] "To further obtain information about different surface Pt ensembles over Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO adsorption. For Pt/SiO2, one CO adsorption peak appeared in CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) (Figure S5) at 2,075 cm−1, which was assigned to stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Pt ensembles with on-top modes."

[7] "Moreover, the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with little deactivation at 520C (Figure S18) and 575C (Figure S19), respectively."
[8] "To further evaluate the stability of this PtZn IMA catalyst, we performed the long-term test under industrial operating conditions (600C, WHSV of C3H8=11 h−1, C3H8/H2 = 2/1, no inert gas dilution) and compared with the representative PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (see Experimental Procedures)."
[9] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
