          Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by significantly improving selectivity and stability. It prohibits coke side reactions, leading to a decrease in coke accumulation patterns and preventing acid site conversions. This results in a lower graphitization degree, enhancing overall process efficiency and performance.

          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
          [3] "However, the loading of Pt is relatively high with about 9.53 wt %, which is far higher than that of the industrial Pt-based catalysts with the Pt loading of about 0.3 wt % in PtSn/Al2O3. This induces low olefin productivity and atom utilization."
          [4] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
          [5] "No obvious deactivation was observed within the 160-h industrial PDH test. We reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The presence of hydrogen can reduce the energy barrier for coke formation, facilitating its accumulation on the catalyst surface. This can lead to a decrease in alkene selectivity and catalyst stability, as coke accumulates and blocks active sites. Additionally, hydrogen can affect the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst, potentially leading to a shift in the reaction mechanism towards coke formation rather than the desired alkene production. Graphitization, a process where the catalyst structure becomes more ordered and less active, can also be influenced by hydrogen, affecting the catalyst's overall performance and efficiency.

          氢在PDH过程中，通过改变能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制。氢的存在可能降低形成焦炭的能量壁垒，促进其在催化剂表面的积累。这可能导致烯烃选择性的下降和催化剂稳定性的降低，因为焦炭积聚并堵塞活性位点。此外，氢还可以影响催化剂上的酸性位点转化，可能导致反应机制从预期的烯烃生成转向焦炭形成。石墨化过程，即催化剂结构变得更加有序且活性降低，也可能受氢的影响，从而影响催化剂的整体性能和效率。

          [1] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
          [2] "Isolating the active metal components into single atoms can maximize atomic efficiency, and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions with unprecedented selectivity."
          [3] "In situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering."
          [4] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. It can potentially reduce coke formation and inhibit further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The precise impact depends on the balance between hydrogen and reactants, affecting the deactivation rate and propylene productivity.

          [1] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
          [2] "However, due to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations."
          [3] "In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3"
          [4] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."

          [1] "To further obtain information about different surface Pt ensembles over Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO adsorption."
          [2] "Comparatively, for PtZn/SiO2, upon the increase of reduction temperatures, the CO adsorption band corresponding to Pt ensembles (2,075 cm−1) disappeared with an appearance of a new band feature at around 2,047 cm−1 (Figure S6)."
          [3] "Noticeably, no position changes of this band was observed with the decrease of CO coverage during the 60 min purge (Figure 1D), indicating that the band at 2,047 cm−1 might have been assigned to the on-top CO adsorbed on the single-atom Pt1 site."
          [4] "When testing for PDH, we evaluated the influence of Pt and Zn additions, H2 pressures, weight hourly velocity (WHSV) of propane, and reaction temperatures on propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
          [5] "Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h−1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is significantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2A) and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14)."
          [6] "Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2B), indicating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs."
          [7] "Moreover, the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with little deactivation at 520C (Figure S18) and 575C (Figure S19), respectively."
          [8] "To further evaluate the stability of this PtZn IMA catalyst, we performed the long-term test under industrial operating conditions (600C, WHSV of C3H8=11 h−1, C3H8/H2 = 2/1, no inert gas dilution) and compared with the representative PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (see Experimental Procedures)."
          [9] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
          [10] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test (Figure 2C)."
