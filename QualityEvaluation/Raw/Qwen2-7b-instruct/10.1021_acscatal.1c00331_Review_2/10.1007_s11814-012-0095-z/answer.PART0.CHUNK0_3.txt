[1] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high yields of propylene."
[2] "The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic, tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers."
[3] "When used in appropriate levels, however, they could exhibit beneficial effects on catalyst performance without the adverse effects."
[4] "The addition of water as an oxygenated modifier to the feed in optimum amounts could result in a substantial reduction in coke formation as well as an increase in the catalyst activity."
[5] "The optimum amount of water was found to increase with increasing temperature."
[6] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[7] "The model predicts that adding water as an oxygenated additive up to the optimum levels would improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the energy barriers for coke gasification, thereby decreasing coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. This leads to improved catalyst stability and activity. Additionally, the presence of water enhances the gasification process, contributing to the reduction of coke formation. However, the benefits of water are offset by the potential for catalyst sintering at higher water levels. The optimum amount of water required for maximum propane conversion increases with the reaction temperature. By balancing the effects of coke gasification and sintering, water addition up to the optimal level can improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation, optimizing the overall process efficiency and performance.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过降低焦炭气化所需的能量壁垒，减少了催化剂表面的焦炭积累，从而影响了焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。此外，水的存在增强了气化过程，有助于减少焦炭形成。然而，水的好处被高于最佳水平时的催化剂结块所抵消。随着反应温度的增加，达到最大丙烷转化所需的水的最佳量也会增加。通过平衡焦炭气化和结块的作用，将水添加到最佳水平可以改善丙烷转化并减少焦炭形成，从而优化整个过程的效率和性能。
