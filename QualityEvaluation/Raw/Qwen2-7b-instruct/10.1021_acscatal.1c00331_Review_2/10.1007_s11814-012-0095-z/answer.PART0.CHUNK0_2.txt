[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been considered as an alternative route for production of propylene, which is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals and oligomers [8,9]."
[2] "The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic,tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers."
[3] "Experiments have indicated that the presence of very small amounts of oxygenated additives such as water can reduce the amount of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface and enhance catalyst activity."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation was performed at 575, 600, 620 oC near atmospheric pressure (0.8 bar) with different amounts of water in the feed."
[5] "The model predictions for both propane conversion and coke formation with time-on-stream were in good agreement with experimental data."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an alternative method for producing propylene, which is crucial for manufacturing polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals, and oligomers.
2. Platinum modifiers, such as arsenic, tin, or germanium, are used to selectively weaken the interaction between platinum and paraffins.
3. Small amounts of oxygenated additives, particularly water, can decrease coke accumulation on the catalyst surface and boost catalyst efficiency.
4. Propane dehydrogenation experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 575 to 620 degrees Celsius under near-atmospheric pressure (0.8 bar) with varying water feed levels.
5. The model's projections for propane conversion and coke formation over time matched the experimental outcomes effectively.
