[1] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[2] "The model was also capable of predicting an optimum water content that would maximize propane conversion."
[3] "The optimum amount of water was found to increase with increasing reaction temperature."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of water as an oxygenated additive up to certain optimal levels improves propane conversion and reduces coke formation in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process over a Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The model indicates that an increase in water content decreases deactivation caused by enhanced coke gasification, but simultaneously increases deactivation due to sintering. As a result, there exists an optimal water content that maximizes propane conversion, and this optimal amount increases with increasing reaction temperature.

水作为氧化剂添加剂，其在一定最佳水平的添加可以提高丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的丙烷转化率并减少焦炭形成，在铂-锡/γ-氧化铝催化剂上。模型表明，水含量的增加减少了由于焦炭气化增强导致的催化剂失活，但同时增加了由于烧结导致的失活。因此，存在一个能够最大化丙烷转化率的最佳水含量，而且随着反应温度的升高，这个最佳含量也会增加。
