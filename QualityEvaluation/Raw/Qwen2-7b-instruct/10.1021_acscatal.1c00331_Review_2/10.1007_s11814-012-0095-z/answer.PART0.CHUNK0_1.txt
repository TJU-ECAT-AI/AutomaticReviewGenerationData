[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been considered as an alternative route for production of propylene, which is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals and oligomers."
[2] "The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic, tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers."
[3] "Water and light oxygenates could serve as catalyst modifier when used in low levels in the feed stream. Pt-based catalysts are poisoned by high levels of oxygenates by various mechanisms. Oxygenates could also deplete chlorine, essential for re-dispersion of sintered platinum, from the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of water as an oxygenated modifier to the feed in optimum amounts could result in a substantial reduction in coke formation as well as an increase in the catalyst activity."
[5] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[6] "Limited experimental data was available for the coke content of the spent catalysts, and the agreement between experimental and predicted coke content was also satisfactory."
[7] "The model predicts that adding water as an oxygenated additive up to the optimum levels would improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation."

The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing coke accumulation and enhancing catalyst activity. The presence of water as an oxygenated additive lowers the energy barrier for coke gasification, decreasing coke formation. However, beyond an optimal level, water promotes catalyst sintering, which negatively impacts catalyst stability. This dual effect of water on coke gasification and catalyst sintering explains the observed optimum in the amount of water added to the feed for maximizing activity. The model accurately predicts the optimum water content, improving propane conversion while controlling coke formation. The implications of these effects are significant for process efficiency and performance, as they allow for better control over coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.
