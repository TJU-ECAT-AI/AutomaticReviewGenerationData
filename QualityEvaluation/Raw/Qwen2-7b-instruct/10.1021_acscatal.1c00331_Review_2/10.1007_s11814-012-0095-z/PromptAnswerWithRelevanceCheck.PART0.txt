[1] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[2] "The model was also capable of predicting an optimum water content that would maximize propane conversion."
[3] "The optimum amount of water was found to increase with increasing reaction temperature."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of water as an oxygenated additive up to certain optimal levels improves propane conversion and reduces coke formation in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process over a Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The model indicates that an increase in water content decreases deactivation caused by enhanced coke gasification, but simultaneously increases deactivation due to sintering. As a result, there exists an optimal water content that maximizes propane conversion, and this optimal amount increases with increasing reaction temperature.

[2] "The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic, tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers."
[3] "Water and light oxygenates could serve as catalyst modifier when used in low levels in the feed stream. Pt-based catalysts are poisoned by high levels of oxygenates by various mechanisms. Oxygenates could also deplete chlorine, essential for re-dispersion of sintered platinum, from the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of water as an oxygenated modifier to the feed in optimum amounts could result in a substantial reduction in coke formation as well as an increase in the catalyst activity."
[5] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[6] "Limited experimental data was available for the coke content of the spent catalysts, and the agreement between experimental and predicted coke content was also satisfactory."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing coke accumulation and enhancing catalyst activity. The presence of water as an oxygenated additive lowers the energy barrier for coke gasification, decreasing coke formation. However, beyond an optimal level, water promotes catalyst sintering, which negatively impacts catalyst stability. This dual effect of water on coke gasification and catalyst sintering explains the observed optimum in the amount of water added to the feed for maximizing activity. The model accurately predicts the optimum water content, improving propane conversion while controlling coke formation. The implications of these effects are significant for process efficiency and performance, as they allow for better control over coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

氢共喂料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，通过降低焦炭形成并增强催化剂活性，影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性及反应机制。水作为氧化添加剂的存在降低了焦炭气化的能量壁垒，减少了焦炭的形成。然而，在超过最优水平时，水会促进催化剂结块，这会负面影响催化剂稳定性。这种水对焦炭气化和催化剂结块的双重作用解释了添加到流体中水的观察到的最优水平以获得最大活性的原因。该模型准确预测了最优的水量，提高了丙烯转化率的同时控制了焦炭形成。这些效应的影响对于过程效率和性能非常重要，因为它们允许更好地控制焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by reducing the energy barriers for coke gasification, thereby decreasing coke accumulation on the catalyst surface. This leads to improved catalyst stability and activity. Additionally, the presence of water enhances the gasification process, contributing to the reduction of coke formation. However, the benefits of water are offset by the potential for catalyst sintering at higher water levels. The optimum amount of water required for maximum propane conversion increases with the reaction temperature. By balancing the effects of coke gasification and sintering, water addition up to the optimal level can improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation, optimizing the overall process efficiency and performance.

To properly describe the kinetics of coke deposition on the catalyst leading to a decrease in the catalyst activity, it is important to include a kinetic expression for coke gasification which occurs in parallel with monolayer-multilayer coke formation. The following expression was used for the amount of gasified coke:
where k2G is the gasification rate constant and is described by the Arrhenius equation, KWG is the equilibrium constant for the first stage of gasification and nG is the dependency of the number of active sites for gasification on the catalyst coke content; its value was found to be close to 1/3. The interaction between coke formation and gasification leads to a dynamic equilibrium coke content on the catalyst.

The presence of steam in the reaction mixture leads to a continuous gasification of the deposited coke so that the experimentally measured rate of coke formation is a net rate resulting from both deposition and gasification.

The optimum kinetic parameters were obtained with RMS=6% and are reported in Table 4.

The predicted coke contents of the catalyst for different amounts of water added to the feed are presented in Fig. 2 for reaction temperature of 620 oC, indicating that the coke content would decrease with increasing amount of water added to the feed due to coke gasification and would increase with time-on-stream.

The model predicts that adding water as an oxygenated additive up to the optimum levels would improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation. The optimum amount of water was found to increase with increasing reaction temperature.

The presence of small amounts of water in the feed reduces coke deposition on the catalyst, thus reducing catalyst deactivation. However, addition of too much water results in extensive sintering, leading to a decrease in propane conversions. The optimum amount of water for maximum propane conversion increases with the reaction temperature. The coke formation is influenced by both deposition and gasification, with the latter occurring in parallel with the former. The model successfully predicts the optimal amount of water needed for maximum propane conversion and the coke content on the catalyst.
