Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process impacts coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, hydrogen addition reduces coke formation by altering the nature of coke deposits, leading to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites. This results in improved catalyst performance and stability. The addition of hydrogen increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, enhancing overall process efficiency. For the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen addition significantly slows down deactivation, maintaining a more stable catalyst performance. These effects are substantiated by operando Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and online activity measurements.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，氢共喂养对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制产生了影响。首先，氢的添加通过改变焦炭沉积物的性质，导致更小、更有序的石墨晶粒，从而减少了焦炭形成。这提高了催化剂性能和稳定性。氢的添加增加了Pt/Al2O3催化剂的转化率和选择性，从而提高了整体过程效率。对于Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂，氢的添加显著减缓了失活速度，保持了更稳定的催化剂性能。这些效果得到了原位拉曼光谱、热重分析和在线活性测量的支持。
