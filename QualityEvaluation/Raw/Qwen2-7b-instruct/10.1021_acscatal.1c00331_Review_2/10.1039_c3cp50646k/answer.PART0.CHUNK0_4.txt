Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly impacts coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Firstly, hydrogen addition reduces the formation of coke deposits by lowering the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material, thus decreasing the likelihood of coke polymerization. Secondly, hydrogen cofeeding enhances the conversion of propane, improving overall process efficiency. This is because hydrogen assists in maintaining the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits, which prevents the accumulation of coke precursors. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding leads to a more stable catalyst, as evidenced by the slower deactivation rate of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is due to hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation, thereby reducing the amount of coke that can potentially sinter the Pt nanoparticles, a common cause of catalyst deactivation. The addition of hydrogen also affects the composition of coke deposits, promoting the formation of more graphitized coke structures. This type of coke is less prone to cracking and hydrogenolysis, which are detrimental side reactions that can reduce catalyst performance. Overall, hydrogen cofeeding improves the selectivity towards propene, as the hydrogen concentration increases, indicating a more efficient dehydrogenation process with reduced side reactions. These effects collectively contribute to enhanced process efficiency and performance by maintaining high conversion rates, improving selectivity, and ensuring a more stable catalyst under repeated dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

氢共喂养在丙烷脱氢过程中的作用对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了显著影响。首先，氢的添加减少了焦炭沉积物的形成，降低了催化材料上焦炭前体的浓度，从而减少了焦炭聚合的可能性。其次，氢共喂养提高了丙烷的转化率，改善了整体工艺效率。这是因为氢有助于保持脱氢活性位点不受焦炭沉积物的影响，从而防止焦炭前体的积累。此外，氢共喂养使催化剂更加稳定，这从铂锡/氧化铝催化剂的活性降低速率变慢可以看出来。这是由于氢的作用抑制了焦炭形成，减少了可能烧结铂纳米粒子的焦炭量，这是催化剂失活的常见原因。氢共喂养还影响了焦炭沉积物的组成，促进了更石墨化的焦炭结构的形成。这种类型的焦炭不太容易发生裂解和氢解离，这些是会降低催化剂性能的不利副反应。总的来说，氢共喂养提高了丙烯选择性，随着氢浓度的增加，选择性提高，表明了一个更高效的脱氢过程，减少了副反应。这些效果综合起来共同贡献于提高过程效率、提高选择性和确保在反复脱氢-再生周期中催化剂的稳定性。
