[1] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane."
[2] "Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles."
[3] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases."
[4] "For the tenth cycle, the selectivity to propene is 43% for the 100% propane feed and 73% for the feed containing 50% propane, which is the highest selectivity measured on this catalyst material for this cycle."
[5] "The corresponding on-line activity data shows that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was slowed down significantly by the addition of hydrogen, resulting in a more stable catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process increases the conversion of propane by lowering the energy barriers for the reaction, allowing more efficient conversion.
2. The catalyst becomes less stable and conversion decreases both within and between dehydrogenation cycles without hydrogen cofeeding.
3. Initially, hydrogen cofeeding reduces the selectivity for propene due to increased cracking products. However, over time, the selectivity towards propene increases.
4. The highest propene selectivity is achieved when 50% propane is fed alongside hydrogen.
5. Hydrogen cofeeding increases the overall conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, enhancing its performance.
6. The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates improved stability and reduced deactivation when hydrogen is included in the feed, leading to a more consistent performance.

1. 在PDH过程中，氢共喂养通过降低反应的能量壁垒，提高了丙烷的转化率，实现了更高效的转化。
2. 没有氢共喂养的情况下，催化剂变得不稳定，转化率在循环内和循环间都下降。
3. 初始时，氢共喂养降低了丙烯选择性，由于增加了裂解产物。然而，随着时间推移，丙烯选择性增加。
4. 当丙烷含量为50%，并伴随氢气喂养时，达到最高的丙烯选择性。
5. 氢气共喂养增加了Pt/Al2O3催化剂的整体转化率和选择性，提升了其性能。
6. Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂在氢气加入到喂养流中时表现出更好的稳定性，减少了失活现象，导致了更一致的性能表现。
