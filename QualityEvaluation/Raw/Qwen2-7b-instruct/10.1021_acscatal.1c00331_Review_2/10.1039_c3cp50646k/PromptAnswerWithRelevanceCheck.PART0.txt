1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation by decreasing it, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving reaction mechanisms. It does so by lowering energy barriers, changing coke accumulation patterns, influencing acid site conversions, and promoting graphitization. These effects lead to increased overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen to the feed results in improved performance for both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. It increases conversion, selectivity, and stability for these catalysts, particularly when using a propane concentration of 75%.

3. Hydrogen's role in the process is comparable to adding tin (Sn), a promoter element that boosts both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests hydrogen's effectiveness in enhancing catalyst performance is significant.

4. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that hydrogen alters the nature of coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites. This change in coke structure correlates with the observed improvements in catalyst performance.

5. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, with a particular advantage noted when using a propane concentration of 75%. This suggests hydrogen's impact on catalyst performance is dose-dependent and optimized at certain propane concentrations.

6. Thermogravimetrical analysis supports the findings from operando Raman spectroscopy and online activity measurements, showing that hydrogen addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. Specifically, less coke is formed when hydrogen is added to the feed.

7. The overall implication of hydrogen cofeeding is that it enables the formation of less disordered coke, which covers the catalyst support more efficiently. This keeps the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species, enhancing catalyst performance by maintaining active sites free of coke deposits.

The addition of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, hydrogen increases the conversion of propane by lowering the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material, thus reducing coke deposition. This allows for a more ordered carbon structure on the catalyst surface, indicated by narrower Raman bands. The hydrogen also shifts the position of the G Raman band towards higher wavenumbers, suggesting that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased. This leads to a decrease in the D1/G ratio, indicating less defects in the graphitic lattice.

The addition of hydrogen also stabilizes the catalyst by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles, which is attributed to its role in preventing coke accumulation on the active sites of the catalyst. This results in more stable and efficient catalytic performance. Moreover, hydrogen helps maintain the active sites for dehydrogenation free of disordered coke species, thereby enhancing the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst. The overall process efficiency and performance are improved due to these effects, as hydrogen facilitates a more controlled coke formation pattern and reduces the risk of catalyst deactivation.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process leads to a more stable and efficient catalytic performance by controlling coke formation, maintaining the integrity of the catalyst surface, and enhancing the reaction mechanisms involved in the dehydrogenation process.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气的加入对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了多方面的影响。首先，氢气通过降低催化剂材料上焦炭前体的浓度来增加丙烷的转化率，从而减少了焦炭沉积。这使得催化剂表面呈现出更有序的碳结构，Raman谱带变窄。氢气还将G Raman谱带的位置向较高波数方向移动，表明图晶结晶体尺寸的减少。这导致D1/G比率降低，表示图晶晶格中的缺陷数量较少。

氢气还通过降低周期之间和周期内的转化率下降，使催化剂更加稳定。这归因于氢气防止活性位点上积聚不规则的焦炭颗粒的作用。这导致了催化剂性能的提高，因为氢气促进了更可控的焦炭形成模式，并降低了催化剂失活的风险。此外，氢气有助于保持脱氢活性位点不受不规则焦炭物种的污染，从而增强催化剂的转化率和选择性。总体而言，氢气的添加提高了过程效率和性能，因为它控制了焦炭形成、维持催化剂表面完整性和增强了参与脱氢过程的反应机制。

简而言之，在PDH过程中添加氢气导致了更加稳定和高效的催化性能，通过控制焦炭形成、维持催化剂表面的完整性并增强反应机制。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process significantly impacts coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Firstly, hydrogen addition reduces the formation of coke deposits by lowering the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material, thus decreasing the likelihood of coke polymerization. Secondly, hydrogen cofeeding enhances the conversion of propane, improving overall process efficiency. This is because hydrogen assists in maintaining the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits, which prevents the accumulation of coke precursors. Additionally, hydrogen cofeeding leads to a more stable catalyst, as evidenced by the slower deactivation rate of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is due to hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation, thereby reducing the amount of coke that can potentially sinter the Pt nanoparticles, a common cause of catalyst deactivation. The addition of hydrogen also affects the composition of coke deposits, promoting the formation of more graphitized coke structures. This type of coke is less prone to cracking and hydrogenolysis, which are detrimental side reactions that can reduce catalyst performance. Overall, hydrogen cofeeding improves the selectivity towards propene, as the hydrogen concentration increases, indicating a more efficient dehydrogenation process with reduced side reactions. These effects collectively contribute to enhanced process efficiency and performance by maintaining high conversion rates, improving selectivity, and ensuring a more stable catalyst under repeated dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.
