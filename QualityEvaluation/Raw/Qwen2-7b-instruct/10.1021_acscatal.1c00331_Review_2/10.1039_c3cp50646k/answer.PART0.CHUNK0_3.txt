The addition of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways. Firstly, hydrogen increases the conversion of propane by lowering the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material, thus reducing coke deposition. This allows for a more ordered carbon structure on the catalyst surface, indicated by narrower Raman bands. The hydrogen also shifts the position of the G Raman band towards higher wavenumbers, suggesting that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased. This leads to a decrease in the D1/G ratio, indicating less defects in the graphitic lattice.

The addition of hydrogen also stabilizes the catalyst by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles, which is attributed to its role in preventing coke accumulation on the active sites of the catalyst. This results in more stable and efficient catalytic performance. Moreover, hydrogen helps maintain the active sites for dehydrogenation free of disordered coke species, thereby enhancing the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst. The overall process efficiency and performance are improved due to these effects, as hydrogen facilitates a more controlled coke formation pattern and reduces the risk of catalyst deactivation.

In summary, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process leads to a more stable and efficient catalytic performance by controlling coke formation, maintaining the integrity of the catalyst surface, and enhancing the reaction mechanisms involved in the dehydrogenation process.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气的加入对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应机制产生了多方面的影响。首先，氢气通过降低催化剂材料上焦炭前体的浓度来增加丙烷的转化率，从而减少了焦炭沉积。这使得催化剂表面呈现出更有序的碳结构，Raman谱带变窄。氢气还将G Raman谱带的位置向较高波数方向移动，表明图晶结晶体尺寸的减少。这导致D1/G比率降低，表示图晶晶格中的缺陷数量较少。

氢气还通过降低周期之间和周期内的转化率下降，使催化剂更加稳定。这归因于氢气防止活性位点上积聚不规则的焦炭颗粒的作用。这导致了催化剂性能的提高，因为氢气促进了更可控的焦炭形成模式，并降低了催化剂失活的风险。此外，氢气有助于保持脱氢活性位点不受不规则焦炭物种的污染，从而增强催化剂的转化率和选择性。总体而言，氢气的添加提高了过程效率和性能，因为它控制了焦炭形成、维持催化剂表面完整性和增强了参与脱氢过程的反应机制。

简而言之，在PDH过程中添加氢气导致了更加稳定和高效的催化性能，通过控制焦炭形成、维持催化剂表面的完整性并增强反应机制。
