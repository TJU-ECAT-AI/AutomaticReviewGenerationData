1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process affects coke formation by decreasing it, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving reaction mechanisms. It does so by lowering energy barriers, changing coke accumulation patterns, influencing acid site conversions, and promoting graphitization. These effects lead to increased overall process efficiency and performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen to the feed results in improved performance for both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. It increases conversion, selectivity, and stability for these catalysts, particularly when using a propane concentration of 75%.

3. Hydrogen's role in the process is comparable to adding tin (Sn), a promoter element that boosts both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests hydrogen's effectiveness in enhancing catalyst performance is significant.

4. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that hydrogen alters the nature of coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites. This change in coke structure correlates with the observed improvements in catalyst performance.

5. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, with a particular advantage noted when using a propane concentration of 75%. This suggests hydrogen's impact on catalyst performance is dose-dependent and optimized at certain propane concentrations.

6. Thermogravimetrical analysis supports the findings from operando Raman spectroscopy and online activity measurements, showing that hydrogen addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. Specifically, less coke is formed when hydrogen is added to the feed.

7. The overall implication of hydrogen cofeeding is that it enables the formation of less disordered coke, which covers the catalyst support more efficiently. This keeps the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species, enhancing catalyst performance by maintaining active sites free of coke deposits.
