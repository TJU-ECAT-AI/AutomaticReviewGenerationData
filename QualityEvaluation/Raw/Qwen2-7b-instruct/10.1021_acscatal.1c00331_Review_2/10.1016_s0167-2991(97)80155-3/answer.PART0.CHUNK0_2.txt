2.1 "The addition of Sn to Pt/A1203 improves the activity and selectivity to propylene and decreases deactivation."
2.2 "Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl204 not only enhances activity but also improves catalyst stability."
2.3 "Bimetallic PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts appear to have the highest stability and reversibility after several reaction steps including the corresponding regeneration steps between them."
2.4 "The existence of strong interactions between Pt and Sn, with probable alloy formation, is suggested both on an acidic support like Al2O3, and on a pH-neutral support like ZnAl204."

Propane dehydrogenation processes utilizing catalysts with Pt and PtSn components on inert supports, such as K-doped alumina and ZnAl204, demonstrate significant benefits. The addition of tin (Sn) to the platinum (Pt) catalysts notably reduces catalyst deactivation. This is achieved by minimizing the amounts of coke deposited on both the support and the metal, leading to a lower degree of polymerization of the coke. Sn addition also improves the activity and selectivity to propylene, enhancing the overall efficiency of the process. The incorporation of Sn into Pt catalysts, particularly on ZnAl204, results in the highest stability and reversibility across multiple reaction and regeneration cycles. The strong interactions between Pt and Sn, potentially forming alloys, are suggested to occur on both acidic and neutral supports, contributing to the enhanced catalytic properties.

在使用惰性支持（如K掺杂氧化铝和ZnAl204）的丙烷脱氢催化剂中，铂（Pt）和PtSn组件的组合展现出显著的优势。向铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）能够显著降低催化剂的失活。这主要是通过减少沉积在支撑物和支持物上的焦炭量来实现的，并且降低了焦炭的聚合度。Sn的添加不仅提高了活性和丙烯选择性，还减少了催化剂的失活率，从而增强了过程的整体效率。在ZnAl204上，Sn与Pt的结合特别有效，其形成的催化剂表现出最高的一致稳定性和再生循环性能。Pt和Sn之间强烈的相互作用，可能形成合金，在酸性和中性支持物上都存在，对增强催化性质起到了关键作用。
