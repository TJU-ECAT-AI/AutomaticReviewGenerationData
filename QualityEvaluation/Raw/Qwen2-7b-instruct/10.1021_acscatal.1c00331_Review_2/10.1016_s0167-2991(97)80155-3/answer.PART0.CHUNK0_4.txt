The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts on various supports affects their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Sn addition enhances activity and selectivity for propylene production and reduces deactivation rates. On acidic support like Al2O3, Sn blocks acidic sites, decreasing coke deposition on both the support and metal. On neutral support like ZnAl2O4, Sn not only boosts activity but also improves catalyst stability. The monometallic Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst has lower initial conversion but higher selectivity to propylene and lower deactivation compared to Pt/Al2O3. Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 further enhances activity and reduces deactivation, with coke deposition mainly occurring at the metal-support interface, thus minimizing its impact on the active sites.

添加锡（Sn）到铂（Pt）催化剂在各种支撑上对其丙烷脱氢性能产生了影响。Sn添加可以增强丙烯产率和选择性，并减少失活速率。在酸性支持如Al2O3上，Sn阻塞了酸性位点，减少了对支持和金属的焦炭沉积。在中性支持如ZnAl2O4上，Sn不仅提升了活性，还提高了催化剂稳定性。单金属Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂的初始转化率较低，但丙烯选择性更高且失活程度更低，相比于Pt/Al2O3。Sn添加到Pt/ZnAl2O4进一步增强了活性并减少了失活，焦炭沉积主要发生在金属-支持界面，从而最大限度地减少了对活性位点的影响。
