<p>When the Pt/A1203 catalyst is doped with K, slight modifications of both the initial conversion and the selectivity to propylene, and a significant decrease of the deactivation parameter, are observed (Table 1).</p>
<p>This fact suggests an additional effect of the K addition to Pt. Thus the TPR profile of Pt/A1203-K shows very important differences with respect to the monometalic catalyst (Figure 3), which can be attributed to a modification of the structure of the supported Pt by the alkali metal addition.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn to the Pt/ZnA1204 catalyst apparently promotes activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, while the selectivity to propylene remains practically unchanged, and the deactivation rate is markedly decreased (Table 1).</p>
<p>However, coke contents were similar for both Pt/ZnA1204 and PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts (0.94 and 0.86 wt%, respectively).</p>
<p>These results show (1) the highest reversibility of the regeneration process for the bimetallic catalyst supported on ZnA1204, (2) a higher extent of deactivation for Pt/A1203 relative to Pt/A12Oa-K, and (3) improved stability due to Sn addition to Pt especially for the catalyst supported on ZnA1204, whose conversion is practically constant through the successive reaction steps (Table 3).</p>
<p>Selectivity to propylene remains practically constant through five cycles for PtSn/ZnA1204 and PtSn/A12Oa-K. However, selectivities to propylene are higher for the PtSn supported on ZnA1204 (96-98%) relative to those for PtSn supported on the K-doped alumina (89-90%).</p>

1. The addition of potassium (K) to the platinum (Pt) on aluminum oxide (A1203) catalyst leads to slight modifications in the initial conversion and selectivity to propylene, as well as a significant decrease in deactivation parameters. The TPR profile of the Pt/A1203-K catalyst shows important differences compared to the monometallic catalyst, suggesting a modification of the supported Pt structure due to the alkali metal addition.

2. The introduction of tin (Sn) into the Pt/ZnA1204 catalyst increases its activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining a similar selectivity towards propylene and markedly decreasing the deactivation rate.

3. Coke contents were found to be comparable between the Pt/ZnA1204 and PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts, despite the changes in their performance.

4. The Pt/A1203 catalyst experiences a higher degree of deactivation compared to the Pt/A12Oa-K catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt catalyst, especially when supported on ZnA1204, improves stability and allows for a more reversible regeneration process.

5. Selectivity to propylene remains constant across five reaction cycles for the PtSn catalysts supported on ZnA1204 and A1203-K. The PtSn catalyst supported on ZnA1204 shows higher propylene selectivity (96-98%) compared to the catalyst supported on K-doped alumina (89-90%).

1. 向铝氧化物（A1203）上的铂（Pt）添加钾（K）会导致初始转化率和丙烯选择性的轻微变化，以及显著降低失活参数。Pt/A1203-K 催化剂的温度程序还原（TPR）轮廓与单金属催化剂相比显示出重要差异，这可以归因于碱性金属添加对支持的Pt结构的修改。

2. 将锡（Sn）引入到Pt/ZnA1204催化剂中增加了其在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性，保持了丙烯选择性，并明显降低了失活速率。

3. Pt/ZnA1204 和 PtSn/ZnA1204 催化剂的焦炭含量相似，尽管它们的性能有所变化。

4. 与Pt/A12Oa-K 催化剂相比，Pt/A1203 催化剂的失活程度更高。在ZnA1204 上添加锡到Pt 催化剂，特别是当它被支持时，提高了稳定性，并允许再生过程更可逆。

5. 对于支持在ZnA1204 和 A1203-K 上的PtSn 催化剂，丙烯选择性在五个反应周期内保持不变。与在K掺杂的氧化铝上支持的PtSn 催化剂相比，ZnA1204 支持的PtSn 催化剂具有更高的丙烯选择性（96-98%），而K掺杂的氧化铝为（89-90%）。
