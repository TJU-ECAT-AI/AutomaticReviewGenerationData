[1] "K addition to Pt/A1203 blocks acidic sites of the support. It also substantially decreases the deactivation of the catalyst, diminishing the amounts of carbon deposited not only on the support but also on the metal. The coke deposited on Pt displays a lower degree of polymerization."
[2] "The significant modification of the metallic phase of Pt due to Sn addition, with probable alloy formation, was confirmed by TPR results and by the substantial changes of the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. Sn addition to Pt also enhances the selectivity to propene and decreases the catalyst deactivation rate."
[3] "The change from an acidic support (like A1203) to another with neutral or nonacidic characteristics (like ZnA1204) produces important modifications in the characteristics and catalytic performance of the metallic phase."
[4] "Sn addition to Pt/ZnA1204 improves activity and decreases deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. This improvement in the stability is related to the lower toxicity of the coke deposited on the bimetallic catalyst located at the support-metal interface."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process leads to decreased coke formation and catalyst deactivation by blocking acidic sites on the support. This reduces carbon deposition on both the support and the metal, resulting in coke with a lower degree of polymerization.

2. The addition of Sn to Pt significantly modifies the metallic phase, possibly forming alloys, and results in substantial changes to the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. This enhancement improves the selectivity towards propene and decreases the catalyst's deactivation rate.

3. Changing from an acidic support (such as Al2O3) to a neutral or non-acidic one (such as ZnAl2O4) leads to important modifications in the characteristics and performance of the metallic phase. This change is not attributed to particle size effects but rather to structural alterations within the metallic particles.

4. Adding Sn to Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts improves activity and decreases deactivation rates in the PDH reaction. This stability improvement is associated with the lower toxicity of coke deposited on the bimetallic catalyst at the support-metal interface.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共供给导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活减少，通过阻塞支撑上的酸性位点。这减少了支撑和金属上的碳沉积，导致焦炭的聚合度较低。

2. 添加Sn到Pt中，显著改变了金属相，可能形成了合金，并导致丙烷脱氢反应的活化能发生了重大变化。这种增强提高了丙烯的选择性并降低了催化剂的失活率。

3. 将从酸性支撑（如Al2O3）改为中性或非酸性支撑（如ZnAl2O4）导致金属相的重要特性和催化性能改变。这种变化不是由于颗粒大小效应，而是与金属颗粒内的结构改变有关。

4. 将Sn添加到Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂中，在PDH反应中提高了活性并降低了失活率。这种稳定性改善与位于支撑-金属界面的双金属催化剂上较低毒性焦炭的沉积相关。
