<p>When the Pt/A1203 catalyst is doped with K, slight modifications of both the initial conversion and the selectivity to propylene, and a significant decrease of the deactivation parameter, are observed (Table 1).</p>
<p>This fact suggests an additional effect of the K addition to Pt. Thus the TPR profile of Pt/A1203-K shows very important differences with respect to the monometalic catalyst (Figure 3), which can be attributed to a modification of the structure of the supported Pt by the alkali metal addition.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn to the Pt/ZnA1204 catalyst apparently promotes activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, while the selectivity to propylene remains practically unchanged, and the deactivation rate is markedly decreased (Table 1).</p>
<p>However, coke contents were similar for both Pt/ZnA1204 and PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts (0.94 and 0.86 wt%, respectively).</p>
<p>These results show (1) the highest reversibility of the regeneration process for the bimetallic catalyst supported on ZnA1204, (2) a higher extent of deactivation for Pt/A1203 relative to Pt/A12Oa-K, and (3) improved stability due to Sn addition to Pt especially for the catalyst supported on ZnA1204, whose conversion is practically constant through the successive reaction steps (Table 3).</p>
<p>Selectivity to propylene remains practically constant through five cycles for PtSn/ZnA1204 and PtSn/A12Oa-K. However, selectivities to propylene are higher for the PtSn supported on ZnA1204 (96-98%) relative to those for PtSn supported on the K-doped alumina (89-90%).</p>

1. The addition of potassium (K) to the platinum (Pt) on aluminum oxide (A1203) catalyst leads to slight modifications in the initial conversion and selectivity to propylene, as well as a significant decrease in deactivation parameters. The TPR profile of the Pt/A1203-K catalyst shows important differences compared to the monometallic catalyst, suggesting a modification of the supported Pt structure due to the alkali metal addition.

2. The introduction of tin (Sn) into the Pt/ZnA1204 catalyst increases its activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining a similar selectivity towards propylene and markedly decreasing the deactivation rate.

3. Coke contents were found to be comparable between the Pt/ZnA1204 and PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts, despite the changes in their performance.

4. The Pt/A1203 catalyst experiences a higher degree of deactivation compared to the Pt/A12Oa-K catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt catalyst, especially when supported on ZnA1204, improves stability and allows for a more reversible regeneration process.

5. Selectivity to propylene remains constant across five reaction cycles for the PtSn catalysts supported on ZnA1204 and A1203-K. The PtSn catalyst supported on ZnA1204 shows higher propylene selectivity (96-98%) compared to the catalyst supported on K-doped alumina (89-90%).

1. 向铝氧化物（A1203）上的铂（Pt）添加钾（K）会导致初始转化率和丙烯选择性的轻微变化，以及显著降低失活参数。Pt/A1203-K 催化剂的温度程序还原（TPR）轮廓与单金属催化剂相比显示出重要差异，这可以归因于碱性金属添加对支持的Pt结构的修改。

2. 将锡（Sn）引入到Pt/ZnA1204催化剂中增加了其在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性，保持了丙烯选择性，并明显降低了失活速率。

3. Pt/ZnA1204 和 PtSn/ZnA1204 催化剂的焦炭含量相似，尽管它们的性能有所变化。

4. 与Pt/A12Oa-K 催化剂相比，Pt/A1203 催化剂的失活程度更高。在ZnA1204 上添加锡到Pt 催化剂，特别是当它被支持时，提高了稳定性，并允许再生过程更可逆。

5. 对于支持在ZnA1204 和 A1203-K 上的PtSn 催化剂，丙烯选择性在五个反应周期内保持不变。与在K掺杂的氧化铝上支持的PtSn 催化剂相比，ZnA1204 支持的PtSn 催化剂具有更高的丙烯选择性（96-98%），而K掺杂的氧化铝为（89-90%）。

[1] "K addition to Pt/A1203 blocks acidic sites of the support. It also substantially decreases the deactivation of the catalyst, diminishing the amounts of carbon deposited not only on the support but also on the metal. The coke deposited on Pt displays a lower degree of polymerization."
[2] "The significant modification of the metallic phase of Pt due to Sn addition, with probable alloy formation, was confirmed by TPR results and by the substantial changes of the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. Sn addition to Pt also enhances the selectivity to propene and decreases the catalyst deactivation rate."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process leads to decreased coke formation and catalyst deactivation by blocking acidic sites on the support. This reduces carbon deposition on both the support and the metal, resulting in coke with a lower degree of polymerization.

2. The addition of Sn to Pt significantly modifies the metallic phase, possibly forming alloys, and results in substantial changes to the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. This enhancement improves the selectivity towards propene and decreases the catalyst's deactivation rate.

3. Changing from an acidic support (such as Al2O3) to a neutral or non-acidic one (such as ZnAl2O4) leads to important modifications in the characteristics and performance of the metallic phase. This change is not attributed to particle size effects but rather to structural alterations within the metallic particles.

4. Adding Sn to Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts improves activity and decreases deactivation rates in the PDH reaction. This stability improvement is associated with the lower toxicity of coke deposited on the bimetallic catalyst at the support-metal interface.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢共供给导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活减少，通过阻塞支撑上的酸性位点。这减少了支撑和金属上的碳沉积，导致焦炭的聚合度较低。

2. 添加Sn到Pt中，显著改变了金属相，可能形成了合金，并导致丙烷脱氢反应的活化能发生了重大变化。这种增强提高了丙烯的选择性并降低了催化剂的失活率。

3. 将从酸性支撑（如Al2O3）改为中性或非酸性支撑（如ZnAl2O4）导致金属相的重要特性和催化性能改变。这种变化不是由于颗粒大小效应，而是与金属颗粒内的结构改变有关。

4. 将Sn添加到Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂中，在PDH反应中提高了活性并降低了失活率。这种稳定性改善与位于支撑-金属界面的双金属催化剂上较低毒性焦炭的沉积相关。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane dehydrogenation processes utilizing catalysts with Pt and PtSn components on inert supports, such as K-doped alumina and ZnAl204, demonstrate significant benefits. The addition of tin (Sn) to the platinum (Pt) catalysts notably reduces catalyst deactivation. This is achieved by minimizing the amounts of coke deposited on both the support and the metal, leading to a lower degree of polymerization of the coke. Sn addition also improves the activity and selectivity to propylene, enhancing the overall efficiency of the process. The incorporation of Sn into Pt catalysts, particularly on ZnAl204, results in the highest stability and reversibility across multiple reaction and regeneration cycles. The strong interactions between Pt and Sn, potentially forming alloys, are suggested to occur on both acidic and neutral supports, contributing to the enhanced catalytic properties.

在使用惰性支持（如K掺杂氧化铝和ZnAl204）的丙烷脱氢催化剂中，铂（Pt）和PtSn组件的组合展现出显著的优势。向铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）能够显著降低催化剂的失活。这主要是通过减少沉积在支撑物和支持物上的焦炭量来实现的，并且降低了焦炭的聚合度。Sn的添加不仅提高了活性和丙烯选择性，还减少了催化剂的失活率，从而增强了过程的整体效率。在ZnAl204上，Sn与Pt的结合特别有效，其形成的催化剂表现出最高的一致稳定性和再生循环性能。Pt和Sn之间强烈的相互作用，可能形成合金，在酸性和中性支持物上都存在，对增强催化性质起到了关键作用。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts on various supports affects their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Sn addition enhances activity and selectivity for propylene production and reduces deactivation rates. On acidic support like Al2O3, Sn blocks acidic sites, decreasing coke deposition on both the support and metal. On neutral support like ZnAl2O4, Sn not only boosts activity but also improves catalyst stability. The monometallic Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst has lower initial conversion but higher selectivity to propylene and lower deactivation compared to Pt/Al2O3. Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 further enhances activity and reduces deactivation, with coke deposition mainly occurring at the metal-support interface, thus minimizing its impact on the active sites.

添加锡（Sn）到铂（Pt）催化剂在各种支撑上对其丙烷脱氢性能产生了影响。Sn添加可以增强丙烯产率和选择性，并减少失活速率。在酸性支持如Al2O3上，Sn阻塞了酸性位点，减少了对支持和金属的焦炭沉积。在中性支持如ZnAl2O4上，Sn不仅提升了活性，还提高了催化剂稳定性。单金属Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂的初始转化率较低，但丙烯选择性更高且失活程度更低，相比于Pt/Al2O3。Sn添加到Pt/ZnAl2O4进一步增强了活性并减少了失活，焦炭沉积主要发生在金属-支持界面，从而最大限度地减少了对活性位点的影响。
