2. The effect of Sn addition to Pt/A1203 is reflected in the increase of the initial activity and selectivity to propylene in flow reaction experiments accompanied by a decrease of the deactivation parameter (Table 1). The carbon retention obtained in the pulse experiments was also substantially lower for the bimetallic catalyst compared with Pt/A1203 (Figure 2a).

3. The change from an acidic support (like A1203) to another with neutral or nonacidic characteristics (like ZnA1204) produces important modifications in the characteristics and catalytic performance of the metallic phase. The different behavior of Pt/ZnA1204 and Pt/A1203 cannot be attributed to an effect of particle size, but to changes in the structure of the metallic particles.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Switching from an acidic support (such as A1203) to one with neutral or non-acidic properties (like ZnA1204) leads to significant alterations in the properties and catalytic performance of the metallic phase. The distinct behaviors of Pt/ZnA1204 and Pt/A1203 are not due to particle size effects but rather to changes in the structure of the metal particles.

1. K added to Pt/A1203 blocks acidic sites of the support. It also substantially decreases the deactivation of the catalyst, diminishing the amounts of carbon deposited not only on the support but also on the metal. The coke deposited on Pt displays a lower degree of polymerization. These effects are probably caused by an electronic modification of the metallic phase due to the K addition.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Adding potassium (K) to Pt/A1203 catalysts blocks the acidic sites of the support. This leads to a significant reduction in catalyst deactivation, decreasing carbon deposition not just on the support but also on the metal. The coke formed on platinum exhibits a lower degree of polymerization. These outcomes likely stem from an electronic modification of the metal phase due to the potassium addition.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
向Pt/A1203催化剂中添加钾（K）会阻塞支持体的酸性位点。这显著降低了催化剂的失活，减少了不仅在支撑体上，而且在金属上的碳沉积。沉积在铂上的焦炭的聚合度较低。这些效果可能由钾添加导致的金属相电子改性引起。
