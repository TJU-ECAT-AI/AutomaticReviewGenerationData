<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by lowering energy barriers for coke formation, influencing coke accumulation patterns, converting acid sites on the catalyst, and potentially impacting the catalyst's life span through the graphitization process. These effects collectively influence the overall process efficiency and performance.
