[1] "The introduction of hydrogen cofeeding into the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process was found to significantly influence the coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms."
[2] "By affecting the energy barriers, hydrogen cofeeding can alter the coke accumulation patterns, leading to more controlled coke formation."
[3] "It also impacts the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, promoting a more efficient use of the catalyst."
[4] "The presence of hydrogen can delay the onset of graphitization, thereby enhancing catalyst stability over time."
[5] "These effects collectively contribute to improved overall process efficiency and performance by reducing coke accumulation and maintaining high catalyst activity."
