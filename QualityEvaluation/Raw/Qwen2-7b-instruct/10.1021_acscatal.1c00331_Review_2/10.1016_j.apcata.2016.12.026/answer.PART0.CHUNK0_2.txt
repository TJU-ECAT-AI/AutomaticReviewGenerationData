<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the synthesis of ordered mesoporous Mg-SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It examines how hydrogen cofeeding affects the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not directly addressed within the provided literature.
