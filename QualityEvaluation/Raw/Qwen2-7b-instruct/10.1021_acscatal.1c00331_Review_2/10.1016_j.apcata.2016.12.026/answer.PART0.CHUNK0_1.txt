The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reduces the energy barrier for coke formation, leading to a more uniform coke accumulation pattern on the catalyst surface. It also promotes the stability of acid sites on the catalyst and alters the graphitization process, which collectively improves the overall process efficiency and catalyst performance.
