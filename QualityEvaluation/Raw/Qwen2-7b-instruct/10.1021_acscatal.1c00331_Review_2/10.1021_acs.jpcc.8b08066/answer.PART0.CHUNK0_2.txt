[1] "In the presence of hydrogen, the coke formation rate is significantly reduced."
[2] "Catalyst stability is improved due to the hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation."
[3] "Energy barriers associated with coke formation are lowered by hydrogen."
[4] "Hydrogen affects the coke accumulation pattern by preventing the aggregation of carbon species."
[5] "Acid sites on the catalyst surface undergo conversion when hydrogen is present, affecting the reaction mechanism."
[6] "Graphitization is inhibited by hydrogen, which prevents the formation of graphite-like structures."
[7] "These effects lead to enhanced process efficiency and catalyst performance."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process leads to reduced coke formation rate, improved catalyst stability, and altered energy barriers related to coke formation. It modifies the coke accumulation pattern by preventing carbon species aggregation, converts acid sites on the catalyst surface, inhibits graphitization, and ultimately enhances the overall process efficiency and catalyst performance.
