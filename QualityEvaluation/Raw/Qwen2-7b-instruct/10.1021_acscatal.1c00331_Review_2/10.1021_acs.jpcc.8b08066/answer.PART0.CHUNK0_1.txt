[1] "In the presence of hydrogen, the PDH process shows significant differences in coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms compared to the non-hydrogen-fed process."
[2] "Hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, leading to altered coke accumulation patterns."
[3] "It also impacts the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Furthermore, hydrogen influences the degree of graphitization within the catalyst structure."
[5] "These effects collectively influence the overall process efficiency and performance."

1. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms by altering energy barriers, changing coke accumulation patterns, impacting the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, influencing the degree of graphitization within the catalyst structure, and collectively influencing the overall process efficiency and performance.
