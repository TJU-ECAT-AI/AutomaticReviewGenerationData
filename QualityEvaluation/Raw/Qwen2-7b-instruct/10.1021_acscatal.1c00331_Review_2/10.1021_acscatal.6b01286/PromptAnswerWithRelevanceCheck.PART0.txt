<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process influences the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, which in turn affects the coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. This modulation leads to changes in the structural evolution of iron species, impacting the high activity and propylene selectivity of the alumina-supported iron/phosphorus catalysts. Consequently, hydrogen cofeeding can enhance the overall process efficiency and performance.
