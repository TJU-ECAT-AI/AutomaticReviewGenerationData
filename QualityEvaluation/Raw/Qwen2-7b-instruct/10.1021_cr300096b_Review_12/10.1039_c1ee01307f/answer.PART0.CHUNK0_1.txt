[1] "For the requirements of electrocatalytic activity and durability, core-shell-like catalysts seem to be most promising for practical application."
[2] "In the case of dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, Strasser et al. stated that the compressive strain effect rather than the ligand effect was responsible for the improved activity in ORR."
[3] "Considering that the base-metal Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni etc.) is unstable in an electrochemical environment, the catalytic surface for a PdMe system should be Pt-rich or almost pure Pt."
[4] "The core-shell structure is regarded as a stable structure in the electrochemical environment."

The document discusses the importance of core-shell-like catalysts for achieving both high electrocatalytic activity and durability. It also highlights that in dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, the compressive strain effect rather than the ligand effect contributes to the enhanced activity in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Furthermore, the text mentions that for a palladium-based system, the surface should ideally be rich in or almost entirely composed of platinum to ensure stability in electrochemical environments. Lastly, it is noted that core-shell structures are considered stable configurations in electrochemical settings.

文档讨论了用于实现高电催化活性和稳定性的核心壳状催化剂的重要性。它还强调，在钯合金化纳米颗粒中，压缩应变效应而非配位效应是导致过氧化物还原反应（ORR）活性增强的原因。此外，文本提到，在电解质化学环境中，钯基系统表面应富含或几乎完全由铂组成以确保稳定性。最后，指出核心壳结构在电化学环境中被认为是稳定的配置。
