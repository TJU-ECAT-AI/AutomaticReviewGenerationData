Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been developed as efficient energy conversion devices. However, their reliance on costly platinum-based catalysts for both anode and cathode components hinders their large-scale commercialization. To address this, there has been significant progress in creating low-platinum and non-platinum catalysts. These include low-platinum alloys, core-shell-like catalysts, and non-platinum catalysts such as palladium-based, ruthenium-selenium, and metal-nitrogen-carbon-based catalysts. This review explores strategies to enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of these catalysts.

[1] "In the study of Koper et al.,66 the binding energies and geometries of CO and OH were computed for PtRu, PtMo and PtSn catalysts."
[2] "According to their calculations, the PtMo and PtSn catalysts seemed to be better CO oxidation catalysts than PtRu catalysts."

In the work of Koper et al., the binding energies and geometries of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydroxyl (OH) were calculated for platinum-ruthenium (PtRu), platinum-molybdenum (PtMo), and platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts. The calculations suggested that the PtMo and PtSn catalysts were more effective for CO oxidation compared to the PtRu catalysts. Experiments by Eichhorn et al. confirmed that both a Pt0.8Mo0.2 alloy and molybdenum oxide @ platinum (MoOx@Pt) core-shell catalysts showed minimal overpotential for oxidizing a hydrogen/carbon monoxide (H2/CO) mixture. Dupont et al. further studied the CO oxidation efficiency of PtSn alloy surfaces using first-principles theory.
