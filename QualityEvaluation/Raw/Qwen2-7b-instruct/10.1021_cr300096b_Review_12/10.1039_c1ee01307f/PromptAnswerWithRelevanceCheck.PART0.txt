[1] "In terms of highly CO-resistant PtMe catalysts, three factors need to be considered: (a) the effective spilled pathway of CO, (b) the ability of providing MeOHads on Me sites, and (c) the ability to release Pt active sites."
[2] "For the requirements of electrocatalytic activity and durability, core-shell-like catalysts seem to be most promising for practical application."
[3] "On the other hand, an interesting topic is to explore CO oxidation and MOR on preferentially oriented Pt nanoparticles (i.e., shape-dependent/facet-dependent electrocatalysis)."
[4] "For these debates, the literature43,44 has proposed that the bifunctional mechanism and the electronic effect of Ru are usually combined for a 20% enhancement in MOR attributed to the electronic effect and a 80% enhancement due to the bifunctional mechanism.43,44"
[5] "Meanwhile, large-scale, low-cost synthetic methods118,124,125 have also been developed for the wide application of such high-efficiency ORR catalysts."

[1] "For the requirements of electrocatalytic activity and durability, core-shell-like catalysts seem to be most promising for practical application."
[2] "In the case of dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, Strasser et al. stated that the compressive strain effect rather than the ligand effect was responsible for the improved activity in ORR."
[3] "Considering that the base-metal Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni etc.) is unstable in an electrochemical environment, the catalytic surface for a PdMe system should be Pt-rich or almost pure Pt."
[4] "The core-shell structure is regarded as a stable structure in the electrochemical environment."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the importance of core-shell-like catalysts for achieving both high electrocatalytic activity and durability. It also highlights that in dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, the compressive strain effect rather than the ligand effect contributes to the enhanced activity in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Furthermore, the text mentions that for a palladium-based system, the surface should ideally be rich in or almost entirely composed of platinum to ensure stability in electrochemical environments. Lastly, it is noted that core-shell structures are considered stable configurations in electrochemical settings.

Moreover, the decay rate of the current slowed with increasing numbers of PtNi interfaces."

Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been developed as efficient energy conversion devices. However, their reliance on costly platinum-based catalysts for both anode and cathode components hinders their large-scale commercialization. To address this, there has been significant progress in creating low-platinum and non-platinum catalysts. These include low-platinum alloys, core-shell-like catalysts, and non-platinum catalysts such as palladium-based, ruthenium-selenium, and metal-nitrogen-carbon-based catalysts.
