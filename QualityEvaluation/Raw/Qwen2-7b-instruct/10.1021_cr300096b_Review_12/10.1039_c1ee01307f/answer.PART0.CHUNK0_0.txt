[1] "In terms of highly CO-resistant PtMe catalysts, three factors need to be considered: (a) the effective spilled pathway of CO, (b) the ability of providing MeOHads on Me sites, and (c) the ability to release Pt active sites."
[2] "For the requirements of electrocatalytic activity and durability, core-shell-like catalysts seem to be most promising for practical application."
[3] "On the other hand, an interesting topic is to explore CO oxidation and MOR on preferentially oriented Pt nanoparticles (i.e., shape-dependent/facet-dependent electrocatalysis)."
[4] "For these debates, the literature43,44 has proposed that the bifunctional mechanism and the electronic effect of Ru are usually combined for a 20% enhancement in MOR attributed to the electronic effect and a 80% enhancement due to the bifunctional mechanism.43,44"
[5] "Meanwhile, large-scale, low-cost synthetic methods118,124,125 have also been developed for the wide application of such high-efficiency ORR catalysts."

1. For highly CO-resistant PtMe catalysts, three key factors to consider are: ensuring an effective pathway for CO to escape, enabling the formation of MeOHads on metal sites, and facilitating the release of active Pt sites.
2. Core-shell-like catalysts are considered to be the most promising for achieving both high electrocatalytic activity and durability.
3. The exploration of CO oxidation and Methanol Oxidation Reaction (MOR) on Pt nanoparticles with specific shapes and orientations offers interesting insights into facet-dependent electrocatalysis.
4. The literature suggests that the promotion effect of Ru in PtRu catalysts can be attributed to a combination of the bifunctional mechanism and the electronic effect, with the electronic effect contributing to 20% of the enhancement in CO oxidation and a much larger portion (80%) coming from the bifunctional mechanism.
5. The development of efficient ORR catalysts is advancing, with the implementation of large-scale, low-cost synthetic methods being crucial for their widespread application.
