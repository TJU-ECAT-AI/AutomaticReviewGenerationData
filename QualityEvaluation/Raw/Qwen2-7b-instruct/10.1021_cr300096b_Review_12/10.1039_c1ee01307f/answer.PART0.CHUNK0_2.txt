<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics necessitate a high loading of platinum (Pt) in the cathode to achieve acceptable power density. Simultaneously, methanol crossover reduces fuel efficiency and introduces mixed potentials due to the occurrence of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) on the Pt surface.

[1] "Recent investigations have validated that the ORR activity of Pd can be effectively enhanced by alloying with other elements."
[2] "Specifically, in the case of PdMe alloys, the Me breaks the OO bond; then the produced atomic oxygen migrates to and is reduced on the Pd surface."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Recent studies have confirmed that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of palladium (Pd) can be significantly improved by alloying with other elements. Specifically, in PdMe alloys, the Me element disrupts the OO bond; then the resulting atomic oxygen migrates to the Pd surface and is reduced there.

[1] "The most active ORR catalyst reported in the literature is the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface."
[2] "In general, Pt alloying with other metals causes a series of changes in the geometric and electronic structure of Pt."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The most active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst reported in literature is the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface. Typically, platinum (Pt) alloying with other metals results in a series of modifications to both the geometric and electronic structure of Pt.
