<p>The present study is essentially benefit to obtaining a completed exploration on the catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction over the bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst.</p>
<p>There were no large difference in the activity and product selectivity within the experimental error over PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3 and PtFe3/Al2O3 treated in H2 as compared to that treated in He at 400 C.</p>
<p>The XRD and 57Fe Mssbauer results indicate that PtFe, PtFe2 and PtFe3 nanoparticles supported on alumina are in high dispersion and exist as alloyed state.</p>
<p>The relative resonance area of the ferrous species decreased in the increase of Pt molar fractions contained in the as-prepared catalysts, indicating that Pt can enhance the reduction of iron intimately contacting with them.</p>
<p>These differences are reasonable to lead their catalytic performance and mechanism changed somewhat.</p>

The research demonstrates that the novel alumina-supported PtFe alloy nanoparticles exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity for the CO oxidation (PROX) reaction in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, compared to conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts show a steady-state CO conversion at temperatures below 100°C and higher CO2 selectivity at lower temperatures. The XRD and 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy results confirm that the nanoparticles are in a high-dispersed alloyed state with iron in ferric, alloyed, and ferrous states. The presence of ferrous components suggests strong interactions between the nanoparticles and alumina support. Platinum's ability to enhance the reduction of iron in contact with it is also noted. These characteristics lead to variations in catalytic performance and mechanism compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism for the PROX reaction over bimetallic Pt-Fe catalysts.

研究证明，新型的氧化铝支持的PtFe合金纳米粒子在富氢气氛中对CO氧化（PROX）反应具有增强的活性和选择性，与传统的Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比。催化剂在低于100°C的温度下显示出稳定的CO转化率，并且在较低温度下具有更高的CO2选择性。通过X射线衍射和57Fe磁共振光谱的结果证实，纳米粒子处于高分散的合金状态，铁以三价、合金化和二价形式存在。出现二价成分表明纳米粒子与氧化铝支持物之间存在强烈的相互作用。铂能够促进与之接触的铁的还原的能力也被注意到。这些特征导致了与传统制备催化剂相比，催化性能和机制的变化。这项研究为了解双金属Pt-Fe催化剂上PROX反应的催化机制做出了贡献。
