The literature discusses the development and application of bimetallic catalysts, specifically focusing on the use of supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) in rich-hydrogen atmospheres. These catalysts aim to improve the efficiency of fuel cells. The study investigates the activity and selectivity of novel alumina-supported PtFe x (where x = 1, 2, and 3) alloy nanoparticles at low temperatures for the PROX reaction, providing insights into the enhanced catalytic performance compared to conventional methods. The research employs techniques like 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to characterize the structural properties and iron states within these catalysts. Additionally, the study explores the catalytic performance of the PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3, and PtFe3/Al2O3 samples without hydrogen reduction, revealing differences in their activity and product selectivity profiles. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction over bimetallic Pt-Fe catalysts.
