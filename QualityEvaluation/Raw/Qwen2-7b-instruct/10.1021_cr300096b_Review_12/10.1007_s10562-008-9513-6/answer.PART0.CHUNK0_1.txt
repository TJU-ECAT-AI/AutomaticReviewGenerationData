<p>The present study, focusing on the development of novel supported PtFe catalysts, aimed to enhance the activity and selectivity for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. The catalysts were prepared using Pt(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3 reduced by ethylene glycol in an Ar atmosphere at 185°C. The catalytic experiments demonstrated that the prepared materials were more active for the PROX reaction under pretreatment in both He and H2 atmospheres compared to a conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>The structural properties and iron state were investigated using X-ray diffraction and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results showed that the novel as-prepared PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3, and PtFe3/Al2O3 materials were distinct in their architecture and the oxidation state of iron compared to the conventionally prepared one.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance over the PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3, and PtFe3/Al2O3 samples was also investigated without the H2 reduction. The results indicated that at the low temperature range, there was no significant difference in activity and product selectivity within the experimental error over the samples, suggesting they are essentially active to the PROX reaction before pretreatment.</p>

The study developed novel PtFe catalysts for the preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, demonstrating enhanced activity and selectivity compared to conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts' unique architecture and iron state, identified through X-ray diffraction and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, led to improved catalytic performance. Notably, the catalysts showed similar activity and product selectivity even without H2 reduction pretreatment, indicating their inherent activity for the PROX reaction.

本研究开发了一种新型的PtFe催化剂，用于氢气富集气氛下的CO选择性氧化反应，其活性和选择性优于传统的Pt/Al2O3催化剂。通过X射线衍射和57Fe Mossbauer光谱分析确定了催化剂的独特结构和铁的状态，这导致了催化性能的提高。值得注意的是，即使在未进行H2还原预处理的情况下，催化剂也显示出相似的活性和产物选择性，这表明它们本身就具有进行PROX反应的能力。
