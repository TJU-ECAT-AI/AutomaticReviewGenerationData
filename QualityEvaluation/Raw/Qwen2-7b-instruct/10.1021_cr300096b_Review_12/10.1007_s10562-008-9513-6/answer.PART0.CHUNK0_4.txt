There is wide interest in the development of novel heterogeneous catalysts that are applicable to the carbon monoxide (CO) preferential oxidation (PROX) in rich-hydrogen atmosphere to improve the efficiency of fuel cells [110].
Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts so far for the CO oxidation, PROX reaction and cathodic materials of the PEM fuel cells, supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles prepared by one improved method have been investigated by several groups [36, 8].
Liu et al. reported an iron oxide promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a modified impregnation method and investigated the role of iron in enhancing the catalytic performance for the PROX reaction [3].
Kotobuki et al. reported the catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction on Pt, Fe and Pt-Fe/mordentite catalysts prepared by a conventional ion-exchange method [4].
They proposed a so-called bifunctional mechanism and pointed out that the mechanism was clearly different to that of the PROX reaction on Au catalysts supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 [7].
They also confirmed that Pt forms the metallic clusters after H2 pretreatment or the PROX reaction, whereas a large part of Fe exists as oxides even after the H2 treatment according to a XAFS characterization [5].
Tang et al. reported novel Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a modified polylol method, which showed 99% CO conversion and 98% selectivity at 80 C and n(CO)/n(O2) = 2 [6].
Very recently, Siani et al. reported the silica-supported Pt, PtFe2 and Pt5Fe2 catalysts prepared from PtFe2(COD)(CO)8 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 organometallic cluster precursors, respectively [8].
They gained better control on the stoichiometry and morphology of the resulting Pt-Fe nanoparticles due to use the above two bimetallic Pt-Fe clusters as precursor.
The cluster-derived PtFe/SiO2 catalyst showed improved CO oxidation activity in the presence and absence of hydrogen as compared to that prepared by the conventional methods.
However, we still have a doubt whether the best composition of the supported bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst was found or not due to the limited composition of the cluster precursor.
On the other hand, the chemical synthesis of self-assembled and monodispersed PtFe alloy nanoparticles have been widely investigated for the new generation ultra density magnetic storage [1320].
It is interesting to develop novel supported chemically disordered and/or ordered PtFe alloy nanoparticles and deeply investigate their catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction by mainly using 57Fe Mssbauer Mssbauer spectroscopy under various experimental conditions.
In the present study, the results of three kinds of novel alumina-supported PtFe x (x = 1, 2 and 3) alloy nanoparticles, which were prepared by modifying the reported chemical process [1320], are described for the enhanced activity and selectivity at low temperatures (< 100 C) for the PROX reaction and for the structural characterization by using 57Fe Mssbauer Mssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

This study investigates the development of novel PtFe alloy nanoparticles for improving the efficiency of fuel cell operations through enhanced CO preferential oxidation (PROX) reactions. It explores the differences in the catalytic performance, architecture, and oxidation state of iron in various PtFe materials, compared to conventionally prepared catalysts. The study utilizes 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze the structures and properties of the catalysts. The researchers aim to understand how these differences might influence the catalytic mechanisms of CO oxidation, the water-gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies.
