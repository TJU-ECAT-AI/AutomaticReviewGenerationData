<p>The present study is essentially benefit to obtaining a completed exploration on the catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction over the bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst.</p>
<p>There were no large difference in the activity and product selectivity within the experimental error over PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3 and PtFe3/Al2O3 treated in H2 as compared to that treated in He at 400 C.</p>
<p>The XRD and 57Fe Mssbauer results indicate that PtFe, PtFe2 and PtFe3 nanoparticles supported on alumina are in high dispersion and exist as alloyed state.</p>
<p>The relative resonance area of the ferrous species decreased in the increase of Pt molar fractions contained in the as-prepared catalysts, indicating that Pt can enhance the reduction of iron intimately contacting with them.</p>
<p>These differences are reasonable to lead their catalytic performance and mechanism changed somewhat.</p>

The research demonstrates that the novel alumina-supported PtFe alloy nanoparticles exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity for the CO oxidation (PROX) reaction in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, compared to conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts show a steady-state CO conversion at temperatures below 100°C and higher CO2 selectivity at lower temperatures. The XRD and 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy results confirm that the nanoparticles are in a high-dispersed alloyed state with iron in ferric, alloyed, and ferrous states. The presence of ferrous components suggests strong interactions between the nanoparticles and alumina support. Platinum's ability to enhance the reduction of iron in contact with it is also noted. These characteristics lead to variations in catalytic performance and mechanism compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism for the PROX reaction over bimetallic Pt-Fe catalysts.

<p>The present study, focusing on the development of novel supported PtFe catalysts, aimed to enhance the activity and selectivity for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. The catalysts were prepared using Pt(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3 reduced by ethylene glycol in an Ar atmosphere at 185°C. The catalytic experiments demonstrated that the prepared materials were more active for the PROX reaction under pretreatment in both He and H2 atmospheres compared to a conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>The structural properties and iron state were investigated using X-ray diffraction and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results showed that the novel as-prepared PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3, and PtFe3/Al2O3 materials were distinct in their architecture and the oxidation state of iron compared to the conventionally prepared one.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance over the PtFe/Al2O3, PtFe2/Al2O3, and PtFe3/Al2O3 samples was also investigated without the H2 reduction. The results indicated that at the low temperature range, there was no significant difference in activity and product selectivity within the experimental error over the samples, suggesting they are essentially active to the PROX reaction before pretreatment.</p>

There is wide interest in the development of novel heterogeneous catalysts that are applicable to the carbon monoxide (CO) preferential oxidation (PROX) in rich-hydrogen atmosphere to improve the efficiency of fuel cells [110].
Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts so far for the CO oxidation, PROX reaction and cathodic materials of the PEM fuel cells, supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles prepared by one improved method have been investigated by several groups [36, 8].
Liu et al. reported an iron oxide promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a modified impregnation method and investigated the role of iron in enhancing the catalytic performance for the PROX reaction [3].
Kotobuki et al. reported the catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction on Pt, Fe and Pt-Fe/mordentite catalysts prepared by a conventional ion-exchange method [4].
They proposed a so-called bifunctional mechanism and pointed out that the mechanism was clearly different to that of the PROX reaction on Au catalysts supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 [7].
They also confirmed that Pt forms the metallic clusters after H2 pretreatment or the PROX reaction, whereas a large part of Fe exists as oxides even after the H2 treatment according to a XAFS characterization [5].
Tang et al. reported novel Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a modified polylol method, which showed 99% CO conversion and 98% selectivity at 80 C and n(CO)/n(O2) = 2 [6].
Very recently, Siani et al. reported the silica-supported Pt, PtFe2 and Pt5Fe2 catalysts prepared from PtFe2(COD)(CO)8 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 organometallic cluster precursors, respectively [8].
They gained better control on the stoichiometry and morphology of the resulting Pt-Fe nanoparticles due to use the above two bimetallic Pt-Fe clusters as precursor.
The cluster-derived PtFe/SiO2 catalyst showed improved CO oxidation activity in the presence and absence of hydrogen as compared to that prepared by the conventional methods.
However, we still have a doubt whether the best composition of the supported bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst was found or not due to the limited composition of the cluster precursor.
On the other hand, the chemical synthesis of self-assembled and monodispersed PtFe alloy nanoparticles have been widely investigated for the new generation ultra density magnetic storage [1320].
It is interesting to develop novel supported chemically disordered and/or ordered PtFe alloy nanoparticles and deeply investigate their catalytic mechanism of the PROX reaction by mainly using 57Fe Mssbauer Mssbauer spectroscopy under various experimental conditions.
