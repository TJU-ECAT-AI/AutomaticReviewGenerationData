The scientific literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum, impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, the water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The use of core-shell nanoparticles provides insights into the reactivity patterns of these processes. Future UHV studies seek to bridge the gap between theoretical model surfaces and practical applications, aiming to correlate findings from model systems with real-world catalysts despite existing limitations.

In situ infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) measurements were performed using a Nicolet Nexus 670 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer, which was equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector cooled with liquid nitrogen, to identify the intermediates and products of ethanol oxidation.

The study examines the performance of cobalt-platinum (Co-Pt) powders and catalysts supported on gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) and a graphite-like carbon material named Sibunit in the selective oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) within hydrogen-containing mixtures. The bimetallic catalysts are found to be more active than their single-metal counterparts, enabling a significant reduction in CO concentration—from 1 to 103 volume percent—within hydrogen-rich environments.
