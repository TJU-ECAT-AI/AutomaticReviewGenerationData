Bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on platinum (Pt), have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts show distinct reactivity patterns compared to monometallic catalysts. Future studies utilizing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques may provide crucial insights into the surface chemistry of Pt-based bimetallic systems, correlating surface properties with catalytic activity.

The research focuses on developing a ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst for the efficient oxidation of ethanol to CO2. The catalyst combines the properties of platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide nanoparticles on a carbon support. Key findings include:

          - The PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst shows significantly higher activity in oxidizing ethanol compared to other catalysts, as evidenced by the higher current densities observed at various potentials.
          - The Tafel slope of the PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is 120mV, indicating that the first charge transfer is the rate-limiting step in the oxidation process.
          - Water adsorption on the SnO2 surface is verified through multiple studies, suggesting its role in promoting the catalytic process.
          - The initial step of ethanol adsorption involves δ-CH dissociation on the platinum surface, leading to the formation of acetaldehyde and acetic acid species. Surface-enhanced infrared measurements for Pt confirm that the partial oxidation of ethanol generates CH3CHO and CH3COOH species.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, show enhanced activity in selective CO oxidation within hydrogen-containing mixtures. Compared to their monometallic counterparts (Pt or Co), these bimetallic catalysts enable a significant reduction in CO concentration, from 1 to 103 volume percent.
