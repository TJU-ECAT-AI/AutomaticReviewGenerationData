Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 occurs via an oxametallacyclic conformation, which enables a reasonable rate of direct cleavage of the CC bond. The superior activity of platinum-ruthenium in methanol oxidation compared to ethanol oxidation might stem from ruthenium's high tendency to form RuOH upon interaction with water at potentials greater than 0V, a reaction that cannot be suppressed in the presence of SnOH as it is with weakly bound RhOH.", "Chinese": "在设计双金属和表面合金时，应致力于用能提供接近铑的吸附和表面氧化性质的材料来替换昂贵的铑。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，乙醇在PtRh/SnO2上的氧化通过一个氧胺金属环结构进行，这使得直接切割CC键以合理速率成为可能。铂-钌在甲醇氧化中的高活性与乙醇氧化中缺乏活性可能归因于钌在水合大于0V时形成RuOH的高倾向，这一反应在SnOH存在的情况下不能被抑制，而这是弱结合的RhOH所不具备的特性。", "Doi": "10.1038/nmat2359"},
