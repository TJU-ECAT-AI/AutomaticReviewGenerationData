          [2] "The DFT calculations demonstrated that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 proceeds through oxametallacyclic conformation that facilitates the direct cleavage of the CC bond at a reasonable rate."
          [3] "The high activity of PtRu for methanol oxidation and the lack of it for ethanol oxidation seems to be due to a high propensity of Ru to form RuOH in interaction with H2O at potentials E>0V (ref. 25)."

          [2] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content."
          [3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion."
          [4] "The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs."
          [5] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results."

[1] "Fine particles of metal-metal solid solutions and intermetallides were obtained by the decomposition of a Co- and Pt-containing double complex salt in a hydrogen atmosphere at 400C."
          [2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."
          [3] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."
