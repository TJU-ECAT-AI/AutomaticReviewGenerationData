          [3] "The high activity of PtRu for methanol oxidation and the lack of it for ethanol oxidation seems to be due to a high propensity of Ru to form RuOH in interaction with H2O at potentials E>0V (ref. 25)."

          [5] "On platinum, the first step on adsorption of ethanol involves δ-CH dissociation18, leading to the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde: Our surface-enhanced infrared measurements for Pt (ref. 19) show that the partial oxidation of ethanol generates CH3CHO and CH3COOH species."
