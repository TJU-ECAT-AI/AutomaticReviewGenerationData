This work provides insights into the synergistic effects of the Pt, Rh, and SnO2 components, highlighting their contributions to the efficient oxidation of ethanol to CO2. The findings are significant for the development of practical direct ethanol fuel cells and may inspire the design of more effective bimetallic catalysts for similar reactions.

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, exhibit higher activity in selective CO oxidation within hydrogen-containing mixtures compared to their monometallic counterparts. They enable a significant reduction in CO concentration, ranging from 1 to 103 volume percent, which suggests enhanced efficiency in CO conversion processes.
