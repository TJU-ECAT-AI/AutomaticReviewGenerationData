          The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), exhibit enhanced activity in the selective oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) within hydrogen-containing mixtures. Compared to their monometallic counterparts (Pt or Co), these bimetallic catalysts enable a significant reduction in CO concentration, from as low as 1 vol % to up to 103 vol %. This improved efficiency is attributed to the formation of a Co-Pt solid solution on the surface of the catalyst support, which creates a unique catalytic environment that enhances the oxidation process.
