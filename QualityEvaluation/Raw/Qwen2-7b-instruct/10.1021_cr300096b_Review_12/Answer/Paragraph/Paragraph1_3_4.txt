            <p>The preferential CO oxidation over Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is greatly influenced by the composition of the metal core and shell, which is essential for understanding their reactivity in chemical transformations such as water gas shift reaction and methane conversions. This mechanism is crucial for comprehending the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various chemical transformations, including CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. Our experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the activity of ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is due to the specific property of each constituent, induced by their interactions. The Tafel slope of 120mV obtained from the plot indicates that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step. The coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS spectroscopy show that the nanoparticles have a size range of approximately 13nm, aligning with TEM analysis.</p>
            <p>The ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is capable of oxidizing ethanol to CO2 efficiently due to the synergistic effects of its components—platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide—which interact with each other. This catalyst uniquely splits the CC bond in ethanol at room temperature, enabling its conversion to CO2 at low potentials—a feat not accomplished by existing catalysts. The addition of platinum to bimetallic catalysts results in smaller metal particles, enhancing the electron-withdrawing capability of Pt centers. This modification affects Ni's chemical behavior, increasing its reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data. The Vegards rule applied to XRD data on spent catalysts indicates a similar composition of the solid solution to the catalyst's virtual composition. The alloy exhibits a surface enrichment with Pt, featuring a smaller crystal size than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, which might explain the higher νCO for terminal carbonyls.</p>
            <p>The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is superior to their monometallic counterparts. The bimetallic catalysts enable a significant reduction in CO concentration within the mixtures, demonstrating enhanced activity. Fine particles of metal-metal solid solutions and intermetallides were obtained by the decomposition of a Co- and Pt-containing double complex salt in a hydrogen atmosphere at 400°C. As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %.</p>
