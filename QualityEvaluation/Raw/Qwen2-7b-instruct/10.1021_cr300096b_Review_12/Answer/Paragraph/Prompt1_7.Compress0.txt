This modification affects Ni's chemical behavior, increasing its reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data. The Vegards rule applied to XRD data on spent catalysts indicates a similar composition of the solid solution to the catalyst's virtual composition. The alloy exhibits a surface enrichment with Pt, featuring a smaller crystal size than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, which might explain the higher νCO for terminal carbonyls. A fcc solid solution is confirmed for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, consistent with previous silica-supported PtNi catalyst studies. The surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts is characterized by Pt-rich metal surfaces with dispersed, easily oxidized Ni centers, as reported by Mukainakano et al.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.05.020"},
