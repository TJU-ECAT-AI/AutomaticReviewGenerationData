These studies underscore the importance of the interaction between constituent metals and their specific properties in achieving superior catalytic performance.</p>
            <p>Despite the progress made, there remains a need for deeper insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, especially through ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies. The limitations of current UHV techniques pose challenges in fully understanding the intricate mechanisms involved at the atomic level. As discussed in \[10.1021/ja101108w\], future UHV studies may provide more profound insights into these correlations, offering a clearer picture of how these catalysts operate under controlled conditions.</p>
