Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/nmat2359\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.05.020\], and \[10.1134/s0023158407020127\]. The preferential CO oxidation over Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is greatly influenced by the composition of the metal core and shell, which is essential for understanding their reactivity in chemical transformations such as water gas shift reaction and methane conversions. Future UHV studies could offer more profound insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite existing constraints.

                The ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is capable of oxidizing ethanol to CO2 efficiently due to the synergistic effects of its components—platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide—which interact with each other. The first charge transfer is the rate-determining step, as indicated by a Tafel slope of 120mV. The coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS spectroscopy show that the nanoparticles have a size range of approximately 13nm, in good agreement with TEM analysis. This electrocatalyst uniquely splits the CC bond in ethanol at room temperature, enabling its efficient conversion to CO2 at low potentials—a feat not accomplished by existing catalysts.

                The addition of platinum to bimetallic catalysts results in smaller metal particles, enhancing the electron-withdrawing capability of Pt centers. This modification affects Ni's chemical behavior, increasing its reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data. The Vegards rule applied to XRD data on spent catalysts indicates a similar composition of the solid solution to the catalyst's virtual composition. The alloy exhibits a surface enrichment with Pt, featuring a smaller crystal size than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, which might explain the higher νCO for terminal carbonyls. A fcc solid solution is confirmed for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, consistent with previous silica-supported PtNi catalyst studies. The surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts is characterized by Pt-rich metal surfaces with dispersed, easily oxidized Ni centers, as reported by Mukainakano et al.

                三元PtRhSnO2电催化剂能够高效地将乙醇氧化为CO2，这是由于其成分——铂、铑和二氧化锡——之间协同效应的结果，它们相互作用。第一个电荷转移是决定性步骤，由120mV的塔菲尔斜率指示。通过扩展吸收近边X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱的协调数显示，纳米颗粒具有大约13nm的尺寸范围，这与透射电子显微镜（TEM）分析结果一致。这种电催化剂在室温下的酸溶液中独特地分裂了乙醇中的CC键，使CO2的低电势氧化成为可能，这是现有催化剂无法实现的。
