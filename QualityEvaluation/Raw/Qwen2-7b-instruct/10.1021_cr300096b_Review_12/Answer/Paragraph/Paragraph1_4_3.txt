        Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency of key catalytic processes including CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. These reactions are fundamental in chemical engineering and industrial applications, especially in the production of hydrogen, syngas, and other valuable chemicals. The utilization of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts has been extensively studied due to their exceptional reactivity and selectivity, often outperforming their monometallic counterparts.

        The preferential CO oxidation over Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is significantly influenced by the composition of the metal core and shell, which directly impacts the reactivity of these catalysts in various chemical transformations. This finding underscores the importance of tailoring the metal composition for optimized catalytic performance. The water gas shift reaction and methane conversions are notably improved when employing Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, highlighting their unique properties and broad applicability.

        Despite the significant advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, future ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies offer promising avenues for deeper insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts. These studies, although currently constrained by technological limitations, hold the potential to provide a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst behavior under ideal conditions, paving the way for the development of more efficient catalysts.

        The ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst demonstrates the potential for efficient ethanol oxidation to CO2 through the synergistic interaction of its components. This catalyst's activity is attributed to the specific properties of each constituent, which are enhanced by their interactions. The Tafel slope of 120mV signifies the first charge transfer as the rate-determining step, indicating an efficient electron transfer process. The coordination numbers derived from EXAFS spectroscopy reveal a nanoparticle size range of approximately 13nm, in line with TEM analysis. This catalyst uniquely enables the efficient conversion of ethanol to CO2 at low potentials, a feat not accomplished by existing catalysts.

        The addition of platinum to bimetallic catalysts results in smaller metal particles, which significantly enhances the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers. This modification affects the chemical behavior of the constituent metals, increasing their reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data. The Vegards rule applied to XRD data suggests a similar composition of the solid solution to the catalyst's virtual composition. The surface of the alloy is enriched with Pt, featuring a smaller crystal size than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, which may explain the higher νCO for terminal carbonyls. A fcc solid solution is confirmed for certain samples, consistent with previous studies on silica-supported PtNi catalysts.

        The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures surpasses that of their monometallic counterparts, allowing for a significant reduction in CO concentration within the mixtures. This enhanced activity showcases the superior catalytic performance of bimetallic systems.

        In summary, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. Their enhanced reactivity and selectivity are attributed to the optimized composition and interaction between the metals. Future UHV studies, despite current limitations, promise to deepen our understanding of these catalysts' behavior on model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.
