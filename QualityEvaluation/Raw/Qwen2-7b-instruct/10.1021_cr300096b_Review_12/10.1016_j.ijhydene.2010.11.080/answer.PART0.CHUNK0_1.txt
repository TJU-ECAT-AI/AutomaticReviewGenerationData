"Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
"The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."
"0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

The study reveals that among the tested PtNi bimetallic catalysts, the one with a low Ni/Pt ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and stability. This is attributed to the ease of reducing nickel oxide species and the formation of smaller, well-dispersed nickel particles due to the intimate interaction between platinum and nickel sites. The catalyst's ability to operate effectively under various feed conditions without significant deactivation suggests its promising application in synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology. The surface reaction mechanisms change based on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts, indicating that the optimal catalyst configuration can vary depending on the specific conditions of the reforming process.

研究发现，在测试的所有PtNi双金属催化剂中，Ni/Pt比例最低的0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3样品表现出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这归因于镍氧化物物种的容易还原以及由于铂和镍位点之间紧密相互作用而形成的较小且分布更好的镍颗粒。该催化剂能够在各种进料条件下有效运行，且不会出现显著失活，这表明其在气体到液体技术中的合成气生产方面具有非常有前景的应用。表面反应机制根据催化剂中Pt负载和Ni/Pt比例的不同而改变，这意味着最优催化剂配置可能取决于重整过程的具体条件。
