The study on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO2 reforming of methane revealed that the catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. Specifically, the 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, featuring the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, demonstrated the highest activity and stability. This outcome was attributed to the easy reduction of nickel oxide species and the formation of smaller, well-dispersed nickel particles due to the strong interaction between platinum and nickel sites. The catalyst's capability to operate effectively under various feed conditions underscores its potential for synthesis gas production, particularly for gas-to-liquid technologies. Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially enhancing our understanding of surface reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

该关于PtNi双金属催化剂用于CO2甲烷重整的研究表明，催化性能受到金属负载和Ni/Pt负载比的影响。具体而言，0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3催化剂，其Ni/Pt比例最低，表现出最高的活性和稳定性。这一结果归因于镍氧化物种的容易还原和形成较小、分散性较好的镍颗粒，这是由于铂和镍位点之间强烈的相互作用导致的。该催化剂在各种进料条件下的有效操作能力表明，它对于合成气生产特别有前景，特别是对于气体到液体技术。未来UHV研究可以为将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联提供有价值的见解，可能增强我们对Pt基双金属表面表面反应的理解。
