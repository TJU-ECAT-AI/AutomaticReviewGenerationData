[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."
[2] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[3] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."
[4] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The PtNi catalysts, especially those with a low Ni/Pt ratio, such as 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, demonstrate higher activity and stability compared to others. The surface reaction mechanisms associated with these catalysts adapt based on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio. The 0.3Pt10Ni sample stands out due to its capability to operate effectively under diverse feed conditions without substantial deactivation, indicating its potential for synthesis gas production in gas-to-liquid technology.

Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Although UHV studies currently have limitations, they offer a means to understand the detailed interactions at the atomic level, potentially leading to the optimization of catalysts for enhanced performance. However, the current limitations might affect the accuracy of these correlations, necessitating further research to overcome existing constraints.

铂镍双金属催化剂在甲烷二氧化碳重整反应中的应用，显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的机制和效率。特别是低镍/铂比率的催化剂，如0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3，展现出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这些催化剂表面的反应机制会根据铂负载量和镍/铂比率的不同而发生变化。0.3Pt10Ni样品特别突出，因为它能够在各种进料条件下稳定运行，没有显著失活，表明其在气到液体技术中合成气体生产方面的巨大潜力。

未来对基于铂的双金属表面进行超高真空(UHV)研究，可以为模型表面和支撑催化剂提供有价值的信息，以实现这些发现的关联。尽管UHV研究目前存在局限性，但它们提供了一种方法来理解原子水平上的相互作用细节，从而有可能优化催化剂以提高性能。然而，当前的限制可能会影响这些关联的准确性，需要进一步的研究来克服现有障碍。
