[1] "Selected catalyst samples, before and after reaction, were characterized by XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA and SEM-EDS."
[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[4] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[5] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The catalytic performance depends on the metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. Catalysts with a lower Ni/Pt ratio exhibit higher activity and stability. The intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites leads to easier reduction of nickel oxide species and better dispersion of smaller nano-sized nickel particles. This results in enhanced efficiency under various feed conditions. Future UHV studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially offering deeper insights into the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

在反应器研究中，特别是基于铂的双金属催化剂，显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。催化剂性能依赖于金属负载和Ni/Pt负载比。具有较低Ni/Pt摩尔比的催化剂表现出更高的活性和稳定性。Pt和Ni位点之间的紧密相互作用导致镍氧化物种的较容易还原以及更好的分散更小的纳米尺寸镍颗粒，从而在各种进料条件下提高效率。未来UHV研究可以将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，可能提供对Pt基双金属表面行为的更深入见解。
