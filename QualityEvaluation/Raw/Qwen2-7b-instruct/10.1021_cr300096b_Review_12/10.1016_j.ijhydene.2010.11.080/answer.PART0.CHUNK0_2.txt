[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."
[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[4] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[5] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by showing that their catalytic performance depends significantly on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio. The catalyst with the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, demonstrated the highest activity and stability. This catalyst allows for easier reduction of nickel oxide species and better dispersion due to the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites. Furthermore, this catalyst is capable of operating under various feed conditions without significant deactivation, making it a promising candidate for synthesis gas production in gas-to-liquid technology. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may pose challenges.

这些双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，在反应器研究中影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率，这表明其催化性能显著依赖于金属负载量和Ni/Pt负载比。具有最低Ni/Pt摩尔比（0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3）的催化剂显示出最高的活性和稳定性。这种催化剂可以轻松还原镍氧化物物种，并且由于Pt和Ni位点之间的紧密相互作用，具有更好的分散性，形成更小的纳米级镍颗粒。此外，该催化剂能够在各种进料条件下运行，而无需显着失活，使其成为气体到液体技术中合成气体生产的有前景候选者。未来在超高真空（UHV）研究中可能能够将这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂相关联，尽管当前UHV研究中的Pt基双金属表面限制可能会带来挑战。
