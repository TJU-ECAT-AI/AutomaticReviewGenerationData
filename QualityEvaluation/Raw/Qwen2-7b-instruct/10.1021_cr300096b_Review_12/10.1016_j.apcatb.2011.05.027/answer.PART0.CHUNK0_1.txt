[1] "A Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) was capable of reforming sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h on stream at low space velocity conditions."
[2] "Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking."
[3] "The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible."
[4] "Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration."
[5] "Therefore the catalyst underwent some irreversible change which did not allow full activity to be recovered."
[6] "Although it was found that sulfur was the primary cause of deactivation it was not the sole cause of the irreversibility in the catalyst deactivation/regeneration process."
[7] "A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel."
[8] "XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments."

The steam reforming of 85% pure ethanol, 15% gasoline (E85) with and without sulfur was studied over a bimetallic precious metal (Rh/Pt) catalyst deposited on a ceramic monolith. The catalyst could achieve 100% ethanol and gasoline conversion to equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h reforming a sulfur-free E85 fuel. In the presence of 5 ppm sulfur the catalyst maintained 100% ethanol and 100% gasoline conversion for approximately 22 h before rapid deactivation resulted in ethanol conversion values below 21%. TPO analysis established large carbon deposits had formed on the catalyst surface demonstrating that sulfur promoted carbon formation. Following such extensive deactivation full activity was recovered after treating the catalyst with air; however subsequent deactivation occurred more rapidly indicating that some amount of permanent damage had occurred. A process with preemptive regeneration via air treatment was studied and it was found to extend the period of stable activity.

对85%纯乙醇、15%汽油（E85）进行蒸汽重整研究，催化剂为双金属贵金属（Rh/Pt），沉积在陶瓷蜂窝上。在无硫的E85燃料下，催化剂可以在至少110小时内实现100%乙醇和汽油转化为平衡浓度的H2、CO、CO2和CH4，且未显示出失活迹象。在5 ppm硫的情况下，催化剂在大约22小时后保持100%的乙醇和100%的汽油转化率，随后迅速失活导致乙醇转化率低于21%。TPO分析表明，催化剂表面形成了大量碳沉积物，证明了硫促进了碳形成。在严重失活后，通过空气处理恢复了催化剂的活性，但随后的失活发生得更快，表明一定量的永久性损害已经发生。研究了一种预先再生过程，发现它能够延长稳定活动期，重整含硫燃料。
