[1] "Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption."
[2] "It has been found that the presence of higher hydrocarbons in a fuel, specifically aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon deposition."
[3] "Sulfur, which is also present in many transportation fuels is a known catalyst poison and typically has a detrimental effect on catalyst stability."
[4] "Sulfur is not the sole cause of irreversible deactivation. Catalyst chemistry altered with extended periods of time reforming."
[5] "XPS results found neither sulfur, nor graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface."
[6] "None of the three samples showed any retained sulfur or carbon on the surface by XPS."

1. There are growing concerns about the environmental effects of gasoline-powered vehicles, leading to the development of technologies aimed at decreasing emissions and fossil fuel usage.

2. Higher hydrocarbons, especially aromatics, can lead to catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition.

3. Sulfur is recognized as a catalyst poison and negatively impacts catalyst stability in transportation fuels.

4. Sulfur is the primary cause of deactivation, but it is not the only factor leading to irreversible catalyst degradation.

5. After oxidative regeneration, neither sulfur nor graphitic carbon was detected on the catalyst surface.

6. All samples, including those treated continuously and those subjected to preemptive air treatments, showed no retained sulfur or carbon upon XPS analysis.

1. 对于以汽油为动力的车辆的环境影响日益关注，导致了旨在减少排放和化石燃料消耗的技术发展。

2. 高级烃，尤其是芳香烃，会导致催化剂失活，由于碳沉积。

3. 硫被确认为催化剂毒物，并对运输燃料的稳定性产生不利影响。

4. 虽然硫是导致失活的主要原因，但并非不可逆转催化剂退化过程中的唯一因素。

5. 在氧化再生后，催化剂表面既未检测到硫也未检测到石墨碳。

6. 所有样品，包括连续处理和预设空气回复时间处理的样品，在XPS分析中均未显示出保留的硫或碳。
