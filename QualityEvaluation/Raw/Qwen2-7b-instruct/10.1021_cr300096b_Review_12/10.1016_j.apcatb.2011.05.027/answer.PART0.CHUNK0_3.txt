[1] "A Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) was capable of reforming sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h on stream at low space velocity conditions."
[2] "Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking."
[3] "The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible."
[4] "Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration."
[5] "A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel."
[6] "XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments."

1. The Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) could reform sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations without signs of deactivation for up to 110 hours under low space velocity conditions.
2. High space velocity conditions led to catalyst instability, possibly due to the formation of coke from C2 intermediates, especially ethylene.
3. Adding 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel caused significant catalyst deactivation within 22 hours, making hydrogen production unfeasible for industrial use.
4. Air treatment could restore the catalyst to its original activity, albeit with accelerated deactivation following regeneration.
5. A preemptive regeneration process enabled extended stable operation of the catalyst under sulfur-containing conditions.
6. XPS analysis showed that continuous exposure to reforming conditions led to a chemical change in the catalyst, distinct from that with periodic air treatments.

1. Rh/Pt催化剂（BASF SR10D）在低空间速度条件下能够将无硫E85还原至平衡浓度，且至少持续110小时没有发现失活迹象。
2. 高空间速度条件导致催化剂不稳定，可能由于C2中间体尤其是乙烯形成焦炭所致。
3. 向燃料中添加5 ppm硫导致催化剂在22小时内发生显著失活，使工业氢生产变得不可行。
4. 空气处理可以恢复催化剂到原始活性，但再生后失活速度加快。
5. 预先进行的再生过程使催化剂在含硫条件下实现了稳定的运行。
6. XPS分析显示，连续暴露于还原条件会导致催化剂发生化学变化，与周期性空气处理不同。
