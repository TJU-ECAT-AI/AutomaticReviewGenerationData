[1] "A Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) was capable of reforming sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h on stream at low space velocity conditions."
[2] "Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The steam reforming of 85% pure ethanol, 15% gasoline (E85) with and without sulfur was studied over a bimetallic precious metal (Rh/Pt) catalyst deposited on a ceramic monolith. The catalyst could achieve 100% ethanol and gasoline conversion to equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h reforming a sulfur-free E85 fuel. In the presence of 5 ppm sulfur the catalyst maintained 100% ethanol and 100% gasoline conversion for approximately 22 h before rapid deactivation resulted in ethanol conversion values below 21%. TPO analysis established large carbon deposits had formed on the catalyst surface demonstrating that sulfur promoted carbon formation. Following such extensive deactivation full activity was recovered after treating the catalyst with air; however subsequent deactivation occurred more rapidly indicating that some amount of permanent damage had occurred. A process with preemptive regeneration via air treatment was studied and it was found to extend the period of stable activity.

对85%纯乙醇、15%汽油（E85）进行蒸汽重整研究，催化剂为双金属贵金属（Rh/Pt），沉积在陶瓷蜂窝上。在无硫的E85燃料下，催化剂可以在至少110小时内实现100%乙醇和汽油转化为平衡浓度的H2、CO、CO2和CH4，且未显示出失活迹象。在5 ppm硫的情况下，催化剂在大约22小时后保持100%的乙醇和100%的汽油转化率，随后迅速失活导致乙醇转化率低于21%。TPO分析表明，催化剂表面形成了大量碳沉积物，证明了硫促进了碳形成。在严重失活后，通过空气处理恢复了催化剂的活性，但随后的失活发生得更快，表明一定量的永久性损害已经发生。研究了一种预先再生过程，发现它能够延长稳定活动期，重整含硫燃料。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel resulted in deactivation after 22 hours of operation, limiting hydrogen production to non-industrial levels. Air treatments could restore the catalyst to its original performance, albeit with a faster rate of deactivation post-regeneration. An irreversible change occurred during the operation, preventing the catalyst from achieving full activity again. A preemptive regeneration process allowed for a prolonged period of stable operation, especially when dealing with sulfur-containing fuels. XPS analysis showed that the catalyst's precious metal oxidation state changed depending on whether the catalyst was continuously in operation or subjected to periodic air treatments.

在燃料中添加5ppm硫导致催化剂在22小时后发生失活，使得氢产量无法达到工业标准。空气处理可以将催化剂恢复到初始状态，但再生后失活的速度更快。催化剂经历了一些不可逆的变化，阻止了其完全恢复活性。预设的再生过程允许在较长时间内保持稳定的运行，尤其是在处理含硫燃料时。XPS分析显示，催化剂的贵重金属氧化态变化取决于催化剂是否连续运行或接受周期性的空气处理。

1. The Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) could reform sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations without signs of deactivation for up to 110 hours under low space velocity conditions.
2. High space velocity conditions led to catalyst instability, possibly due to the formation of coke from C2 intermediates, especially ethylene.
3. Adding 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel caused significant catalyst deactivation within 22 hours, making hydrogen production unfeasible for industrial use.
4. Air treatment could restore the catalyst to its original activity, albeit with accelerated deactivation following regeneration.
5. A preemptive regeneration process enabled extended stable operation of the catalyst under sulfur-containing conditions.
6. XPS analysis showed that continuous exposure to reforming conditions led to a chemical change in the catalyst, distinct from that with periodic air treatments.

<p>The results shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 , in conjunction with the XPS and TPO analyses, demonstrate that sulfur promotes carbon formation, since deactivation was not measured under these conditions in the absence of sulfur.</p>
<p>Despite the significant impact of sulfur, XPS tests on the aged catalyst did not measure sulfur indicating that the sulfur did not adsorb on the surface of the aged catalyst or that the amount was less than the XPS detection limits.</p>
<p>It is likely that these small amounts of sulfur measured by ICP are not the sole cause of deactivation and rather that sulfur is able to temporarily adsorb to the surface and induce changes to the mechanism or catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Under the experimental conditions, coking and sulfur are the most likely causes of deactivation. As discussed earlier, coking was evidenced by substantial mass loss during TPO and the generation of CO2 in the effluent during both the TPO tests in Section 3.2 and the reactor tests in Section 3.3. Sulfur is also suspected of causing deactivation since it often bonds strongly to catalytic sites [4] and causes site poisoning.</p>
<p>In Section 3.3 it was shown that after various extents of deactivation, air treatments did not return the catalyst to its initial chemical and/or structural state because deactivation occurred more quickly following successive regenerations.</p>
<p>Consistent with results for the sulfur containing fuel, full activity returned after each regeneration but catalyst performance worsened with successive regeneration attempts. As shown in Fig. 7 conversion decreased more rapidly following air treatments. Therefore, the catalyst deactivation had an irreversible nature which was seen at both high and low space velocities, and both in the presence and absence of sulfur.</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanism by which these periodic air treatments prolong stable performance, XPS was performed on the catalyst used for 7 cycles of reforming and pre-emptive regeneration.</p>
<p>None of the three samples showed any retained sulfur or carbon on the surface by XPS. The rhodium 3d 5/2 XPS peaks are shown in Fig. 9.</p>

1. Sulfur promotes carbon formation, leading to deactivation in the steam reforming process of ethanol/gasoline blends. This was observed in the presence of sulfur, but not in its absence, indicating sulfur's role in deactivation.
2. Sulfur, despite its significant impact, was not detected on the surface of aged catalysts via XPS tests, suggesting it might not adsorb directly to the catalyst surface or its amount is below detection limits.
3. The small quantities of sulfur measured by ICP are not considered the sole cause of deactivation, implying sulfur might temporarily adsorb to the catalyst surface and induce changes in its mechanism or structure.
4. Coking and sulfur are identified as the main causes of catalyst deactivation under the experimental conditions. Coking was evidenced by substantial mass loss during TPO and the release of CO2 in the effluent, while sulfur poisoning was suspected due to its strong bonding to catalytic sites and its ability to cause site poisoning.
5. Air treatments, though capable of regenerating the catalyst to its initial activity, failed to return the catalyst to its initial chemical and structural state, indicating an irreversible nature of deactivation.
6. The catalyst's deactivation displayed an irreversible nature, observed at both high and low space velocities and in the presence or absence of sulfur, as demonstrated by the decreasing conversion rates following successive air treatments.
7. XPS analysis on the catalyst used for 7 cycles of reforming and pre-emptive regeneration revealed no retained sulfur or carbon on the surface, suggesting a shift in the catalyst's chemical state during continuous exposure to reforming conditions, which might correlate with irreversible aspects of deactivation.

1. 硫促进了碳的形成，导致蒸汽重整乙醇/汽油混合物过程中的失活。在硫的存在下观察到这一点，但在其不存在时没有观察到，表明硫在失活中的作用。
2. 尽管硫的影响显著，但通过XPS测试未在老化催化剂的表面检测到硫，这可能意味着硫不能直接吸附到催化剂表面上，或者其量低于检测限。
3. 通过ICP测量的小量硫是失活原因的主要因素，而不是唯一的，暗示硫可能暂时吸附到催化剂表面，并引起其机制或结构的变化。
4. 在实验条件下，焦化和硫是催化剂失活的主要原因。焦化的证据是在TPO中观察到的大量质量损失和从气相释放的CO2，在TPO测试和反应器测试中，而硫中毒被怀疑是因为它强烈地结合到催化位点并导致位点中毒。
5. 虽然空气处理能够使催化剂恢复到初始活动状态，但它未能将催化剂恢复到初始的化学和结构状态，表明失活具有不可逆性。
6. 催化剂的失活显示了不可逆性，无论是在高空间速度还是低空间速度下，在硫的存在或不存在的情况下，通过连续降低转化率后每次空气处理的结果可以看出这一点。
7. 对连续经历重整和预预防性再生7周期的催化剂进行的XPS分析显示表面无残留硫或碳，暗示在持续暴露于重整条件下的过程中催化剂的化学状态发生了变化，这可能与失活的不可逆性质有关。
