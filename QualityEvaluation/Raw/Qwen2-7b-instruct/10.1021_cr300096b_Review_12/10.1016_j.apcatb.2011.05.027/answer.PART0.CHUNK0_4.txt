<p>The results shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 , in conjunction with the XPS and TPO analyses, demonstrate that sulfur promotes carbon formation, since deactivation was not measured under these conditions in the absence of sulfur.</p>
<p>Despite the significant impact of sulfur, XPS tests on the aged catalyst did not measure sulfur indicating that the sulfur did not adsorb on the surface of the aged catalyst or that the amount was less than the XPS detection limits.</p>
<p>It is likely that these small amounts of sulfur measured by ICP are not the sole cause of deactivation and rather that sulfur is able to temporarily adsorb to the surface and induce changes to the mechanism or catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Under the experimental conditions, coking and sulfur are the most likely causes of deactivation. As discussed earlier, coking was evidenced by substantial mass loss during TPO and the generation of CO2 in the effluent during both the TPO tests in Section 3.2 and the reactor tests in Section 3.3. Sulfur is also suspected of causing deactivation since it often bonds strongly to catalytic sites [4] and causes site poisoning.</p>
<p>In Section 3.3 it was shown that after various extents of deactivation, air treatments did not return the catalyst to its initial chemical and/or structural state because deactivation occurred more quickly following successive regenerations.</p>
<p>Consistent with results for the sulfur containing fuel, full activity returned after each regeneration but catalyst performance worsened with successive regeneration attempts. As shown in Fig. 7 conversion decreased more rapidly following air treatments. Therefore, the catalyst deactivation had an irreversible nature which was seen at both high and low space velocities, and both in the presence and absence of sulfur.</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanism by which these periodic air treatments prolong stable performance, XPS was performed on the catalyst used for 7 cycles of reforming and pre-emptive regeneration.</p>
<p>None of the three samples showed any retained sulfur or carbon on the surface by XPS. The rhodium 3d 5/2 XPS peaks are shown in Fig. 9.</p>

1. Sulfur promotes carbon formation, leading to deactivation in the steam reforming process of ethanol/gasoline blends. This was observed in the presence of sulfur, but not in its absence, indicating sulfur's role in deactivation.
2. Sulfur, despite its significant impact, was not detected on the surface of aged catalysts via XPS tests, suggesting it might not adsorb directly to the catalyst surface or its amount is below detection limits.
3. The small quantities of sulfur measured by ICP are not considered the sole cause of deactivation, implying sulfur might temporarily adsorb to the catalyst surface and induce changes in its mechanism or structure.
4. Coking and sulfur are identified as the main causes of catalyst deactivation under the experimental conditions. Coking was evidenced by substantial mass loss during TPO and the release of CO2 in the effluent, while sulfur poisoning was suspected due to its strong bonding to catalytic sites and its ability to cause site poisoning.
5. Air treatments, though capable of regenerating the catalyst to its initial activity, failed to return the catalyst to its initial chemical and structural state, indicating an irreversible nature of deactivation.
6. The catalyst's deactivation displayed an irreversible nature, observed at both high and low space velocities and in the presence or absence of sulfur, as demonstrated by the decreasing conversion rates following successive air treatments.
7. XPS analysis on the catalyst used for 7 cycles of reforming and pre-emptive regeneration revealed no retained sulfur or carbon on the surface, suggesting a shift in the catalyst's chemical state during continuous exposure to reforming conditions, which might correlate with irreversible aspects of deactivation.

1. 硫促进了碳的形成，导致蒸汽重整乙醇/汽油混合物过程中的失活。在硫的存在下观察到这一点，但在其不存在时没有观察到，表明硫在失活中的作用。
2. 尽管硫的影响显著，但通过XPS测试未在老化催化剂的表面检测到硫，这可能意味着硫不能直接吸附到催化剂表面上，或者其量低于检测限。
3. 通过ICP测量的小量硫是失活原因的主要因素，而不是唯一的，暗示硫可能暂时吸附到催化剂表面，并引起其机制或结构的变化。
4. 在实验条件下，焦化和硫是催化剂失活的主要原因。焦化的证据是在TPO中观察到的大量质量损失和从气相释放的CO2，在TPO测试和反应器测试中，而硫中毒被怀疑是因为它强烈地结合到催化位点并导致位点中毒。
5. 虽然空气处理能够使催化剂恢复到初始活动状态，但它未能将催化剂恢复到初始的化学和结构状态，表明失活具有不可逆性。
6. 催化剂的失活显示了不可逆性，无论是在高空间速度还是低空间速度下，在硫的存在或不存在的情况下，通过连续降低转化率后每次空气处理的结果可以看出这一点。
7. 对连续经历重整和预预防性再生7周期的催化剂进行的XPS分析显示表面无残留硫或碳，暗示在持续暴露于重整条件下的过程中催化剂的化学状态发生了变化，这可能与失活的不可逆性质有关。
