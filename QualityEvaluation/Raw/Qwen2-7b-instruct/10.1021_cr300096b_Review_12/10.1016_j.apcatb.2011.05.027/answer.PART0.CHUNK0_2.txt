[1] "The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible."
[2] "Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration."
[3] "Therefore the catalyst underwent some irreversible change which did not allow full activity to be recovered."
[4] "A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel."
[5] "XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments."

The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel resulted in deactivation after 22 hours of operation, limiting hydrogen production to non-industrial levels. Air treatments could restore the catalyst to its original performance, albeit with a faster rate of deactivation post-regeneration. An irreversible change occurred during the operation, preventing the catalyst from achieving full activity again. A preemptive regeneration process allowed for a prolonged period of stable operation, especially when dealing with sulfur-containing fuels. XPS analysis showed that the catalyst's precious metal oxidation state changed depending on whether the catalyst was continuously in operation or subjected to periodic air treatments.

在燃料中添加5ppm硫导致催化剂在22小时后发生失活，使得氢产量无法达到工业标准。空气处理可以将催化剂恢复到初始状态，但再生后失活的速度更快。催化剂经历了一些不可逆的变化，阻止了其完全恢复活性。预设的再生过程允许在较长时间内保持稳定的运行，尤其是在处理含硫燃料时。XPS分析显示，催化剂的贵重金属氧化态变化取决于催化剂是否连续运行或接受周期性的空气处理。
