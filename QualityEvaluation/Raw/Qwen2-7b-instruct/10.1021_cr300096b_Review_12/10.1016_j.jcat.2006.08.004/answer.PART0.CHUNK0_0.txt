[1] "The EXAFS data show that both treatments led to the formation of dispersed bimetallic structures, with an average PtRu bond distance of 2.68 Å."
[2] "The adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."
[3] "Interparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals into individual particles) was observed with the PtRu/SiO2 sample exposed to direct H2 treatment; in contrast, intraparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals within the same particle), with Pt preferentially occupying more surface sites, was observed when consequent O2/H2 treatments were used."
[4] "As a result, the direct H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity almost identical to that of monometallic Ru catalysts, whereas the O2/H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity intermediate to those of monometallic Pt and Ru catalysts."
[5] "Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

The introduction of Pt into PtRu bimetallic catalysts influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions by affecting the strength of CO adsorption. This is because the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru, preventing its sintering during oxidizing conditions. Consequently, the bimetallic interaction reduces the adsorption strength of CO, promoting CO oxidation on Pt surfaces. The use of an O2/H2 treatment enhances the PtRu bimetallic interactions, leading to a lower degree of phase segregation between Pt and Ru. However, intraparticle segregation, with Pt occupying more surface sites, is more pronounced after O2/H2 treatment. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Despite current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, they offer the potential to deepen our understanding of the complex interactions and mechanisms involved in these catalytic processes.

铂的引入对PtRu双金属催化剂影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率，主要是通过改变CO吸附强度。由于铂稳定了钌，防止其在氧化条件下结块，从而在铂和钌之间形成双金属相互作用，降低CO吸附强度，促进CO在铂表面的氧化。使用O2/H2处理可以增强PtRu双金属之间的相互作用，导致铂和钌之间较低的相分离程度。然而，在O2/H2处理后，颗粒内部的分离更为明显，铂更倾向于占据更多的表面位置。未来在超高真空(UHV)下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究可能为模型表面和支持催化剂提供关联这些发现的见解。尽管目前在UHV下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究存在局限性，但它们为深化我们对这些催化过程复杂相互作用和机制的理解提供了潜力。
