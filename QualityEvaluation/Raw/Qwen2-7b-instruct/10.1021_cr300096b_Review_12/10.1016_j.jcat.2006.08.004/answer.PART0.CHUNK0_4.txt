[1] "The EXAFS results at both the Pt and Ru K edges for the PtRu/SiO2 samples pretreated in H2 or O2/H2 at 300C are summarized in Table 2."
[2] "When the PtRu/SiO2 sample was exposed to the oxidation/reduction treatment at 300C, approximately 99% of the observed metal particles were in the size range of 15 nm with the highest occurrence centered at 2.5 nm."
[3] "The EXAFS data collected at the Ru K edge for this sample complement those attained at the Pt edge and show that each Ru atom was in close proximity to approximately 1.4 Pt and 5.2 Ru atoms at average distances of 2.68 and 2.65 Å, respectively."
[4] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."
[5] "However, when an oxidation treatment was used before the reduction step, all particles observed in the STEM images were in the size range of 956 nm, and the surface-averaged size was found to be approximately 42 nm, indicating that substantial sintering of Ru took place under these conditions."
[6] "These results demonstrate that Pt/SiO2 has a fairly narrow temperature window of operation for CO elimination under PROX conditions, consistent with previous literature reports."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They do so by stabilizing the dispersion of one metal through the interaction with another, preventing sintering and maintaining a dispersed structure. This allows for a more efficient and selective conversion of reactants. The presence of Pt can reduce the adsorption strength of CO, facilitating the oxidation process. The efficiency of the catalysts can vary depending on the pretreatment conditions. Future UHV studies can provide insights into the correlations between these findings and model surfaces, potentially revealing more detailed mechanisms and optimizing catalyst design.

In the case of CO oxidation under PROX conditions, the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts shows improved activity compared to monometallic Ru catalysts, especially when the catalyst undergoes an oxidation/reduction treatment. The PtRu interaction leads to a lower strength of CO adsorption, which enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This is due to the increased number of vacant sites for oxygen adsorption and dissociation, facilitating the oxidation process. The results suggest that the bimetallic structure enables a broader temperature window for CO elimination, offering a wider operational range for the catalyst.

在反应器研究中，特别是CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化过程中，基于Pt的双金属催化剂能够显著影响反应机制和效率。它们通过一种金属与另一种金属之间的相互作用来稳定分散结构，防止聚集并保持分散状态，从而实现更高效的转换。Pt的存在可以降低CO的吸附强度，促进氧化过程。催化剂的效率会根据预处理条件的不同而变化。

在CO选择性氧化（PROX）条件下使用PtRu双金属催化剂时，其活性比单金属Ru催化剂有明显提升，尤其是在氧化/还原处理后。PtRu之间的相互作用导致CO吸附强度降低，从而增强催化活性。这是由于增加了氧吸附和离解的空位数量，促进了氧化过程。结果表明，双金属结构允许更宽的CO消除温度窗口，为催化剂提供更广泛的运行范围。

未来UHV研究可以为模型表面和支撑催化剂之间这些发现的相关性提供见解，可能揭示更多详细的机制并优化催化剂设计。
