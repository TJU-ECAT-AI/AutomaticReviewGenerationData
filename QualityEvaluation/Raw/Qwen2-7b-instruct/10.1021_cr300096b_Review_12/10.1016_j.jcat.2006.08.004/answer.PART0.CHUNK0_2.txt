[1] "The EXAFS data show that both treatments led to the formation of dispersed bimetallic structures, with an average PtRu bond distance of 2.68 Å."
[2] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."
[3] "Interparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals into individual particles) was observed with the PtRu/SiO2 sample exposed to direct H2 treatment; in contrast, intraparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals within the same particle), with Pt preferentially occupying more surface sites, was observed when consequent O2/H2 treatments were used."
[4] "As a result, the direct H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity almost identical to that of monometallic Ru catalysts, whereas the O2/H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity intermediate to those of monometallic Pt and Ru catalysts."
[5] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."
[6] "Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

1. The EXAFS data reveal that both treatments resulted in the creation of dispersed bimetallic structures with an average Pt-Ru bond distance of 2.68 Å.

2. The FTIR results demonstrate that carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption is notably weaker on bimetallic samples compared to their monometallic counterparts.

3. The PtRu/SiO2 sample subjected to direct hydrogen treatment exhibited interparticle segregation, while the sample treated with oxygen and hydrogen consecutively showed intraparticle segregation, with Pt occupying more surface sites.

4. Consequently, the sample treated directly with hydrogen displayed PROX activity akin to monometallic ruthenium catalysts, whereas the sample treated with oxygen followed by hydrogen exhibited intermediate PROX activity between monometallic platinum and ruthenium catalysts.

5. Our findings suggest that, irrespective of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples is weakly bound to the surface.

6. Moreover, the strength of CO adsorption on bimetallic samples is lower than on monometallic counterparts, likely due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between platinum and ruthenium.

1. EXAFS数据显示，两种处理方法均导致形成分散的双金属结构，平均Pt-Ru键距为2.68 Å。

2. FTIR结果显示，CO吸附在双金属样品上的强度明显弱于其对应的单金属样品。

3. 直接用氢气处理的PtRu/SiO2样品表现出粒子间的分离，而依次使用氧气和氢气处理的样品则表现出粒子内的分离，其中Pt占据更多的表面位置。

4. 相比之下，直接用氢气处理的样品显示出了与单金属铑催化剂相似的选择性氧化CO活性。相反，依次使用氧气和氢气处理的样品则显示出了介于单金属铂和铑催化剂之间的选择性氧化CO活性。

5. 我们的发现表明，无论预处理条件如何，吸附在PtRu/SiO2样品Pt位点上的CO均较弱地结合到表面上。

6. 此外，双金属样品中CO的吸附强度低于单金属样品，这可能归因于铂和铑之间存在的双金属相互作用。
