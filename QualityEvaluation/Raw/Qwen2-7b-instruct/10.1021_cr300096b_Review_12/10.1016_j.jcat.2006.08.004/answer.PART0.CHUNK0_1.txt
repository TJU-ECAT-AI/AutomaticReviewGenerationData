[1] "The EXAFS data show that both treatments led to the formation of dispersed bimetallic structures, with an average PtRu bond distance of 2.68 Å."
[2] "The adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."
[3] "Interparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals into individual particles) was observed with the PtRu/SiO2 sample exposed to direct H2 treatment; in contrast, intraparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals within the same particle), with Pt preferentially occupying more surface sites, was observed when consequent O2/H2 treatments were used."
[4] "As a result, the direct H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity almost identical to that of monometallic Ru catalysts, whereas the O2/H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity intermediate to those of monometallic Pt and Ru catalysts."

1. The EXAFS data demonstrate that both pretreatment protocols produced dispersed bimetallic structures with an average PtRu bond distance of 2.68 Å. This indicates the successful formation of PtRu nanoparticles on the silica support.

2. CO adsorption was significantly weaker on bimetallic catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts, suggesting a potential improvement in the selectivity towards the desired reaction products.

3. Direct hydrogen treatment resulted in interparticle segregation, with the metals forming distinct particles. In contrast, sequential oxygen/hydrogen treatment led to intraparticle segregation, where Pt occupied a greater number of surface sites.

4. The direct hydrogen treatment produced catalysts with PROX activity equivalent to that of monometallic Ru, while sequential oxygen/hydrogen treatment yielded catalysts with intermediate PROX activity between monometallic Pt and Ru.

1. EXAFS数据显示，两种预处理过程均产生了分散的双金属结构，平均PtRu键距为2.68 Å。这表明在二氧化硅支持下成功形成了PtRu纳米颗粒。

2. CO吸附在双金属催化剂上的强度明显低于其单金属对应物，这可能暗示了对目标产物选择性的潜在改善。

3. 直接氢气处理导致了粒子间的分离，金属形成独立的粒子。相反，连续氧气/氢气处理导致了粒子内的分离，在这种情况下，Pt占据更多的表面位点。

4. 直接氢处理产生的催化剂的PROX活性与单金属Ru相当，而连续氧气/氢气处理则产生了介于单金属Pt和Ru催化剂之间的PROX活性。
