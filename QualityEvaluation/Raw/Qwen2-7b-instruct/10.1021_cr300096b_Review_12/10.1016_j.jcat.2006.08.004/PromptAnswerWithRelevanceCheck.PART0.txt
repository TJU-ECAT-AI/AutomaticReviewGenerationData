[1] "The EXAFS data show that both treatments led to the formation of dispersed bimetallic structures, with an average PtRu bond distance of 2.68 Å."
[2] "The adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."
[3] "Interparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals into individual particles) was observed with the PtRu/SiO2 sample exposed to direct H2 treatment; in contrast, intraparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals within the same particle), with Pt preferentially occupying more surface sites, was observed when consequent O2/H2 treatments were used."
[4] "As a result, the direct H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity almost identical to that of monometallic Ru catalysts, whereas the O2/H2 treatment yielded samples with PROX activity intermediate to those of monometallic Pt and Ru catalysts."
[5] "Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

The introduction of Pt into PtRu bimetallic catalysts influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions by affecting the strength of CO adsorption. This is because the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru, preventing its sintering during oxidizing conditions. Consequently, the bimetallic interaction reduces the adsorption strength of CO, promoting CO oxidation on Pt surfaces. The use of an O2/H2 treatment enhances the PtRu bimetallic interactions, leading to a lower degree of phase segregation between Pt and Ru. However, intraparticle segregation, with Pt occupying more surface sites, is more pronounced after O2/H2 treatment. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Despite current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, they offer the potential to deepen our understanding of the complex interactions and mechanisms involved in these catalytic processes.

铂的引入对PtRu双金属催化剂影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率，主要是通过改变CO吸附强度。由于铂稳定了钌，防止其在氧化条件下结块，从而在铂和钌之间形成双金属相互作用，降低CO吸附强度，促进CO在铂表面的氧化。使用O2/H2处理可以增强PtRu双金属之间的相互作用，导致铂和钌之间较低的相分离程度。然而，在O2/H2处理后，颗粒内部的分离更为明显，铂更倾向于占据更多的表面位置。未来在超高真空(UHV)下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究可能为模型表面和支持催化剂提供关联这些发现的见解。尽管目前在UHV下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究存在局限性，但它们为深化我们对这些催化过程复杂相互作用和机制的理解提供了潜力。

1. The EXAFS data reveal that both treatments resulted in the creation of dispersed bimetallic structures with an average Pt-Ru bond distance of 2.68 Å.

2. The FTIR results demonstrate that carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption is notably weaker on bimetallic samples compared to their monometallic counterparts.

3. The PtRu/SiO2 sample subjected to direct hydrogen treatment exhibited interparticle segregation, while the sample treated with oxygen and hydrogen consecutively showed intraparticle segregation, with Pt occupying more surface sites.

6. Moreover, the strength of CO adsorption on bimetallic samples is lower than on monometallic counterparts, likely due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between platinum and ruthenium.

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They do so by stabilizing the dispersion of one metal through the interaction with another, preventing sintering and maintaining a dispersed structure. This allows for a more efficient and selective conversion of reactants. The presence of Pt can reduce the adsorption strength of CO, facilitating the oxidation process. The efficiency of the catalysts can vary depending on the pretreatment conditions. Future UHV studies can provide insights into the correlations between these findings and model surfaces, potentially revealing more detailed mechanisms and optimizing catalyst design.

In the case of CO oxidation under PROX conditions, the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts shows improved activity compared to monometallic Ru catalysts, especially when the catalyst undergoes an oxidation/reduction treatment. The PtRu interaction leads to a lower strength of CO adsorption, which enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This is due to the increased number of vacant sites for oxygen adsorption and dissociation, facilitating the oxidation process. The results suggest that the bimetallic structure enables a broader temperature window for CO elimination, offering a wider operational range for the catalyst.

在反应器研究中，特别是CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化过程中，基于Pt的双金属催化剂能够显著影响反应机制和效率。它们通过一种金属与另一种金属之间的相互作用来稳定分散结构，防止聚集并保持分散状态，从而实现更高效的转换。Pt的存在可以降低CO的吸附强度，促进氧化过程。催化剂的效率会根据预处理条件的不同而变化。

在CO选择性氧化（PROX）条件下使用PtRu双金属催化剂时，其活性比单金属Ru催化剂有明显提升，尤其是在氧化/还原处理后。PtRu之间的相互作用导致CO吸附强度降低，从而增强催化活性。这是由于增加了氧吸附和离解的空位数量，促进了氧化过程。结果表明，双金属结构允许更宽的CO消除温度窗口，为催化剂提供更广泛的运行范围。

未来UHV研究可以为模型表面和支撑催化剂之间这些发现的相关性提供见解，可能揭示更多详细的机制并优化催化剂设计。
