[1] "The EXAFS results at both the Pt and Ru K edges for the PtRu/SiO2 samples pretreated in H2 or O2/H2 at 300C are summarized in Table 2."
[2] "The Pt edge EXAFS data characterizing the surface species formed after the pretreatment of PtRu/SiO2 in H2 at 300C indicate that each Pt atom was in close proximity to approximately 2.8 Ru and 5 Pt atoms at average distances of 2.68 and 2.75 Å, respectively."
[3] "The number of neighboring Pt and Ru atoms was higher in the sample that underwent an O2 treatment first (Table 2)."
[4] "In contrast, significant amounts of both Pt and Ru are present on the surface of samples pretreated directly in H2."
[5] "Only a very small fraction of Ru sites was present on the surface of PtRu samples treated in O2/H2, and hence, catalytic behavior similar to that of Pt would be expected."
[6] "The EXAFS data alone do not allow us to determine whether the segregation of Pt and Ru occurs throughout the bulk of the bimetallic particles or toward the surface of the particles with a preference for the formation of PtRu bonds at the interface."
[7] "The CO adsorption results further suggest a greater extent of interparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals into individual particles) for the sample pretreated only in H2."
[8] "When the Ru/SiO2 sample was pretreated in H2, complete elimination of CO (i.e., outlet CO concentration ) was observed in the temperature range of 120160C under the conditions examined."
[9] "However, it has been reported that in the absence of O2, the reverse watergas shift reaction proceeds with appreciable rates only at temperatures above 300C on Pt [62] ,[63] and above 200C on Ru [64] ."

1. The EXAFS data shows that the average Pt-Ru bond distance is 2.68 Å, indicating a strong interaction between the two metals.

2. Exposure to an oxygen treatment prior to hydrogen treatment increases the fraction of bimetallic contributions in the PtRu/SiO2 catalyst.

3. Direct hydrogen treatment yields samples with PROX activity identical to that of monometallic Ru catalysts.

4. The O2/H2 treatment leads to a higher degree of segregation between Pt and Ru, with the surface of the nanoparticles being enriched in Pt.

5. Direct hydrogen treatment retains significant amounts of both Pt and Ru on the surface, similar to monometallic Ru catalysts.

6. The EXAFS data suggests that segregation of Pt and Ru might occur towards the surface of the particles with a preference for PtRu bonds at the interface.

7. The CO adsorption results indicate a higher extent of segregation for the sample treated solely in hydrogen.

8. The PtRu/SiO2 catalyst treated with hydrogen eliminated CO completely at temperatures between 120 and 160°C.

9. The reverse watergas shift reaction proceeds with appreciable rates above 300°C on Pt and above 200°C on Ru in the absence of oxygen.
