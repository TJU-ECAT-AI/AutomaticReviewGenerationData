2. "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the WGS rate compared with the WGS rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."
3. "Based on this Pt dispersion, the exposed Pt surface area was calculated for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."
4. "The WGS rate for both the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts was observed to correlate with the exposed Pt surface area on the various catalysts; however, the enhancement in the rate observed upon the addition of Re could not be completely explained by just the higher Pt dispersion."
5. "The stabilities of the two catalysts, 0.91 wt.% Pt0.95 wt.% Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and 1.05 wt.% Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, were compared by measuring the WGS rate for each catalyst at 300 C over a period of 60 h."

1. The addition of rhenium (Re) to platinum (Pt) catalysts on ceria-zirconia supports enhances the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction rate compared to Pt alone, even at similar Pt loadings.

2. The exposed Pt surface area was calculated based on the dispersion of Pt on different catalysts.

3. The WGS rate for both Pt-Re and Pt catalysts correlates with the exposed Pt surface area, but the enhancement from adding Re is not solely due to increased Pt dispersion.

4. The stability of the Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 catalyst was found to be better than that of the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 catalyst over 60 hours at 300°C.

1. 向Ce0.46Zr0.54O2载体上的Pt催化剂中添加Re增强了WGS反应速率，即使在相似的Pt负载下也是如此。

2. 根据Pt在不同催化剂中的分散情况计算了暴露的Pt表面积。

3. Pt-Re和Pt催化剂的WGS速率与暴露的Pt表面积成正比，但添加Re的增强效果不仅仅是由于Pt分散度的增加。

4. 在300°C下持续60小时，Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2催化剂的稳定性优于Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2催化剂。
