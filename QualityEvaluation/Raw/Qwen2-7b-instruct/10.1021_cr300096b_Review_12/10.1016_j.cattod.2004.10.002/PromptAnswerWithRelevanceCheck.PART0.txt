1. The addition of rhenium (Re) to platinum (Pt) catalysts on ceria-zirconia supports enhances the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction rate compared to Pt alone, even at similar Pt loadings.

2. The exposed Pt surface area was calculated based on the dispersion of Pt on different catalysts.

3. The WGS rate for both Pt-Re and Pt catalysts correlates with the exposed Pt surface area, but the enhancement from adding Re is not solely due to increased Pt dispersion.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by enhancing the rate of the water gas shift reaction. The addition of Re to the Pt catalyst increases the dispersion of Pt, leading to an increase in the exposed Pt surface area. This results in an enhanced WGS rate, which cannot be fully explained by just the higher Pt dispersion. Future ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces restrict such correlations.

在反应器研究中，特别是含铂的双金属催化剂影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率，通过提高水煤气变换反应速率。向Pt催化剂中添加Re可以增加Pt的分散度，导致暴露的Pt表面积增加，从而增强WGS速率。这种增强不能仅归因于Pt分散度的提高。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以为与模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性提供见解。然而，当前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究限制了这些相关性的建立。

To understand how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, consider the following insights:

1. The addition of Re to Pt catalysts on CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides enhances the water gas shift (WGS) rate compared to pure Pt catalysts. This enhancement is observed even at similar Pt weight loadings.

2. The exposed Pt surface area plays a crucial role in the WGS rate. Catalysts with higher Pt dispersion, such as Pt-Re, exhibit a higher WGS rate per unit area of exposed Pt. This suggests that the synergy between Pt and Re might extend beyond mere Pt dispersion improvements.

3. The stability of Pt-Re catalysts is superior to that of Pt-only catalysts when exposed to air at high temperatures, which is a potential drawback in fuel processing applications. This stability indicates that Re might stabilize Pt against sintering, contributing to better long-term performance.

4. The research focuses on developing WGS catalysts that address the drawbacks of using conventional Cu-Zn and Fe-Cr oxide catalysts in fuel processors for automotive and distributed power generation. The enhanced WGS activity of Pt-Re catalysts holds promise for more efficient hydrogen production in these applications.

Future UHV (ultra-high vacuum) studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially offering deeper insights into the catalytic mechanisms. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might hinder such correlations fully.

1. 在相似的铂负载量下，向铈氧化锆混合氧化物支持的铂中添加铼会增强水煤气变换（WGS）速率。与纯铂催化剂相比，这种增强是明显的。

3. Pt-Re催化剂在暴露于高温空气时的稳定性优于仅含铂的催化剂，这是燃料加工应用中的潜在缺点。这种稳定性表明，铼可能稳定铂，防止其聚集，从而提供更长的使用寿命。

4. 研究旨在开发针对汽车和分布式电力生产应用中使用商用Cu-Zn和Fe-Cr氧化物WGS催化剂的缺点的WGS催化剂。Pt-Re催化剂增强的WGS活性为这些应用中的高效氢气生产提供了希望。

This study found that the addition of rhenium (Re) to platinum (Pt) on ceria (Ce)-zirconia (Zr) mixed oxides significantly enhanced the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction rate compared to pure platinum on the same supports. The enhanced WGS rate correlated with increased dispersion of platinum on the Pt-Re catalyst, leading to a higher exposed surface area. Moreover, the Pt-Re catalyst demonstrated superior stability, showing less deactivation over time compared to the pure Pt catalyst. Additionally, the catalyst containing both platinum and rhenium maintained its activity even after exposure to air at high temperatures, indicating robust stability under oxidative conditions.
