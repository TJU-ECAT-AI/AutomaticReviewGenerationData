[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."
[2] "Based on this Pt dispersion, the exposed Pt surface area was calculated for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."
[3] "The WGS rate for both the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts was observed to correlate with the exposed Pt surface area on the various catalysts; however, the enhancement in the rate observed upon the addition of Re could not be completely explained by just the higher Pt dispersion."
[4] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the WGS rate compared with the WGS rate observed with Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by enhancing the rate of the water gas shift reaction. The addition of Re to the Pt catalyst increases the dispersion of Pt, leading to an increase in the exposed Pt surface area. This results in an enhanced WGS rate, which cannot be fully explained by just the higher Pt dispersion. Future ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces restrict such correlations.

在反应器研究中，特别是含铂的双金属催化剂影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率，通过提高水煤气变换反应速率。向Pt催化剂中添加Re可以增加Pt的分散度，导致暴露的Pt表面积增加，从而增强WGS速率。这种增强不能仅归因于Pt分散度的提高。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以为与模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性提供见解。然而，当前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究限制了这些相关性的建立。
