[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."
[2] "Based on this Pt dispersion, the exposed Pt surface area was calculated for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2. The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."
[3] "Although Pt-Re and Pt were shown to be more active than Pt, the Pt-Re catalyst was less prone to deactivation than the Pt catalyst."
[4] "The stability of the 0.91 wt.% Pt0.95 wt.% Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 catalyst after exposure to air at 300 C was investigated. The WGS rates observed before and after successive air exposures are compared in Fig. 9."

This study found that the addition of rhenium (Re) to platinum (Pt) on ceria (Ce)-zirconia (Zr) mixed oxides significantly enhanced the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction rate compared to pure platinum on the same supports. The enhanced WGS rate correlated with increased dispersion of platinum on the Pt-Re catalyst, leading to a higher exposed surface area. Moreover, the Pt-Re catalyst demonstrated superior stability, showing less deactivation over time compared to the pure Pt catalyst. Additionally, the catalyst containing both platinum and rhenium maintained its activity even after exposure to air at high temperatures, indicating robust stability under oxidative conditions.

本研究发现，在铈锆复合氧化物上添加铼（Re）到铂（Pt）中，显著提高了水气转化（WGS）反应速率，与仅在相同支撑材料上的纯铂相比。增强的WGS速率与铂在Pt-Re催化剂中的分散度增加相关，导致暴露表面面积更高。此外，Pt-Re催化剂显示出更好的稳定性，随着时间的推移表现出更少的失活，与纯Pt催化剂相比。此外，即使在高温下暴露于空气中，含有铂和铼的催化剂仍能保持其活性，表明在氧化条件下具有出色的稳定性。
