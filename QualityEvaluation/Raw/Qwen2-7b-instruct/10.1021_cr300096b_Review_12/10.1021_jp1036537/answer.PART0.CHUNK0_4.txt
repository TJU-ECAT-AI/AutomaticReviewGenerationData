[1] "Two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure have been grown on Pt(111) by a two-step preparation process, which consists of Fe deposition at low temperatures, such as 150 K, in an O2 atmosphere and subsequent annealing at elevated temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum."
[2] "The peripheries of the FeO nanoislands as prepared on Pt(111) contain coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which have been proved to play very critical roles in CO oxidation reactions."
[3] "The specific periphery density (SPD), defined as the length of the periphery of FeO nanoislands per unit area of the Pt(111) substrate, is used to quantify the dispersion."
[4] "On the basis of the above experimental results, we conclude that well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands can be prepared on Pt(111) by depositing 0.25 ML Fe at the substrate temperature of 150250 K and in the O2 partial pressure range from 1.3 × 108 to 1.3 × 106 mbar, followed by postannealing between 473 and 673 K in UHV."
[5] "The low growth temperature and presence of an oxidant atmosphere are critical to the structure and morphology of the FeO overlayers."

1. Two-dimensional FeO nanoislands with controlled size, density, and surface structure have been synthesized on a Pt(111) surface through a two-step process involving low-temperature Fe deposition in an O2 atmosphere followed by annealing at higher temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum.

2. The edges of these FeO nanoislands possess coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which play crucial roles in CO oxidation reactions.

3. The periphery density (SPD) of the FeO nanoislands, which is the ratio of the periphery length to the total area, is used to measure their dispersion.

4. Based on experimental evidence, FeO nanoislands can be successfully fabricated on a Pt(111) surface by depositing 0.25 ML of Fe at a temperature ranging from 150 to 250 K, in an O2 pressure between 1.3 × 10^8 to 1.3 × 10^6 mbar, and then annealing at temperatures between 473 and 673 K in ultrahigh vacuum.

5. Low deposition temperatures and the presence of an oxidant atmosphere are essential for controlling the structure and morphology of the FeO overlayers.

1. 在150至250 K的低温下，在氧气气氛中沉积铁，然后在超高真空下进行高温退火，可以合成具有控制尺寸、密度和表面结构的二维FeO纳米岛，这些纳米岛生长在Pt(111)表面上。

2. 这些FeO纳米岛的边缘含有未配位的亚铁(CUF)位点，这些位点在CO氧化反应中发挥关键作用。

3. FeO纳米岛的边缘密度（SPD），即边缘长度与Pt(111)总面积之比，用于衡量它们的分散性。

4. 根据实验结果，通过在150至250 K的温度范围内，O2压力为1.3 × 10^8至1.3 × 10^6 mbar，以及在473至673 K的温度下进行超高压退火，可以在Pt(111)表面上成功制备FeO纳米岛。

5. 低温沉积和氧化气氛的存在对于控制FeO覆盖层的结构和形态至关重要。
