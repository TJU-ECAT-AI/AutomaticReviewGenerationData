1. High temperatures are commonly used in the preparation of supported nanostructured oxides, leading to less control over their growth. A two-step growth method has been presented that allows for the preparation of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) with a well-controlled structure and size.

2. The metastable 2D FeO surface phase is formed due to confinement effects at the interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, specifically the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111).

3. FeO nanoislands can be prepared on Pt(111) using a two-step process involving deposition at low temperatures followed by annealing. The process ensures the formation of well-defined and highly dispersed nanoislands.

4. CUF sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands play a critical role in CO oxidation reactions.

5. The FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm, and the stacking domains within this pattern follow a brightness order of top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials.

6. The strong interface interaction between the FeO overlayer and the Pt substrate contributes to the stability of the FeO nanoislands, explaining their metastable nature.

7. The 2D interface confinement at metal surfaces enables the formation of various metastable oxide surface phases on metal substrates.
