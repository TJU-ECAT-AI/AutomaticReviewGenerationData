[1] "The atomic structure of the FeO nanoislands was characterized by STM. It was found that the FeO surfaces exhibit an apparently strong bias-dependent topography. For both positive and negative high-bias voltages, STM images of the FeO nanoislands show typical periodic bright dots (Figure 11a,b)."
[2] "The main structural characteristic of the FeO nanoislands is the presence of high-density metaloxide boundaries or island edge sites. As shown by the high-resolution STM images and the STS results (Figure 14), the island edges show a distinct atomic structure and electronic property, which may provide active sites for catalytic reactions, for example, CO oxidation reactions."

The two-step deposition process allows for the growth of FeO nanoislands with controlled size, density, and surface structure on Pt(111) surfaces. These islands exhibit high-density metaloxide boundaries or island edge sites, providing distinct atomic structures and electronic properties that could act as active sites for catalytic reactions, such as CO oxidation. The bias-dependent topography of the FeO nanoislands, revealed through STM imaging, suggests that the islands' structure changes with the application of different voltages, indicating their dynamic behavior. This understanding of the FeO nanoislands' structure and reactivity could inform the design of more efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.
