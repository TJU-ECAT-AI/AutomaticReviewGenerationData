[1] "The atomic structure of the FeO nanoislands was characterized by STM. It was found that the FeO surfaces exhibit an apparently strong bias-dependent topography. For both positive and negative high-bias voltages, STM images of the FeO nanoislands show typical periodic bright dots (Figure 11a,b)."
[2] "The main structural characteristic of the FeO nanoislands is the presence of high-density metaloxide boundaries or island edge sites. As shown by the high-resolution STM images and the STS results (Figure 14), the island edges show a distinct atomic structure and electronic property, which may provide active sites for catalytic reactions, for example, CO oxidation reactions."

The two-step deposition process allows for the growth of FeO nanoislands with controlled size, density, and surface structure on Pt(111) surfaces. These islands exhibit high-density metaloxide boundaries or island edge sites, providing distinct atomic structures and electronic properties that could act as active sites for catalytic reactions, such as CO oxidation. The bias-dependent topography of the FeO nanoislands, revealed through STM imaging, suggests that the islands' structure changes with the application of different voltages, indicating their dynamic behavior. This understanding of the FeO nanoislands' structure and reactivity could inform the design of more efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.

双步沉积过程允许在Pt(111)表面上生长具有可控制尺寸、密度和表面结构的FeO纳米岛。这些岛表现出高密度金属氧化物边界或岛屿边缘位点，提供独特的原子结构和电子性质，可能作为催化反应（例如CO氧化）的活性位点。通过STM成像揭示的FeO纳米岛的电压依赖性拓扑结构表明，随着不同电压的应用，岛的结构会发生变化，暗示着它们的动态行为。对FeO纳米岛结构和活性的理解可以指导设计更高效的催化剂用于各种工业过程。
