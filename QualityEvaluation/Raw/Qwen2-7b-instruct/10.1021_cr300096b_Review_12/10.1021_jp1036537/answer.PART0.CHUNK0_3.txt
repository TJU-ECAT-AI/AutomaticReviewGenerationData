The atomic structure, chemical composition, and electronic state of the formed FeO nanoislands were investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase can be attributed to confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, which originate from the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111). Furthermore, the STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data indicate that the formed PtFeO boundaries or edges of the FeO nanoislands present distinct chemical and electronic characteristics, which could be highly active in many catalytic processes."

The study discusses the growth and characterization of two-dimensional FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) through a two-step process involving low-temperature Fe deposition and subsequent annealing. The atomic structure, chemical composition, and electronic state of the FeO nanoislands were analyzed using scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase is attributed to the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111), leading to confinement effects at the interface. The edges or boundaries of the FeO nanoislands display distinct chemical and electronic characteristics, which might be highly active in catalytic processes.

本文研究了在Pt(111)上通过两步法生长和表征二维FeO纳米岛的过程，包括低温Fe沉积和随后在高真空下进行退火。使用扫描隧道显微镜、X射线光电子能谱和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱对FeO纳米岛的原子结构、化学组成和电子状态进行了分析。FeO表面相的形成归因于纳米氧化物与金属基底界面之间的强相互作用导致的限制效应。形成的FeO纳米岛边缘或边界显示出独特的化学和电子特性，这些特性可能在许多催化过程中表现出高度活性。
