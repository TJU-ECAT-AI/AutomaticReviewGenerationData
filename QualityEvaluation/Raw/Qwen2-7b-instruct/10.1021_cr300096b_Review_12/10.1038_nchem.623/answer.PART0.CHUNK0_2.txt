<p>The preferential dissolution (removal) of the electrochemically more reactive component from a bimetallic alloy (precursor) that consists of a less reactive (here Pt) and more reactive metal (here Cu)21,2,22,23 is commonly referred to as dealloying.</p>
<p>We showed that dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles have uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes24,25,26,27,28, which is of tremendous importance as it occurs at the cathode of virtually all fuel cells29,30, with pure Pt as the preferred catalyst.</p>
<p>Despite such importance, the mechanistic origin of their enhanced reactivity remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>To realize similar property improvements in related electrocatalytic systems, the principles that underlie their performance must be elucidated.</p>
<p>We studied six different PtCu alloy nanoparticle precursors and their corresponding dealloyed counterparts.</p>
<p>These form face-centred cubic disordered alloys31.</p>
<p>Given the thickness of the pure Pt shell and considering the limited range of ligand effects46, we conclude that compressive-strain effects rather than ligand effects are responsible for the exceptional reactivity of the particle surface.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to other ORR electrocatalyst systems, such as Pt monolayer20 or Pt skin17 catalysts, in which strain and ligand effects are always convoluted.</p>
<p>Using X-ray diffraction, we measured and quantified the presence of compressive lattice strain in the Pt shells of the dealloyed particles.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous reports of correlations in reactivity-band structure19, in which band-broadening and band-centre shifts were adopted from computational predictions, we demonstrated experimentally a continuous change of the oxygen 2p and Pt 5d antibonding state from above to below the Fermi level as additional compressive strain was applied, which resulted in a weakening of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates.</p>

The literature discusses the use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of chemical reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial processes. It highlights the unique high catalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes, emphasizing their importance in fuel cell technology. The literature also addresses the lack of understanding regarding the mechanistic origin of this enhanced reactivity, suggesting that elucidating these principles could lead to similar improvements in other electrocatalytic systems.

The study involves the synthesis and characterization of six different PtCu alloy nanoparticle precursors and their dealloyed counterparts. The dealloyed nanoparticles exhibit a distinct core-shell structure, with a platinum-enriched layer surrounding a PtCu core. This structure is attributed to the preferential removal of copper (Cu) from the alloy, leaving behind a Pt-enriched shell. The literature further explains that the high catalytic activity of these dealloyed nanoparticles can be attributed to the presence of compressive lattice strain in the Pt shell, which modifies the d-band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt.

Experimental evidence is provided to support the hypothesis that compressive strain effects are responsible for the exceptional reactivity of the particle surface, contrasting with other ORR electrocatalyst systems where strain and ligand effects are often intertwined. The literature demonstrates the experimental measurement and quantification of compressive lattice strain in the Pt shells of the dealloyed particles. It also presents experimental evidence of a continuous change in the oxygen 2p and Pt 5d antibonding states as a result of additional compressive strain, leading to a weakening of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates.

Furthermore, the literature discusses the correlation between the synthesis strain, activity, and the catalytic reactivity of dealloyed coreshell particles, providing insights into the relationship between the degree of strain in the Pt shell and the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. This relationship is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict a volcano-shaped trend between the predicted ORR rate and lattice strain, indicating that moderate compressive strain enhances the rate of ORR catalysis.

文献讨论了双金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt）基催化剂，在化学反应如CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换等工业过程中的机制和效率影响。它强调了去合金化PtCu纳米颗粒在燃料电池电极上的氧还原反应（ORR）中表现出的独特高催化活性的重要性，这在所有燃料电池的阴极中都是至关重要的，且纯铂是首选催化剂。

研究涉及对六种不同PtCu合金纳米颗粒前体及其去合金化对应物的合成与表征。去合金化纳米颗粒展现出一种核心壳结构，其中包含一个铂富集层环绕着一个PtCu核心。这种结构归因于铜（Cu）的优先去除，留下了一个铂富集的外壳。文献进一步解释说，这些去合金化纳米颗粒的高催化活性可归因于铂壳中的压缩晶格应变，这改变了铂原子的d带结构，减弱了活性中间体的吸附能，与未受约束的铂相比。

提供了支持假设的实验证据，即压缩应力效应是表面反应性显著提高的原因，与其它ORR电催化剂系统中应力和配位效应常交织在一起形成对比。文献展示了对压缩晶格应变在铂壳中的测量和量化，并提供了实验证据，说明随着额外压缩应变的应用，氧2p和铂5d抗键态从费米能级之上连续变化至之下，导致活性中间体吸附能的减弱。

此外，文献讨论了去合金化核壳颗粒合成应力、活性和催化活性之间的相关性，提供了关于Pt壳中应力程度与ORR催化活性之间关系的见解。这种关系得到密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的支持，预测了ORR速率与晶格应变之间的火山状趋势，表明适度的压缩应力可以增强ORR催化速率。
