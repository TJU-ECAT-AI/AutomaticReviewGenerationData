<p>Considering the dimensions across which ensemble, geometric strain and ligand effects are effective, only geometric strain can impact surface reactivity over more than a few atomic layers.

1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of chemical reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in industrial reactors. The presence of a second metal can alter the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalyst, potentially leading to improved selectivity and activity.

2. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces can provide valuable insights into the correlation between the findings from model surfaces and supported catalysts. These studies might reveal the specific mechanisms governing the enhanced catalytic activity, which could not be easily observed under more practical reactor conditions due to the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial environments.

3. The exceptional electrocatalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu particles is attributed to the formation of a coreshell structure, where a Pt-enriched shell surrounds a PtCu core. The lattice strain in the Pt shell plays a crucial role in modifying the electronic band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates, and consequently enhancing the catalytic reactivity.

4. The thickness of the Pt shell, estimated to be between 0.6 and 1.0 nm, corresponds to three or more Pt-rich layers, which contributes to the high catalytic activity of the dealloyed particles.

5. The lattice strain in the Pt shell is isolated by the coreshell structure, allowing for precise control over the geometric strain effects that impact surface reactivity.

6. The experimental synthesis strain-activity data of dealloyed coreshell particles, as shown in Figure 6, establishes a clear relationship between the lattice strain in the Pt shell and the electrocatalytic ORR activity.

7. The ability to adjust the noble and non-noble constituents in the alloy precursor allows for the creation of both expansive and compressive strain, which can be tuned to control the strength or weakening of surface bonds, offering a versatile approach to optimizing catalytic reactivity.

8. The volcano-shaped relationship between lattice strain and ORR activity, as depicted in Figure 6, indicates that moderate compressive strain initially enhances the overall activity by reducing the binding energy of oxygenated species, lowering the activation barriers for proton- and electron-transfer processes. However, beyond a critical strain, the binding becomes too weak, potentially leading to a decrease in catalytic activity due to increased activation barriers for oxygen dissociation or the formation of peroxyl (OOH) intermediates.

9. The experimental data and computational predictions correlate well, providing a comprehensive understanding of the origin of the exceptional electrocatalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu particles, which can guide the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for energy conversion and storage technologies.

3. 处理后铂铜纳米粒子表现出独特的氧还原反应（ORR）活性，其原因在于形成了一种内核壳结构，其中一层富含铂围绕着一个铂铜核心。铂壳中的晶格应变在铂原子的电子带结构中起关键作用，减弱了活性中间体的吸附能，从而增强了催化活性。
