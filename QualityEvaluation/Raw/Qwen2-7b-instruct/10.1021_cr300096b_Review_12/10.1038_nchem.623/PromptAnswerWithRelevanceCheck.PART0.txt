1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of chemical reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in industrial reactors. The presence of a second metal can alter the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalyst, potentially leading to improved selectivity and activity.

2. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces can provide valuable insights into the correlation between the findings from model surfaces and supported catalysts. These studies might reveal the specific mechanisms governing the enhanced catalytic activity, which could not be easily observed under more practical reactor conditions due to the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial environments.

3. The exceptional electrocatalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu particles is attributed to the formation of a coreshell structure, where a Pt-enriched shell surrounds a PtCu core. The lattice strain in the Pt shell plays a crucial role in modifying the electronic band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates, and consequently enhancing the catalytic reactivity.

4. The thickness of the Pt shell, estimated to be between 0.6 and 1.0 nm, corresponds to three or more Pt-rich layers, which contributes to the high catalytic activity of the dealloyed particles.

5. The lattice strain in the Pt shell is isolated by the coreshell structure, allowing for precise control over the geometric strain effects that impact surface reactivity.

6. The experimental synthesis strain-activity data of dealloyed coreshell particles, as shown in Figure 6, establishes a clear relationship between the lattice strain in the Pt shell and the electrocatalytic ORR activity.

7. The ability to adjust the noble and non-noble constituents in the alloy precursor allows for the creation of both expansive and compressive strain, which can be tuned to control the strength or weakening of surface bonds, offering a versatile approach to optimizing catalytic reactivity.

8. The volcano-shaped relationship between lattice strain and ORR activity, as depicted in Figure 6, indicates that moderate compressive strain initially enhances the overall activity by reducing the binding energy of oxygenated species, lowering the activation barriers for proton- and electron-transfer processes. However, beyond a critical strain, the binding becomes too weak, potentially leading to a decrease in catalytic activity due to increased activation barriers for oxygen dissociation or the formation of peroxyl (OOH) intermediates.

9. The experimental data and computational predictions correlate well, providing a comprehensive understanding of the origin of the exceptional electrocatalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu particles, which can guide the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for energy conversion and storage technologies.

1. 铂基双金属催化剂，尤其是铂基催化剂，可以显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化等工业反应的机制和效率。第二种金属的存在可以改变催化剂的电子结构和表面性质，可能带来更好的选择性和活性。

2. 将来在超高真空(UHV)条件下对铂基双金属表面的研究可以为模型表面和负载催化剂之间的发现提供有价值的见解。这些研究可能会揭示特定机制如何控制增强催化活性，这在更实际的反应器条件下可能难以观察到，因为工业环境的复杂性和异质性。

3. 处理后铂铜纳米粒子表现出独特的氧还原反应（ORR）活性，其原因在于形成了一种内核壳结构，其中一层富含铂围绕着一个铂铜核心。铂壳中的晶格应变在铂原子的电子带结构中起关键作用，减弱了活性中间体的吸附能，从而增强了催化活性。

4. 铂壳的厚度估计在0.6至1.0纳米之间，对应于三个或更多个富铂层，这有助于处理后的纳米粒子展现出高催化活性。

5. 通过内核壳结构隔离了晶格应变效应，这些效应影响表面活性，允许精确控制对表面活性产生影响的几何应变。

6. 图6所示的实验合成应变-活性数据处理后，铂壳中的晶格应变与电解催化ORR活性之间的关系明显。

7. 在合金前体中调整贵重金属和非贵金属成分的能力允许创建膨胀和压缩应变，可以通过调整来控制表面键的强度或削弱，提供优化催化活性的灵活方法。

8. 图6所示的火山形状关系表明，适度的压缩应变最初通过降低氧化物种的结合能并降低质子-和电子转移过程的活化能，从而增强整体活性。然而，在达到临界应变之后，结合力变得太弱，可能导致由于氧解离或过氧（OOH）中间体的形成而导致催化活性下降的活化壁垒增加。

9. 实验数据和计算预测之间的良好相关性提供了全面理解处理后铂铜粒子异常电催化活性起源的综合理解，这可以指导设计更高效和选择性的催化剂以供能源转换和存储技术使用。

The literature discusses the use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of chemical reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial processes. It highlights the unique high catalytic reactivity of dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes, emphasizing their importance in fuel cell technology. The literature also addresses the lack of understanding regarding the mechanistic origin of this enhanced reactivity, suggesting that elucidating these principles could lead to similar improvements in other electrocatalytic systems.

The study involves the synthesis and characterization of six different PtCu alloy nanoparticle precursors and their dealloyed counterparts. The dealloyed nanoparticles exhibit a distinct core-shell structure, with a platinum-enriched layer surrounding a PtCu core. This structure is attributed to the preferential removal of copper (Cu) from the alloy, leaving behind a Pt-enriched shell. The literature further explains that the high catalytic activity of these dealloyed nanoparticles can be attributed to the presence of compressive lattice strain in the Pt shell, which modifies the d-band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt.

Experimental evidence is provided to support the hypothesis that compressive strain effects are responsible for the exceptional reactivity of the particle surface, contrasting with other ORR electrocatalyst systems where strain and ligand effects are often intertwined. The literature demonstrates the experimental measurement and quantification of compressive lattice strain in the Pt shells of the dealloyed particles. It also presents experimental evidence of a continuous change in the oxygen 2p and Pt 5d antibonding states as a result of additional compressive strain, leading to a weakening of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates.

Furthermore, the literature discusses the correlation between the synthesis strain, activity, and the catalytic reactivity of dealloyed coreshell particles, providing insights into the relationship between the degree of strain in the Pt shell and the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. This relationship is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict a volcano-shaped trend between the predicted ORR rate and lattice strain, indicating that moderate compressive strain enhances the rate of ORR catalysis.

文献讨论了双金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt）基催化剂，在化学反应如CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换等工业过程中的机制和效率影响。它强调了去合金化PtCu纳米颗粒在燃料电池电极上的氧还原反应（ORR）中表现出的独特高催化活性的重要性，这在所有燃料电池的阴极中都是至关重要的，且纯铂是首选催化剂。

研究涉及对六种不同PtCu合金纳米颗粒前体及其去合金化对应物的合成与表征。去合金化纳米颗粒展现出一种核心壳结构，其中包含一个铂富集层环绕着一个PtCu核心。这种结构归因于铜（Cu）的优先去除，留下了一个铂富集的外壳。文献进一步解释说，这些去合金化纳米颗粒的高催化活性可归因于铂壳中的压缩晶格应变，这改变了铂原子的d带结构，减弱了活性中间体的吸附能，与未受约束的铂相比。

提供了支持假设的实验证据，即压缩应力效应是表面反应性显著提高的原因，与其它ORR电催化剂系统中应力和配位效应常交织在一起形成对比。文献展示了对压缩晶格应变在铂壳中的测量和量化，并提供了实验证据，说明随着额外压缩应变的应用，氧2p和铂5d抗键态从费米能级之上连续变化至之下，导致活性中间体吸附能的减弱。

此外，文献讨论了去合金化核壳颗粒合成应力、活性和催化活性之间的相关性，提供了关于Pt壳中应力程度与ORR催化活性之间关系的见解。这种关系得到密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的支持，预测了ORR速率与晶格应变之间的火山状趋势，表明适度的压缩应力可以增强ORR催化速率。

The document explains how lattice strain plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of dealloyed coreshell fuel cell catalysts. Specifically, it discusses how the platinum-rich shell of the catalysts experiences compressive strain, which shifts the electronic band structure of platinum and weakens the chemisorption of oxygenated species. This results in improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metalair batteries. The study demonstrates the coreshell structure of the catalyst and clarifies the mechanistic origin of its activity, providing guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity by controlling lattice strain.

The document discusses the use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly focusing on dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, for enhancing the activity in electrocatalytic reactions such as the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. The dealloying process involves the preferential removal of the more reactive component (Cu) from a bimetallic alloy, leaving behind a Pt-enriched shell on a PtCu core. This shell exhibits compressive strain due to the difference in lattice parameters between the Pt shell and the underlying PtCu core. The compressive strain in the Pt shell modifies the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to a weakening of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt, thus enhancing the catalytic reactivity for the ORR. The document provides experimental evidence, theoretical models, and correlations between lattice strain and catalytic activity, offering insights into the mechanism of enhanced catalytic performance in dealloyed bimetallic catalysts.

The document also mentions that the dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles show uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the ORR, surpassing that of pure Pt catalysts, and suggests that the control over the extent of dealloying and the composition of the alloy core allows for continuous tuning of the catalytic reactivity. This phenomenon could potentially be extended to other electrocatalytic reactions requiring modifications to the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates, such as the electrooxidation of small organic molecules.

文献讨论了用于增强电解催化反应，特别是燃料电池电极中的氧还原反应（ORR）活性的双金属催化剂的应用。通过选择性去除合金中的更活泼成分（Cu），留下了富含Pt的壳层在PtCu核心上。该壳层由于Pt壳与底层PtCu核心之间的晶格参数差异而表现出压缩应力。Pt壳层的压缩应力改变了Pt原子的电子结构，导致活性中间体的吸附能减弱，相比于未受约束的Pt，从而增强了催化活性。文献提供了实验证据、理论模型和拉伸应力与催化活性之间的相关性，为理解在去合金化双金属催化剂中增强催化性能的机制提供了见解。

文献还提到，去合金化的PtCu纳米粒子显示出对于ORR的独特高催化活性，超过了纯Pt催化剂，并暗示通过控制去合金化程度和合金核心的组成，可以实现催化活性的连续调节。这种现象可能扩展到需要修改活性中间体吸附能的其他电解催化反应，例如对小有机分子的电氧化。
