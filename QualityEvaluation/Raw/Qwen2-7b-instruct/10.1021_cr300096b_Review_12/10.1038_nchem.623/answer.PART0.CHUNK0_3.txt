[1] "Main Electrocatalytic energy-conversion processes are expected to play a major role in the development of sustainable technologies that mitigate global warming and lower our dependence on fossil fuels."
[2] "To date, however, no effective strategy to isolate and tune strain effects in electrocatalytic systems has been achieved."
[3] "Considering the dimensions across which ensemble, geometric strain and ligand effects are effective, only geometric strain can impact surface reactivity over more than a few atomic layers."
[4] "We showed that dealloyed Pt catalysts, however, meet and exceed the technological activity targets in realistic fuel cells24, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1."
[5] "Specifically, we hypothesize that lattice strain in the Pt shell controls the surface catalytic reactivity."

The document explains how lattice strain plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of dealloyed coreshell fuel cell catalysts. Specifically, it discusses how the platinum-rich shell of the catalysts experiences compressive strain, which shifts the electronic band structure of platinum and weakens the chemisorption of oxygenated species. This results in improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metalair batteries. The study demonstrates the coreshell structure of the catalyst and clarifies the mechanistic origin of its activity, providing guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity by controlling lattice strain.
