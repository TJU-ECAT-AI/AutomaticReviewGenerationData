[1] "The preferential dissolution (removal) of the electrochemically more reactive component from a bimetallic alloy (precursor) that consists of a less reactive (here Pt) and more reactive metal (here Cu)21,2,22,23 is commonly referred to as dealloying."
[2] "We showed that dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles have uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes24,25,26,27,28, which is of tremendous importance as it occurs at the cathode of virtually all fuel cells29,30, with pure Pt as the preferred catalyst."

[9] "We did not, however, observe a decrease in the experimental activity values on the left side of the volcano curve, as predicted by theory; this is probably related to compressive-strain relaxation in the Pt shells."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly focusing on dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles, for enhancing the activity in electrocatalytic reactions such as the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. The dealloying process involves the preferential removal of the more reactive component (Cu) from a bimetallic alloy, leaving behind a Pt-enriched shell on a PtCu core. This shell exhibits compressive strain due to the difference in lattice parameters between the Pt shell and the underlying PtCu core. The compressive strain in the Pt shell modifies the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to a weakening of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt, thus enhancing the catalytic reactivity for the ORR. The document provides experimental evidence, theoretical models, and correlations between lattice strain and catalytic activity, offering insights into the mechanism of enhanced catalytic performance in dealloyed bimetallic catalysts.

The document also mentions that the dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles show uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the ORR, surpassing that of pure Pt catalysts, and suggests that the control over the extent of dealloying and the composition of the alloy core allows for continuous tuning of the catalytic reactivity. This phenomenon could potentially be extended to other electrocatalytic reactions requiring modifications to the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates, such as the electrooxidation of small organic molecules.

文献讨论了用于增强电解催化反应，特别是燃料电池电极中的氧还原反应（ORR）活性的双金属催化剂的应用。通过选择性去除合金中的更活泼成分（Cu），留下了富含Pt的壳层在PtCu核心上。该壳层由于Pt壳与底层PtCu核心之间的晶格参数差异而表现出压缩应力。Pt壳层的压缩应力改变了Pt原子的电子结构，导致活性中间体的吸附能减弱，相比于未受约束的Pt，从而增强了催化活性。文献提供了实验证据、理论模型和拉伸应力与催化活性之间的相关性，为理解在去合金化双金属催化剂中增强催化性能的机制提供了见解。

文献还提到，去合金化的PtCu纳米粒子显示出对于ORR的独特高催化活性，超过了纯Pt催化剂，并暗示通过控制去合金化程度和合金核心的组成，可以实现催化活性的连续调节。这种现象可能扩展到需要修改活性中间体吸附能的其他电解催化反应，例如对小有机分子的电氧化。
