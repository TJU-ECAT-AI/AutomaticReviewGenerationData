<p>The preferential dissolution (removal) of the electrochemically more reactive component from a bimetallic alloy (precursor) that consists of a less reactive (here Pt) and more reactive metal (here Cu)21,2,22,23 is commonly referred to as dealloying.</p>
<p>We showed that dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles have uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes24,25,26,27,28, which is of tremendous importance as it occurs at the cathode of virtually all fuel cells29,30, with pure Pt as the preferred catalyst.</p>
<p>Considering the dimensions across which ensemble, geometric strain and ligand effects are effective, only geometric strain can impact surface reactivity over more than a few atomic layers.</p>
<p>To achieve such a unifying principle, we demonstrate that the concept of strain tuning the catalytic properties, introduced above, provides such a unifying principle.</p>
<p>We studied six different PtCu alloy nanoparticle precursors and their corresponding dealloyed counterparts.</p>
<p>Specifically, we hypothesize that lattice strain in the Pt shell controls the surface catalytic reactivity.</p>
<p>We address our lattice-strain hypothesis using anomalous X-ray diffraction (AXRD), which permits independent measurements of the average lattice parameter and average composition of the scattering nanoparticles before and after dealloying.</p>
<p>Based on the STEM, EDS and XPS data, we estimate the thickness of the Pt shell to be 0.61.0 nm, which corresponds to three or more Pt-rich layers, consistent with estimates from anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering of similar materials33.</p>
<p>Given the coreshell nature of the dealloyed particles, the lattice strain in the Pt shell is most relevant for surface catalysis.</p>
<p>Specifically, we hypothesize that lattice strain in the Pt shell controls the surface catalytic reactivity.</p>
<p>For oxygen on Pt(111), we observed a broad occupied bonding state in the XES spectrum and an intense resonance related to the antibonding state in the XAS spectrum.</p>
<p>Our computations showed a linear relationship between lattice strain and the adsorbate bond energy, consistent with the experimental X-ray spectroscopy data and previous computational analyses16,44.</p>
<p>We did not, however, observe a decrease in the experimental activity values on the left side of the volcano curve, as predicted by theory; this is probably related to compressive-strain relaxation in the Pt shells.</p>
<p>Hence, our strain-related conclusions generally refer to particles of comparable size.</p>

The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It focuses on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and the role of lattice strain in enhancing the catalytic activity of dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles. The document does not discuss the potential insights from future UHV studies or their correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Therefore, there is no direct answer to the question based on the provided literature.

文档没有提供关于铂基双金属催化剂如何影响重整反应、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化等反应在反应器研究中的机制和效率的具体信息。它主要关注燃料电池中氧还原反应（ORR）以及处理合金化铂铜纳米颗粒的催化活性提升的晶格应变的作用。文档没有讨论未来超高压（UHV）研究的潜在见解或它们与模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性。因此，基于提供的文献，无法直接回答这个问题。
