[1] "When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane , and the methane oxygen mixture was subsequently removed from the oxidative steam reforming of methane up to steam reforming of methane, the hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio were superior to those of the Ni(2.6) and catalysts. These better results might be the result of deep oxidation of Ni during the reaction."
[2] "Characterization of results using Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."
[3] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[4] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. The addition and subsequent removal of methane oxygen mixture from oxidative steam reforming of methane led to superior hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio compared to Ni-based catalysts. This might be due to the deep oxidation of Ni during the reaction.

2. The formation of PtNi alloy particles with segregated Pt atoms on the surface suggests that high reducibility and suppression of deep Ni oxidation are related to the lack of hysteresis behavior in Pt-based catalysts.

3. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst effectively suppressed temperature increase during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is explained by the overlap of the exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones due to high reducibility.

4. The stable bimetallic structure of Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming of methane is supported by similar CO adsorption FTIR spectra of fresh and used catalysts.

1. 添加和随后从氧化性蒸汽重整甲烷中去除甲烷氧气混合物导致了甲烷转化率、CO选择性和比率的滞后优于Ni基催化剂。这可能是因为反应过程中Ni的深度氧化。

2. 形成的PtNi合金颗粒，表面有分隔的Pt原子，表明高可还原性和抑制Ni物种深度氧化与缺乏滞后行为有关。

3. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化性蒸汽重整甲烷过程中有效抑制了温度增加，这是由于高可还原性导致燃烧反应区和重整反应区重叠解释的。

4. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化性蒸汽重整甲烷过程中的稳定双金属结构维持了8小时，这由新鲜和使用后的催化剂相似的CO吸附FTIR光谱支持。
