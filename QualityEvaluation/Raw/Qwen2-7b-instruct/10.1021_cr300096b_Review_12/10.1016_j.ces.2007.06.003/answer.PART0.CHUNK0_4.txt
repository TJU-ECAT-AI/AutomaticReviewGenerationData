[1] "When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane, and the methane oxygen mixture was subsequently removed from the oxidative steam reforming of methane up to steam reforming of methane, the hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio were superior to those of the Ni(2.6) and catalysts."
[2] "Characterization of results using Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."
[3] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[4] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane and then removed, the Pt-based catalysts showed improved hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio compared to Ni-based catalysts.

2. The PtNi alloy particles formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst, with Pt atoms segregated to the surface, might explain the lack of hysteresis behavior due to high reducibility and suppression of deep oxidation of Ni species.

3. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst effectively suppressed the temperature increase in the catalyst bed during oxidative steam reforming of methane, thanks to the high reducibility that overlaps the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone.

4. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst maintained its bimetallic structure for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming of methane, and the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption for the fresh and used catalysts confirm its stability.

1. 当向甲烷蒸汽重整过程添加甲烷氧混合物，直至氧化重整过程，并随后从氧化重整过程中移除甲烷氧混合物时，基于铂的催化剂在甲烷转化率、CO选择性和比例方面的滞后行为优于Ni基催化剂。

2. 形成于Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂上的PtNi合金颗粒，其中Pt原子分段到表面，可能与高可还原性以及抑制Ni物种深度氧化有关，解释了缺乏滞后行为的原因。

3. 在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中，Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高，这得益于高可还原性导致燃烧反应区与重整反应区重叠。

4. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中维持了其双金属结构长达8小时，新鲜和使用后的催化剂的相似的CO吸附FTIR光谱证实了其稳定性。
