[1] "When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane , and the methane oxygen mixture was subsequently removed from the oxidative steam reforming of methane up to steam reforming of methane, the hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio were superior to those of the Ni(2.6) and catalysts."
[2] "These better results might be the result of deep oxidation of Ni during the reaction. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst."
[3] "Characterization of results using Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."
[4] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[5] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, show superior performance in oxidative steam reforming of methane compared to monometallic Ni catalysts due to the formation of PtNi alloy particles with segregated Pt atoms on the surface. This leads to enhanced reducibility and suppression of deep oxidation of Ni species, resulting in better efficiency and stability.

2. In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst effectively overlaps the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone, which helps in suppressing the temperature increase over the catalyst bed inlet more efficiently than other catalysts.

3. The stability of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming of methane and the similarity in FTIR spectra of CO adsorption for the fresh and used catalysts indicate the robustness of the bimetallic structure formed on this catalyst.

1. Pt基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基催化剂，在氧化性甲烷蒸汽重整过程中与单金属Ni催化剂相比表现更优，由于形成了表面分离的Pt原子的PtNi合金粒子。这增强了可还原性并抑制了Ni物种的深度氧化，导致更高的效率和稳定性。

2. 在氧化性甲烷蒸汽重整过程中，Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂能够更有效地将放热燃烧反应区域与吸热重整反应区域重叠，这有助于比其他催化剂更有效地抑制催化剂床入口处温度的升高。

3. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化性甲烷蒸汽重整过程中保持8小时的稳定性，并且新鲜和使用过的催化剂的CO吸附的FTIR光谱相似，这表明了这种催化剂形成的双金属结构的稳健性。
