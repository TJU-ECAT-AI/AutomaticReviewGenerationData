[1] "When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane , and the methane oxygen mixture was subsequently removed from the oxidative steam reforming of methane up to steam reforming of methane, the hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio were superior to those of the Ni(2.6) and catalysts."
[2] "Characterization of results using Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."
[3] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[4] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. The addition of methane oxygen mixture during the transition from steam reforming to oxidative reforming resulted in superior hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio compared to Ni-based catalysts. This suggests enhanced catalytic performance due to the deep oxidation of Ni species.
2. The formation of PtNi alloy particles with segregated Pt atoms on the surface of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst, as evidenced by Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption, may correlate with the catalyst's lack of hysteresis behavior, attributed to high reducibility and suppression of deep Ni oxidation.
3. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst effectively mitigated the temperature increase over the catalyst bed inlet during oxidative steam reforming, likely due to the high reducibility that overlaps the exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones.
4. The stability of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) bimetallic structure for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming, as confirmed by similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts, underscores its durability and efficiency.

1. 在从蒸汽重整到氧化重整的过程中添加甲烷氧混合物，导致了与Ni基催化剂相比，甲烷转化率、CO选择性和比率的更好滞后性。这表明增强的催化性能可能由于Ni物种的深度氧化。
2. 通过Pt -边和Ni K-边EXAFS分析以及CO吸附的FTIR，可以观察到在Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂上形成的PtNi合金颗粒，其中Pt原子位于表面，这可能与催化剂的无滞后行为相关联，归因于高可还原性和抑制Ni物种的深度氧化。
3. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化重整过程中有效抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高，可能是因为高可还原性导致燃烧反应区与重整反应区重叠。
4. 通过新鲜和使用后的催化剂上相似的CO吸附的FTIR光谱确认了Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)双金属结构在氧化重整过程中的稳定性，这强调了其耐用性和效率。
