[1] "When methane oxygen mixture was added to the steam reforming of methane up to the oxidative reforming of methane , and the methane oxygen mixture was subsequently removed from the oxidative steam reforming of methane up to steam reforming of methane, the hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio were superior to those of the Ni(2.6) and catalysts. These better results might be the result of deep oxidation of Ni during the reaction."
[2] "Characterization of results using Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."
[3] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[4] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. The addition of methane oxygen mixture to steam reforming and its subsequent removal from oxidative steam reforming resulted in superior hysteresis in methane conversion, CO selectivity, and ratio compared to Ni-based catalysts. This suggests that deep oxidation of nickel during the reaction could be the cause.

2. The formation of PtNi alloy particles with segregated Pt atoms on the surface of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst, as indicated by Pt -edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption, might be responsible for the lack of hysteresis behavior due to high reducibility and the suppression of deep oxidation of Ni species.

3. In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase at the catalyst bed inlet compared to other catalysts. This is explained by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone.

4. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst's bimetallic structure remained stable for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This stability is further supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption for the fresh and used catalysts.

1. 将甲烷氧气混合物添加到蒸汽重整中直至氧化性重整，并随后从氧化性重整中移除该混合物，导致甲烷转化率、CO选择性和比例的滞后优于Ni基催化剂。这可能意味着在反应过程中镍的深度氧化是原因。

2. 通过Pt -边和Ni K边EXAFS分析以及CO吸附的FTIR，表明在Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂上形成PtNi合金颗粒，其中Pt原子分层于表面，可能是由于高可还原性和抑制镍物种深度氧化导致的缺乏滞后行为的原因。

3. 在甲烷氧化性重整过程中，与其它催化剂相比，Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂更有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度增加。这是由高可还原性导致的燃烧反应区与重整反应区重叠所解释的。

4. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂的双金属结构在甲烷氧化性重整过程中保持了8小时的稳定性。这种稳定性进一步得到新鲜和使用后催化剂的相似CO吸附的FTIR光谱的支持。
