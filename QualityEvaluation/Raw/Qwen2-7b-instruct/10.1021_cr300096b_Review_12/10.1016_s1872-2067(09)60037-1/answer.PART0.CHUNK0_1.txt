[1] "Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K."
[2] "The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."
[3] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments."

Bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on platinum, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of carbon monoxide oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They achieve this by enhancing the active sites available for reaction, improving the selectivity of products, and optimizing the reaction conditions. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. These studies might reveal how the electronic structure and composition of the surface affect catalytic activity and selectivity, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts with tailored properties. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces include the inability to fully replicate industrial conditions and the challenge of accurately measuring the interactions between the metal components at the atomic scale.
