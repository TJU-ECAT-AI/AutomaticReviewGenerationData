[1] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[2] "The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

These findings indicate that by controlling the environment and annealing temperature, the surface structure of Fe-Pt bimetallic systems can be reversibly transformed between metallic Fe, FeO, and subsurface Fe. This modulation provides insights into the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts, particularly for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Future studies employing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques might offer a more detailed understanding of the relationships between the structural configurations of these surfaces and their catalytic properties. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could hinder the comprehensive exploration of these phenomena.

这些发现表明，通过控制环境和退火温度，Pt(111)表面结构上的Fe可以可逆地转换为金属Fe、FeO以及亚表面Fe。这种调制为设计高性能和低成本催化剂提供了可能，特别是在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的实验室研究中。未来采用超高真空（UHV）技术的研究可能会提供更深入的理解，即这些表面结构配置与其催化性质之间的关系。然而，当前在基于Pt的双金属系统中的UHV研究限制可能会阻碍这些现象的全面探索。
