[1] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."
[2] "The optimized performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."
[3] "First, the surface Fe structure, Fe/Pt(111), was obtained by the deposition of Fe on bare Pt(111) in vacuum or mild reduction of the FeO/Pt(111) surface in H2 (< 650 K). From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."
[4] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature."

1. The unique catalytic properties of Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by subsurface Fe, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of surface species.
2. Optimizing the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis necessitates precise control over surface structural configurations and knowledge about the stability of these structures under elevated temperatures and varying reaction atmospheres.
3. Surface Fe structure, Fe/Pt(111), can be obtained via deposition of Fe on bare Pt(111) under vacuum or mild reduction of the FeO/Pt(111) surface in H2 (< 650 K). The Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), is produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). Surface FeO can be generated from the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface through oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K).
4. By controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can be prepared.

1. Pt-skin表面的独特催化性质归因于表面Pt的电子结构被下方的Fe修改，从而影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。
2. 在磁性和催化性能优化中，需要精确控制表面结构配置，并了解在高温和不同反应气氛下各种结构的稳定性。
3. 表面Fe结构，Fe/Pt(111)，可以通过在真空或在H2中对FeO/Pt(111)表面进行轻微还原（< 650 K）获得。通过在真空或H2中以较高温度（例如800 K）进行强还原，可以从Pt(111)表面生成Pt/Fe/Pt(111)结构。通过在O2中对Pt/Fe/Pt(111)表面进行氧化并达到高温（850 K），可以生成表面FeO。
4. 通过控制处理气氛和退火温度，可以制备三种不同的表面结构，分别为Fe/Pt(111)，Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)。
