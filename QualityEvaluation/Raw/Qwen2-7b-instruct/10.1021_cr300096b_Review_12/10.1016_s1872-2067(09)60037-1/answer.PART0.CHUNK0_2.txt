The reversibility of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces, including the transformation between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe, can be controlled through cyclic oxidation and reduction treatments. By altering the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature, the surface can be prepared to exhibit different configurations such as Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111). This process allows for the manipulation of surface structures, which is crucial for understanding the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Future studies using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques might provide insights into how these findings correlate with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to advancements in the field of catalysis.

对Pt(111)表面上的Fe结构的可逆控制，包括表面Fe或FeO与亚表面Fe之间的转变，可以通过循环氧化和还原处理来实现。通过改变处理气氛和退火温度，可以准备表现出不同配置的表面，如Fe/Pt(111)，Pt/Fe/Pt(111)，和FeO/Pt(111)。这一过程允许对表面结构进行操作，这对于理解CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率至关重要。未来使用超高真空（UHV）技术的研究可能会提供有关这些发现如何与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联的信息，从而可能推动催化领域的进步。
