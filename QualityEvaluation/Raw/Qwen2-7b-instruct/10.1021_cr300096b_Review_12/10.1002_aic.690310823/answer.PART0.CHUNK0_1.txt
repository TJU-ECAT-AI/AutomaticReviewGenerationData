Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, have the potential to improve selectivity and maintain better activity in various hydrocarbon reactions compared to monometallic catalysts. This improvement is observed in hydrogenolysis, hydrodenation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. Pt-iridium bimetallic catalysts are also discussed, utilizing Mossbauer spectroscopy as a tool for characterizing the structure of these catalysts. The book serves as a comprehensive resource for scientists and engineers interested in bimetallic catalysis, providing insights into the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts through the process of careful experimentation and theory development, leading to significant industrial applications.
