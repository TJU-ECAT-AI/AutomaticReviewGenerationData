[1] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, play a significant role in enhancing the mechanisms and efficiencies of various chemical reactions, including CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial settings. These catalysts demonstrate improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. The potential for further advancements lies in understanding the interactions between platinum-based bimetallic surfaces at ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which could provide insights into the correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder the full realization of these potential insights.

铂基双金属催化剂在提高CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化等化学反应的机制和效率方面发挥着重要作用，特别是在石油工业中。与单一金属催化剂相比，它们展现出更高的选择性和更好的活性维持能力。进一步的改进潜力在于理解铂基双金属表面在超高真空（UHV）条件下的相互作用，这可能为模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性提供见解。然而，当前在UHV条件下对铂基双金属表面的研究限制阻碍了这些潜在洞察力的全面实现。
