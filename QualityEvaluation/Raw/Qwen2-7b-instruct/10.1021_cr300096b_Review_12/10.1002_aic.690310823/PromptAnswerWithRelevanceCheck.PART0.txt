Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, play a significant role in enhancing the mechanisms and efficiencies of various chemical reactions, including CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial settings. These catalysts demonstrate improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. The potential for further advancements lies in understanding the interactions between platinum-based bimetallic surfaces at ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which could provide insights into the correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder the full realization of these potential insights.
