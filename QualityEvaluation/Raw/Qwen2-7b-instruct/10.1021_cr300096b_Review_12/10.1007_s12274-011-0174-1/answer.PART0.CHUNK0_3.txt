[1] "Magnetically recyclable Au/Co/Fe core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully synthesized via a one-step in situ procedure."
[2] "The Au/Co/Fe core-shell NPs exhibit much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) than the monometallic (Au, Co, Fe) or bimetallic (AuCo, AuFe, CoFe) counterparts."
