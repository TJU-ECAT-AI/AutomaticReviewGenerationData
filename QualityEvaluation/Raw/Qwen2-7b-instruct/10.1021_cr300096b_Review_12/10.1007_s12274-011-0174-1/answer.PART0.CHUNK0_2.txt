[1] "The Au/Co/Fe core-shell nanoparticles exhibit much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) than the monometallic (Au, Co, Fe) or bimetallic (AuCo, AuFe, CoFe) counterparts."
[2] "The trimetallic Au/Co/Fe NPs have a triple-layered core-shell structure composed of a Au core, a Co-rich inter-layer, and a Fe-rich shell."

The Au/Co/Fe core-shell nanoparticles show significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane compared to their monometallic and bimetallic counterparts. This structure, characterized by an Au core, a Co-rich inter-layer, and a Fe-rich shell, contributes to their superior performance.
