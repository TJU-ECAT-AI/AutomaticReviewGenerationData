[1] "Our recent studies [21] ,[22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."
[2] "As temperature rises CO and H2 prevail in the reactor, resulting in a reducing atmosphere. At lower T more oxidizing conditions prevail."
[3] "The overlapping of the rightmost branches of the curve, particularly at the higher GHSV discourages an explanation purely based on redox behavior, as suggested previously [21] ."
[4] "The overall effect of platinum is to trigger the reaction at lower temperature and even if the first reaction to occur is TOM, partial oxidation also ignites at a lower temperature if compared with monometallic ruthenium catalyst [21] ,[22] (about 550 C vs. 630 C)."

The bimetallic catalyst, specifically Pt-based, influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions by stabilizing the Ru component and limiting its redox reactions. This results in smoother operation and less hysteresis compared to monometallic Ru catalysts. At lower temperatures, the Pt component enables the initiation of the reaction, with total oxidation occurring at a lower temperature (around 550°C) than with monometallic Ru (630°C). However, this catalyst requires a slightly lower gas space velocity (GHSV) to achieve the same conversions as monometallic Ru. The bimetallic catalyst shows promise in correlating findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

铂基双金属催化剂通过稳定钌成分并限制其氧化还原反应，影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。与单金属钌催化剂相比，这导致操作更加平稳，红磁效应更少。在较低温度下，铂成分能够触发反应的开始，完全氧化反应在约550°C时发生，而单金属钌则需要更高的温度（630°C）。然而，这种双金属催化剂要求稍低的气体空间速度（GHSV）来实现与单金属钌相同的转化率。尽管目前在超高真空(UHV)研究中对铂基双金属表面的研究有限，但该催化剂仍有可能将实验结果与模型表面和支撑催化剂的相关性联系起来。
