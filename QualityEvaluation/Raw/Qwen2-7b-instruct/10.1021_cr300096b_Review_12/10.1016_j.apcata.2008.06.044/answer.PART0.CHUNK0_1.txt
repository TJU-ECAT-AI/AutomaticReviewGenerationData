3.4.3. Catalyst aging
Repeated tests under the same experimental conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) allow evaluating the aging effect on the catalyst. The results are reported in Fig. 9: lines are overlapped up to 560 C, then the line of the latter test (after the catalyst worked for 30 h) stays a little below the other line, but the difference is very small and the maximum conversion reached is still close to 100% (being 97.5 and 95%, respectively). As expected, the addition of Pt had a stabilizing effect on the catalyst, not only on its redox behavior, but also preventing a marked aging showed by monometallic Ru as reported in a previous study [21] .

The aging effect on the catalyst, when subjected to repeated tests under identical conditions, was evaluated. The results indicated that the addition of platinum significantly stabilized the catalyst, preventing a notable decline in activity as seen in monometallic ruthenium catalysts. The maximum conversion remained close to 100%, even after 30 hours of operation, showcasing the catalyst's improved stability.

3.4.1. Effect of gas space velocity
The effect of changing residence time has been investigated by varying the total feed flow rate, resulting in GHSV values approximately equal to 26,000, 53,000 and 93,000 h-1. At higher GHSVs the reaction has a shorter time to occur, so a lower conversion is expected. Since we measure the composition of the gases exiting the monolith, increasing the space velocity has the effect of moving the reaction front forward. Therefore, the gas mixture analyzed at high GHSV should approximate the composition in the first millimeters of the monolith at lower space velocities, allowing to confirm the picture outlined from Fig. 4 where a spatial sequence TOM  CPO has been suggested.

The impact of altering residence time was explored by adjusting the total feed flow rate, leading to GHSV values roughly equivalent to 26,000, 53,000, and 93,000 h-1. Higher GHSV values imply a quicker reaction, thus predicting lower conversion rates. By measuring the gas composition exiting the monolith, increasing the space velocity effectively advances the reaction front, making the analyzed gas mixture at high GHSV comparable to that found in the first few millimeters of the monolith at lower space velocities. This aligns with the spatial sequence of total oxidation (TOM) followed by partial oxidation (CPO) as depicted in Figure 4.

通过调整总进料流速来探索停留时间的变化影响，得到了大约26,000、53,000和93,000 h-1的GHSV值。较高的GHSV意味着更快的反应，预测到较低的转化率。通过测量从蜂窝体排出气体的组成，提高空间速度实际上使反应前沿前移，使得高GHSV下分析的气体混合物与低空间速度下第一毫米区域的混合物相似。这与图4中描述的总氧化（TOM）随后是部分氧化（CPO）的空间序列相一致。

3.4.2. Temperature cycles
All tests previously presented and discussed, have been run both increasing and decreasing the temperature. This allows adding further details to the catalyst chemical and thermal behavior. As reported [21] ,[22] ,[36] catalysts can undergo oxidation or reduction depending on the atmosphere they are exposed to and their aptitude for redox reactions. Pt can hardly be oxidized, as confirmed by TPO characterization (both from our analysis and literature, see Section
3.2
); once reduced after preparation it keeps that form. On the other hand Ru is quite easy both to reduce and oxidize, resulting in different activity in the CPO reaction. Actually, the atmosphere in the reactor changes from oxidizing to reducing, both along its length and at a given axial position, when the T is varied. As temperature rises CO and H2 prevail in the reactor, resulting in a reducing atmosphere. At lower T more oxidizing conditions prevail. Cycling T, catalyst reducing and oxidizing cycles can be detected [21] .

All previously conducted tests, both increasing and decreasing temperature, have provided insights into the catalyst's chemical and thermal properties. As reported [21], [22], [36], catalysts may experience oxidation or reduction based on the atmosphere they encounter and their redox reactivity capabilities. Platinum is barely oxidizable, as confirmed by TPO characterization (both through our analysis and literature, see Section 3.2); once reduced post-preparation, it maintains that state. In contrast, ruthenium is easily reducible and oxidizable, leading to differing activities in the partial oxidation of methane (CPO) reactions. The reactor's atmosphere shifts from oxidizing to reducing conditions, both longitudinally and at specific axial points, as temperature fluctuates. With rising temperatures, carbon monoxide and hydrogen dominate, creating a reducing atmosphere, while lower temperatures favor more oxidizing conditions. Temperature cycling enables detection of catalyst reduction and oxidation cycles [21].

所有之前进行的测试，无论是增加还是降低温度，都提供了有关催化剂化学和热力学行为的详细信息。如报告[21]、[22]、[36]所示，催化剂可能根据所接触的气氛及其还原性反应能力经历氧化或还原过程。铂几乎不能被氧化，这一点由TPO表征（通过我们的分析和文献，参见第3.2节）得到证实；经过准备后的还原后，它保持这种状态不变。相反，钌很容易还原和氧化，导致在甲烷部分氧化（CPO）反应中的不同活性。随着温度的波动，反应器的气氛从氧化性转变为还原性条件，既沿着长度方向也发生在特定轴向位置上。随着温度升高，一氧化碳和氢气占据主导地位，形成还原性气氛，而较低温度则更倾向于氧化性条件。温度循环能够检测催化剂的还原和氧化周期[21]。

Repeating tests under identical conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) enables the assessment of catalyst aging effects. The outcomes are illustrated in Figure 9: the lines align up to 560°C, but the line from the later test (after the catalyst operated for 30 hours) lingers slightly beneath the other line. Despite this, the minimal discrepancy indicates that the maximum conversion remains near 100% (97.5% versus 95%). As anticipated, the inclusion of platinum imparted a stabilizing influence on the catalyst, not only mitigating its redox behavior, but also thwarting the pronounced aging observed in monometallic ruthenium, as documented in a prior investigation [21].

在相同的实验条件下（GHSV、HR、组成）重复测试允许评估催化剂的老化效果。结果如图9所示：线条直到560°C时重合，然后后一次测试（催化剂运行30小时后）的线条略低于另一条线。尽管如此，微小的差异表明最大转化率仍然接近100%（分别为97.5%和95%）。正如预期的那样，铂的加入对催化剂产生了稳定作用，不仅抑制了其红氧化行为，而且阻止了单金属钌在先前研究中报道的明显老化现象。

How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?
