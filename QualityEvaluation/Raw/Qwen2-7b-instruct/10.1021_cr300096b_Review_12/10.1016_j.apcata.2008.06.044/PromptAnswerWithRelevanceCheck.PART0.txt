[1] "The catalyst prepared has shown the desired behavior: Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles."
[2] "The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions)."
[3] "As shown by thermodynamic calculation, CO2 and H2O production is predicted: consequently the final product composition is determined by a combination of reactions occurring after part of the methane has been converted into CO2 according to the complete combustion mechanism."
[4] "Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating platinum, stabilize the redox behavior of the catalyst during heating and cooling cycles by limiting redox reactions. This stabilization is attributed to the interaction between platinum and another metal, such as ruthenium, which helps maintain the catalyst's performance.

2. The residual hysteresis observed in the catalyst's performance is more likely due to thermal effects rather than chemical redox reactions. This indicates that the catalyst's stability is influenced by its thermal properties rather than its chemical reactivity.

3. Thermodynamic calculations predict the production of CO2 and H2O during the reaction. This prediction shapes the final product composition, which is determined by a combination of reactions that occur after a portion of the methane has been converted into CO2 through the complete combustion mechanism.

4. The catalyst, despite not undergoing extensive testing over long periods, has exhibited minimal signs of aging, maintaining its activity levels consistently. This suggests that the catalyst has a robust stability profile that resists degradation over time.

1. 合金催化剂，特别是包含铂的催化剂，在加热和冷却周期中通过限制红氧化反应来稳定催化剂的还原行为。这种稳定性归因于铂与其他金属（如钌）之间的相互作用，有助于维持催化剂的性能。

2. 观察到的剩余滞后性更可能是由热效应引起的，而不是化学还原/氧化反应。这表明催化剂的稳定性受到其热性质的影响，而不是其化学活性。

3. 根据热力学计算，预测CO2和H2O的产生。这一预测决定了最终产物组成，由在部分甲烷转化为CO2后发生的组合反应所形成。

4. 尽管未进行长时间的测试，催化剂显示出很少的老化迹象，保持了其活动水平的一致性。这表明催化剂具有强大的稳定性特征，可以抵抗长期使用过程中的降解。

3.4.3. Catalyst aging
Repeated tests under the same experimental conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) allow evaluating the aging effect on the catalyst. The results are reported in Fig. 9: lines are overlapped up to 560 C, then the line of the latter test (after the catalyst worked for 30 h) stays a little below the other line, but the difference is very small and the maximum conversion reached is still close to 100% (being 97.5 and 95%, respectively). As expected, the addition of Pt had a stabilizing effect on the catalyst, not only on its redox behavior, but also preventing a marked aging showed by monometallic Ru as reported in a previous study [21] .

The aging effect on the catalyst, when subjected to repeated tests under identical conditions, was evaluated. The results indicated that the addition of platinum significantly stabilized the catalyst, preventing a notable decline in activity as seen in monometallic ruthenium catalysts. The maximum conversion remained close to 100%, even after 30 hours of operation, showcasing the catalyst's improved stability.

3.4.1. Effect of gas space velocity
The effect of changing residence time has been investigated by varying the total feed flow rate, resulting in GHSV values approximately equal to 26,000, 53,000 and 93,000 h-1. At higher GHSVs the reaction has a shorter time to occur, so a lower conversion is expected. Since we measure the composition of the gases exiting the monolith, increasing the space velocity has the effect of moving the reaction front forward. Therefore, the gas mixture analyzed at high GHSV should approximate the composition in the first millimeters of the monolith at lower space velocities, allowing to confirm the picture outlined from Fig. 4 where a spatial sequence TOM  CPO has been suggested.

The impact of altering residence time was explored by adjusting the total feed flow rate, leading to GHSV values roughly equivalent to 26,000, 53,000, and 93,000 h-1. Higher GHSV values imply a quicker reaction, thus predicting lower conversion rates. By measuring the gas composition exiting the monolith, increasing the space velocity effectively advances the reaction front, making the analyzed gas mixture at high GHSV comparable to that found in the first few millimeters of the monolith at lower space velocities. This aligns with the spatial sequence of total oxidation (TOM) followed by partial oxidation (CPO) as depicted in Figure 4.

通过调整总进料流速来探索停留时间的变化影响，得到了大约26,000、53,000和93,000 h-1的GHSV值。较高的GHSV意味着更快的反应，预测到较低的转化率。通过测量从蜂窝体排出气体的组成，提高空间速度实际上使反应前沿前移，使得高GHSV下分析的气体混合物与低空间速度下第一毫米区域的混合物相似。这与图4中描述的总氧化（TOM）随后是部分氧化（CPO）的空间序列相一致。

3.4.2. Temperature cycles
All tests previously presented and discussed, have been run both increasing and decreasing the temperature. This allows adding further details to the catalyst chemical and thermal behavior. As reported [21] ,[22] ,[36] catalysts can undergo oxidation or reduction depending on the atmosphere they are exposed to and their aptitude for redox reactions. Pt can hardly be oxidized, as confirmed by TPO characterization (both from our analysis and literature, see Section
3.2
); once reduced after preparation it keeps that form. On the other hand Ru is quite easy both to reduce and oxidize, resulting in different activity in the CPO reaction. Actually, the atmosphere in the reactor changes from oxidizing to reducing, both along its length and at a given axial position, when the T is varied. As temperature rises CO and H2 prevail in the reactor, resulting in a reducing atmosphere. At lower T more oxidizing conditions prevail. Cycling T, catalyst reducing and oxidizing cycles can be detected [21] .

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
All previously conducted tests, both increasing and decreasing temperature, have provided insights into the catalyst's chemical and thermal properties. As reported [21], [22], [36], catalysts may experience oxidation or reduction based on the atmosphere they encounter and their redox reactivity capabilities. Platinum is barely oxidizable, as confirmed by TPO characterization (both through our analysis and literature, see Section 3.2); once reduced post-preparation, it maintains that state. In contrast, ruthenium is easily reducible and oxidizable, leading to differing activities in the partial oxidation of methane (CPO) reactions. The reactor's atmosphere shifts from oxidizing to reducing conditions, both longitudinally and at specific axial points, as temperature fluctuates. With rising temperatures, carbon monoxide and hydrogen dominate, creating a reducing atmosphere, while lower temperatures favor more oxidizing conditions. Temperature cycling enables detection of catalyst reduction and oxidation cycles [21].

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
所有之前进行的测试，无论是增加还是降低温度，都提供了有关催化剂化学和热力学行为的详细信息。如报告[21]、[22]、[36]所示，催化剂可能根据所接触的气氛及其还原性反应能力经历氧化或还原过程。铂几乎不能被氧化，这一点由TPO表征（通过我们的分析和文献，参见第3.2节）得到证实；经过准备后的还原后，它保持这种状态不变。相反，钌很容易还原和氧化，导致在甲烷部分氧化（CPO）反应中的不同活性。随着温度的波动，反应器的气氛从氧化性转变为还原性条件，既沿着长度方向也发生在特定轴向位置上。随着温度升高，一氧化碳和氢气占据主导地位，形成还原性气氛，而较低温度则更倾向于氧化性条件。温度循环能够检测催化剂的还原和氧化周期[21]。

Repeating tests under identical conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) enables the assessment of catalyst aging effects. The outcomes are illustrated in Figure 9: the lines align up to 560°C, but the line from the later test (after the catalyst operated for 30 hours) lingers slightly beneath the other line. Despite this, the minimal discrepancy indicates that the maximum conversion remains near 100% (97.5% versus 95%). As anticipated, the inclusion of platinum imparted a stabilizing influence on the catalyst, not only mitigating its redox behavior, but also thwarting the pronounced aging observed in monometallic ruthenium, as documented in a prior investigation [21].

3.4.1. Effect of gas space velocity

Obviously, the higher the GHSV, the lower the conversion measured. Further, conversion decrease at a given T is not linear with the GHSV increase, reflecting the non-linear conversion profiles along the monolith, as discussed previously [21] . It is also shown that the reaction onset is shifted towards higher temperatures as GHSV increases and it takes place more gradually, over a larger range of T, indicating that a larger GHSV can increase reactor stability.

The analysis of the variations of the outlet other species is shown in Fig. 6 . The picture refers to the same tests presented in Fig. 4 and highlights the behavior of O2 and CO2. It shows that the first methane conversion/O2 consumption at lower temperature leads to CO2 according to total oxidation stoichiometry. Above approximately 550 C oxygen is completely consumed, producing the maximum CO2 (approximately = 25%) allowed by the initial feed (O2/CH4 = 0.5) and the total oxidation stoichiometry.

Fig. 7 clearly shows that TOM occurs as the reaction ignites and becomes more important as GHSV increases. Indeed, at 26,000 h1 the water amount never reaches the stoichiometric value (if compared to CO2 production) meaning that H2O is also involved in other reactions. At 93,000 h1, on the other hand, the H2O/CO2 ratio is quite stable around the value of 1.82 that is to be expected if TOM occurs.

3. The effect of gas space velocity (GHSV) on the methane conversion and syngas production efficiency has been studied. It was found that increasing GHSV results in a decrease in the measured conversion rate, and this decrease is not linear with GHSV increase. The reaction onset shifts towards higher temperatures as GHSV increases, leading to a more gradual reaction profile across a wider temperature range. This suggests that a higher GHSV can enhance reactor stability. The analysis of other species' variations in the reactor output indicates that total oxidation (TOM) occurs initially, and as GHSV increases, partial oxidation (CPO) becomes more significant. At lower GHSV, water is involved in multiple reactions, whereas at higher GHSV, the H2O/CO2 ratio stabilizes around 1.82, suggesting that TOM is the primary reaction occurring.

3. 气体空间速度（GHSV）对甲烷转化率和合成气生产效率的影响进行了研究。发现随着GHSV的增加，测量的转化率会降低，并且这种降低与GHSV的增加不成线性关系。随着GHSV的增加，反应起始点向更高温度移动，导致反应沿更宽的温度范围进行得更为平稳。这表明较高的GHSV可以提高反应器稳定性。对于其他物种在反应器输出中的变化分析显示，完全氧化（TOM）首先发生，随着GHSV的增加，部分氧化（CPO）变得更为重要。在较低的GHSV下，水参与多个反应，而在较高的GHSV下，H2O/CO2的比例稳定在约1.82，这表明TOM是主要发生的反应。

The bimetallic catalyst, specifically Pt-based, influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions by stabilizing the Ru component and limiting its redox reactions. This results in smoother operation and less hysteresis compared to monometallic Ru catalysts. At lower temperatures, the Pt component enables the initiation of the reaction, with total oxidation occurring at a lower temperature (around 550°C) than with monometallic Ru (630°C). However, this catalyst requires a slightly lower gas space velocity (GHSV) to achieve the same conversions as monometallic Ru. The bimetallic catalyst shows promise in correlating findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.
