3.4.1. Effect of gas space velocity

Obviously, the higher the GHSV, the lower the conversion measured. Further, conversion decrease at a given T is not linear with the GHSV increase, reflecting the non-linear conversion profiles along the monolith, as discussed previously [21] . It is also shown that the reaction onset is shifted towards higher temperatures as GHSV increases and it takes place more gradually, over a larger range of T, indicating that a larger GHSV can increase reactor stability.

The analysis of the variations of the outlet other species is shown in Fig. 6 . The picture refers to the same tests presented in Fig. 4 and highlights the behavior of O2 and CO2. It shows that the first methane conversion/O2 consumption at lower temperature leads to CO2 according to total oxidation stoichiometry. Above approximately 550 C oxygen is completely consumed, producing the maximum CO2 (approximately = 25%) allowed by the initial feed (O2/CH4 = 0.5) and the total oxidation stoichiometry.

Fig. 7 clearly shows that TOM occurs as the reaction ignites and becomes more important as GHSV increases. Indeed, at 26,000 h1 the water amount never reaches the stoichiometric value (if compared to CO2 production) meaning that H2O is also involved in other reactions. At 93,000 h1, on the other hand, the H2O/CO2 ratio is quite stable around the value of 1.82 that is to be expected if TOM occurs.

3. The effect of gas space velocity (GHSV) on the methane conversion and syngas production efficiency has been studied. It was found that increasing GHSV results in a decrease in the measured conversion rate, and this decrease is not linear with GHSV increase. The reaction onset shifts towards higher temperatures as GHSV increases, leading to a more gradual reaction profile across a wider temperature range. This suggests that a higher GHSV can enhance reactor stability. The analysis of other species' variations in the reactor output indicates that total oxidation (TOM) occurs initially, and as GHSV increases, partial oxidation (CPO) becomes more significant. At lower GHSV, water is involved in multiple reactions, whereas at higher GHSV, the H2O/CO2 ratio stabilizes around 1.82, suggesting that TOM is the primary reaction occurring.

3. 气体空间速度（GHSV）对甲烷转化率和合成气生产效率的影响进行了研究。发现随着GHSV的增加，测量的转化率会降低，并且这种降低与GHSV的增加不成线性关系。随着GHSV的增加，反应起始点向更高温度移动，导致反应沿更宽的温度范围进行得更为平稳。这表明较高的GHSV可以提高反应器稳定性。对于其他物种在反应器输出中的变化分析显示，完全氧化（TOM）首先发生，随着GHSV的增加，部分氧化（CPO）变得更为重要。在较低的GHSV下，水参与多个反应，而在较高的GHSV下，H2O/CO2的比例稳定在约1.82，这表明TOM是主要发生的反应。

3.4.2. Temperature cycles

As temperature rises CO and H2 prevail in the reactor, resulting in a reducing atmosphere. At lower T more oxidizing conditions prevail. Cycling T, catalyst reducing and oxidizing cycles can be detected [21] .

3.4.3. Catalyst aging

Repeated tests under the same experimental conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) allow evaluating the aging effect on the catalyst. The results are reported in Fig. 9 : lines are overlapped up to 560 C, then the line of the latter test (after the catalyst worked for 30 h) stays a little below the other line, but the difference is very small and the maximum conversion reached is still close to 100% (being 97.5 and 95%, respectively). As expected, the addition of Pt had a stabilizing effect on the catalyst, not only on its redox behavior, but also preventing a marked aging showed by monometallic Ru as reported in a previous study [21] .

5. Repeating tests under identical conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) enables assessing the catalyst's aging impact. As illustrated in Figure 9, the lines are aligned up to 560°C, but the line from the later test (after the catalyst operated for 30 hours) lags slightly behind the other line. Despite this minor discrepancy, the maximum conversion achieved remains nearly perfect (97.5% versus 95%). As anticipated, the inclusion of Pt imparted a stabilizing effect on the catalyst, not only mitigating its redox behavior but also averting the notable degradation observed in monometallic Ru, as documented in a prior study [21].

5. 在相同的实验条件下重复测试，可以评估催化剂的老化效果。如图9所示，线条在560°C之前重叠，但在后期测试（催化剂运行30小时后）的线条稍微落后于其他线条。尽管存在这一细微差异，但达到的最大转换率仍然接近完美（分别为97.5%和95%）。正如预期的那样，铂的加入对催化剂产生了稳定作用，不仅减少了其氧化还原行为的影响，而且避免了先前研究中报道的单金属钌明显老化现象 [21]。
