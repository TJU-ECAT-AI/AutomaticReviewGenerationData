[1] "The catalyst prepared has shown the desired behavior: Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles."
[2] "As shown by thermodynamic calculation, CO2 and H2O production is predicted: consequently the final product composition is determined by a combination of reactions occurring after part of the methane has been converted into CO2 according to the complete combustion mechanism."
[3] "The overall effect of platinum is to trigger the reaction at lower temperature and even if the first reaction to occur is TOM, partial oxidation also ignites at a lower temperature if compared with monometallic ruthenium catalyst [21] ,[22] (about 550 C vs. 630 C)."
[4] "The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions)."
[5] "The catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."

1. Platinum in bimetallic catalysts stabilizes ruthenium, reducing redox reactions during heating and cooling cycles.
2. Thermodynamic calculations predict CO2 and H2O production, influencing the final product composition.
3. Compared to monometallic ruthenium, platinum triggers reactions at lower temperatures, even if total oxidation initially dominates.
4. The residual hysteresis observed is attributed to thermal effects rather than chemical reactions.
5. The catalyst maintains its activity without significant signs of aging.
