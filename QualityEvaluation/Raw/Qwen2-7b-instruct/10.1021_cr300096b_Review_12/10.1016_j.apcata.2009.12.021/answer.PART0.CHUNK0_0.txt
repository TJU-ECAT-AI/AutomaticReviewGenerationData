<p>During the last decades the research on catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPO) has received a strong impulse both for economic and environmental reasons. The reaction represents a viable process for producing synthesis gas, useful in FisherTropsch processes for synthetic fuels production.</p>
<p>There is a large number of studies available in the literature, but the mechanism leading to the formation of CO and H2 is not fully clarified, yet. There are two different reaction mechanisms proposed: one is the direct pathway in which CH4 and O2 adsorb on the catalyst and then react to CO and H2; the second one is the so-called combustion and reforming mechanism (CRM).</p>
<p>The CO and H2 yields of partial oxidation have been quantitatively connected with steam and dry reforming, while the persistent water-gas shift reaction always rearranges the products and intermediates.</p>
<p>Steam reforming, dry reforming, direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were investigated.</p>
<p>Conditions at which single side reactions are expected to occur during the partial oxidation process, were approximated by tuning the reactant composition.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic equilibrium has been calculated using NASA CEA Code.</p>
<p>The direct water-gas shift reaction was investigated by feeding steam and CO to the same reactor and catalyst.</p>
<p>Water is actually produced during the tests, consistently with the occurrence of RWGS: in Fig. 5 where the calculated value is reported and compared with the equilibrium.</p>
<p>The amount of water produced is rather limited, but in excess of the equilibrium, particularly at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>Comparing CO2 consumption during DR and partial oxidation tests demonstrates that DR contributes to CO2 consumption, although only partially, and that it is more sensitive to space velocity.</p>
<p>The direct water-gas shift reaction is quite fast, approaching equilibrium, and apparently facilitated by the Pt/Ru catalyst as well.</p>
<p>The reverse water-gas shift reaction is very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. It approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests.</p>

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts facilitate the combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, enabling efficient CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions. Future studies in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments could correlate findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing deeper insights into surface chemistry and reaction pathways. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces restrict comprehensive understanding.

2. The combustion and reforming mechanism (CRM) is a key factor in the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Pt-based catalysts, especially in bimetallic configurations, play a crucial role in enhancing these processes.

3. The direct water-gas shift reaction is highly influenced by the Pt/Ru catalyst, demonstrating its capability to efficiently convert CO and steam into CO2 and H2, respectively.

4. The steam reforming reaction is significant at lower gas space velocities, offering substantial contributions to methane conversion in CPO processes. 

5. The reverse water-gas shift reaction is notably fast, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium, and significantly impacts the product distribution in CPO reactions.

6. Dry reforming reactions occur on Pt/Ru catalysts, contributing to the conversion of methane alongside steam reforming, direct water-gas shift, and reverse water-gas shift reactions.

7. Quantitative analysis of individual reactions, such as dry reforming, steam reforming, and water gas shift reactions, provides insights into their relative contributions to the overall methane conversion in CPO processes.

8. The Pt/Ru catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as suggested in previous studies. Further increasing the oxygen feed leads to the complete combustion products, followed by subsequent reactions involving residual methane, CO2, and H2O.

9. The direct water-gas shift reaction approaches equilibrium at a lower temperature compared to dry reforming, influencing the reaction dynamics in CPO processes.

10. The steam reforming reaction is most relevant in converting methane, coexisting with the water gas shift reaction, and significantly supported by dry reforming at higher temperatures.
