1. The 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst was found to exhibit sequential combustion and reforming of methane during partial oxidation tests. This was also evident in global reaction tests without the need to separately analyze each reaction mechanism.

2. The PtRu catalyst was confirmed to be active for dry reforming of methane, contributing to the partial oxidation mechanism. 

3. The Pt/Ru catalyst was found to be active for reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions, which were identified through dedicated tests.

4. The direct water-gas shift reaction was successfully investigated using the Pt/Ru catalyst, demonstrating its ability to convert steam and CO into CO2 and H2.

5. Steam reforming was identified as an effective mechanism for converting methane when oxygen was fully consumed, complementing the RWGS and dry reforming reactions.

1. 我们已经研究了这种0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru催化剂在部分氧化中的活性，推测甲烷的燃烧和重整是依次进行的，并且在全局反应测试中也清楚地识别出这一机制。

2. PtRu催化剂被证实能够对干重整过程中的甲烷起作用，从而参与到部分氧化机制中。

3. Pt/Ru催化剂表现出对逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的活性，这是通过专门的测试来确定的。

4. 直接水煤气变换反应被成功地用Pt/Ru催化剂进行了调查，证明了其将蒸汽和CO转换为CO2和H2的能力。

5. 当氧气完全消耗时，蒸汽重整被确认为一种有效的甲烷转化机制，与RWGS和干重整反应相辅相成。
