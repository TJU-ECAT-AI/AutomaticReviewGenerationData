<p>During the last decades the research on catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPO) has received a strong impulse both for economic and environmental reasons. The reaction represents a viable process for producing synthesis gas, useful in FisherTropsch processes for synthetic fuels production.</p>
<p>There is a large number of studies available in the literature, but the mechanism leading to the formation of CO and H2 is not fully clarified, yet. There are two different reaction mechanisms proposed: one is the direct pathway in which CH4 and O2 adsorb on the catalyst and then react to CO and H2; the second one is the so-called combustion and reforming mechanism (CRM).</p>
<p>The CO and H2 yields of partial oxidation have been quantitatively connected with steam and dry reforming, while the persistent water-gas shift reaction always rearranges the products and intermediates.</p>
<p>Steam reforming, dry reforming, direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were investigated.</p>
<p>Conditions at which single side reactions are expected to occur during the partial oxidation process, were approximated by tuning the reactant composition.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic equilibrium has been calculated using NASA CEA Code.</p>
<p>The direct water-gas shift reaction was investigated by feeding steam and CO to the same reactor and catalyst.</p>
<p>Water is actually produced during the tests, consistently with the occurrence of RWGS: in Fig. 5 where the calculated value is reported and compared with the equilibrium.</p>
<p>The amount of water produced is rather limited, but in excess of the equilibrium, particularly at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>Comparing CO2 consumption during DR and partial oxidation tests demonstrates that DR contributes to CO2 consumption, although only partially, and that it is more sensitive to space velocity.</p>
<p>The direct water-gas shift reaction is quite fast, approaching equilibrium, and apparently facilitated by the Pt/Ru catalyst as well.</p>
<p>The reverse water-gas shift reaction is very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. It approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests.</p>

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts facilitate the combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, enabling efficient CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions. Future studies in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments could correlate findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing deeper insights into surface chemistry and reaction pathways. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces restrict comprehensive understanding.

2. The combustion and reforming mechanism (CRM) is a key factor in the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Pt-based catalysts, especially in bimetallic configurations, play a crucial role in enhancing these processes.

3. The direct water-gas shift reaction is highly influenced by the Pt/Ru catalyst, demonstrating its capability to efficiently convert CO and steam into CO2 and H2, respectively.

4. The steam reforming reaction is significant at lower gas space velocities, offering substantial contributions to methane conversion in CPO processes. 

5. The reverse water-gas shift reaction is notably fast, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium, and significantly impacts the product distribution in CPO reactions.

6. Dry reforming reactions occur on Pt/Ru catalysts, contributing to the conversion of methane alongside steam reforming, direct water-gas shift, and reverse water-gas shift reactions.

7. Quantitative analysis of individual reactions, such as dry reforming, steam reforming, and water gas shift reactions, provides insights into their relative contributions to the overall methane conversion in CPO processes.

8. The Pt/Ru catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as suggested in previous studies. Further increasing the oxygen feed leads to the complete combustion products, followed by subsequent reactions involving residual methane, CO2, and H2O.

9. The direct water-gas shift reaction approaches equilibrium at a lower temperature compared to dry reforming, influencing the reaction dynamics in CPO processes.

10. The steam reforming reaction is most relevant in converting methane, coexisting with the water gas shift reaction, and significantly supported by dry reforming at higher temperatures.

1. Bimetallic PtRu catalysts were used to investigate the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The direct pathway involves CH4 and O2 adsorbing on the catalyst and reacting to CO and H2. The combustion and reforming mechanism involves complete combustion followed by reforming reactions. Steam reforming and dry reforming were also investigated. Quantitative connections were made between the CO and H2 yields of partial oxidation and steam and dry reforming. The water-gas shift reaction always rearranges products and intermediates. Other reactions like direct and reverse water-gas shift were also reported.

2. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces exist, but detailed investigations of separate reactions, like dry reforming, steam reforming, and water-gas shift, can help understand the mechanisms and efficiencies better. Steam reforming is particularly significant at lower gas space velocities, explaining differences in methane conversions detected during CPO tests.

3. The direct pathway involves CH4 and O2 reacting to produce CO and H2. Steam reforming produces CO and 3H2, while dry reforming produces 2CO and 2H2. Water-gas shift involves CO reacting with H2O to produce CO2 and H2. The ratio of products to reactants in water-gas shift is not consistent with the stoichiometry, indicating the presence of RWGS, which rapidly rearranges products and intermediates.

4. Dry reforming of methane is active on the PtRu catalyst, converting CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO. The ratio of CH4 to CO2 conversion deviates from the stoichiometry, suggesting the involvement of RWGS, which is fast in approaching equilibrium at lower temperatures compared to DR. Steam reforming is significant at lower gas space velocities, explaining differences in methane conversions during CPO tests.

5. The steam reforming reaction is catalyzed and is strongly affected by the gas space velocity, being far from equilibrium. At higher space velocities, CH4 and H2O conversions are very small, but at lower velocities, both CH4 and H2O start being converted at lower temperatures, reaching about 400-650°C.

6. Discrepancies in the production of CO and H2 during steam reforming increase at lower space velocities and temperatures, suggesting the occurrence of WGS, which explains why CO production is delayed compared to H2 production. The measured CO2 formation confirms the simultaneous presence of WGS, where CO reacts with steam as soon as it is formed.

7. The investigation of separate reactions, like dry reforming, steam reforming, and water-gas shift, provides insights into the contribution of each to the global mechanism of partial oxidation of methane. Steam reforming is the most relevant reaction that converts CH4 in CPO, coexisting with WGS, and significantly supported by DR at higher temperatures. The additivity of the measured results correlates with CPO yields, proving the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism.

1.PtRu双金属催化剂用于研究甲烷部分氧化过程中的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率。直接路径涉及CH4和O2在催化剂上吸附并反应生成CO和H2。燃烧和重整机制包括完全燃烧后进行重整反应。蒸汽重整和干重整也被研究。部分氧化过程中CO和H2产量与蒸汽和干重整之间的定量联系被建立。水煤气变换反应总是重新排列产物和中间体。其他反应如直接和逆向水煤气变换也被报道。

2.未来超高真空(UHV)研究中对基于Pt的双金属表面的深入研究，可以提供将实验结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联的见解。当前在UHV研究中关于基于Pt的双金属表面的限制存在，但单独调查各种反应，如干重整、蒸汽重整和水煤气变换，可以帮助更好地理解机制和效率。

3.直接路径涉及CH4和O2反应生成CO和H2。蒸汽重整产生CO和3H2，而干重整产生2CO和2H2。水煤气变换涉及CO与H2O反应生成CO2和H2。水煤气变换产物与反应物的比例不一致，表明快速进行的逆向水煤气变换的存在，它在较低温度下迅速接近平衡，与干重整相比。

4.干重整甲烷在PtRu催化剂上是活跃的，可以将CO2和CH4转化为H2和CO。CH4与CO2的转化比偏离理论值，这表明逆向水煤气变换的存在，该反应在较低温度下快速接近平衡，而干重整反应则在较高温度下占主导地位。

5.蒸汽重整反应受到催化作用，并且受气体空间速度的影响很大，远离平衡状态。在较高的空间速度下，CH4和H2O的转化率非常低，但在较低的速度下，从大约400°C开始，CH4和H2O开始被转化，达到大约400-650°C。

6.蒸汽重整过程中CO和H2的生产差异在较低的空间速度和温度下增加，这表明同时发生水煤气变换，其中CO立即与蒸汽反应。这种快速的平衡调整解释了CO生产相对于H2生产延迟的原因。

7.单独研究反应，如干重整、蒸汽重整和水煤气变换，提供了对甲烷部分氧化全球机制中每个贡献的见解。蒸汽重整在较低气体空间速度时是主要的反应，与WGS共存，后者在较高温度下由DR显著支持。测量结果的相加性与部分氧化甲烷产量相匹配，证明了间接燃烧和重整机制。
