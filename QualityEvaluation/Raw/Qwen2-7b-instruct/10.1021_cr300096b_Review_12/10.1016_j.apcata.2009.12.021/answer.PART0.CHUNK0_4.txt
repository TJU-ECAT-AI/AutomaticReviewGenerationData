<p>The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane has been investigated over a bimetallic PtRu catalyst.</p>
<p>Steam reforming, dry reforming, direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were investigated.</p>
<p>Conditions at which single side reactions are expected to occur during the partial oxidation process, were approximated by tuning the reactant composition.</p>
<p>The CO and H2 yields of partial oxidation have been quantitatively connected with steam and dry reforming, while the persistent water-gas shift reaction always rearranges the products and intermediates.</p>
<p>Results are shown in terms of percentage variations between inlet and outlet concentrations with respect to the inlet methane concentration.</p>
<p>Further increasing the amount of oxygen fed (over-stoichiometric for the CPO), simply causes the complete combustion products to increase, at low temperature.</p>
<p>The direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity.</p>
<p>The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests.</p>

1. Bimetallic PtRu catalysts were used to investigate the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The investigation aimed to separate and quantify the relative contribution of these reactions to the overall process.

2. The study confirmed the presence of steam reforming, dry reforming, and direct/reverse water-gas shift reactions on the PtRu catalyst. The reactions were studied under varying conditions to understand their contributions to the partial oxidation of methane.

3. The CO and H2 yields from partial oxidation were found to be closely linked with steam and dry reforming, whereas the water-gas shift reaction played a role in rearranging the products and intermediates.

4. The study used specific test mixtures to determine the individual contributions of these reactions to the global mechanism of partial oxidation, providing insights into the reaction pathways.

5. The direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were found to be very fast and not influenced by the gas space velocity. They approached thermodynamic equilibrium at different temperatures.

6. Steam reforming was identified as a significant contributor to the conversion of methane, especially at lower gas space velocities. This reaction coexisted with the water-gas shift reaction, with the latter playing a more dominant role at higher temperatures.

7. The findings of this study could potentially inform future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts by providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions under controlled conditions. The limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based surfaces were acknowledged, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
