1. Bimetallic PtRu catalysts were used to investigate the mechanism of partial oxidation of methane. Steam reforming, dry reforming, direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were studied. The contributions of these reactions to the partial oxidation process were quantified, and the persistent water-gas shift reaction was found to rearrange the products and intermediates. The total methane conversion was attributed to three main reactions: complete combustion, dry reforming, and steam reforming.

2. The direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were found to be very fast and unaffected by the gas space velocity. They approached thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant at lower temperatures and the reverse reaction becoming more important at higher temperatures. 

3. Steam reforming was found to be the most significant reaction for converting methane in the context of partial oxidation, coexisting with the water-gas shift reaction and significantly supported by dry reforming at higher temperatures.

1. 在双金属PtRu催化剂的作用下，对甲烷部分氧化的机制进行了研究。蒸汽重整、干重整、直接和逆水煤气变换反应被研究。这些反应对部分氧化过程的贡献被量化，并发现逆水煤气变换反应总是重新排列产物和中间体。总甲烷转化归因于三个主要反应：完全燃烧、干重整和蒸汽重整。

2. 直接和逆水煤气变换反应被发现非常快，不受气体空间速度的影响。它们接近热力学平衡，直接反应在较低温度下更相关，而逆反应在较高温度下变得更重要。

3. 蒸汽重整被发现是部分氧化中转换甲烷的主要反应，与水煤气变换反应共存，并在较高温度下由干重整显著支持。
