The textural test results indicate that the air treatment leads to an increase in both micropore volume (Wo) and the mesoporous surface area (Smeso), relative to AC1. The increase in the Smeso/Wo ratio suggests that the texture of the AC as a catalyst support is improved by the air treatment. On the other hand, since the nitric acid oxidation treatment leads to a slight decrease in Smeso whereas it left Wo unaffected, a slight decrease in Smeso/Wo ratio was observed. The results indicate that the high acidity of the surface of ACN3 stems mostly from the presence of carboxylic groups. Since the carboxylic acid groups have less thermal stability and were removed during air oxidation at 723 K, the air oxidised sample, ACN2, does not have carboxylic acid groups on its surface. On the other hand, air oxidation leads to the formation of very large amounts of highly stable carbonylquinone groups, which are responsible for the basicity of the sample AC2. The results also show the formation of large amounts of anhydride and phenol groups during HNO3 oxidation. The amount of lactones is very similar for both oxidized samples.

The results clearly show the increase in Pt-dispersion for the samples prepared on oxidized supports compared to Pt/ACN1. Pt/ACN3 has the highest Pt dispersion. On the other hand, hydrogen adsorption cannot be used to measure the Pt surface area of bimetallic samples, due to the adsorption capacity of the alloy formed between the metals. As a result, structure insensitive benzene hydrogenation was used as a probe reaction, in order to get an idea about the changes in the amount of Pt sites available as well as to confirm the hydrogen adsorption results obtained for monometallic samples. The benzene hydrogenation activities of the samples are given in Table 2.

The results of CO oxidation tests conducted show that (i) the monometallic Pt/AC samples were not active in CO oxidation under the given conditions, (ii) the activities of all samples increased with the increase in the reduction temperature applied prior to the reaction, (iii) the activities of the bimetallic samples decreased with the increase in Sn load, indicating an optimal Pt:Sn weight ratio of four (i.e. the molar ratio of Pt:Sn ca. 2.5) for the catalysts tested under the given reaction conditions, (iv) the activities of the bimetallic samples prepared on the non-oxidized AC support were lower for both reaction sets compared to those prepared on oxidized samples, indicating the beneficial effect of using AC supports that have higher amounts of oxygen bearing surface groups, (v) for the coimpregnated samples, the catalysts supported on the air oxidized carbon showed the highest activities, indicating the beneficial effect of the basic surface chemistry of the AC support for coimpregnation, (vi) for the samples prepared by sequential impregnation, those prepared on the HNO3 oxidized support showed the highest activities, pointing out to the beneficial effect of an acidic surface chemistry for the sequential impregnation method, (vii) for both reduction procedures applied, the 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 sample (Cat. #13) prepared by sequential impregnation showed the highest activity; the final CO conversion level for this sample upon reduction scheme R2 was 100%.

The presence of chlorine results from acid washing of the support, and from the metal precursors used in the impregnation step. The chlorine level of the sample reduced by R2 is similar to the residual chlorine found on the support (ACN3). The lower Cl and O content of the surface upon R2 indicates the enhanced reduction of metallic phases as well as very low oxidation of the active sites and the support during the reaction. The high concentrations of the Pt and Sn phases on the outer surface can be explained by the stabilization effects of both Sn and the oxygen bearing surface groups of the AC support.

The activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reaction is significantly influenced by the surface chemistry of the support, the preparation method of the catalyst, the Pt:Sn ratio, and the reduction procedure applied. Key findings from the study include:

1. Applying the HNO3 oxidation pretreatment to the AC support creates an acidic surface with less thermally stable carboxylic acid groups, facilitating the formation of PtSn alloys.
2. Sequential impregnation, where Sn is introduced first in the preparation of the catalyst with a Pt:Sn molar ratio around 2.5, leads to the formation of active metallic Pt sites along with a Pt-rich alloy.
3. High temperature reduction procedures that enhance Sn reduction and PtSn interaction during preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation prove highly beneficial.
4. Strong CO adsorption, capable of blocking active sites of catalysts with low activity, leads to rapid deactivation due to inhibition of oxygen adsorption.
5. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared through sequential impregnation on the HNO3-oxidized support, demonstrated the highest activity; upon reduction at a higher temperature, the CO conversion reached 100%.

These findings suggest that optimizing the surface chemistry of the support, employing specific preparation techniques, controlling the Pt:Sn ratio, and applying appropriate reduction procedures can significantly enhance the efficiency of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reactions. Future studies focusing on UHV conditions may provide deeper insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially uncovering new avenues for improving catalyst performance.

The study highlights the significant impact of various factors on the CO oxidation activities of PtSn/AC catalysts. These factors include the surface chemistry of the activated carbon support, the ratio of Pt to Sn, the preparation method of the catalyst, and the reduction procedure applied. Specifically, it is noted that applying a pretreatment with HNO3 to the support creates an acidic surface, which facilitates the formation of PtSn alloys. The sequential impregnation technique, where Sn is introduced before Pt, yields active metallic Pt sites along with a Pt-rich alloy. A high-temperature reduction process enhances the interaction between Sn and Pt, leading to better catalyst activation. The study also points out that strong CO adsorption can inhibit oxygen adsorption, causing fast deactivation. Notably, the 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared through sequential impregnation on a HNO3-oxidized support, demonstrated the highest activity, reaching 100% CO conversion when reduced at a higher temperature.

The influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies involves several factors. These include the surface chemistry of the support, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation method, and the reduction procedure. Applying the HNO3 oxidation pretreatment to the AC support creates an acidic surface, facilitating the formation of PtSn alloys. Sequential impregnation with a Pt:Sn molar ratio around 2.5 leads to the formation of active metallic Pt sites alongside a Pt-rich alloy. A high temperature reduction procedure enhances Sn reduction and PtSn interaction, benefiting CO oxidation. Strong CO adsorption can inhibit oxygen adsorption, leading to deactivation. The highest activity was observed in the 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst prepared through sequential impregnation on an HNO3-oxidized support, with CO conversion reaching 100% upon high temperature reduction.

For future UHV studies correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, insights could potentially provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder direct comparisons and interpretations.
