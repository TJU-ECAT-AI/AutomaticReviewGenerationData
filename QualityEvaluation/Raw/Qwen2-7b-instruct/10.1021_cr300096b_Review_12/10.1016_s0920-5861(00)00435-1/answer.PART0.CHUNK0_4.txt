<p>One of the oxidation reactions reported in which carbon was used as a support is CO oxidation over the PdCu system [8] ,[9]. In these studies, a carbon support was used due to its high surface area as well as its hydrophobicity.</p>
<p>The results indicate the strong effects of the surface chemistry of the AC supports, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation procedure and the reduction procedure, on the CO oxidation activities of the catalysts.</p>
<p>In spite of the unique properties mentioned, AC has a main disadvantage as a catalyst support: it cannot be used in gas phase oxidation above 500 K [1].</p>
<p>It has been proposed in the literature that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O [21] ,[22] ,[23]. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site [21].</p>
<p>The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by this inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step [7] have been reported to be active for CO oxidation [10] ,[11].</p>
<p>The high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial.</p>
<p>The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%.</p>

The influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies involves several factors. These include the surface chemistry of the support, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation method, and the reduction procedure. Applying the HNO3 oxidation pretreatment to the AC support creates an acidic surface, facilitating the formation of PtSn alloys. Sequential impregnation with a Pt:Sn molar ratio around 2.5 leads to the formation of active metallic Pt sites alongside a Pt-rich alloy. A high temperature reduction procedure enhances Sn reduction and PtSn interaction, benefiting CO oxidation. Strong CO adsorption can inhibit oxygen adsorption, leading to deactivation. The highest activity was observed in the 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst prepared through sequential impregnation on an HNO3-oxidized support, with CO conversion reaching 100% upon high temperature reduction.

For future UHV studies correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, insights could potentially provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder direct comparisons and interpretations.

在反应器研究中，特别是以Pt为基础的双金属催化剂对CO氧化机制和效率的影响涉及几个因素。这些因素包括支撑物的表面化学、Pt：Sn比率、制备方法和还原程序。将HNO3氧化预处理应用于AC支持可以创建具有酸性的表面，促进PtSn合金的形成。通过顺序浸渍，使用约2.5的Pt：Sn摩尔比形成活性金属Pt位点以及Pt丰富的合金。高温还原程序可以增强Sn的还原和PtSn的相互作用，从而有益于CO氧化。强烈的CO吸附可以抑制氧吸附，导致失活。观察到最高活性的催化剂是1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3，通过顺序浸渍在HNO3氧化化的支持上制备，其在高温还原后CO转化率达到100%。

对于未来UHV研究与模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性，可能提供更深入的理解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究限制可能阻碍直接比较和解释。
