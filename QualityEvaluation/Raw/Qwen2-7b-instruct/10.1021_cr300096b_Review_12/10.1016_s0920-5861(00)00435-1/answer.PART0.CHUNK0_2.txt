[1] "The results indicate the strong effects of the surface chemistry of the AC supports, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation procedure and the reduction procedure, on the CO oxidation activities of the catalysts."
[2] "The results clearly show the increase in Pt-dispersion for the samples prepared on oxidized supports compared to Pt/ACN1. Pt/ACN3 has the highest Pt dispersion."
[3] "The activities for benzene hydrogenation determined with the sequentially impregnated samples indicate the presence of metallic Pt sites on them. On the other hand, their lower activities compared to the monometallic samples, indicate the formation of alloys."
[4] "The results indicate that applying the HNO3 oxidation pretreatment to the AC support, which creates an acidic surface having less thermally stable carboxylic acid groups, helps the formation of PtSn alloys."
[5] "The sequential impregnation procedure, in which Sn is introduced first in the preparation of the catalyst, with a Pt:Sn molar ratio around 2.5, leads to the formation of active metallic Pt sites as well as Pt-rich alloy."
[6] "The high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial."
[7] "The activity tests indicate that strong CO adsorption, that can block the active sites of the catalysts with low activity, leads to fast deactivation due to inhibition of oxygen adsorption."
[8] "The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%."

The study highlights the significant impact of various factors on the CO oxidation activities of PtSn/AC catalysts. These factors include the surface chemistry of the activated carbon support, the ratio of Pt to Sn, the preparation method of the catalyst, and the reduction procedure applied. Specifically, it is noted that applying a pretreatment with HNO3 to the support creates an acidic surface, which facilitates the formation of PtSn alloys. The sequential impregnation technique, where Sn is introduced before Pt, yields active metallic Pt sites along with a Pt-rich alloy. A high-temperature reduction process enhances the interaction between Sn and Pt, leading to better catalyst activation. The study also points out that strong CO adsorption can inhibit oxygen adsorption, causing fast deactivation. Notably, the 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared through sequential impregnation on a HNO3-oxidized support, demonstrated the highest activity, reaching 100% CO conversion when reduced at a higher temperature.

研究强调了各种因素对PtSn/AC催化剂中CO氧化活性的显著影响。这些因素包括活性炭支持的表面化学、Pt与Sn的比例、催化剂的制备方法以及所应用的还原过程。特别指出，使用HNO3预处理支持物可以形成酸性表面，从而促进PtSn合金的形成。通过顺序浸渍技术，在引入Sn之前添加Pt，可以产生活性金属Pt位点以及Pt富集合金。高温还原过程增加了Sn和Pt之间的相互作用，促进了更好的催化剂激活。研究还指出，强烈的CO吸附可能会抑制氧吸附，导致快速失活。值得注意的是，通过在HNO3氧化支持物上进行顺序浸渍制备的1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3催化剂，在更高温度下还原时显示出最高的活性，CO转化率达到100%。
