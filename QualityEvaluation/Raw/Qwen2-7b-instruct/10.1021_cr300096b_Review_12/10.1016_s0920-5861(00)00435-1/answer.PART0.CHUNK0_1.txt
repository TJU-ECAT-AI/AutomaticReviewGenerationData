[1] "The results indicate the strong effects of the surface chemistry of the AC supports, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation procedure and the reduction procedure, on the CO oxidation activities of the catalysts."
[2] "The high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial."
[3] "The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%."

The bimetallic PtSn catalysts' efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions is influenced by the surface chemistry of the support, the Pt:Sn ratio, the preparation method, and the reduction procedure. High temperature reduction enhances Sn reduction and PtSn interaction, leading to improved catalyst performance. Sequential impregnation with a Pt:Sn ratio around 2.5 on an HNO3-oxidized support resulted in the highest activity, achieving 100% CO conversion upon reduction at higher temperature.

铂锡双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化中的效率受支持物表面化学、铂：锡比例、制备方法和还原程序的影响。高温还原可以增强Sn的还原和PtSn的相互作用，从而提高催化剂的性能。通过顺序浸渍，在HNO3氧化后的支持上以约2.5的Pt：Sn比率制备，结果显示了最高活性，在较高温度下还原后，CO转化率达到100%。
