[1] "Fine particles of metal-metal solid solutions and intermetallides were obtained by the decomposition of a Co- and Pt-containing double complex salt in a hydrogen atmosphere at 400C."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."
