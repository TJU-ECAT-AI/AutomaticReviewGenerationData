[1] "The performance of a Co-Pt powder and of Co-Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and on the graphite-like carbon material Sibunit in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

The study examines the performance of cobalt-platinum (Co-Pt) powders and catalysts supported on gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) and a graphite-like carbon material named Sibunit in the selective oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) within hydrogen-containing mixtures. The bimetallic catalysts are found to be more active than their single-metal counterparts, enabling a significant reduction in CO concentration—from 1 to 103 volume percent—within hydrogen-rich environments.

研究考虑了在含氢混合物中选择性氧化碳（CO）的钴-铂（Co-Pt）粉末和γ-Al2O3以及石墨状碳材料Sibunit支持的催化剂的性能。双金属催化剂比单金属对应物更活跃，能够在氢基环境中使CO浓度从1%降低到103%，显著提高了效率。
