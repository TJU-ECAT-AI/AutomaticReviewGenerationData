[1] "Fine particles of metal-metal solid solutions and intermetallides were obtained by the decomposition of a Co- and Pt-containing double complex salt in a hydrogen atmosphere at 400C."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."
[3] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), exhibit enhanced activity in the selective oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) within hydrogen-containing mixtures. Compared to their monometallic counterparts (Pt or Co), these bimetallic catalysts enable the CO concentration to be significantly reduced, from as low as 1 vol % to up to 103 vol %. This improved efficiency is attributed to the formation of a Co-Pt solid solution on the surface of the catalyst support, which creates a unique catalytic environment that enhances the oxidation process.

铂基双金属催化剂在氢气混合物中对一氧化碳的选择性氧化表现出增强的活性。与单金属（铂或钴）对应物相比，这些双金属催化剂能够将CO浓度从1%降低至高达103%，效率显著提高。这种改进的效率归因于催化剂支撑表面上形成了一种钴-铂固溶体，这种独特的催化环境增强了氧化过程。
