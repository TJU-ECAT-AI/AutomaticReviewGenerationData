[1] "The performance of a Co-Pt powder and of Co-Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and on the graphite-like carbon material Sibunit in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, exhibit higher activity in selective CO oxidation within hydrogen-containing mixtures compared to their monometallic counterparts. They enable a significant reduction in CO concentration, ranging from 1 to 103 volume percent, which suggests enhanced efficiency in CO conversion processes.
