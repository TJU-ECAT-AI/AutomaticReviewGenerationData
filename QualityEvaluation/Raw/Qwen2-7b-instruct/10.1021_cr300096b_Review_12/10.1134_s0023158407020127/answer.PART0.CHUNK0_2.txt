[1] "The performance of a Co-Pt powder and of Co-Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and on the graphite-like carbon material Sibunit in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, show enhanced activity in selective CO oxidation within hydrogen-containing mixtures. Compared to their monometallic counterparts (Pt or Co), these bimetallic catalysts enable a significant reduction in CO concentration, from 1 to 103 volume percent.

Answer: Future ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies could potentially provide valuable insights into correlating the findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and efficiencies involved in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. Further investigations under controlled UHV conditions might elucidate the detailed atomic-scale interactions and dynamics, which are crucial for optimizing catalyst design and enhancing the efficiency of these reactions in industrial applications.

未来在超高压真空（UHV）条件下进行的研究可能为将实验结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联提供有价值的见解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究限制可能阻碍了对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化机制和效率的全面理解。进一步在受控UHV条件下进行的调查可能会阐明详细的原子级相互作用和动力学过程，这对于优化催化剂设计并提高这些反应在工业应用中的效率至关重要。
