[1] "Among the methods proposed to remove this residual CO, preferential CO oxidation (PROX) has been accepted as one of the most promising."
[2] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications."
[3] "The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K."
[4] "Furthermore, an isolated PtCo bimetallic phase can be observed on this catalyst."
[5] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt and Co, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They facilitate more efficient CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams, reducing CO concentration to below 10ppm at temperatures below 423K. The addition of Co to Pt-based catalysts enhances their performance for CO oxidation, especially at lower temperatures. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support material is responsible for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide valuable insights into the behavior of these catalysts on model surfaces, correlating findings with supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might restrict such correlations.

在反应器研究中，特别是含有Pt和Co的双金属催化剂，显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。它们在氢气丰富的流体中更有效地促进CO氧化，将CO浓度降低至低于10ppm，在温度低于423K的情况下。向Pt基催化剂中添加Co可以增强其CO氧化性能，尤其是在较低温度下。孤立的PtCo双金属纳米颗粒存在于支持材料上，与之相互作用，是这些催化剂高催化活性的原因。未来在超高真空(UHV)研究中对Pt基双金属表面的行为进行深入研究，可能为基于模型表面的发现与支持催化剂的相关性提供宝贵见解。然而，当前UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的限制可能会限制此类相关性的建立。
