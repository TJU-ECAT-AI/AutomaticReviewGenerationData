The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They enable high catalytic activity for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams, especially at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support material is responsible for the enhanced activity in preferential CO oxidation (PROX). This activity is crucial for removing CO from hydrogen-rich streams before they reach a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The selectivity for PROX is quantified as the ratio of oxygen consumed by CO oxidation to the total oxygen consumption. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into the behavior of these catalysts on model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However, current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces face limitations that may hinder direct correlations with practical reactor conditions.

在反应器研究中，特别是Pt基双金属催化剂，显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。它们能够在富氢流中实现高催化活性的CO选择性氧化，尤其是在低于423K的温度下。孤立的PtCo纳米双金属颗粒与支撑材料的相互作用是PROX（优选CO氧化）高度活性的原因。这种活性对于从氢富集流中去除CO并将其送入聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFC）至关重要。PROX的选择性被定义为通过CO氧化消耗的氧气与总消耗氧气的比例。未来在超高真空（UHV）条件下对这些催化剂的研究可能会提供有关模型表面和支持催化剂行为的见解，从而深入了解潜在的机制。然而，当前对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究存在限制，可能阻碍直接将实验结果与实际反应器条件进行关联。
