[1] "Among the methods proposed to remove this residual CO, preferential CO oxidation (PROX) has been accepted as one of the most promising."
[2] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications."
[3] "However, they usually only show noticeable activities under practical conditions above 423K,3a where the reverse WGS reaction could occur, thereby hindering complete CO removal."
[4] "A calcination temperature higher than 773K results in a rapid decrease in both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity."
[5] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They enable more effective CO removal in hydrogen-rich streams, enhancing the performance of fuel cells. At temperatures below 423K, these catalysts exhibit superior activity for preferential CO oxidation (PROX), competing with hydrogen oxidation reactions that are prevalent in practical fuel cell applications. However, beyond this temperature, the reverse water gas shift reaction hinders complete CO removal.

2. Adjusting the pre-treatment conditions for the PtCo/YSZ catalysts allows for achieving high catalytic performance even with a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%). This results in reducing CO concentration to below 10 ppm within the temperature range of 380-423K, demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts under practical conditions. 

3. The high catalytic activity of the PtCo/YSZ catalyst is attributed to the formation of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles that interact with the support. This interaction enhances the efficiency of CO oxidation, allowing for better control over the water gas shift reaction and methane conversions.

4. Careful adjustment of the pre-treatment conditions, such as calcination and reduction temperatures, is crucial for maximizing the catalytic performance of the PtCo/YSZ catalyst. Higher calcination temperatures can lead to a rapid decrease in both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity, indicating the importance of optimal treatment conditions for achieving high catalytic activity.

5. The presence of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles in contact with a reducible support having surface oxygen vacancies plays a key role in the high PROX activity of the PtCo/YSZ catalyst. These nanoparticles facilitate the efficient oxidation of CO, contributing to the reduction of CO concentration to below 10 ppm across the specified temperature range. This finding suggests the potential for these catalysts in fuel cell applications and highlights the importance of surface chemistry and particle size in determining catalytic performance.

1. Pt基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率产生了显著影响。它们允许在氢富集流中更有效地去除残留CO，从而增强燃料电池的性能。在低于423K的温度下，这些催化剂表现出优异的优选CO氧化（PROX）活性，与在实际燃料电池应用中的氢氧化反应竞争。然而，在此温度以上，反向水煤气变换反应阻碍了完全的CO去除。

2. 调整PtCo/YSZ催化剂的预处理条件，甚至使用少量的Pt（0.5 wt%），就能实现高催化性能。这导致在380-423K的温度范围内将CO浓度降低至10 ppm以下，表明在实际条件下这些催化剂的有效性。

3.PtCo/YSZ催化剂的高催化活性归因于与支撑物相互作用的孤立的PtCo双金属纳米颗粒的存在。这种相互作用增强了CO氧化的效率，有助于更好地控制水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化。

4. 对预处理条件，如煅烧和还原温度的精细调整对于最大化PtCo/YSZ催化剂的催化性能至关重要。高于773K的煅烧温度会导致CO转化率和CO2选择性的快速下降，表明优化处理条件对于实现高催化活性的重要性。

5.PtCo/YSZ催化剂的高PROX活性部分归功于与具有表面氧空位的可还原支撑物接触的孤立的PtCo双金属纳米颗粒。这些纳米颗粒促进CO高效氧化，有助于将CO浓度降低至10 ppm以下的指定温度范围内。这一发现表明这些催化剂在燃料电池应用中的潜力，并强调了表面化学和颗粒大小在确定催化性能中的重要性。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of Pt and Co supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), exhibit high efficiency in selectively oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO) in a hydrogen-rich stream at temperatures below 423 K. This is notably advantageous for removing CO from fuel cell feed streams, especially in the context of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), where CO poisoning can significantly impact performance. Compared to single platinum catalysts, which require higher temperatures to achieve effective CO oxidation, the PtCo bimetallic catalyst allows for complete CO conversion at lower temperatures, reducing the risk of the reverse water gas shift reaction. The addition of Co to the Pt catalyst improves its activity for CO oxidation, particularly at temperatures below 423 K. Moreover, careful adjustment of the catalyst preparation conditions ensures high catalytic performance, enabling the reduction of CO concentration to below 10 ppm across the temperature range of 380 to 423 K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles on the YSZ support appears to be the key factor contributing to the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.

特别由铂和钴组成的钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）支持的双金属催化剂，在低于423 K的温度下，在富含氢气的流体中对碳氧化物（CO）的选择性氧化表现出高效性。这在聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFC）的燃料流体中去除CO方面尤其具有优势，可以显著改善PEMFC的性能。与单一铂催化剂相比，这些双金属催化剂可以在更低的温度下实现有效的CO氧化，从而降低了逆向水煤气变换反应的风险。添加Co到铂催化剂中可以提高其CO氧化活性，尤其是在低于423 K的温度下。此外，通过精细调整催化剂的制备条件确保了高催化性能，使得CO浓度可以降至10 ppm以下，范围为380至423 K的温度范围内。YSZ支撑上的孤立铂钴纳米颗粒的存在似乎是这些催化剂高催化活性的关键因素。

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They enable high catalytic activity for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams, especially at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support material is responsible for the enhanced activity in preferential CO oxidation (PROX). This activity is crucial for removing CO from hydrogen-rich streams before they reach a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The selectivity for PROX is quantified as the ratio of oxygen consumed by CO oxidation to the total oxygen consumption. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into the behavior of these catalysts on model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However, current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces face limitations that may hinder direct correlations with practical reactor conditions.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of cobalt (Co) to Pt catalysts enhances the catalytic performance for the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX), especially at lower temperatures below 423 K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support material is responsible for the high catalytic activity observed in these systems. This activity is further supported by the formation of bimetallic phases like Pt3Co or PtCo in other catalyst systems. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reveals that the Co-to-Pt ratio is crucial, being less than one for the most active catalysts prepared at 573 K and less than 1.5 for those prepared at 773 K. These insights suggest that the synergistic effects between Pt and Co, facilitated by specific preparation conditions, can lead to enhanced catalytic properties suitable for practical applications in fuel cell technologies and hydrogen processing.
