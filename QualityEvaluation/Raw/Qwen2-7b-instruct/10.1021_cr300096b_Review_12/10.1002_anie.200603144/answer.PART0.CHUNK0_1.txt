[1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."
[2] "However, they usually only show noticeable activities under practical conditions above 423K, where the reverse WGS reaction could occur, thereby hindering complete CO removal."
[3] "Many researchers have therefore made efforts to enhance the PROX activity of supported platinum catalysts at low temperatures, for example by water vapor pre-treatment of the Pt catalyst, the addition of alkali metals, and the addition of other metals."
[4] "Herein, we report that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."
[5] "Furthermore, an isolated PtCo bimetallic phase can be observed on this catalyst."
[6] "In summary, the YSZ-supported PtCo catalyst reported here is highly active for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423K even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%)."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of Pt and Co supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), exhibit high efficiency in selectively oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO) in a hydrogen-rich stream at temperatures below 423 K. This is notably advantageous for removing CO from fuel cell feed streams, especially in the context of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), where CO poisoning can significantly impact performance. Compared to single platinum catalysts, which require higher temperatures to achieve effective CO oxidation, the PtCo bimetallic catalyst allows for complete CO conversion at lower temperatures, reducing the risk of the reverse water gas shift reaction. The addition of Co to the Pt catalyst improves its activity for CO oxidation, particularly at temperatures below 423 K. Moreover, careful adjustment of the catalyst preparation conditions ensures high catalytic performance, enabling the reduction of CO concentration to below 10 ppm across the temperature range of 380 to 423 K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles on the YSZ support appears to be the key factor contributing to the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.

特别由铂和钴组成的钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）支持的双金属催化剂，在低于423 K的温度下，在富含氢气的流体中对碳氧化物（CO）的选择性氧化表现出高效性。这在聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFC）的燃料流体中去除CO方面尤其具有优势，可以显著改善PEMFC的性能。与单一铂催化剂相比，这些双金属催化剂可以在更低的温度下实现有效的CO氧化，从而降低了逆向水煤气变换反应的风险。添加Co到铂催化剂中可以提高其CO氧化活性，尤其是在低于423 K的温度下。此外，通过精细调整催化剂的制备条件确保了高催化性能，使得CO浓度可以降至10 ppm以下，范围为380至423 K的温度范围内。YSZ支撑上的孤立铂钴纳米颗粒的存在似乎是这些催化剂高催化活性的关键因素。
