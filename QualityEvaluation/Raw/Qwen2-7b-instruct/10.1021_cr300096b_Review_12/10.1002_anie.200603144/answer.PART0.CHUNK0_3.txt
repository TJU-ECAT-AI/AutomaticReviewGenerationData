[1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."
[2] "Many researchers have therefore made efforts to enhance the PROX activity of supported platinum catalysts at low temperatures, for example by water vapor pre-treatment of the Pt catalyst, the addition of alkali metals, and the addition of other metals."
[3] "The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K."
[4] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."
[5] "The presence of a bimetallic PtCo phase such as Pt3Co or PtCo has also been reported in other catalyst systems."
[6] "In the case of the PtCo/YSZ catalysts, we also found by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of different regions that the ratio of Co to Pt is below one for the sample calcined and reduced at 573K and below 1.5 for the sample calcined and reduced at 773K, both of which are active catalysts containing PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles that interact with the YSZ support."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of cobalt (Co) to Pt catalysts enhances the catalytic performance for the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX), especially at lower temperatures below 423 K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support material is responsible for the high catalytic activity observed in these systems. This activity is further supported by the formation of bimetallic phases like Pt3Co or PtCo in other catalyst systems. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reveals that the Co-to-Pt ratio is crucial, being less than one for the most active catalysts prepared at 573 K and less than 1.5 for those prepared at 773 K. These insights suggest that the synergistic effects between Pt and Co, facilitated by specific preparation conditions, can lead to enhanced catalytic properties suitable for practical applications in fuel cell technologies and hydrogen processing.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制与效率。向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加钴（Co）能显著增强优选氧化CO（PROX）的催化性能，尤其是在低于423K的温度区域。孤立的PtCo双金属纳米粒子与支撑材料的相互作用是这些系统表现出高催化活性的关键。在其他催化剂体系中也报告了类似Pt3Co或PtCo的双金属相的存在。能量发散X射线（EDX）分析表明，最活跃催化剂中的Co/Pt比值至关重要，分别小于1（在573K下制备）和小于1.5（在773K下制备）。这些见解表明，通过特定的制备条件实现的Pt和Co之间的协同效应可以导致适用于燃料电池技术及氢气处理应用的增强催化性能。
