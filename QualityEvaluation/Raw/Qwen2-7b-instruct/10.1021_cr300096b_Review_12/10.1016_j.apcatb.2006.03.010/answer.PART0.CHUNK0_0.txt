The activity of the monometalic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470 C. In situ XRD results showed that no decomposition of bulk PdO into metallic palladium occurred at temperatures below 800 C. Hence, the reason for the drop in activity is probably not connected to the bulk PdO decomposition.

All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst. However, dissimilarities in activity and ability to reoxidise PdO were observed for the various support materials. PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C.

The ability to reoxidise metallic Pd into PdO was observed to vary between the supports. The alumina sample showed a very slow reoxidation, whereas ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was clearly faster.

In the transient activity tests, the monometallic palladium catalyst supported on alumina gives higher activity for methane combustion than the PdPt catalysts. The PdPt catalysts tested in this study consist of equal molar amounts of noble metals as on the PdAl2O3 catalysts, but divided as 2/3 of palladium and 1/3 of platinum. The XRD studies of the PdPt catalysts indicate that some of the palladium is alloyed with Pt. Hence, the bimetallic catalysts contain smaller amounts of the active PdO phase compared to PdAl2O3.

In the steady-state tests, incorporation of platinum into the palladium catalyst prevents the drop of methane conversion. This is in line with previous results from our laboratory and from others. For temperatures below 670 C, the activities of the bimetallic catalysts slightly increase with time-on-stream. As seen by in situ XRD, more PdO is formed during operation. This may be the explanation of the increase in methane conversion since PdO is more active than its metallic state.

The redox properties of PdO and the catalytic activity for methane conversion are strongly dependent on the nature of the support material. PdPtAl2O3 has the highest activity of the bimetallic catalysts at the lower temperatures, both for the transient and the steady-state activity tests. This is most likely related to its surface area being almost 10 times larger than that of the other support materials.

PdPtCeZrO2 is the most active of the bimetallic catalysts in the steady-state test at temperatures above 620 C. However, in the transient tests PdPtCeZrO2 has similar activity as PdPtZrO2 during heating, but differs during cooling. Hence, the activity of PdPtCeZrO2 becomes clearly improved in the steady-state tests compared to the transient tests.

The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation. The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts.

Both activity tests operating in transient and in steady-state modes are important for comparing the stability and level of activity of various catalysts.
