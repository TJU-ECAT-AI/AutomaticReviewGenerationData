The activity of the monometalic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470 C. In situ XRD results showed that no decomposition of bulk PdO into metallic palladium occurred at temperatures below 800 C. Hence, the reason for the drop in activity is probably not connected to the bulk PdO decomposition.

All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst. However, dissimilarities in activity and ability to reoxidise PdO were observed for the various support materials. PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C.

The ability to reoxidise metallic Pd into PdO was observed to vary between the supports. The alumina sample showed a very slow reoxidation, whereas ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was clearly faster.

In the transient activity tests, the monometallic palladium catalyst supported on alumina gives higher activity for methane combustion than the PdPt catalysts. The PdPt catalysts tested in this study consist of equal molar amounts of noble metals as on the PdAl2O3 catalysts, but divided as 2/3 of palladium and 1/3 of platinum. The XRD studies of the PdPt catalysts indicate that some of the palladium is alloyed with Pt. Hence, the bimetallic catalysts contain smaller amounts of the active PdO phase compared to PdAl2O3.

In the steady-state tests, incorporation of platinum into the palladium catalyst prevents the drop of methane conversion. This is in line with previous results from our laboratory and from others. For temperatures below 670 C, the activities of the bimetallic catalysts slightly increase with time-on-stream. As seen by in situ XRD, more PdO is formed during operation. This may be the explanation of the increase in methane conversion since PdO is more active than its metallic state.

The redox properties of PdO and the catalytic activity for methane conversion are strongly dependent on the nature of the support material. PdPtAl2O3 has the highest activity of the bimetallic catalysts at the lower temperatures, both for the transient and the steady-state activity tests. This is most likely related to its surface area being almost 10 times larger than that of the other support materials.

PdPtCeZrO2 is the most active of the bimetallic catalysts in the steady-state test at temperatures above 620 C. However, in the transient tests PdPtCeZrO2 has similar activity as PdPtZrO2 during heating, but differs during cooling. Hence, the activity of PdPtCeZrO2 becomes clearly improved in the steady-state tests compared to the transient tests.

The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation. The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts.

Both activity tests operating in transient and in steady-state modes are important for comparing the stability and level of activity of various catalysts.

To understand how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, we refer to the study on the influence of support materials for palladium-platinum catalysts. The results show that the activity of the monometallic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470°C. In contrast, all PdPt catalysts have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst, regardless of the support material. The nature of the support material significantly affects the combustion performance of the bimetallic PdPt catalysts. Specifically, PdPtAl2O3 was the most active catalyst at lower temperatures, PdPtCeZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800°C, and PdPtLaMnAl11O19 was the most active for temperatures above 800°C. Moreover, PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidizes PdO much easier than PdPtAl2O3, requiring up to 10 hours for completion. Lastly, the drop in methane conversion during PdO decomposition was suppressed for ZrO2-based catalysts compared to Al2O3-based catalysts. These findings highlight the importance of support material selection in enhancing the stability and efficiency of bimetallic catalysts in reactor studies.

Future UHV (ultra-high vacuum) studies could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder the direct comparison and interpretation of the results. Future research could aim to bridge this gap by developing methodologies that better simulate the operational conditions of industrial reactors, thus enabling more accurate predictions and optimization of catalyst performance.

要了解铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响，我们可以参考对钯-铂催化剂支持材料影响的研究。研究结果表明，单金属钯催化剂在稳态条件下活性降低，即使在470°C这样的低温下也是如此。相比之下，所有钯-铂催化剂的甲烷转化稳定性显著高于单金属钯催化剂，且与支持材料无关。支持材料的性质对双金属钯-铂催化剂的燃烧性能有显著影响。具体而言，钯-氧化铝2O3在较低温度下最为活跃，钯-铈氧化锆在620至800°C之间最活跃，而钯-镧锰铝11O19在800°C以上温度下最为活跃。此外，钯-铈氧化锆比钯-氧化铝2O3更容易还原钯氧化物，需要长达10小时才能完成。最后，钯氧化物分解过程中甲烷转化的下降在锆基催化剂中被抑制，与氧化铝基催化剂相比。这些发现强调了选择支持材料的重要性，以增强双金属催化剂在反应器研究中的稳定性和效率。

未来超高真空(UHV)研究可能为将这些发现与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联提供有价值的信息。然而，当前UHV研究中关于铂基双金属表面的限制可能阻碍了直接比较和解释结果。未来的研究可以致力于开发能够更好地模拟工业反应器操作条件的方法，从而实现催化剂性能预测和优化的更准确评估。

The literature provides extensive details on the catalytic performance of palladium-palladium and palladium-platinum catalysts on various support materials. It discusses the effects of support materials on the catalytic activities, redox properties, and stability of these catalysts. The literature also delves into the behavior of palladium-based catalysts during oxidation and reduction, highlighting the differences in their performance across various support materials. Additionally, it explores the influence of the support material on the reoxidation of palladium oxide (PdO) into metallic palladium (Pd), which is crucial for the stability and efficiency of the catalysts.

The influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, on CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies is multifaceted. The literature indicates that the nature of the support material significantly affects the catalytic performance of these systems. For instance, the use of ceria-stabilized zirconia (CeZrO2) in the support leads to enhanced reoxidation properties of PdO, facilitating easier reactivation of metallic Pd, which is crucial for maintaining high conversion rates over time. 

The literature suggests that the introduction of ceria into the support material can lead to a smaller temperature gap between the decomposition and reoxidation of PdO, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst. This finding aligns with the observed improvements in steady-state activity tests, where the addition of ceria to the support material led to superior performance compared to other support materials. 

However, the literature also acknowledges the limitations of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies in fully correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. UHV studies often lack the complexity of real-world conditions, including the presence of impurities and the dynamic interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces. Future studies could potentially bridge this gap by incorporating more realistic conditions, such as varying gas compositions and temperatures, to better understand the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under practical operating conditions. 

The insights gained from studying bimetallic catalysts on different support materials can inform the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications. By understanding how support materials influence the reactivity, stability, and selectivity of these catalysts, researchers can tailor catalyst formulations to optimize performance for specific chemical processes, such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的影响是多方面的。文献表明，支持材料的性质显著影响这些系统的催化性能。例如，在支撑物中使用铈稳定化的锆氧（CeZrO2）可以增强PdO的重新氧化特性，促进金属Pd的重新激活，这对于维持高转化率具有重要意义。

文献表明，向支撑材料中添加铈可以导致PdO分解和重新氧化之间的温度差距变小，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。这一发现与在稳态活性测试中观察到的性能改进相一致，其中添加铈到支撑材料中的催化剂表现出优于其他支撑材料的性能。

然而，文献也认识到超真空(UHV)研究在完全将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂联系起来时的局限性。UHV研究往往缺乏实际条件的复杂性，包括杂质的存在以及反应物与催化剂表面之间的动态相互作用。未来的研究可以通过引入更真实的情况，如不同的气体组成和温度，来更好地理解在实际操作条件下Pt基双金属表面的行为。

通过研究不同支持材料对双金属催化剂的影响，可以获得有关反应活性、稳定性和选择性的见解，从而指导催化剂配方的优化设计以适应特定化学过程的需求，如CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化。

The document discusses the use of bimetallic palladium-platinum catalysts in catalytic combustion processes for heat and power production in gas turbines. It highlights the benefits of reducing operating temperatures, minimizing thermal NOx emissions, and achieving low levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. However, it notes that the stability of palladium-based catalysts is insufficient for maintaining adequate methane conversion over time, leading to the development of bimetallic catalysts like PdPt. The addition of a second metal, such as platinum, enhances the stability and efficiency of the catalysts. The behavior of these catalysts during oxidation and reduction, as well as their thermal stability, is influenced by the support material. Different additives, like ceria, have been shown to positively affect reoxidation processes and prevent catalyst deactivation. The study investigates the impact of various support materials, including alumina, zirconium oxide, ceria-stabilized zirconium oxide, yttria-stabilized zirconium oxide, and manganese-substituted La-hexaaluminate, on the performance of bimetallic PdPt catalysts. Special attention is given to the catalysts' performance at steady-state conditions and their ability to maintain stable methane conversion over time. The results indicate that the choice of support material significantly influences the catalyst's efficiency and stability in catalytic combustion processes.
