[1] "The activity of the monometallic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470 C."
[2] "All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst."
[3] "PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C."
[4] "The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation."
[5] "The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by offering more stable conversions at various temperatures compared to monometallic palladium catalysts. The ceria-stabilized ZrO2 support provides the best activity between 620 and 800°C, while LaMnAl11O19 is superior for temperatures above 800°C. The formation of PdO during operation contributes to an increase in activity, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts, which exhibit suppressed effects of PdO decomposition compared to Al2O3-based catalysts. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by exploring the detailed interactions and transformations at the atomic scale.

特别是Pt基催化剂，对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率产生影响，通过提供与单金属钯催化剂相比更稳定的转化，在不同温度下。在620至800°C之间，铈稳定化的ZrO2支持提供了最佳的活性，而LaMnAl11O19在800°C以上温度表现出色。操作过程中PdO的形成增加了活性，尤其是在ZrO2基催化剂中，显示出与Al2O3基催化剂相比抑制PdO分解的效果。未来UHV研究可以通过探索原子尺度上的详细相互作用和转变，为模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性提供见解。
