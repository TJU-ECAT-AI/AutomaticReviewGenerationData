<p>The activity of the monometalic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470 C.</p>
<p>All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometalic palladium catalyst.</p>
<p>PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C.</p>
<p>The ability to reoxidise metallic Pd into PdO was observed to vary between the supports. The alumina sample showed a very slow reoxidation, whereas ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was clearly faster.</p>
<p>Both the TPO profile and the in situ XRD diffractograms suggest that PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises Pd very easily during cooling.</p>
<p>For higher temperatures, above 800 C, the PdPtLaMnAl11O19 catalyst is superior, shown by the transient activity tests as the steady-state tests were only performed to 720 C.</p>
<p>The objectives of this paper were to investigate the influence of support materials for palladiumplatinum catalysts as well as to compare monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>At steady-state conditions, i.e. when temperature was kept constant, the methane conversion drops significant with time for the monometallic palladium catalyst.</p>
<p>However, for the zirconium-based samples, the drop in activity due to PdO decomposition is not as pronounced as for the alumina-based catalysts.</p>

The study aimed to evaluate how different support materials affect the performance of palladium-platinum catalysts and compare the outcomes between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The results showed that bimetallic catalysts provided more stable methane conversions under steady-state conditions compared to monometallic palladium catalysts. Specifically, PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active at lower temperatures, while PdPt supported on ceria-stabilized ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800°C. PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800°C. The reoxidation of PdO varied between supports, with alumina showing a slower reoxidation compared to ceria-stabilized ZrO2. Moreover, the bimetallic catalyst PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidized Pd more easily during cooling. Lastly, the PdPtLaMnAl11O19 catalyst was found to be superior for temperatures above 800°C in transient activity tests.

本研究旨在评估不同载体材料对钯铂催化剂性能的影响，并比较单金属和双金属催化剂的差异。结果表明，在恒定状态条件下，双金属催化剂提供了更稳定的甲烷转化率，与单金属钯催化剂相比。具体而言，Al2O3支持的PdPt在较低温度下最为活跃，而Ce稳定化的ZrO2支持的PdPt在620至800°C之间最为活跃。LaMnAl11O19支持的PdPt在高于800°C时表现出色。PdO的再氧化在不同载体间存在差异，其中Al2O3的再氧化速度较慢，而Ce稳定化的ZrO2则更快。此外，PdPtCeZrO2在冷却过程中更容易将Pd重新氧化。最后，在瞬态活性测试中发现，PdPtLaMnAl11O19催化剂在高于800°C时表现优异。
