Abstract
Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr. CO chemisorption, XRD, TPR, and TPO were conducted to characterize active catalysts. Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures. For supported Pt-Ni catalysts, Alumina was superior to TiO2 and ZrO2 as a support. The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures. The optimum molar ratio between Ni and Pt was determined to be 5. This Pt-Ni/γ A12O3 showed no decrease in CO conversion and CO2 selectivity for the selective CO oxidation in the presence of 2 vol% H2O and 20 vol% CO2. The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream.
