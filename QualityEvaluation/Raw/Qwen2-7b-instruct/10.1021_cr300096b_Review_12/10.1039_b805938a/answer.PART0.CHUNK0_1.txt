[1] "The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively."
[2] "The C2C6 distance value (the distance value between the two dehydrocarbons) and the C2C1C6 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much smaller than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule, and the small C2C6 distance value of 1.419 Å indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation."
[3] "Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level."
