The o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations: a theoretical study On the basis of the CASPT2 (multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory) geometry optimization calculations, the ground states of the o-C6H4+ (C2v), m-C6H4+ (C2v), and p-C6H4+ (D2h) radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. For o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+, the first excited states (12A2 and 12A1, respectively) lie very close to the respective ground states. The small distance value of 1.419 Å between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground-state geometry of m-C6H4+ indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons (the distance in the 12A1 geometry of m-C6H4+ is very long as in the m-C6H4 molecule). The (U)B3LYP isotropic proton hfcc (hyperfine coupling constant) calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns while the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns.

The CASPT2 method further incorporates dynamic electron correlation. The CAS methods were previously used in our theoretical study13 on the o-, m-, and p-benzyne molecules since these parent molecules have a biradical character and their wavefunctions have a multi-configurational character.

The CAS methods are also considered to be effective for theoretical studies of excited electronic states of molecules and molecular ions.26,30 The choice of the CAS methods in the present work stemmed from the following considerations: (i) the ground states of the benzyne radical cations may also have a multi-configurational character in the wavefunctions and (ii) several electronic states, including the excited states, of the benzyne radical cations should be calculated.

As shown in Table 1, the CASSCF(7,8) calculations predict that the 12B1 state lies slightly above 12A2 (the CASSCF T0 values are not reliable) and the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1 produced an imaginary frequency (i1875 cm−1) of the b2 symmetry. We performed the CASPT2(7,8) geometry optimization calculations with a Cs (the symmetry plane being the carbon-framework plane) starting geometry, obtained by slightly distorting the C2v geometry of the 12B1 state according to the b2 vibration mode, in the 12A state, and the calculations led to the CASPT2(7,8) C2v optimized geometry of the 12B1 state.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As depicted in Table 1, the CASSCF(7,8) calculations suggest that the 12B1 state is positioned slightly above the 12A2 state (the reliability of CASSCF T0 values is questionable). The CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1 resulted in an imaginary frequency (i1875 cm−1) associated with the b2 symmetry. By initiating CASPT2(7,8) geometry optimization calculations with a Cs geometry (carbon-framework plane serving as the symmetry plane), which was derived by slightly modifying the C2v geometry of the 12B1 state in accordance with the b2 vibrational mode, we achieved the CASPT2(7,8) C2v optimized configuration for the 12B1 state.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
如表1所示，CASSCF(7,8)计算预测12B1状态略高于12A2状态（CASSCF T0值的可靠性存在疑问）。对12B1状态进行CASSCF(7,8)频率计算时产生了与b2对称性相关的虚频率（i1875 cm−1）。通过采用Cs几何（碳骨架平面作为对称面）作为起始几何结构，该几何结构是根据b2振动模式微调12B1状态的C2v几何得到的，在12A状态下，我们实现了CASPT2(7,8) C2v优化的12B1状态。

It is noted that the C1C6 bond (the bond between the two dehydrocarbons) and C3C4 bond in the 12B1 geometry are longer than the respective bonds in the parent molecule. The 12A2 geometry is quite different from the 12B1 geometry and it is also quite different from the geometry of the parent molecule. The properties of the ground state of the o-benzyne radical cation will be described in section 3.5.

It's worth mentioning that the C1C6 bond (connecting the two dehydrocarbons) and C3C4 bond in the 12B1 geometry are longer compared to their counterparts in the parent molecule.

In the 12B1 (X2B1) state of o-C6H4+, the a(H2) and a(H3) values are around ()10 G and the a(H1) and a(H4) values are small. In the 12A2 state of o-C6H4+, the a(H1) and a(H4) values are around ()10 G and the a(H2) and a(H3) values are small. Since there are two protons having significant isotropic hfcc values of around 10 G in either 12B1 or 12A2, the ESR spectra for the 12B1 and 12A2 states of o-C6H4+ would have similar patterns (hence the ESR spectra may not be helpful in assignment of the ground state).

In the 12B1 (X2B1) state of o-C6H4+, the a(H2) and a(H3) values are approximately 10 G, while the a(H1) and a(H4) values are small. In the 12A2 state of o-C6H4+, the a(H1) and a(H4) values are roughly 10 G, and the a(H2) and a(H3) values are small. Given that two protons possess significant isotropic hfcc values of around 10 G in either the 12B1 or 12A2 states, the ESR spectra for the 12B1 and 12A2 states of o-C6H4+ would exhibit similar patterns (thus, the ESR spectra might not aid in identifying the ground state).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在o-C6H4+的12B1（X2B1）状态下，a(H2)和a(H3)值约为10 G，而a(H1)和a(H4)值较小。在o-C6H4+的12A2状态下，a(H1)和a(H4)值大致为10 G，a(H2)和a(H3)值较小。鉴于在12B1或12A2状态中，有两个质子具有大约10 G的显著各向同性hfcc值，因此，o-C6H4+的12B1和12A2状态的ESR光谱将呈现相似的模式（因此，ESR光谱可能无法帮助识别基态）。
