[1] "On the basis of the CASPT2 (multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory) geometry optimization calculations, the ground states of the o-C6H4+ (C2v), m-C6H4+ (C2v), and p-C6H4+ (D2h) radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively."
[2] "The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively."
[3] "The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons."
[4] "Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level."
[5] "The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns. The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results."
