[1] "The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively."
[2] "For the o-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A2 (assuming that 22B1 does not lie between 12B1 and 12A2) and it lies very close to the ground state."
[3] "For the m-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A1 (assuming that 22A2 does not lie between 12A2 and 12A1) and it lies close to the ground state."
[4] "The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character."
[5] "In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons."
[6] "In the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons either."
[7] "In the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons."
[8] "Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level."
[9] "The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns."
[10] "The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results."
