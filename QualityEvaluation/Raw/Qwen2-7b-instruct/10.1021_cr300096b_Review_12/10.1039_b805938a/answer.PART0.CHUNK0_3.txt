[1] "The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively."
[2] "The small C2C6 distance value of 1.419 Å (see the CASPT2(7,8) and CASSCF(7,8) values in Table 3) in the 12A2 geometry indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons (see Fig. 1) in the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation."
[3] "The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character."
[4] "Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level."

1. The ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations were identified as 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively.
2. The short C2C6 bond distance in the 12A2 geometry of m-C6H4+ indicates a real chemical bond between the dehydrocarbons in its ground state.
3. The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of o-C6H4+ exhibits a somewhat multiconfigurational character.
4. Isotropic proton hyperfine coupling constant calculations were conducted for the ground and first excited states of o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations using UB3LYP(//CASPT2).

1. o-, m-, 和 p-苯基炔基自由基离子的基态分别被确定为12B1、12A2和12B1u。
2. 在m-C6H4+的12A2几何结构中较短的C2C6键距离表明其基态中两个脱氢碳之间确实存在化学键。
3. 对于o-C6H4+的基态，CASSCF波函数表现出一定程度的多配置性特征。
4. 使用UB3LYP(//CASPT2)，对o-、m-和p-苯基炔基自由基离子的基态和第一激发态进行了等向质子耦合常数计算。
