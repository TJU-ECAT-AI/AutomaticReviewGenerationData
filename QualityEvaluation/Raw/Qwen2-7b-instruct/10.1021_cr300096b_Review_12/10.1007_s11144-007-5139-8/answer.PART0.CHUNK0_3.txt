[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated how the Pt/Ni ratio affects the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2. By adding a small amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percentage) to the Ni catalyst, the size of NiO was reduced, making it easier to reduce and promoting a uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究探讨了Pt/Ni比例对用于甲烷CO2重整的双金属PtNi催化剂表面性质和催化性能的影响。通过向Ni催化剂中添加少量的Pt（0.3至0.5重量百分比），NiO的大小被减小，使其更容易还原，并且促进了镍金属颗粒的均匀分布。
