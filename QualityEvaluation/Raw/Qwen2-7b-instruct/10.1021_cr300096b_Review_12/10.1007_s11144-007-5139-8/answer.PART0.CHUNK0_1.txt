[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated how the ratio of platinum (Pt) to nickel (Ni) influences the surface characteristics and catalytic activity of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with carbon dioxide. The results indicated that adding a small proportion of Pt (between 0.3% and 0.5% by weight) to the Ni catalyst reduced the size of NiO, made it easier to reduce, and ensured a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.
