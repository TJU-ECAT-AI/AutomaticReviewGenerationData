[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic activity of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. It was observed that incorporating a minor amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) into the Ni catalyst resulted in a reduction of the NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.
