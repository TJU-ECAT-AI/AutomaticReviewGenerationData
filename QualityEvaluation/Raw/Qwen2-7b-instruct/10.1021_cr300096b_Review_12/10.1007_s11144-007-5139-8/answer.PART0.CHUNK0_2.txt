The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) to the Ni catalyst resulted in reduced NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.
