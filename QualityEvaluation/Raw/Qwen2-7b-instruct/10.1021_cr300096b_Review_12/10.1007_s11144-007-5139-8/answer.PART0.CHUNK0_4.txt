[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated how the ratio of Pt to Ni influences the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used in methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small percentage of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

Tests such as Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that incorporating a small amount of platinum (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) into the nickel catalyst reduces the size of NiO, facilitates its easy reduction, and ensures an even distribution of nickel metal particles.
