[1] "Introduction Cheap catalysts amenable for use in low-resource settings (e.g., fuel cell catalysts with a reduced Pt loading) are ever in high demand."
[2] "In order to reduce cost (by reducing the amount of Pt in the catalyst) and simultaneously increase efficiency, Pt-based bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticle (NP) catalysts have been developed."
[3] "Trimetallic NPs may possess an even greater degree of catalytic activity and selectivity than the bimetallic ones because more variables are available for tuning; however, there have been only a few reports of trimetallic NPs in the literature thus far."
[4] "In this work we report the synthesis and optimization of catalytic NPs consisting of a Au core, covered by a Pd shell, onto which Pt clusters are deposited (hereafter denoted as Au@Pd@Pt NPs)."
[5] "This activity is critically dependent upon the Pd-shell thickness and the Pt-cluster coverage."
[6] "A complex synergistic effect is achieved by using all three metals in combination (i.e., the whole is greater than the sum of its parts)."
[7] "We note, however, that the frequency of the 1844 cm1 band increases by 105 cm1 whereas the frequency of the 2000 cm1 band increases by only 75 cm1."
[8] "Further evidence for the band assignments given above is provided in S3 of the ESI."
[9] "For NPs with 2 monolayers of Pd, the CO adsorption energies in Table 1 can be divided into two distinct categories, high energy sites (A, B and C) and low energy sites (D)."
[10] "CO adsorption will be favored atop Pt clusters (A) and on isolated Pd hollow sites (B), which exist widely in ordinary Pt and Pd surfaces."
[11] "Accordingly, the unusually high catalytic activity seen in our Au@Pd@Pt NPs must occur by a synergistic effect."

The document discusses the development and optimization of Pt-based bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles for enhancing electrocatalytic activity, particularly for the electrooxidation of formic acid. The trimetallic nanoparticles, specifically Au@Pd@Pt NPs, exhibit unusual high activity due to the synergistic effect between the Au core, Pd shell, and Pt clusters. This synergy allows for the optimization of the catalytic activity through the tuning of the composition and structure of the nanoparticles. The document also explores the influence of the Pd shell thickness and Pt cluster coverage on the catalytic activity, highlighting the critical role these factors play in achieving maximum activity. Furthermore, the document employs a combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods to elucidate the mechanisms behind the enhanced catalytic activity, providing insights into the electronic and morphological properties of the trimetallic nanostructure that are uniquely suited for catalysis. The authors suggest that the optimized Au@Pd@Pt NPs could be promising materials for commercial fuel cells, potentially with cost-effective alternatives like Ag replacing the Au core for enhanced catalytic activity through the same synergistic effect.
