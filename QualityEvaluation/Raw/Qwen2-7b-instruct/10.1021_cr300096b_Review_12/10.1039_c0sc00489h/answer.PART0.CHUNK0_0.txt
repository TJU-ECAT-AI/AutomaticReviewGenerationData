[1] "Introduction Cheap catalysts amenable for use in low-resource settings (e.g., fuel cell catalysts with a reduced Pt loading) are ever in high demand."
[2] "These NPs exhibit different properties and functionalities when compared to monometallic Pt. In particular, they show enhanced selectivity and reactivity when used as catalysts and sensors."
[3] "Trimetallic NPs may possess an even greater degree of catalytic activity and selectivity than the bimetallic ones because more variables are available for tuning."
[4] "In accordance with the increased degrees of freedom that trimetallic NPs offer, the optimization of composition and morphology presented in this work has been a great challenge."
[5] "In this work we report the synthesis and optimization of catalytic NPs consisting of a Au core, covered by a Pd shell, onto which Pt clusters are deposited (hereafter denoted as Au@Pd@Pt NPs)."
[6] "This activity is critically dependent upon the Pd-shell thickness and the Pt-cluster coverage."
[7] "A complex synergistic effect is achieved by using all three metals in combination (i.e., the whole is greater than the sum of its parts)."
[8] "We now describe the synthesis of NPs with a 55 nm Au core, covered by 2 monolayers of Pd, and having Pt clusters added such that the amount of Pt is approximately equivalent to the amount that would be present in half a monolayer (θPt  0.5)."
[9] "The loading of Pt and Pd on NPs prepared in this way was found to be about 28.7 μg cm−2 (this number is a sum for both metals)."
[10] "Characterization of the Au@Pd@Pt NP surface by SERS Apart from HRTEM, an alternative way to detect the very small Pt clusters formed when θPt  0.5 is to employ a probe molecule and SERS strategy."
[11] "As θPt is increased, more Pt top sites and fewer Pd bridge sites become available."
[12] "The frequency changes observed for CO on top of Pt are even more interesting, as they appear to be quite complex."
[13] "Finally, we note that both the Pd bridge and Pt top-site CO peaks display a long, low-frequency tail."
[14] "Linear voltammetry was used to investigate the effect of θPt on the catalytic activity of Au@Pd@Pt NPs toward electrooxidation of formic acid."
[15] "The onset potential of formic acid oxidation is about 0.23 V and the current peak potential is about 0.05 V."
[16] "According to Grozovski et al., the dehydration step of formic acid oxidation will take place in a potential region where little hydrogen is adsorbed."
[17] "In addition to possessing high catalytic activity, our Au@Pd@Pt NPs are stable beyond 2 h."
[18] "We also synthesized coreshellcluster structures possessing a nanocube, instead of a nanosphere, core."
[19] "In order to make the catalyst cheaper and therefore more applicable to an industrial setting, we reduced the size of the Au core from 55 to 16 nm."
[20] "Since the ideal θPt is constant for different types of NPs, the Pt-on-Pd structure must have some specific position for the electrooxidation of formic acid."
[21] "Of central interest here is the synergistic effect of the special coreshellcluster structure with an extremely small amount of Pt on the ultra-thin Pd overlayer."
[22] "Since the above-mentioned electrochemical measurements were unable to reveal a detailed mechanism, a combination of spectroscopic and theoretical methods were employed to gain mechanistic information on this complex system at the atomic and molecular levels."
[23] "According to Nrskov and co-workers,85,86 adsorption energies and catalytic activities are greatly dependent on the d-band center."
[24] "The lower the d-band center, the weaker the metal-adsorbate binding strength during oxidation and the more negative the oxidation potential."

The literature provides insights into the synthesis and optimization of trimetallic nanoparticles (Au@Pd@Pt NPs) for enhanced electrocatalytic activity in formic acid oxidation. The synergistic effect between the three metals leads to high activity, stability, and selectivity in catalytic processes. Specifically, the Au@Pd@Pt NPs show maximum catalytic activity when the Pt coverage is approximately 0.5 monolayer equivalents (θPt  0.5), which optimizes the number of active mixed hollow D-sites for formic acid oxidation. This structure allows for efficient dissociation of formic acid and reduction of CO poisoning, leading to a higher onset potential of 0.23 V and a current peak potential of 0.05 V for formic acid oxidation. The activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique electronic properties and morphological features of the coreshellcluster trimetallic nanostructure, which are suitable for catalysis. The Au core, Pd shell, and Pt clusters work together to enhance the catalytic activity for formic acid oxidation, surpassing the performance of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The optimized Au@Pd@Pt NPs demonstrate high stability and are promising for commercial fuel cells, with potential for scalability and application in various electrochemical and catalytic processes. The synthesis methodology allows for customization of the core, shell, and cluster materials, offering versatility in designing nanomaterials for industrial applications. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms and correlations between model surfaces, supported catalysts, and UHV studies for further advancements in catalytic research.
