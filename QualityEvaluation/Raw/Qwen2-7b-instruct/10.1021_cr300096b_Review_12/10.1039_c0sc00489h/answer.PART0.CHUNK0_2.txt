The document highlights the potential of trimetallic catalysts, specifically those consisting of Au cores, Pd shells, and Pt clusters, for enhancing electrocatalytic activity. The presence of multiple metals allows for a synergistic effect that can increase the catalytic activity and selectivity compared to bimetallic catalysts. The activity of the Au@Pd@Pt NPs is highly dependent on the thickness of the Pd shell and the coverage of the Pt clusters. Spectroscopic and theoretical methods were employed to gain mechanistic insight into the complex system. The document also mentions that the d-band center of the catalyst surface plays a significant role in the catalytic activity, with a lower d-band center leading to weaker metal-adsorbate binding strength and a more negative oxidation potential.

文档强调了由Au内核、Pd外壳和Pt簇组成的三元催化剂在增强电催化活性方面的潜力。多种金属的存在允许产生协同效应，这可以增加与单金属或二元催化剂相比的催化活性和选择性。Au@Pd@Pt NPs的活性高度依赖于Pd层的厚度和Pt簇的覆盖度。采用光谱学和理论方法获得了关于这一复杂系统的机制信息。文档还提到催化剂表面的d带中心对催化活性有重要影响，d带中心较低导致金属-吸附剂结合强度较弱和氧化电势更负。
