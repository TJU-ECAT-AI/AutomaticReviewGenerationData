[1] "Cheap catalysts amenable for use in low-resource settings (e.g., fuel cell catalysts with a reduced Pt loading) are ever in high demand."
[2] "In order to reduce cost (by reducing the amount of Pt in the catalyst) and simultaneously increase efficiency, Pt-based bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticle (NP) catalysts have been developed."
[3] "Trimetallic NPs may possess an even greater degree of catalytic activity and selectivity than the bimetallic ones because more variables are available for tuning."
[4] "The high energy density, fast oxidation kinetics, and convenience of liquid formic acid, as well as the simplicity of power-system integration, make DFAFCs a promising power source for portable device applications."
[5] "This activity is critically dependent upon the Pd-shell thickness and the Pt-cluster coverage."
[6] "The small anodic peak at 0.22 V is related to the desorption of hydrogen, and it is proportional to shell thickness."
[7] "We note that NPs with a 9 nm Ag core, 2 atomic layers of Pd and a Pt loading such that θPt  0.5 have a Ag:Pd:Pt molar ratio of about 50:10:1."

1. Catalysts suitable for low-resource environments, such as fuel cell catalysts with reduced platinum loading, are in high demand.
2. To reduce cost and enhance efficiency, researchers have developed Pt-based bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles.
3. Trimetallic nanoparticles might offer greater catalytic activity and selectivity than bimetallic ones due to the ability to adjust more variables.
4. Direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) are promising for portable devices because of their high energy density, rapid oxidation kinetics, and ease of integration.
5. The electrooxidation activity of formic acid depends critically on the palladium shell thickness and the platinum cluster coverage.
6. The peak related to hydrogen desorption at 0.22 V is proportional to the thickness of the palladium shell.
7. Nanoparticles with a 9 nm silver core, 2 atomic layers of palladium, and a platinum loading of θPt  0.5 have an approximate molar ratio of 50:10:1 of Ag:Pd:Pt.

1. 对于低资源环境（如具有较低铂负载的燃料电池催化剂），便宜的催化剂始终需求量大。
2. 为了降低成本（通过减少催化剂中的铂含量）并同时提高效率，研究人员已经开发出了基于铂的双金属和三金属纳米颗粒催化剂。
3. 与双金属相比，三金属纳米颗粒可能拥有更高的催化活性和选择性，因为有更多的变量可供调整。
4. 直接甲酸燃料电池（DFAFC）对于便携式设备应用是很有前景的，原因在于它们的高能量密度、快速氧化动力学以及集成的简便性。
5. 形酸电氧化的活性在很大程度上依赖于钯壳的厚度和铂簇的覆盖度。
6. 与0.22伏特相关的氢脱附峰值与钯壳的厚度成正比。
7. 核心为9纳米银、2层钯和θPt  0.5的铂负载的纳米颗粒具有大约50:10:1的银：钯：铂摩尔比（Ag:Pd:Pt）。
