Supported PtCo Catalysts for Selective CO Oxidation in a Hydrogen-Rich Stream Graphical Abstract Highly active bimetallic catalysts, PtCo nanoparticles supported on yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ; see picture) can be prepared in a single step by co-impregnation. This system shows a high catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of CO in the presence of excess hydrogen, especially at temperatures below 423K.
The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has come to be regarded as one of the most promising candidates for utilizing hydrogen to produce heat and electricity, especially for electric vehicles or residential co-generation systems.1 Pt and Pt-based alloys, which are generally used as the anode of PEMFCs, are known to be easily poisoned by even small amounts of CO in the hydrogen-rich stream that can be produced from various hydrocarbons by the reforming and water gas shift (WGS) reactions.2 Due to the limited catalytic activities of the current WGS catalysts for complete CO conversion, which is thermodynamically favored at low temperatures, approximately 0.51vol% of unconverted CO remains in the effluent, and this should be removed to a trace level of below 10ppm before reaching the PEMFC. Among the methods proposed to remove this residual CO, preferential CO oxidation (PROX) has been accepted as one of the most promising.2 Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications. In addition, CO can consume additional H2 by undergoing hydrogenation [Eq.(3)], a process also known as methanation, which should be avoided unless the CO concentration in the reactant stream is quite low, because it consumes relatively large amounts of hydrogen (3mol per mol CO).
((1)) ((2)) ((3)) Thus, a highly active and selective catalyst is required to remove CO from the H2-rich stream before it reaches the PEMFC. Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX,3 supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance. However, they usually only show noticeable activities under practical conditions above 423K,3a where the reverse WGS reaction could occur, thereby hindering complete CO removal. Many researchers have therefore made efforts to enhance the PROX activity of supported platinum catalysts at low temperatures, for example by water vapor pre-treatment of the Pt catalyst,3b the addition of alkali metals,3c and the addition of other metals.3d3n In a previous study, we found that PtCo/γ-Al2O3 is one of the most active catalysts among the supported Pt catalysts tested under the same reaction conditions.3k,3l Until now, most work has been conducted on Pt-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, and the effect of supports on Pt-based catalysts has been limited to TiO23m and CeO2.3n Furthermore, the Pt loading in some active Pt-based catalysts is relatively high, which can hinder their practical applications.3b,3e3g Herein, we report that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. By optimizing the calcination and reduction pre-treatment conditions for PtCo/YSZ, the CO concentration can be decreased below 10ppm in the temperature range 380423K. Furthermore, an isolated PtCo bimetallic phase can be observed on this catalyst.
Figure1 1shows the catalytic performance of PtCo/YSZ for PROX with increasing reaction temperatures. An extremely high H2 concentration (80vol%) in the reactant stream was adopted. The BET surface area of the YSZ employed, as determined by N2 adsorption isotherms, was 9m2g1. As shown in Figure1, 1PtCo/YSZ catalysts reveal much higher activity and selectivity for PROX compared with those of the unpromoted Pt/YSZ catalyst at all reaction temperatures. For the Pt/YSZ catalyst, the CO conversion and CO2 selectivity at temperatures above 423K were about 40% and 20%, respectively. The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K. However, the extent of the increase of CO and O2 conversion depends on the preparation conditions. Thus, as the amount of Pt decreases from 1.0 to 0.5wt% in PtCo/YSZ, the reaction temperature showing the maximum PROX activity is shifted to higher temperature by approximately 60K.

Catalyst preparation: 0.5wt% PtCo/YSZ (Co/Pt=5) calcined and reduced at 573K (•, ) or 773K (, ); 0.5wt% PtCo/YSZ (Co/Pt=5) calcined at 973K and reduced at 773K (, ); 1wt% PtCo/YSZ (Co/Pt=10) calcined and reduced at 573K (, ); and 1wt% Pt/YSZ calcined and reduced at 573K (, ). Reaction conditions: 1vol% CO, 1vol% O2, 80vol% H2, and 2vol% H2O in He. F/W=1000mLmin1(gcat)1. F/W: ratio of the total gaseous reactant flow rate to the catalyst weight.
The influence of the pre-treatment conditions for PtCo/YSZ containing 0.5wt% Pt on the catalytic activity for PROX is also revealed by Figure1. 1With an increase of the calcination and reduction temperature from 573 to 773K, the maximum CO conversion is obtained at slightly lower temperature; CH4 formation decreases at all reaction temperatures. A calcination temperature higher than 773K results in a rapid decrease in both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity. Thus, the most active PtCo/YSZ catalyst for PROX was found to be that calcined and reduced at 773K, where the amount of Pt can be reduced to 0.5wt% whilst maintaining high catalytic performance. Furthermore, the Co/Pt molar ratio can be adjusted from 5 to 20 to be effective for PROX and the PtCo/YSZ catalyst shows higher catalytic activity at temperatures below 423K than other PtCo catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2, or TiO2 under the same reaction conditions.4 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ (Figure2). 2YSZ is well known to be a reducible support with surface oxygen vacancies.5 For CO oxidation, it has been proposed that the lattice oxygen and interfacial metalsupport interaction play a crucial role in promoting CO oxidation when metal species are supported on an oxygen-ion-conducting support.5,6 As shown in Figure2a, 2the sample with 1wt% Pt/YSZ leads to one broad reduction peak at around 440K, which could be related to the reduction of platinum oxide into Pt metal. The 3wt% Co/YSZ sample (Figure2b) 2exhibits two adjacent reduction peaks for Co oxides with maxima at 500 and 540K. This reduction occurs until the temperature reaches 760K, thus indicating that different metalsupport interactions exist between Co oxides and YSZ. The 1wt% PtCo/YSZ sample (Co/Pt=10, in which the amount of Co is 3wt%; Figure2c) 2shows three adjacent reduction peaks with maxima at 365, 400, and 475K. These reduction temperatures are much lower than those of the 1wt% Pt/YSZ and 3wt% Co/YSZ samples. The lowest temperature peak could be due to the reduction of newly created bimetallic PtCo oxides and the others to the reduction of cobalt oxides to metallic Co.

A similar TPR pattern was observed for the 0.5wt% PtCo/YSZ sample calcined at 573K, with a 30-K shift of the peaks to higher temperatures and with a continuous reduction signal up to 773K (Figure2d). 2For the most active catalyst (sample calcined at 773K; Figure2e), 2the reduction peak at 430K in Figure2d 2has disappeared, thus indicating that the Co oxide is uniformly formed at a higher calcination temperature, as shown in the TEM images in Figures3c,d. 3However, for the catalyst calcined at 973K, disappearance of the bimetallic PtCo reduction peak at low temperatures and overlap of the reduction peaks from Co oxides occurs, as shown in Figure2f. 2The low catalytic activity of this catalyst (Figure1) 1appears to be related to the disappearance of the PtCo bimetallic peak.
To observe the nanosized bimetallic PtCo phase, TEM images were obtained for the 0.5wt% PtCo/YSZ (Co/Pt=5) catalysts calcined and reduced at different temperatures (Figure3). 3Interestingly, the PtCo/YSZ catalyst calcined and reduced at 773K, which is the most active catalyst for PROX, shows a distinct distribution of isolated PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles with an average size of (2.90.5)nm along with isolated Co particles, as shown in Figures3c,d. 3The PtCo/YSZ catalyst calcined and reduced at 573K shows bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles embedded in Co oxides along with isolated PtCo bimetallic particles, whereas coreshell-structured PtCo and Co particles were found for the catalyst calcined at 973K and reduced at 773K. In light of these results, the presence of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles in contact with a reducible support having surface oxygen vacancies could be the reason for the high PROX activity of the PtCo/YSZ catalyst. The presence of a bimetallic PtCo phase such as Pt3Co or PtCo has also been reported in other catalyst systems.7 In the case of the PtCo/YSZ catalysts, we also found by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of different regions that the ratio of Co to Pt is below one for the sample calcined and reduced at 573K and below 1.5 for the sample calcined and reduced at 773K, both of which are active catalysts containing PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles that interact with the YSZ support. However, for the sample calcined at 973K, we found that Co nanoparticles cover most of the surface of the support and the Co/Pt ratio in the coreshell structure exceeds six, which results in low PROX activity.4 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the formation of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles is responsible for the high PROX activity.

An investigation of these catalysts for PROX under practical conditions (an excess H2 gas stream containing CO2 and a large amount of H2O) was carried out to confirm the high catalytic performance of the selected compound, that is, that calcined and reduced at 773K. As shown in Figure4, 4the PtCo/YSZ catalyst is highly effective for PROX as it reduces the CO concentration to below 10ppm in the temperature range 380423K without any significant change in the H2 and CO2 concentrations.

Reaction conditions: 0.9vol% CO, 0.9vol% O2, 17.4vol% CO2, 64.6vol% H2, and 13vol% H2O in N2. F/W=278mLmin1(gcat)1.
In summary, the YSZ-supported PtCo catalyst reported here is highly active for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423K even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%). Careful adjustment of the pre-treatment calcination and reduction conditions provides a PtCo/YSZ catalyst that can reduce the CO concentration to below 10ppm in the temperature range 380423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity.
Experimental Section All the catalysts were prepared by a single-step, co-impregnation method from an aqueous solution of [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2 over YSZ (TZ-8YS, Tosoh), followed by drying at 373K for 12h. The loading of Pt was varied from 0.2 to 1.0wt% and the Co/Pt molar ratio was varied from 0 to 50. Calcination and reduction were carried out in air and a H2 stream, respectively, at various temperatures. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted with a 0.2-g sample in a 10vol% H2/Ar stream from 300 to 800K at a heating rate of 10Kmin1. The TCD signals were recorded after calcining the samples at different temperatures for 1h. The bright-field TEM image was recorded with a Technai G2 TEM (FEI) operating at 200kV. Catalytic activity tests for PROX were carried out in a small, fixed-bed reactor with catalysts that had been retained between 45 and 80mesh sieves. A standard gas containing 1.0vol% CO, 1.0vol% O2, 2.0vol% H2O, and 80vol% H2 balanced with helium was used to compare the catalytic performance of the various catalysts. Subsequently, realistic gas flow conditions of 0.9vol% CO, 0.9vol% O2, 17.4vol% CO2, 64.6vol% H2, and 13vol% H2O balanced with N2 were adopted to confirm the catalytic performance for the most active catalyst. The reactant gas flow was fed into the reactor at atmospheric pressure. The conversion of CO and O2 and the yield of CH4 were determined by GC analysis (HP5890A, 5-Å molecular sieve column) of the effluent stream of the reactor. The detection limit of CO was 10ppm. The effluent gas composition was also determined with an online gas analyzer (NGA2000, MLT4, Rosemount Analyzer System from Emerson Process Management; CO at ppm level, CO2, H2, and CH4 at percent level). The conversion of CO and O2 was calculated from the ratio of the amount consumed to the initial amount of each gas. The CH4 yield was determined from the ratio of the amount of CH4 produced to the initial CO amount. Finally, the CO2 selectivity for PROX was defined as the ratio of the amount of O2 consumed by CO oxidation to the total amount of O2 consumed, as described elsewhere.3k
