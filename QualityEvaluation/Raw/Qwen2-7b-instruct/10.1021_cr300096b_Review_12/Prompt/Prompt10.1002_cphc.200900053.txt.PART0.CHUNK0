Reversible Structural Modulation of FePt Bimetallic Surfaces and Its Effect on Reactivity Teng Ma, Qiang Fu,* Hai-Yan Su, Hong-Yang Liu, Yi Cui, Zhen Wang, Ren-Tao Mu, Wei-Xue Li, and Xin-He Bao*[a] Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic perform- ance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes.[15] Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metalin either the metallic or the oxidized statecan be exposed on the surface,in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region. It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt- based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super cata- lytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface.[4,68] In order to optimize the catalytic performance, it is highly demanding to modulate the surface structure of the bimetallic catalysts. The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wettingdewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst sys- tems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc- tive and oxidative conditions.[911] The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox po- tential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportu- nity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, using well-defined FePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modula- tion regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface

adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts.
Fe overlayers with coverage of about 1.0 monolayer (ML) were grown on a clean PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) by molecular beam epitaxy with the substrate temperature at 487 K, producing a Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) sur- face. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy (XPS), and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) [see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)] indicate that Fe grows on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) in the layer growth mode, at least for the first layer under the current deposition conditions. Upon an- nealing a 1.0 ML Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at 850 K for 6 min, the surface Fe overlayers disappear completely, as indicated by the ISS spectrum (see Figure S2a in SI), where only Pt signals are present. This is confirmed further by the characteristic morphology of the atomically flat PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface (Figure 1a and inset therein) by STM. However, XPS measurements still show a strong signal from Fe (Figure S2b in SI), and a decrease of 61% in the Fe 2p3/2 peak intensity occurs upon the UHV annealing. Considering that the attenua- tion of Fe 2p3/2 photoelectrons through one layer PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) is around 30%, Fe should diffuse into the near surface regions (mainly in first subsurface layer, around 0.5 ML) rather than the deep bulk. Correspondingly, the binding energy (BE) of Fe 2p3/2 shifts from 707.2 eV for the surface Fe overlayers to 707.8 eV Figure 1. a) STM image (200200 nm2) of Pt skin with subsurface Fe, Pt/Fe/ PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), obtained by annealing 1.0 ML Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) at 850 K for 6 min, inset showing an atomic resolution image (1010 nm2). b) STM image (200200 nm2) of FeO/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface via annealing the Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface from (a) in 1.1106 mbar O2 at 850 K for 6 min, inset showing an atomic resolution image (6.36.3 nm2). c) Variation of XPS Fe 2p3/2 peak area, XPS Fe 2p3/2 binding energy, and ratio of ISS Fe signal to Pt signal from a

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
