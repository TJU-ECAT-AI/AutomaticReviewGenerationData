1. Quantum chemical calculations can provide detailed insights into catalytic processes that are hard to achieve through experiments. They are valuable not just for deepening our understanding of the mechanisms, but also for catalyst design screening.

2. The addition of a Sn atom at the adsorption site on a Pt3Sn surface significantly reduces the stability of the surface. All sites on the three stable Pt3Sn surfaces tested were found to be unstable when a Sn atom was present.

3. The presence of Sn beneath the adsorption site enhances CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn atoms on the surface tend to destabilize CO adsorption across all Pt3Sn surfaces studied.

4. The presence of Sn in the alloy limits the number of stable CO adsorption sites on the surface and weakens the CO adsorption process when compared to pure Pt surfaces.

5. LDOS profiles facilitate the understanding of the bonding interactions in COPt3Sn systems, and allow for a straightforward discussion of the effects of Sn on the electronic structure of Pt based on changes in LDOS profiles.

1. 定量化学计算能够提供实验难以获取的催化化学细节洞察，不仅有助于深入理解机制，还能用于催化剂设计的筛选。

2. 在Pt3Sn表面上，当在吸附位点引入Sn原子时，表面的稳定性显著降低。研究中测试的所有三个稳定Pt3Sn表面的所有此类位置都被发现是不稳定的。

3. Sn位于吸附位下方时，增强了CO吸附，而表面附近的Sn原子倾向于使CO吸附不稳定，这发生在所有Pt3Sn表面的研究中。

4. Sn的存在限制了合金表面的稳定CO吸附位点数量，并减弱了与纯Pt表面相比的CO吸附过程。

5. LDOS图谱有助于理解COPt3Sn系统的相互作用，基于Pt的LDOS图谱的变化，可以方便地讨论Sn对Pt电子结构的影响。
