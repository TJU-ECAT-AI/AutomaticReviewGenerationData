<p>Though there are many theoretical CO adsorption studies, none of them covers a one-to-one comparison of the possible adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces. To make this kind of a comparison, it is necessary to apply systematically the same assumptions in all simulations. In this study, the adsorption properties of CO on experimentally verified stable surfaces of Pt3Sn, namely Pt3Sn (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] , were investigated utilizing quantum mechanical calculations.</p>
<p>Aiming to understand the details of the interactions between CO and the metal adsorption sites, the local density of states (LDOS) at the carbon end of CO and at the binding Pt atom were evaluated for Pt-atop adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces. They were compared with the LDOS of: (a) the C of CO in its free state and the binding Pt on the corresponding isolated alloy surface, aiming to understand the energetic and mechanistic details of CO adsorption, (b) the C of CO and the binding Pt on Pt(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces, respectively, to see the effect of alloying with Sn on the CO adsorption properties. Effect of alloying on properties of bare surfaces and details of bridge type CO adsorption on Pt3Sn were also studied.</p>

The study provides a comparison of CO adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces through quantum mechanical calculations. The researchers aimed to understand the interactions between CO and metal adsorption sites by evaluating the local density of states (LDOS) for CO adsorption on Pt3Sn surfaces, comparing these results with those from monometallic Pt surfaces. The effect of alloying with Sn on CO adsorption properties and the effect on bare surface properties were also investigated.

本研究通过量子力学计算，对比了Pt3Sn表面所有面和终止面上的CO吸附位点。研究者旨在通过评估CO吸附在Pt3Sn表面的局部密度态（LDOS），并与单金属Pt表面的结果进行比较，来理解CO与金属吸附位点之间的相互作用。还研究了合金化对CO吸附性质的影响以及对裸露表面性质的影响。

<p>During geometry optimization both the top layer of the metal surface and the adsorbate molecule are relaxed and they reach a minimum energy configuration. Through the optimization studies it was found that at some adsorption sites on the Pt3Sn surface the CO molecule deviated significantly from the site region investigated. As an example, how CO adsorbed at a fourfold hollow site J of the mixed terminated Pt3Sn(1 1 0) moves upon adsorption to its equilibrium structure is given in Fig. 5 . The site is comprised of two Pt and two Sn atoms with a Pt atom in the second layer (top view).</p>
<p>As can be seen from the optimized geometry, the adsorbed CO molecule has moved significantly towards the Pt atoms and away from the Sn atoms; thereby approaching to the nearest stable (i.e. a long-bridge) position. The fourfold hollow site is clearly a site for unstable CO adsorption. The other unstable adsorption sites on the three Pt3Sn surfaces are marked with () in Table 4a . As seen form the simulation results, all of the sites including Sn atoms have proved unstable. This result is in agreement with the literature [11] ,[14] ,[25] .</p>

During the geometry optimization process, both the top layer of the metal surface and the adsorbate molecule were relaxed until they reached a state of minimum energy. In the optimization studies, it was found that at certain adsorption sites on the Pt3Sn surface, the CO molecule significantly deviated from the region under investigation. For instance, the movement of CO adsorbed at a fourfold hollow site J of the mixed terminated Pt3Sn(1 1 0) to its equilibrium structure is illustrated in Figure 5. The site consists of two Pt and two Sn atoms with a Pt atom in the second layer (top view). The optimized geometry shows that the adsorbed CO molecule moved significantly towards the Pt atoms and away from the Sn atoms, approaching the nearest stable (long-bridge) position. This site is clearly unstable for CO adsorption. All sites containing Sn atoms on the three Pt3Sn surfaces were found to be unstable, as per the simulation results, in accordance with previous literature [11], [14], [25].

在几何优化过程中，金属表面的顶层和吸附剂分子被放松到能量最低的状态。在优化研究中发现，在Pt3Sn表面上的某些吸附位点，CO分子偏离了研究区域。例如，图5展示了混合终止的Pt3Sn(1 1 0)上四面空位J处吸附的CO在吸附到其平衡结构时的移动情况。该位置由两个Pt和两个Sn原子组成，第二层有一个Pt原子（顶部视图）。优化后的几何形状显示，吸附的CO分子向Pt原子方向移动并远离Sn原子，接近最稳定的（长桥）位置。这个位置显然是不稳定的CO吸附位点。三个Pt3Sn表面上包含Sn原子的所有位点都被证明是不稳定的，这与模拟结果一致，符合先前文献[11]、[14]、[25]的记载。
