<p>There are several theoretical studies published on CO adsorption on Pt and alloyed Pt surfaces [6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17]. A DFT study on CO and atomic oxygen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) showed that the CO adsorption energies of the high symmetry sites on this surface are quite close [6]. It was found that when CO adsorption was studied on O-precovered surface, the most favorable CO adsorption site was found as the Pt-atop. Ge and King studied CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 0) surface and calculated the potential energy surface (PES) along. The results indicated an existence of an energy barrier of about 0.15 eV between atop and bridge sites [7]. One of the few studies carried out on CO adsorption on defect sites is by Hammer et al. [8]. The results showed extremely strong structure sensitivity of adsorption and this was explained by a model for the d-band center of Pt. Though the computational studies are useful in understanding the CO-surface interaction, it should be kept in mind that some discrepancies may arise between experimental and theoretical results. For example, Feibelman et al. showed that there are discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results for CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) surface [11]. The preferred adsorption site within DFT is the hollow site whereas experimental studies showed that atop site is favored. Grinberg et al. showed that the discrepancies between the experimental and computational results are due to GGA treating different bond orders with varying accuracy and this is not only a problem for Pt surface but also on many other transition metal surfaces [12]. In another work, Gil et al. [13] studied site preference of CO on Pt(1 1 1) and how the calculated adsorption energy changes with the models/parameters are used during the calculations.</p>
<p>Though there are many theoretical CO adsorption studies, none of them covers a one-to-one comparison of the possible adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces. To make this kind of a comparison, it is necessary to apply systematically the same assumptions in all simulations. In this study, the adsorption properties of CO on experimentally verified stable surfaces of Pt3Sn, namely Pt3Sn (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] , were investigated utilizing quantum mechanical calculations. The experimental studies showed that the order and composition of those Pt3Sn surface terminations are essentially bulklike. 3D models of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces were generated with all possible bulk terminations and CO adsorption properties were determined for all possible adsorption sites on these surfaces. Throughout the paper, stable adsorption is used to indicate an adsorbed CO molecule staying at the adsorption site; on the other hand, when a CO molecule moves from an adsorption site to the closest neighboring site, the term unstable adsorption is used. Besides the energy of adsorption, the position and the geometry of the adsorbed CO molecule were found for each adsorption site to determine whether the adsorption is stable. Aiming to determine the relative strengths of CO adsorption at the stable adsorption sites which show CO adsorption preferences, the adsorption energies were also calculated. In the simulations no restriction was imposed on CO molecular geometry. The same QM simulations were also performed for CO adsorption on monometallic Pt surfaces, i.e. Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(0 0 1).</p>

The literature provides extensive theoretical studies on CO adsorption on Pt and alloyed Pt surfaces, revealing differences between DFT predictions and experimental observations. It highlights discrepancies in the preferred adsorption sites, with DFT favoring hollow sites while experiments suggest the Pt-atop site. The study focuses on comparing CO adsorption properties on experimentally verified stable surfaces of Pt3Sn, generating 3D models of (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (0 0 1) surfaces to determine stable and unstable adsorption sites. The aim is to understand the relative strengths of CO adsorption at these sites and calculate adsorption energies without restricting CO molecular geometry. Simulations are also conducted for monometallic Pt surfaces to compare with Pt3Sn adsorption.

文献提供了对Pt和合金Pt表面上CO吸附的大量理论研究，揭示了DFT预测与实验观察之间的差异。它强调了在吸附位点上的偏好差异，DFT更倾向于空穴位点，而实验则倾向于Pt-atop位点。研究集中在比较实验验证的稳定Pt3Sn表面的CO吸附性质，生成（1 1 1），（1 1 0）和（0 0 1）表面的三维模型，以确定稳定的和不稳定的吸附位点。目的是理解这些位点上CO吸附相对强度，并在不限制CO分子几何形状的情况下计算吸附能。还进行了单金属Pt表面的模拟，以与Pt3Sn吸附进行比较。
