<p>The stringent environmental regulations and economic feasibility considerations impose design of catalysts having superior activity, selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>To reach this aggressive target, a widely accepted way is to start the design from molecular level [1], which needs detailed information on the properties of the possible active sites and their interactions with the reactants as well as with possible reaction intermediates.</p>
<p>CO oxidation has been of great interest in catalysis. Recently, preferential CO oxidation in H2-rich streams (PROX) has become crucially important in the efficient use of fuel processor-fuel cell systems, considering the pure hydrogen need of the fuel cell anode.</p>
<p>The presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams.</p>
<p>The adsorption energies for the Pt3Sn sites on which CO is stably adsorbed were compared with the adsorption energies of the similar sites of the corresponding monometallic Pt surfaces.</p>
<p>Aiming to understand the interactions between CO and the metal adsorption sites in detail, the local density of states (LDOS) profiles were produced for atop-Pt adsorption, both for the carbon end of CO for its adsorbed and free states, and for the Pt atom of the binding site.</p>
<p>The comparison of the LDOS profiles of Pt atoms of atop adsorption sites on the same faces of bare Pt3Sn and Pt surfaces showed the effect of alloying with Sn on the electronic properties of Pt atoms.</p>
<p>The study showed that (i) inclusion of a Sn atom at the adsorption site structure causes dramatic decrease in stability which limits the number of possible CO adsorption sites on Pt3Sn surface, (ii) the presence of Sn causes angles different from 180 for MCO orientation, (iii) the presence of Sn in the neighborhood of Pt on which CO is adsorbed causes superposition of the 5σ/1π derived-state peaks at the carbon end of CO and changes in adsorption energy of CO, (iv) Sn present beneath the adsorption site strengthens the CO adsorption, whereas neighboring Sn on the surface weakens it for all Pt3Sn surfaces tested and (v) the most stable site for CO adsorption is the atop-Pt site of the mixed atom termination of Pt3Sn(1 1 0).</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, play a significant role in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in industrial processes. They enhance activity, selectivity, and stability. Understanding the detailed properties of active sites and their interactions with reactants and intermediates is crucial for designing effective catalysts.

2. The presence of Pt3Sn in catalysts leads to a substantial change in the catalyst's performance under both hydrogen-free and hydrogen-rich conditions in CO oxidation reactions. This is because the Pt3Sn phase alters the electronic properties of the active sites, affecting the adsorption and activation of reactants.

3. Detailed quantum mechanical calculations were conducted to compare the adsorption properties of CO on Pt3Sn surfaces with those on pure Pt surfaces. This comparison provides insights into the influence of alloying on the catalytic activity and stability.

4. The local density of states (LDOS) profiles were utilized to investigate the interactions between CO and the metal adsorption sites on Pt3Sn surfaces. These profiles revealed the electronic changes occurring upon CO adsorption, including shifts in energy levels and alterations in the distribution of charge.

5. The effect of alloying on the electronic properties of Pt atoms was elucidated by comparing the LDOS profiles of Pt3Sn surfaces with those of pure Pt surfaces. This comparison highlighted the impact of Sn incorporation on the electronic structure of Pt.

6. The study concluded that the inclusion of Sn atoms in the Pt3Sn surface structure significantly reduces the stability of CO adsorption sites, limiting the number of possible adsorption locations. The presence of Sn also affects the orientation of MCO complexes and modifies the adsorption energy of CO. Furthermore, Sn beneath the adsorption site enhances CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn on the surface tends to weaken it. The most stable site for CO adsorption is identified as the atop-Pt site on the mixed atom termination of Pt3Sn(1 1 0).

1. 含有Pt的双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化等工业过程中扮演着重要角色。它们能显著提高活性、选择性和稳定性。深入了解活性位点及其与反应物和中间体的相互作用特性对于设计高效催化剂至关重要。

2. 在CO氧化反应中，含有Pt3Sn的催化剂在氢气存在与否的条件下都能表现出显著的性能变化。这是因为Pt3Sn相改变了活性位点的电子性质，影响了反应物的吸附和激活过程。

3. 对于Pt3Sn表面和纯Pt表面上的CO吸附性质进行了详细的量子机械计算比较。这种比较提供了合金化对催化活性和稳定性的影响的洞察。

4. 利用局部密度态（LDOS）图谱研究了CO与Pt3Sn表面金属吸附位点之间的相互作用。这些图谱揭示了CO吸附时电子结构的变化，包括能量水平的位移和电荷分布的改变。

5. 通过比较Pt3Sn表面和纯Pt表面的LDOS图谱，阐明了Sn掺杂对Pt原子电子性质的影响。比较结果显示，Sn的引入对Pt的电子结构产生了显著影响。

6. 研究结论指出，在Pt3Sn表面结构中加入Sn原子显著降低了CO吸附位点的稳定性，限制了可能的吸附位置数量。Sn的存在也影响了MCO复合物的取向，并修改了CO的吸附能。此外，位于吸附位点下方的Sn增强了CO吸附，而表面附近的Sn倾向于削弱它。最稳定的CO吸附位点被确定为混合原子终止的Pt3Sn(1 1 0)表面上的顶部-Pt位点。

<p>During geometry optimization both the top layer of the metal surface and the adsorbate molecule are relaxed and they reach a minimum energy configuration. Through the optimization studies it was found that at some adsorption sites on the Pt3Sn surface the CO molecule deviated significantly from the site region investigated. As an example, how CO adsorbed at a fourfold hollow site J of the mixed terminated Pt3Sn(1 1 0) moves upon adsorption to its equilibrium structure is given in Fig. 5 . The site is comprised of two Pt and two Sn atoms with a Pt atom in the second layer (top view).</p>
<p>As can be seen from the optimized geometry, the adsorbed CO molecule has moved significantly towards the Pt atoms and away from the Sn atoms; thereby approaching to the nearest stable (i.e. a long-bridge) position. The fourfold hollow site is clearly a site for unstable CO adsorption. The other unstable adsorption sites on the three Pt3Sn surfaces are marked with () in Table 4a . As seen form the simulation results, all of the sites including Sn atoms have proved unstable. This result is in agreement with the literature [11] ,[14] ,[25] .</p>

During the geometry optimization process, both the top layer of the metal surface and the adsorbate molecule were relaxed until they reached a state of minimum energy. In the optimization studies, it was found that at certain adsorption sites on the Pt3Sn surface, the CO molecule significantly deviated from the region under investigation. For instance, the movement of CO adsorbed at a fourfold hollow site J of the mixed terminated Pt3Sn(1 1 0) to its equilibrium structure is illustrated in Figure 5. The site consists of two Pt and two Sn atoms with a Pt atom in the second layer (top view). The optimized geometry shows that the adsorbed CO molecule moved significantly towards the Pt atoms and away from the Sn atoms, approaching the nearest stable (long-bridge) position. This site is clearly unstable for CO adsorption. All sites containing Sn atoms on the three Pt3Sn surfaces were found to be unstable, as per the simulation results, in accordance with previous literature [11], [14], [25].

在几何优化过程中，金属表面的顶层和吸附剂分子被放松到能量最低的状态。在优化研究中发现，在Pt3Sn表面上的某些吸附位点，CO分子偏离了研究区域。例如，图5展示了混合终止的Pt3Sn(1 1 0)上四面空位J处吸附的CO在吸附到其平衡结构时的移动情况。该位置由两个Pt和两个Sn原子组成，第二层有一个Pt原子（顶部视图）。优化后的几何形状显示，吸附的CO分子向Pt原子方向移动并远离Sn原子，接近最稳定的（长桥）位置。这个位置显然是不稳定的CO吸附位点。三个Pt3Sn表面上包含Sn原子的所有位点都被证明是不稳定的，这与模拟结果一致，符合先前文献[11]、[14]、[25]的记载。

<p>There are several theoretical studies published on CO adsorption on Pt and alloyed Pt surfaces [6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] . A DFT study on CO and atomic oxygen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) showed that the CO adsorption energies of the high symmetry sites on this surface are quite close [6] . It was found that when CO adsorption was studied on O-precovered surface, the most favorable CO adsorption site was found as the Pt-atop. Ge and King studied CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 0) surface and calculated the potential energy surface (PES) along . The results indicated an existence of an energy barrier of about 0.15 eV between atop and bridge sites [7] . One of the few studies carried out on CO adsorption on defect sites is by Hammer et al.

Though the computational studies are useful in understanding the CO-surface interaction, it should be kept in mind that some discrepencies may arise between experimental and theoretical results. For example, Feibelman et al. showed that there are discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results for CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) surface [11] . The preferred adsorption site within DFT is the hollow site whereas experimental studies showed that atop site is favored. Grinberg et al. showed that the discrepancies between the experimental and computational results are due to GGA treating different bond orders with varying accuracy and this is not only a problem for Pt surface but also on many other transition metal surfaces [12] .
