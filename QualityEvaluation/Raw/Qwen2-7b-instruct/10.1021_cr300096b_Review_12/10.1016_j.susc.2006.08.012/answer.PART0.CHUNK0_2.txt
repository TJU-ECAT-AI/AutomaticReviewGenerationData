<p>There are several theoretical studies published on CO adsorption on Pt and alloyed Pt surfaces [6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] . A DFT study on CO and atomic oxygen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) showed that the CO adsorption energies of the high symmetry sites on this surface are quite close [6] . It was found that when CO adsorption was studied on O-precovered surface, the most favorable CO adsorption site was found as the Pt-atop. Ge and King studied CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 0) surface and calculated the potential energy surface (PES) along . The results indicated an existence of an energy barrier of about 0.15 eV between atop and bridge sites [7] . One of the few studies carried out on CO adsorption on defect sites is by Hammer et al. [8] . The results showed extremely strong structure sensitivity of adsorption and this was explained by a model for the d-band center of Pt. Though the computational studies are useful in understanding the CO-surface interaction, it should be kept in mind that some discrepencies may arise between experimental and theoretical results. For example, Feibelman et al. showed that there are discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results for CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) surface [11] . The preferred adsorption site within DFT is the hollow site whereas experimental studies showed that atop site is favored. Grinberg et al. showed that the discrepancies between the experimental and computational results are due to GGA treating different bond orders with varying accuracy and this is not only a problem for Pt surface but also on many other transition metal surfaces [12] . In another work, Gil et al. [13] studied site preference of CO on Pt(1 1 1) and how the calculated adsorption energy changes with the models/parameters are used during the calculations.</p>

<p>Though there are many theoretical CO adsorption studies, none of them covers a one-to-one comparison of the possible adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces. To make this kind of a comparison, it is necessary to apply systematically the same assumptions in all simulations. In this study, the adsorption properties of CO on experimentally verified stable surfaces of Pt3Sn, namely Pt3Sn (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] , were investigated utilizing quantum mechanical calculations. The experimental studies showed that the order and composition of those Pt3Sn surface terminations are essentially bulklike. 3D models of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces were generated with all possible bulk terminations and CO adsorption properties were determined for all possible adsorption sites on these surfaces.</p>
<p>Comparison of the adsorption strengths for similar sites were made for the same CO surface coverages. The adsorption energies given in Table 5 belong to similar adsorption sites of Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surfaces. The 1.78 eV and 1.60 eV adsorption energies for Pt-atop adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1), respectively, show that the presence of Sn in the alloy structure leads to a decrease in the CO adsorption strength of Pt-atop adsorption.</p>
<p>The LDOS of C of adsorbed CO in bridge form on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1) clearly shows the enhanced electron density approximately 10 eV, which is 4σ-like orbital of C atom, when CO is adsorbed on the atop-Pt site of Pt3Sn(1 1 1).</p>

1. The document provides a detailed overview of various theoretical studies on CO adsorption on Pt and alloyed Pt surfaces, highlighting discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results. It emphasizes the importance of applying consistent assumptions in simulations to accurately compare adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces.

2. The study on CO adsorption on Pt3Sn surfaces demonstrates that the presence of Sn in the alloy structure leads to a decrease in CO adsorption strength, particularly for the Pt-atop adsorption site on Pt3Sn(1 1 1). The enhanced electron density near the C atom in the bridge form on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) suggests a stronger interaction between CO and the surface.

3. The document discusses the use of LDOS profiles to elucidate the electronic interactions during CO adsorption on Pt and Pt3Sn surfaces. It explains that the inclusion of Sn in the alloy affects the electronic structure of the surface, leading to changes in the adsorption properties.
