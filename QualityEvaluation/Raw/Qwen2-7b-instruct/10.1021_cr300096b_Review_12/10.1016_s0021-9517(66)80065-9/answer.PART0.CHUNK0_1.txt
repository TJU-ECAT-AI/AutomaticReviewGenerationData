[1] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1."
[2] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[3] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."
[4] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."
[5] "In other case, there is little doubt that the major reason for the difference in catalytic activity is the difference in the platinum surface area on the two supports."

The study investigates the impact of support materials on the dispersion of platinum and its catalytic activity, specifically in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene. The results indicate that the platinum is more dispersed on alumina than on silica-alumina, leading to a higher degree of dispersion and, consequently, increased catalytic activity for the alumina-supported catalyst. The study suggests that the primary reason for the difference in catalytic activity between the two supports is the difference in platinum surface area, although pore diffusion might limit the activity of the more active alumina-supported catalyst.

该研究探讨了支持材料对铂分散性和催化活性的影响，特别是在环己烷脱氢为苯的反应中。结果表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度高于硅酸盐氧化铝，导致更高的分散度和相应的催化活性。研究表明，两种支撑材料之间催化活性差异的主要原因是铂表面面积的不同，尽管活性较高的氧化铝支持催化剂可能受到孔扩散的限制。
