[1] "The chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum deposited on two different supports, alumina and silica-alumina, has been investigated to determine the effect of the support on the degree of dispersion of the platinum."
[2] "Measurements of the rate of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane were made to determine the corresponding effects on catalytic activity."
[3] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity meas-urements."
[4] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[5] "The higher activity of the platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater platinum dispersion."

The chemisorption and catalytic properties of supported platinum were studied on alumina and silica-alumina supports to determine their effect on the dispersion of platinum. The degree of dispersion was found to be higher on alumina than on silica-alumina. Higher activity of platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation was attributed to greater dispersion. Adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderate high surface coverage was exothermic, releasing around 7-8 kcal/mole. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times higher than that of the platinum on silica-alumina, suggesting a significant impact of the support on catalytic efficiency.

对负载在氧化铝和硅酸铝上的铂的化学吸附和催化性质进行了研究，以确定这些支持物对铂分散度的影响。发现铂在氧化铝上的分散度高于在硅酸铝上的分散度。在氧化铝上，铂的活性较高，用于环己烷脱氢反应，这归因于铂的更高分散度。在适度高表面覆盖度下，氢气在铂上的吸附是放热的，释放大约7-8 kcal/mole的能量。在氧化铝上的铂催化剂的活性约为在硅酸铝上的铂催化剂的六倍，这表明支持物对催化效率有显著影响。
