The chemisorption results showed that platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina compared to silica-alumina. Hydrogen adsorption on platinum at moderate high surface coverage on alumina catalysts was found to be exothermic, releasing energy equivalent to 7-8 kcal/mole. The platinum crystal size on alumina was significantly smaller (less than 10 Å) compared to silica-alumina (85 Å). The platinum-on-alumina catalyst demonstrated a higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, approximately six times higher than the catalyst on silica-alumina. These findings suggest that the support influenced the degree of platinum dispersion, affecting catalytic activity, but did not alter the intrinsic catalytic properties of the platinum. The difference in dispersion might be attributed to the lower concentration of metal used in the platinum case (2% vs. 10%).

化学吸附结果表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散度远高于二氧化硅-氧化铝。在铂催化剂上氢吸附达到中等高表面覆盖度时，释放的能量相当于每摩尔分子7-8 kcal。铂在氧化铝上的晶粒尺寸显著较小（小于10 Å），而二氧化硅-氧化铝上的晶粒尺寸为85 Å。铂-氧化铝催化剂在环己烷脱氢反应中的活性明显更高，大约是二氧化硅-氧化铝催化剂的六倍。这些发现表明，支持物影响了铂的分散度，从而影响了催化活性，但没有改变铂本身的内在催化性质。这种差异可能归因于铂所用金属浓度较低（2% vs. 10%）。

The study investigates the impact of support materials on the dispersion of platinum and its catalytic activity, specifically in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene. The results indicate that the platinum is more dispersed on alumina than on silica-alumina, leading to a higher degree of dispersion and, consequently, increased catalytic activity for the alumina-supported catalyst. The study suggests that the primary reason for the difference in catalytic activity between the two supports is the difference in platinum surface area, although pore diffusion might limit the activity of the more active alumina-supported catalyst.

The chemisorption and catalytic properties of supported platinum were studied on alumina and silica-alumina supports to determine their effect on the dispersion of platinum. The degree of dispersion was found to be higher on alumina than on silica-alumina. Higher activity of platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation was attributed to greater dispersion. Adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderate high surface coverage was exothermic, releasing around 7-8 kcal/mole. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times higher than that of the platinum on silica-alumina, suggesting a significant impact of the support on catalytic efficiency.

对负载在氧化铝和硅酸铝上的铂的化学吸附和催化性质进行了研究，以确定这些支持物对铂分散度的影响。发现铂在氧化铝上的分散度高于在硅酸铝上的分散度。在氧化铝上，铂的活性较高，用于环己烷脱氢反应，这归因于铂的更高分散度。在适度高表面覆盖度下，氢气在铂上的吸附是放热的，释放大约7-8 kcal/mole的能量。在氧化铝上的铂催化剂的活性约为在硅酸铝上的铂催化剂的六倍，这表明支持物对催化效率有显著影响。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts indicates that the dispersion of platinum on alumina is significantly higher than on silica-alumina. This enhanced dispersion leads to a more exothermic hydrogen adsorption process on the alumina-supported catalyst at a moderate surface coverage. Consequently, the catalytic activity of platinum over alumina is notably higher for cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared to silica-alumina, demonstrating that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion rather than its intrinsic catalytic properties. This suggests that the specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is largely unaffected by the support type.

氢在支持的铂催化剂上的化学吸附表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于硅酸铝。这种增强的分散导致了在中等表面覆盖度下，氧化铝支持催化剂上的氢吸附过程更加放热。因此，氧化铝支持的铂催化剂在环己烷脱氢化到苯的速度明显高于硅酸铝。这表明支持物影响了铂的分散度，而不是其固有催化性质。这表明铂对于环己烷脱氢化的特定催化活性主要不受支持类型的影响。

The chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts, particularly those deposited on alumina versus silica-alumina, indicates significant differences in dispersion and catalytic activity. The platinum is dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This is exemplified by the significantly higher rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation over the alumina-supported catalyst compared to the silica-alumina-supported catalyst. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderate surface coverage shows an exothermic process, contributing to the observed catalytic efficiency. These findings suggest that the support type notably affects the degree of dispersion and thus the catalytic activity of the platinum, highlighting the importance of support choice in optimizing catalyst performance.

在支持铂催化剂上氢的化学吸附，特别是在氧化铝和硅藻土氧化铝上的铂沉积，显示出显著的分散度和催化活性差异。铂在氧化铝上的分散程度更高，导致增强的催化性能。这通过氧化铝支持催化剂中环己烷脱氢化速率远高于硅藻土氧化铝支持催化剂的情况得到体现。在铂表面覆盖度适中的情况下，氢吸附表现出放热过程，有助于观察到的催化效率。这些发现表明，支持类型对铂的分散度以及由此产生的催化活性有重大影响，强调了在优化催化剂性能时选择支持的重要性。
