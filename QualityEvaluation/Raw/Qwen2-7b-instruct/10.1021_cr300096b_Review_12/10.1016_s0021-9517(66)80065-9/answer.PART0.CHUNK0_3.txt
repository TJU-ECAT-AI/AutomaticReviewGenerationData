<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts indicates that the dispersion of platinum on alumina is significantly higher than on silica-alumina. This enhanced dispersion leads to a more exothermic hydrogen adsorption process on the alumina-supported catalyst at a moderate surface coverage. Consequently, the catalytic activity of platinum over alumina is notably higher for cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared to silica-alumina, demonstrating that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion rather than its intrinsic catalytic properties. This suggests that the specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is largely unaffected by the support type.

氢在支持的铂催化剂上的化学吸附表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于硅酸铝。这种增强的分散导致了在中等表面覆盖度下，氧化铝支持催化剂上的氢吸附过程更加放热。因此，氧化铝支持的铂催化剂在环己烷脱氢化到苯的速度明显高于硅酸铝。这表明支持物影响了铂的分散度，而不是其固有催化性质。这表明铂对于环己烷脱氢化的特定催化活性主要不受支持类型的影响。
