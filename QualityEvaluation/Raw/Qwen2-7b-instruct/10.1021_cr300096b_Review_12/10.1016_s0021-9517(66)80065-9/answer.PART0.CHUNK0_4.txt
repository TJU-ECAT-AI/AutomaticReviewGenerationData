[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts."
[4] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[5] "Interpreting the results in a strict manner, one would conclude that the difference in catalytic activity of the platinum on the two supports was smaller than the difference in platinum surface area, since the platinum surface area on alumina was about 10 times higher than on silica-alumina."

The chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts, particularly those deposited on alumina versus silica-alumina, indicates significant differences in dispersion and catalytic activity. The platinum is dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This is exemplified by the significantly higher rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation over the alumina-supported catalyst compared to the silica-alumina-supported catalyst. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderate surface coverage shows an exothermic process, contributing to the observed catalytic efficiency. These findings suggest that the support type notably affects the degree of dispersion and thus the catalytic activity of the platinum, highlighting the importance of support choice in optimizing catalyst performance.

在支持铂催化剂上氢的化学吸附，特别是在氧化铝和硅藻土氧化铝上的铂沉积，显示出显著的分散度和催化活性差异。铂在氧化铝上的分散程度更高，导致增强的催化性能。这通过氧化铝支持催化剂中环己烷脱氢化速率远高于硅藻土氧化铝支持催化剂的情况得到体现。在铂表面覆盖度适中的情况下，氢吸附表现出放热过程，有助于观察到的催化效率。这些发现表明，支持类型对铂的分散度以及由此产生的催化活性有重大影响，强调了在优化催化剂性能时选择支持的重要性。
