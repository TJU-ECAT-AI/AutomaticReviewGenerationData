[1] "The Pt presence in Ni-based catalysts inhibits global carbon formation, in particular the CNTs. Moreover, Pt promotes the relative content of Ni0 and avoids Ni sintering."
[2] "The H2/CO ratios obtained are less than one; however, the PtNi nanocatalysts allow reduction in the selectivity for carbon and reach values closer to equilibrium at lower reaction temperatures."
[3] "With reference to catalysts stability, the bimetallic PtNi catalysts have a good performance in the DRM at 700 C, registering deviations less than 5% and 8% in the CO2 and CH4 conversions values, respectively."

The presence of Pt in Ni-based catalysts significantly impacts the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It inhibits global carbon formation, especially the formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Additionally, Pt promotes the reducibility of Ni, preventing Ni sintering. These catalysts exhibit improved selectivity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide, achieving values closer to equilibrium at lower temperatures. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts demonstrate excellent stability, with deviations in CO2 and CH4 conversion values of less than 5% and 8% respectively, at 700°C. This indicates that the Pt addition not only reduces carbon formation but also enhances the overall performance and stability of the catalysts, making them suitable for direct methane reforming applications.

在镍基催化剂中添加铂显著影响重整反应器研究中的CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化效率。它能抑制全局碳形成，尤其是碳纳米管(CNT)的形成。此外，铂促进Ni的可还原性，避免Ni烧结。这些催化剂显示出改善的氢和一氧化碳选择性，在较低温度下接近平衡值。铂镍双金属催化剂在700°C时表现出良好的稳定性，CO2和CH4转换值的偏差分别为小于5%和8%。这表明铂的添加不仅减少了碳形成，而且增强了催化剂的整体性能和稳定性，使它们适用于直接甲烷重整应用。

[1] "In addition, the H2/CO ratios obtained with the catalysts with high Pt content show a trend toward increasing with the temperature, while the H2/CO ratios registered with the catalysts with low Pt load tend to decrease after 600 C."
[2] "The high stability and low net carbon formation in the PtNi catalysts seem to be a cooperative effect of the support and the addition of Pt, where the support allows good activity levels and high metal dispersion and reducibility, while Pt addition enhances all these effects and inhibits carbon formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. High Pt content catalysts exhibit a rising H2/CO ratio with increasing temperature, whereas catalysts with low Pt content show a decline in the H2/CO ratio post 600°C.
2. The synergy of the support and Pt addition in PtNi catalysts results in enhanced stability and reduced net carbon formation. The support ensures optimal activity, high metal dispersion, and reducibility, while Pt boosts these properties and curbs carbon formation.

[1] "The effect of using an alumina with nanofibrous morphology as support for Ni-based catalysts, as well as the addition of different loads of Pt, was studied. The materials were characterized by conventional methods. The catalytic activity and stability were evaluated, for all the catalysts, under dry reforming conditions at steady state."
[2] "The conversion values of CH4 and CO2, registered in the temperature range studied, are presented in Fig. 9, as well as the equilibrium conversions calculated, considering simultaneous CO2CH4 reforming and reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) at the reactivity test conditions (atmospheric pressure and CH4/CO2/He = 20/20/60)."
[3] "It can be inferred that there is a synergic effect of the metals involved, where the PtNi catalysts tend to imitate the behavior of the Pt monometallic catalyst. For the catalyst with the lowest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/100) the activity is slightly improved and the carbon formation reduced with respect to the 4Ni/Al2O3(N) catalysts. Moreover, for the catalysts with the highest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/10) the conversions values are higher than those of the Pt/Al2O3(N) catalyst and the net carbon formation is almost the same."
[4] "Activity and stability results show that the nanostructured PtNi catalysts might be successful catalysts with high selectivity for DRM and low selectivity toward inactive coke. Moreover, this fundamental study suggests that there is an optimum particle size and distribution of the active metal in the DRM, which will provide the best performance, the highest stability, the lowest carbon net formation and the best selectivity toward H2 and CO."

The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The presence of Pt in Ni-based catalysts inhibits global carbon formation, especially the formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Additionally, Pt promotes the relative content of Ni0 particles, thereby avoiding the encapsulation of Ni active sites by carbon. This leads to improved activity and selectivity toward hydrogen and carbon monoxide compared to monometallic Ni catalysts. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to optimized catalyst designs for enhanced performance and stability in the dry reforming of methane (DRM).

文献讨论了铂基双金属催化剂如何影响重整反应中的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化过程。在镍基催化剂中添加铂可以抑制全球碳生成，特别是碳纳米管（CNT）的生成。此外，铂促进了镍0颗粒含量的增加，避免了镍活性位点被碳封装，从而提高了与氢气和一氧化碳选择性相关的活动性和稳定性，与单一镍催化剂相比。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以为模型表面和负载催化剂提供有价值的信息，有助于理解这些发现，并可能促进优化设计以提高干重整甲烷(DRM)性能和稳定性。
