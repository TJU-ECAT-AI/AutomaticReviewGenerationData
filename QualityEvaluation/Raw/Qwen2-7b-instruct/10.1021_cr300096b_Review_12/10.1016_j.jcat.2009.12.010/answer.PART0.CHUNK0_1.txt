[1] "The Pt presence in Ni-based catalysts inhibits global carbon formation, in particular the CNTs. Moreover, Pt promotes the relative content of Ni0 and avoids Ni sintering."
[2] "The H2/CO ratios obtained are less than one; however, the PtNi nanocatalysts allow reduction in the selectivity for carbon and reach values closer to equilibrium at lower reaction temperatures."
[3] "With reference to catalysts stability, the bimetallic PtNi catalysts have a good performance in the DRM at 700 C, registering deviations less than 5% and 8% in the CO2 and CH4 conversions values, respectively."

The presence of Pt in Ni-based catalysts significantly impacts the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It inhibits global carbon formation, especially the formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Additionally, Pt promotes the reducibility of Ni, preventing Ni sintering. These catalysts exhibit improved selectivity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide, achieving values closer to equilibrium at lower temperatures. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts demonstrate excellent stability, with deviations in CO2 and CH4 conversion values of less than 5% and 8% respectively, at 700°C. This indicates that the Pt addition not only reduces carbon formation but also enhances the overall performance and stability of the catalysts, making them suitable for direct methane reforming applications.

在镍基催化剂中添加铂显著影响重整反应器研究中的CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化效率。它能抑制全局碳形成，尤其是碳纳米管(CNT)的形成。此外，铂促进Ni的可还原性，避免Ni烧结。这些催化剂显示出改善的氢和一氧化碳选择性，在较低温度下接近平衡值。铂镍双金属催化剂在700°C时表现出良好的稳定性，CO2和CH4转换值的偏差分别为小于5%和8%。这表明铂的添加不仅减少了碳形成，而且增强了催化剂的整体性能和稳定性，使它们适用于直接甲烷重整应用。
