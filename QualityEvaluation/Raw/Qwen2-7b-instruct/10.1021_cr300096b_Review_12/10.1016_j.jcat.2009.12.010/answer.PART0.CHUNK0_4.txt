[1] "The Pt presence in Ni-based catalysts inhibits global carbon formation, in particular the CNTs. Moreover, Pt promotes the relative content of Ni0 and avoids Ni sintering."
[2] "The H2/CO ratios obtained are less than one; however, the PtNi nanocatalysts allow reduction in the selectivity for carbon and reach values closer to equilibrium at lower reaction temperatures."
[3] "With reference to catalysts stability, the bimetallic PtNi catalysts have a good performance in the DRM at 700 C, registering deviations less than 5% and 8% in the CO2 and CH4 conversions values, respectively."

1. The presence of Pt in Ni-based catalysts reduces the formation of carbon, particularly CNTs. It also increases the content of Ni0 and prevents Ni from aggregating or sintering.
2. PtNi nanocatalysts decrease the selectivity towards carbon, allowing H2/CO ratios closer to equilibrium at lower reaction temperatures compared to other catalysts.
3. Bimetallic PtNi catalysts exhibit excellent stability in the DRM process at 700°C, with deviations of less than 5% and 8% in CO2 and CH4 conversion values, respectively.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在Ni基催化剂中添加Pt可以减少碳的生成，特别是CNT。它还可以增加Ni0的含量，并防止Ni的聚集或烧结。
2. PtNi纳米催化剂降低了对碳的选择性，使H2/CO比在较低反应温度下接近平衡值，与其它催化剂相比。
3. 双金属PtNi催化剂在700°C下的DRM过程表现出良好的稳定性，CO2和CH4转化率的偏差分别小于5%和8%。
