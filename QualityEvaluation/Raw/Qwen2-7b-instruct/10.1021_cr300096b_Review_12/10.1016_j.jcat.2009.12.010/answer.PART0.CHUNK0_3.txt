[1] "The effect of using an alumina with nanofibrous morphology as support for Ni-based catalysts, as well as the addition of different loads of Pt, was studied. The materials were characterized by conventional methods. The catalytic activity and stability were evaluated, for all the catalysts, under dry reforming conditions at steady state."
[2] "The conversion values of CH4 and CO2, registered in the temperature range studied, are presented in Fig. 9, as well as the equilibrium conversions calculated, considering simultaneous CO2CH4 reforming and reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) at the reactivity test conditions (atmospheric pressure and CH4/CO2/He = 20/20/60)."
[3] "It can be inferred that there is a synergic effect of the metals involved, where the PtNi catalysts tend to imitate the behavior of the Pt monometallic catalyst. For the catalyst with the lowest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/100) the activity is slightly improved and the carbon formation reduced with respect to the 4Ni/Al2O3(N) catalysts. Moreover, for the catalysts with the highest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/10) the conversions values are higher than those of the Pt/Al2O3(N) catalyst and the net carbon formation is almost the same."
[4] "Activity and stability results show that the nanostructured PtNi catalysts might be successful catalysts with high selectivity for DRM and low selectivity toward inactive coke. Moreover, this fundamental study suggests that there is an optimum particle size and distribution of the active metal in the DRM, which will provide the best performance, the highest stability, the lowest carbon net formation and the best selectivity toward H2 and CO."

The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The presence of Pt in Ni-based catalysts inhibits global carbon formation, especially the formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Additionally, Pt promotes the relative content of Ni0 particles, thereby avoiding the encapsulation of Ni active sites by carbon. This leads to improved activity and selectivity toward hydrogen and carbon monoxide compared to monometallic Ni catalysts. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to optimized catalyst designs for enhanced performance and stability in the dry reforming of methane (DRM).

文献讨论了铂基双金属催化剂如何影响重整反应中的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化过程。在镍基催化剂中添加铂可以抑制全球碳生成，特别是碳纳米管（CNT）的生成。此外，铂促进了镍0颗粒含量的增加，避免了镍活性位点被碳封装，从而提高了与氢气和一氧化碳选择性相关的活动性和稳定性，与单一镍催化剂相比。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以为模型表面和负载催化剂提供有价值的信息，有助于理解这些发现，并可能促进优化设计以提高干重整甲烷(DRM)性能和稳定性。
