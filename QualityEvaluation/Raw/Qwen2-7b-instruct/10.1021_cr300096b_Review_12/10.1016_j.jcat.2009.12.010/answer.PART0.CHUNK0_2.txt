[1] "In addition, the H2/CO ratios obtained with the catalysts with high Pt content show a trend toward increasing with the temperature, while the H2/CO ratios registered with the catalysts with low Pt load tend to decrease after 600 C."
[2] "The high stability and low net carbon formation in the PtNi catalysts seem to be a cooperative effect of the support and the addition of Pt, where the support allows good activity levels and high metal dispersion and reducibility, while Pt addition enhances all these effects and inhibits carbon formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. High Pt content catalysts exhibit a rising H2/CO ratio with increasing temperature, whereas catalysts with low Pt content show a decline in the H2/CO ratio post 600°C.
2. The synergy of the support and Pt addition in PtNi catalysts results in enhanced stability and reduced net carbon formation. The support ensures optimal activity, high metal dispersion, and reducibility, while Pt boosts these properties and curbs carbon formation.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 高Pt含量催化剂随温度升高，H2/CO比值增加，而低Pt含量催化剂在600°C后H2/CO比值下降。
2. PtNi催化剂中支持物和Pt添加的协同作用导致了高稳定性与低净碳生成。支持物确保了最佳活性、高金属分散性和可还原性，而Pt增强了这些特性并抑制了碳生成。
