[1] "Among the CeO2 supported noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity for this reaction."
[2] "Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the PtPd have been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 support and exhibited high activity at comparatively low temperatures."
[3] "The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and selectivity."
[4] "The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO."
[5] "The main objectives of the present work are to investigate the catalytic activity of PtPd/CeO2 for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich stream and its activity in the presence of CO2 and H2O."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, showed enhanced activity in CO oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, and water gas shift reactions compared to palladium-based catalysts. The addition of water vapor led to a decrease in activation energy, boosting the conversion rates of both CO and hydrogen. Conversely, an increase in CO2 concentration negatively impacted CO conversion and selectivity. These findings suggest that bimetallic Pt-based catalysts could offer improved efficiency in fuel processing systems. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could correlate these observations with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces pose challenges in fully understanding the catalyst behavior.

铂基双金属催化剂在CO氧化、氢氧化和水煤气变换反应中显示出比钯基催化剂更高的活性。水蒸气的添加降低了活化能，提高了CO和氢的转化率。相反，二氧化碳浓度的增加降低了CO的转化率和选择性。这些发现表明，铂基双金属催化剂可能在燃料加工系统中提供更高效的性能。未来在超高真空(UHV)条件下对Pt基双金属表面的研究可以与模型表面和负载催化剂相结合，提供更深入的理解机制。然而，当前在UHV条件下对Pt基双金属表面的限制性挑战了全面理解催化剂行为的可能性。

To understand how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and to gain potential insights for future UHV studies correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, consider the following:

1. The study aimed to evaluate the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams and their activity in the presence of CO2 and H2O. The primary focus was on understanding how these catalysts interact with the reactants and the effects of various conditions on their performance.

2. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream significantly improved the catalytic activity of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts. It lowered the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation, leading to increased conversion and selectivity in CO oxidation processes.

3. Conversely, the presence of CO2 in the feed stream negatively impacted the catalytic performance of the PtPd/CeO2 catalysts. The CO2 concentration reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO, potentially through reverse water gas shift reactions or the formation of carbonate species on the catalyst surface.

4. The study's stability tests demonstrated the high stability of the PtPd/CeO2 catalyst at a reaction temperature of 90°C for 24 hours. This suggests that the catalysts are robust under the conditions tested, which is essential for practical applications in fuel cell systems.

Future UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies could provide deeper insights into the surface chemistry and interactions of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. These studies might help correlate the observed phenomena at the atomic level, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts with optimized properties. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could hinder direct correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts, necessitating innovative approaches to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic observations.

为了理解双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基催化剂对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响，并为未来UHV（超高真空）研究提供与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的潜在见解，可以考虑以下几点：

1. 研究旨在评估CeO2支持的PtPd催化剂在富氢流中选择性CO氧化的催化活性及其在CO2和H2O存在的条件下的活性。主要关注这些催化剂与反应物的相互作用以及各种条件对其性能的影响。

2. 向进料流中添加水蒸气显著提高了PtPd/CeO2催化剂的催化活性。它降低了CO氧化和氢氧化的活化能，导致CO氧化过程中的转化率和选择性增加。

3. 相反，进料流中的CO2浓度对PtPd/CeO2催化剂的活性产生了负面影响。CO2浓度降低了CO的转化率和选择性，可能通过逆向水煤气变换反应或催化剂表面形成碳酸盐物种。

4. 稳定性测试显示，在90°C下运行24小时后，PtPd/CeO2催化剂表现出很高的稳定性。这表明在测试条件下，催化剂具有良好的耐久性，这对于燃料电池系统等实际应用至关重要。

未来的UHV研究可以提供关于Pt基双金属催化剂表面化学和相互作用的深入见解。这些研究可能有助于在原子级别上关联观察到的现象，从而促进开发更高效的催化剂，其具有优化的特性。然而，当前在UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的限制可能阻碍直接与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，需要创新方法来弥合微观和宏观观测之间的差距。

To understand the impact of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, we can examine the provided quotes. The 1% (1:7) PtPd/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated superior activity in CO oxidation. Water vapor significantly enhanced the catalyst's performance, while CO2 had the opposite effect. The presence of both water vapor and CO2 led to a notable improvement in both CO conversion and selectivity. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into the correlation between these findings and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies on Pt surfaces exist.
