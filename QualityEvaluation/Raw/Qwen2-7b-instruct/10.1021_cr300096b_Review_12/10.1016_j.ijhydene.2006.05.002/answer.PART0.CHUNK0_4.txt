[1] "The experimental results showed that 1% (1:7) PtPd/CeO2 (solgel) exhibited higher activity than other catalysts examined."
[2] "Water vapor in the feed substantially increased the activity of the catalysts, whereas CO2 in the feed stream drastically decreased the activity of the catalysts."
[3] "When both H2O and CO2 were added in the feed stream, the positive effect of H2O is more pronounced than the negative effect of CO2."
[4] "The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and selectivity."
[5] "The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO."

To understand the impact of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, we can examine the provided quotes. The 1% (1:7) PtPd/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated superior activity in CO oxidation. Water vapor significantly enhanced the catalyst's performance, while CO2 had the opposite effect. The presence of both water vapor and CO2 led to a notable improvement in both CO conversion and selectivity. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into the correlation between these findings and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies on Pt surfaces exist.

为了理解双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响，我们可以参考提供的引文。1%（1：7）PtPd/CeO2催化剂在CO氧化方面表现出较高的活性。水蒸气显著提高了催化剂的性能，而CO2则产生了相反的效果。水蒸气和CO2的共存导致了CO转化率和选择性的显著提高。对于Pt基双金属表面的未来超高真空(UHV)研究，可以提供这些发现与负载催化剂之间的关联的见解，尽管当前在UHV研究中存在Pt表面的限制。
