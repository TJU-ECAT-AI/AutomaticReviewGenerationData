[1] "Among the CeO2 supported noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity for this reaction."
[2] "Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the PtPd have been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 support and exhibited high activity at comparatively low temperatures."
[3] "The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and selectivity."
[4] "The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO."
[5] "The main objectives of the present work are to investigate the catalytic activity of PtPd/CeO2 for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich stream and its activity in the presence of CO2 and H2O."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, showed enhanced activity in CO oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, and water gas shift reactions compared to palladium-based catalysts. The addition of water vapor led to a decrease in activation energy, boosting the conversion rates of both CO and hydrogen. Conversely, an increase in CO2 concentration negatively impacted CO conversion and selectivity. These findings suggest that bimetallic Pt-based catalysts could offer improved efficiency in fuel processing systems. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could correlate these observations with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces pose challenges in fully understanding the catalyst behavior.

铂基双金属催化剂在CO氧化、氢氧化和水煤气变换反应中显示出比钯基催化剂更高的活性。水蒸气的添加降低了活化能，提高了CO和氢的转化率。相反，二氧化碳浓度的增加降低了CO的转化率和选择性。这些发现表明，铂基双金属催化剂可能在燃料加工系统中提供更高效的性能。未来在超高真空(UHV)条件下对Pt基双金属表面的研究可以与模型表面和负载催化剂相结合，提供更深入的理解机制。然而，当前在UHV条件下对Pt基双金属表面的限制性挑战了全面理解催化剂行为的可能性。
