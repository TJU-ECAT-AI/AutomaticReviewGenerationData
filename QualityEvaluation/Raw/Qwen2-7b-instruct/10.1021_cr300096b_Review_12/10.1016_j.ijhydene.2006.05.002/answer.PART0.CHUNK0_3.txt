[1] "Among the CeO2 supported noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity for this reaction."
[2] "Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the PtPd have been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 sup- port and exhibited high activity at comparatively low temperatures."
[3] "The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and selectivity."
[4] "The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO."
[5] "Our stability results of PtPd/CeO2 catalyst at the re- action temperature of 90 C during 24 h showed the high stability of this catalyst."

1. The Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity in the selective CO oxidation reaction compared to other CeO2-supported noble metals. 
2. The PtPd/CeO2 catalyst was found to exhibit high activity at lower temperatures, unlike the Pd/CeO2 catalyst.
3. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream improved the conversion and selectivity of CO oxidation by reducing the activation energies of both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation.
4. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO oxidation. 
5. The PtPd/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated high stability when operated at 90°C for 24 hours.

1. Pd/CeO2催化剂在选择性CO氧化反应中的活性较差，与其他CeO2支持的贵金属相比。
2. PtPd/CeO2催化剂在较低温度下表现出高活性，与Pd/CeO2催化剂不同。
3. 向进料中添加水蒸气显著提高了CO氧化的转化率和选择性，通过降低CO氧化和氢氧化的活化能。
4. 进料流中CO2的存在降低了CO氧化的转化率和选择性。  
5. 在90°C运行24小时时，PtPd/CeO2催化剂表现出高稳定性。
