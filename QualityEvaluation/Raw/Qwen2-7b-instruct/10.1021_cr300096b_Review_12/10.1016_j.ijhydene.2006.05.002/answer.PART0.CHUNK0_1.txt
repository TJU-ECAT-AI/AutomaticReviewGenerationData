[1] "Among the CeO2 supported noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity for this reaction."
[2] "Using bimetallic system is an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as electronic effect/geometry effect."
[3] "Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the PtPd have been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 support and exhibited high activity at comparatively low temperatures."
[4] "The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and selectivity."
[5] "The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO."
[6] "However, multi-stage reactor is needed to lower the CO concentration below 10100 ppm for PEMFC systems."

1. The Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed low activity for CO oxidation compared to other CeO2-supported noble metals.
2. Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced properties and synergistic effects through electronic and geometric interactions.
3. The PtPd catalyst demonstrated high activity at lower temperatures than the Pd/CeO2 counterpart.
4. Water vapor in the feedstream significantly improved the CO oxidation reaction, reducing activation energy and increasing conversion and selectivity.
5. CO2 in the feedstream negatively impacted CO conversion and selectivity in the temperature range of 50 to 190°C.
6. To achieve the required CO concentration for PEMFC systems below 10-100 ppm, a multi-stage reactor is necessary.

1. Pd/CeO2催化剂在CO氧化反应中的活性较低，与其他CeO2支持的贵金属相比。
2. 双金属催化剂通过电子效应和几何效应提供了增强的特性和协同效应。
3. PtPd催化剂在低温下表现出比Pd/CeO2更高的活性。
4. 在进料流中添加水蒸汽显著改善了CO氧化反应，降低了活化能并提高了转化率和选择性。
5. 在50至190°C的温度范围内，增加CO2浓度降低了CO的转化率和选择性。
6. 为了实现PEMFC系统所需的CO浓度低于10-100 ppm，需要多级反应器。
