[1] "We synthesized a ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalyst by depositing platinum and rhodium atoms on carbon-supported tin dioxide nanoparticles that is capable of oxidizing ethanol with high efficiency and holds great promise for resolving the impediments to developing practical direct ethanol fuel cells."
[2] "Our experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the electrocatalysts activity is due to the specific property of each of its constituents, induced by their interactions."
[3] "The Tafel slope of 120mV can be obtained from that plot, indicating that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The obtained Ptmetal and Rhmetal coordination numbers NPtM=NPtPt+NPtRh and NRhM=NRhRh+NRhPt have similar values (9.50.8 and 10.80.8, respectively), consistent with homogeneous distribution of Pt and Rh throughout the particles."
[5] "The splitting of the CC bond does not occur through the pathway involving acetaldehyde. Its negligible coverage, and the evidence of CO involvement in the reaction, means that this catalyst facilitates a direct splitting of the CC bond, substantiated by our DFT calculations."
[6] "In PtRu, it efficiently oxidizes CO in methanol oxidation. The last reaction cannot be accomplished by the metallic-like Rh in PtRh/SnO2."

The ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalyst synthesized in the study shows high efficiency in oxidizing ethanol, with the mechanism involving interactions between its components. Density functional theory calculations support the findings, indicating that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step. The homogeneous distribution of platinum and rhodium throughout the particles is confirmed by coordination numbers. The catalyst facilitates a direct splitting of the carbon-carbon bond in ethanol, bypassing the acetaldehyde pathway, and this is substantiated by the DFT calculations. In contrast to PtRu, the metallic-like rhodium in PtRh/SnO2 does not efficiently oxidize CO in methanol oxidation.

研究中合成的三元PtRhSnO2/C催化剂在氧化乙醇方面表现出高效性，其机制涉及各组分之间的相互作用。密度泛函理论计算支持这一发现，表明首次电荷转移是决定性步骤。通过配位数确认铂和铑在整个粒子中的均匀分布。该催化剂直接裂解乙醇中的碳-碳键，避免了乙醛途径，并通过DFT计算得到证实。与PtRu相比，在PtRh/SnO2中，类似金属的铑不能有效地氧化甲醇中的CO。
