The synthesis of the ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalyst enables efficient oxidation of ethanol to CO2 at room temperature, overcoming the inefficiency of existing catalysts at extreme potentials. The catalytic activity stems from the synergistic properties of each constituent, influenced by their interactions. The Tafel slope of 120mV suggests that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step. Hydroxyl groups (OH) on the SnO2 surface induce shifts in the surface oxidation of Rh and Pt, forming Rh or PtOH species. In situ infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) identifies intermediates and products of ethanol oxidation, supporting the direct cleavage of the CC bond. The PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst facilitates this cleavage without the intermediate formation of acetaldehyde, as evidenced by the absence of CO bands in the IR spectra. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the formation of oxametallacyclic conformations, which enable the direct cleavage of the CC bond with a reasonable barrier.

The high activity of PtRu in methanol oxidation contrasts with the lack thereof in ethanol oxidation due to Ru's tendency to form RuOH upon interaction with H2O at positive potentials. This reaction cannot occur on the PtRh/SnO2 surface, where SnO2 with H2O provides OH species to oxidize the dissociated CO at Rh sites, and Pt facilitates ethanol dehydrogenation. This modification of the electronic structure of Rh enhances its bonding to ethanol, intermediates, and products, promoting CC bond breaking and ethanol oxidation. The DFT calculations further elucidate the mechanism of ethanol oxidation on the PtRh/SnO2 surface, emphasizing the role of oxametallacyclic conformations in achieving the direct cleavage of the CC bond.

通过合成三元PtRhSnO2/C催化剂，实现了室温下高效氧化乙醇生成CO2，克服了现有催化剂在极端电位下的低效率。催化活性来源于各组分的协同特性及其相互作用。塔菲尔斜率为120mV，表明第一步电荷转移是决定速率的步骤。水溶液中的羟基（OH）在SnO2表面引起Rh和Pt表面氧化状态的偏移，形成Rh或PtOH物种。原位红外反射吸收光谱（IRRAS）确定了乙醇氧化过程中的中间体和产物，支持了直接断裂CC键的过程。PtRhSnO2催化剂通过避免形成乙醛中间体，直接裂解CC键，如IR光谱中未检测到CO峰所示。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算确认了形成氧杂金属环状结构，这使得在合理势垒下实现直接断裂CC键成为可能。

PtRu在甲醇氧化中的高活性与乙醇氧化中缺乏活性形成了对比，这是由于Ru在正电位下与H2O反应形成RuOH的倾向。这种反应在PtRh/SnO2表面无法发生，其中SnO2与水结合提供OH物种以氧化脱附的CO在Rh位点，并且Pt促进乙醇脱氢。这修改了Rh的电子结构，增强了其与乙醇、中间体和产品的结合能力，促进了CC键断裂并加速了乙醇氧化。DFT计算进一步阐明了PtRh/SnO2表面乙醇氧化的机制，强调了氧杂金属环状结构在直接断裂CC键过程中的作用。
