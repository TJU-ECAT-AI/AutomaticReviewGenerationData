[1] "Our experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the electrocatalysts activity is due to the specific property of each of its constituents, induced by their interactions."
[2] "The Tafel slope of 120mV can be obtained from that plot, indicating that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step."
[3] "The absolute values of these coordination numbers indicate the same size range (13nm) as obtained by TEM (see Supplementary Information, S2)."
[4] "This electrocatalyst effectively splits the CC bond in ethanol at room temperature in acid solutions, facilitating its oxidation at low potentials to CO2, which has not been achieved with existing catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is capable of oxidizing ethanol to CO2 efficiently due to the synergistic effects of its components—platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide—which interact with each other. The first charge transfer is the rate-determining step, as indicated by a Tafel slope of 120mV. The coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS spectroscopy show that the nanoparticles have a size range of approximately 13nm, in good agreement with TEM analysis. This electrocatalyst uniquely splits the CC bond in ethanol at room temperature, enabling its efficient conversion to CO2 at low potentials—a feat not accomplished by existing catalysts.

该三元PtRhSnO2电催化剂能够高效氧化乙醇至CO2，这是由于其成分——铂、铑和二氧化锡——之间的协同作用。首次电荷转移是决定性步骤，根据120mV的塔菲尔斜率可得知。EXAFS光谱分析得出的配位数显示，纳米粒子的大小范围约为13nm，与透射电子显微镜分析的结果一致。这种电催化剂能够在室温下有效地分裂乙醇中的CC键，使其在低电位下转化为CO2，这是现有催化剂所无法实现的。

[1] "Replacing expensive Rh should be sought in designing bimetallic and near-surface alloys that can provide adsorption and surface oxidation properties close to those of Rh."
[2] "The DFT calculations demonstrated that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 proceeds through oxametallacyclic conformation that facilitates the direct cleavage of the CC bond at a reasonable rate."
[3] "The high activity of PtRu for methanol oxidation and the lack of it for ethanol oxidation seems to be due to a high propensity of Ru to form RuOH in interaction with H2O at potentials E>0V (ref. 25)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In designing bimetallic and near-surface alloys, efforts should be made to substitute expensive rhodium with materials that offer adsorption and surface oxidation characteristics similar to those of rhodium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 occurs via an oxametallacyclic conformation, which enables a reasonable rate of direct cleavage of the CC bond. The superior activity of platinum-ruthenium in methanol oxidation compared to ethanol oxidation might stem from ruthenium's high tendency to form RuOH upon interaction with water at potentials greater than 0V, a reaction that cannot be suppressed in the presence of SnOH as it is with weakly bound RhOH.

在设计双金属和表面合金时，应致力于用能提供接近铑的吸附和表面氧化性质的材料来替换昂贵的铑。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，乙醇在PtRh/SnO2上的氧化通过一个氧胺金属环结构进行，这使得直接切割CC键以合理速率成为可能。铂-钌在甲醇氧化中的高活性与乙醇氧化中缺乏活性可能归因于钌在水合大于0V时形成RuOH的高倾向，这一反应在SnOH存在的情况下不能被抑制，而这是弱结合的RhOH所不具备的特性。

The synthesis of the ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalyst enables efficient oxidation of ethanol to CO2 at room temperature, overcoming the inefficiency of existing catalysts at extreme potentials. The catalytic activity stems from the synergistic properties of each constituent, influenced by their interactions. The Tafel slope of 120mV suggests that the first charge transfer is the rate-determining step. Hydroxyl groups (OH) on the SnO2 surface induce shifts in the surface oxidation of Rh and Pt, forming Rh or PtOH species. In situ infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) identifies intermediates and products of ethanol oxidation, supporting the direct cleavage of the CC bond. The PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst facilitates this cleavage without the intermediate formation of acetaldehyde, as evidenced by the absence of CO bands in the IR spectra. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the formation of oxametallacyclic conformations, which enable the direct cleavage of the CC bond with a reasonable barrier.

The high activity of PtRu in methanol oxidation contrasts with the lack thereof in ethanol oxidation due to Ru's tendency to form RuOH upon interaction with H2O at positive potentials. This reaction cannot occur on the PtRh/SnO2 surface, where SnO2 with H2O provides OH species to oxidize the dissociated CO at Rh sites, and Pt facilitates ethanol dehydrogenation. This modification of the electronic structure of Rh enhances its bonding to ethanol, intermediates, and products, promoting CC bond breaking and ethanol oxidation. The DFT calculations further elucidate the mechanism of ethanol oxidation on the PtRh/SnO2 surface, emphasizing the role of oxametallacyclic conformations in achieving the direct cleavage of the CC bond.

通过合成三元PtRhSnO2/C催化剂，实现了室温下高效氧化乙醇生成CO2，克服了现有催化剂在极端电位下的低效率。催化活性来源于各组分的协同特性及其相互作用。塔菲尔斜率为120mV，表明第一步电荷转移是决定速率的步骤。水溶液中的羟基（OH）在SnO2表面引起Rh和Pt表面氧化状态的偏移，形成Rh或PtOH物种。原位红外反射吸收光谱（IRRAS）确定了乙醇氧化过程中的中间体和产物，支持了直接断裂CC键的过程。PtRhSnO2催化剂通过避免形成乙醛中间体，直接裂解CC键，如IR光谱中未检测到CO峰所示。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算确认了形成氧杂金属环状结构，这使得在合理势垒下实现直接断裂CC键成为可能。

PtRu在甲醇氧化中的高活性与乙醇氧化中缺乏活性形成了对比，这是由于Ru在正电位下与H2O反应形成RuOH的倾向。这种反应在PtRh/SnO2表面无法发生，其中SnO2与水结合提供OH物种以氧化脱附的CO在Rh位点，并且Pt促进乙醇脱氢。这修改了Rh的电子结构，增强了其与乙醇、中间体和产品的结合能力，促进了CC键断裂并加速了乙醇氧化。DFT计算进一步阐明了PtRh/SnO2表面乙醇氧化的机制，强调了氧杂金属环状结构在直接断裂CC键过程中的作用。

The catalyst is designed to overcome the challenges faced by conventional electrocatalysts in oxidizing ethanol at moderate potentials, which are unsuitable for direct ethanol fuel cells. The authors report that the activity of the PtRhSnO2 catalyst is due to the synergistic effects of its components, specifically how they interact with each other. The study also explains the contrasting activities of PtRu in methanol oxidation and ethanol oxidation, pointing to the importance of specific interactions in achieving efficient catalysis.

The researchers suggest that designing bimetallic and near-surface alloys could lead to catalysts with similar properties to Rh but at a lower cost.

This work could potentially inform future studies on bimetallic catalysts by highlighting the importance of interaction dynamics between metals and their substrates in achieving high catalytic efficiency. It may also inspire new approaches to designing catalysts for various reactions, including CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions, by understanding how specific interactions influence catalytic behavior.
