The ternary PtRhSnO2 electrocatalyst is capable of oxidizing ethanol to CO2 efficiently due to the synergistic effects of its components—platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide—which interact with each other. The first charge transfer is the rate-determining step, as indicated by a Tafel slope of 120mV. The coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS spectroscopy show that the nanoparticles have a size range of approximately 13nm, in good agreement with TEM analysis. This electrocatalyst uniquely splits the CC bond in ethanol at room temperature, enabling its efficient conversion to CO2 at low potentials—a feat not accomplished by existing catalysts.

该三元PtRhSnO2电催化剂能够高效氧化乙醇至CO2，这是由于其成分——铂、铑和二氧化锡——之间的协同作用。首次电荷转移是决定性步骤，根据120mV的塔菲尔斜率可得知。EXAFS光谱分析得出的配位数显示，纳米粒子的大小范围约为13nm，与透射电子显微镜分析的结果一致。这种电催化剂能够在室温下有效地分裂乙醇中的CC键，使其在低电位下转化为CO2，这是现有催化剂所无法实现的。

[1] "Replacing expensive Rh should be sought in designing bimetallic and near-surface alloys that can provide adsorption and surface oxidation properties close to those of Rh."
[2] "The DFT calculations demonstrated that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 proceeds through oxametallacyclic conformation that facilitates the direct cleavage of the CC bond at a reasonable rate."
[3] "The high activity of PtRu for methanol oxidation and the lack of it for ethanol oxidation seems to be due to a high propensity of Ru to form RuOH in interaction with H2O at potentials E>0V (ref. 25)."

In designing bimetallic and near-surface alloys, efforts should be made to substitute expensive rhodium with materials that offer adsorption and surface oxidation characteristics similar to those of rhodium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the oxidation of ethanol on PtRh/SnO2 occurs via an oxametallacyclic conformation, which enables a reasonable rate of direct cleavage of the CC bond. The superior activity of platinum-ruthenium in methanol oxidation compared to ethanol oxidation might stem from ruthenium's high tendency to form RuOH upon interaction with water at potentials greater than 0V, a reaction that cannot be suppressed in the presence of SnOH as it is with weakly bound RhOH.

在设计双金属和表面合金时，应致力于用能提供接近铑的吸附和表面氧化性质的材料来替换昂贵的铑。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，乙醇在PtRh/SnO2上的氧化通过一个氧胺金属环结构进行，这使得直接切割CC键以合理速率成为可能。铂-钌在甲醇氧化中的高活性与乙醇氧化中缺乏活性可能归因于钌在水合大于0V时形成RuOH的高倾向，这一反应在SnOH存在的情况下不能被抑制，而这是弱结合的RhOH所不具备的特性。

The ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalyst was synthesized using a method known as the cation-adsorption-reduction-galvanic-displacement technique, which allows for the controlled deposition of metal atoms onto oxide surfaces. The catalytic activity of this electrocatalyst relies on the cooperative effect of its three components—platinum, rhodium, and tin oxide.
