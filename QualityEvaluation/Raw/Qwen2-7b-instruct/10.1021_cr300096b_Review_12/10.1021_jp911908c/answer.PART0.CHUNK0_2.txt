The introduction of Re species onto a Pt/SiO2 catalyst significantly enhances its catalytic activity for CO oxidation in the presence of H2. This enhancement becomes noticeable after the catalyst is reduced at temperatures exceeding 673 K. The characterization methods employed revealed the formation of ReOx clusters on the surface of the Pt metal particles, with an average valence of Re at +2.7. This modification leads to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface, indicated by a higher wavenumber in CO adsorption on PtReOx/SiO2 compared to Pt/SiO2 at the same CO coverage. The CO coverage on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst during preferential CO oxidation is notably lower than in the absence of H2, suggesting the presence of an oxygen-containing species coadsorbed on the reduced catalyst. The observed phenomena can be explained by a mechanism involving the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species, followed by the spillover of the oxidizing species from the ReOx species to the Pt surface.

向Pt/SiO2催化剂引入Re物种显著提高了其在H2存在的条件下CO氧化的催化活性。这种增强在催化剂在超过673K的温度下还原后变得明显。采用的表征方法揭示了ReOx簇在Pt金属颗粒表面的形成，Re的平均价态为+2.7。这种修改导致CO与Pt表面之间的相互作用减弱，表明在相同的CO覆盖度下，PtReOx/SiO2上的CO吸附峰比Pt/SiO2高，这说明了Pt表面与CO之间的相互作用被削弱。在优选的CO氧化过程中，PtReOx/SiO2上的CO覆盖率远低于没有H2的情况，这表明存在一种氧含物种与还原催化剂共吸附。观察到的现象可以用以下机制解释：通过还原的ReOx物种激活O2，随后氧化物种从ReOx物种溢出到Pt表面。
