[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with Re species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

[4] "The CO adsorption on PtReOx/SiO2 gave a higher wavenumber then that on Pt/SiO2 at the same CO coverage, showing the weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface."
[5] "These tendencies can be explained by the mechanism where the reduced ReOx species activates O2 and the oxidizing species is spilled over from the ReOx species to the Pt surface."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of Re modifiers to Pt/SiO2 enhances the catalytic activity of CO oxidation in the presence of H2. The optimal molar ratio of Re to Pt is found to be 0.5, which leads to the formation of ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles. These clusters have an average valence of Re at +2.7, contributing to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface. The CO adsorption on PtReOx/SiO2 exhibits a higher wavenumber compared to Pt/SiO2, indicating a reduced binding strength. The observed enhancements in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions can be attributed to the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species and the subsequent spillover of oxidizing species from the ReOx species to the Pt surface.

这些双金属催化剂，尤其是基于铂的催化剂，在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。向Pt/SiO2中添加Re修饰剂可以增强CO在H2存在的条件下的氧化催化活性。发现Re与Pt的最佳摩尔比为0.5，这导致形成ReOx簇在Pt金属颗粒表面上。这些簇的Re平均电荷为+2.7，有助于减弱CO与Pt表面之间的结合强度。在PtReOx/SiO2上的CO吸附表现出与Pt/SiO2更高的波数，表明了Pt表面与CO的结合强度降低。观察到的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的增强可以归因于还原的ReOx物种激活O2以及随后从ReOx物种溢出至Pt表面的氧化物种。
