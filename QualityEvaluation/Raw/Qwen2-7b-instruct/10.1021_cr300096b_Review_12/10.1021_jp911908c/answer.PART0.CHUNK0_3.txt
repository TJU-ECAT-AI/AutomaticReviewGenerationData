The document discusses how the addition of Re species to Pt-based catalysts enhances the CO oxidation efficiency, particularly in the presence of H2. The enhancement occurs post-reduction at temperatures above 673 K. The formation of ReOx clusters on the Pt surface with an average Re valence of +2.7 plays a crucial role. This leads to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface, as evidenced by CO adsorption characteristics. The presence of oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface during CO oxidation is attributed to the coadsorption phenomenon. The mechanism involves the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species, with the oxidizing species then transferred from the ReOx to the Pt surface. This explains the high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures, especially when H2 is present in the reaction medium. The reduced state of Re species is crucial for the high O2 activation ability, even when CO adsorption is saturated on the Pt surface.

文档讨论了将Re物种添加到Pt基催化剂中如何增强CO氧化效率，尤其是在存在H2的情况下。增强作用在温度高于673 K后还原出现。ReOx簇在Pt表面的形成及其平均Re价态+2.7起着关键作用。这导致CO与Pt表面的相互作用减弱，如通过CO吸附特性可以证明。在CO氧化过程中表面存在的氧含物种被归因于共吸附现象。机制涉及由还原的ReOx物种激活O2，然后从ReOx转移到Pt表面的氧化物种。这解释了在H2存在于反应介质中的情况下，即使在低温下也能实现高CO氧化活性。还原状态的Re物种对于高O2激活能力至关重要，即使当Pt表面的CO吸附饱和时也是如此。
