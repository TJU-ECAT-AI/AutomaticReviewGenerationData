1. The addition of Re to Pt/SiO2 catalysts increases the preferential CO oxidation activity in a hydrogen-rich environment, lowering the reaction temperature. The enhancement effect depends on the reduced state of the Re species.

2. Small clusters of ReOx attach to the surface of Pt metal particles, and the average valence of the Re species is approximately +2.8 to +3.5.

3. The interaction between CO and Pt is weakened on the surface of both reduced and non-reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalysts due to the decreased desorption temperature of adsorbed CO.

4. The CO coverage during the preferential CO oxidation on the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) catalyst is notably lower than that on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst and Pt/SiO2 under CO + O2 and CO + He conditions.

5. The reduced state of Re species on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst enables high O2 activation ability, even when CO adsorption on the Pt surface is saturated, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

1. 将Re添加到Pt/SiO2催化剂中可以提高在富含氢气环境下的选择性CO氧化活性，并降低反应温度。增强效果依赖于Re物种的还原状态。

2. ReOx的小簇附着在Pt金属颗粒的表面，Re物种的平均价态约为+2.8至+3.5。

3. 由于吸附CO的脱附温度降低，ReOx/SiO2催化剂上的Pt表面与CO之间的相互作用减弱，无论是在还原或非还原状态下。

4. 在进行选择性CO氧化时，PtReOx/SiO2（Re/Pt = 0.5）催化剂上CO覆盖率远低于PtReOx/SiO2催化剂和Pt/SiO2在CO + O2和CO + He条件下的情况。

5. PtReOx/SiO2催化剂上还原的Re物种能够即使CO吸附在Pt表面饱和也能激活高O2活性，从而增强催化剂的性能。
