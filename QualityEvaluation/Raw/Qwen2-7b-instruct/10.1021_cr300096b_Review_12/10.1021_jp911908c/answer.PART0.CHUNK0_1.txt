[1] "The EXAFS analysis of reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalysts indicates the formation of Pt metal particles and the presence of the RePt and ReRe bonds. The Re L3-edge XANES analysis suggests that the average valence of Re species can be +2.8 to +3.5. Combined with XANES and EXAFS results, small ReOx clusters can be attached on the surface of Pt metal particles."
[2] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species. Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

The study demonstrates that the introduction of Re species to Pt-based catalysts enhances their catalytic activity in the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of small ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles. These clusters enable the activation of oxygen molecules even when the surface is saturated with CO, leading to an increase in the coverage of oxidizing species and a decrease in CO coverage. The presence of hydrogen maintains the Re species in a reduced state, which facilitates this process. This finding opens avenues for improving the efficiency of CO oxidation processes, particularly in fuel cells and related applications.

研究表明，在铂基催化剂中引入Re元素可以增强其在氢气富集流中选择性氧化CO的能力。这种增强归因于铂金属颗粒表面形成小的ReOx簇。这些簇能够使氧分子活性化，即使表面饱和了CO也是如此，导致氧化物种覆盖量增加和CO覆盖量减少。氢的存在维持Re元素处于还原状态，这促进了这一过程。这一发现为提高CO氧化过程的效率开辟了途径，尤其是在燃料电池及相关应用领域。
