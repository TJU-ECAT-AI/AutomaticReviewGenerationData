[7] "FTIR observation during the PROX on the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) indicates that the CO coverage was much smaller than that on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst during CO + O2 and CO + He conditions and also that on Pt/SiO2 during all the conditions."

1. The addition of Re to Pt/SiO2 catalysts increases the preferential CO oxidation activity in a hydrogen-rich environment, lowering the reaction temperature. The enhancement effect depends on the reduced state of the Re species.

2. Small clusters of ReOx attach to the surface of Pt metal particles, and the average valence of the Re species is approximately +2.8 to +3.5.

3. The interaction between CO and Pt is weakened on the surface of both reduced and non-reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalysts due to the decreased desorption temperature of adsorbed CO.

4. The CO coverage during the preferential CO oxidation on the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) catalyst is notably lower than that on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst and Pt/SiO2 under CO + O2 and CO + He conditions.

5. The reduced state of Re species on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst enables high O2 activation ability, even when CO adsorption on the Pt surface is saturated, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

1. 将Re添加到Pt/SiO2催化剂中可以提高在富含氢气环境下的选择性CO氧化活性，并降低反应温度。增强效果依赖于Re物种的还原状态。

2. ReOx的小簇附着在Pt金属颗粒的表面，Re物种的平均价态约为+2.8至+3.5。

3. 由于吸附CO的脱附温度降低，ReOx/SiO2催化剂上的Pt表面与CO之间的相互作用减弱，无论是在还原或非还原状态下。

4. 在进行选择性CO氧化时，PtReOx/SiO2（Re/Pt = 0.5）催化剂上CO覆盖率远低于PtReOx/SiO2催化剂和Pt/SiO2在CO + O2和CO + He条件下的情况。

5. PtReOx/SiO2催化剂上还原的Re物种能够即使CO吸附在Pt表面饱和也能激活高O2活性，从而增强催化剂的性能。

The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

The study demonstrates that the introduction of Re species to Pt-based catalysts enhances their catalytic activity in the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of small ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles. These clusters enable the activation of oxygen molecules even when the surface is saturated with CO, leading to an increase in the coverage of oxidizing species and a decrease in CO coverage. The presence of hydrogen maintains the Re species in a reduced state, which facilitates this process. This finding opens avenues for improving the efficiency of CO oxidation processes, particularly in fuel cells and related applications.

研究表明，在铂基催化剂中引入Re元素可以增强其在氢气富集流中选择性氧化CO的能力。这种增强归因于铂金属颗粒表面形成小的ReOx簇。这些簇能够使氧分子活性化，即使表面饱和了CO也是如此，导致氧化物种覆盖量增加和CO覆盖量减少。氢的存在维持Re元素处于还原状态，这促进了这一过程。这一发现为提高CO氧化过程的效率开辟了途径，尤其是在燃料电池及相关应用领域。

The introduction of Re species onto a Pt/SiO2 catalyst significantly enhances its catalytic activity for CO oxidation in the presence of H2. This enhancement becomes noticeable after the catalyst is reduced at temperatures exceeding 673 K. The characterization methods employed revealed the formation of ReOx clusters on the surface of the Pt metal particles, with an average valence of Re at +2.7. This modification leads to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface, indicated by a higher wavenumber in CO adsorption on PtReOx/SiO2 compared to Pt/SiO2 at the same CO coverage. The CO coverage on the PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst during preferential CO oxidation is notably lower than in the absence of H2, suggesting the presence of an oxygen-containing species coadsorbed on the reduced catalyst. The observed phenomena can be explained by a mechanism involving the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species, followed by the spillover of the oxidizing species from the ReOx species to the Pt surface.

向Pt/SiO2催化剂引入Re物种显著提高了其在H2存在的条件下CO氧化的催化活性。这种增强在催化剂在超过673K的温度下还原后变得明显。采用的表征方法揭示了ReOx簇在Pt金属颗粒表面的形成，Re的平均价态为+2.7。这种修改导致CO与Pt表面之间的相互作用减弱，表明在相同的CO覆盖度下，PtReOx/SiO2上的CO吸附峰比Pt/SiO2高，这说明了Pt表面与CO之间的相互作用被削弱。在优选的CO氧化过程中，PtReOx/SiO2上的CO覆盖率远低于没有H2的情况，这表明存在一种氧含物种与还原催化剂共吸附。观察到的现象可以用以下机制解释：通过还原的ReOx物种激活O2，随后氧化物种从ReOx物种溢出到Pt表面。

The document discusses how the addition of Re species to Pt-based catalysts enhances the CO oxidation efficiency, particularly in the presence of H2. The enhancement occurs post-reduction at temperatures above 673 K. The formation of ReOx clusters on the Pt surface with an average Re valence of +2.7 plays a crucial role. This leads to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface, as evidenced by CO adsorption characteristics. The presence of oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface during CO oxidation is attributed to the coadsorption phenomenon. The mechanism involves the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species, with the oxidizing species then transferred from the ReOx to the Pt surface. This explains the high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures, especially when H2 is present in the reaction medium. The reduced state of Re species is crucial for the high O2 activation ability, even when CO adsorption is saturated on the Pt surface.

文档讨论了将Re物种添加到Pt基催化剂中如何增强CO氧化效率，尤其是在存在H2的情况下。增强作用在温度高于673 K后还原出现。ReOx簇在Pt表面的形成及其平均Re价态+2.7起着关键作用。这导致CO与Pt表面的相互作用减弱，如通过CO吸附特性可以证明。在CO氧化过程中表面存在的氧含物种被归因于共吸附现象。机制涉及由还原的ReOx物种激活O2，然后从ReOx转移到Pt表面的氧化物种。这解释了在H2存在于反应介质中的情况下，即使在低温下也能实现高CO氧化活性。还原状态的Re物种对于高O2激活能力至关重要，即使当Pt表面的CO吸附饱和时也是如此。

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of Re modifiers to Pt/SiO2 enhances the catalytic activity of CO oxidation in the presence of H2. The optimal molar ratio of Re to Pt is found to be 0.5, which leads to the formation of ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles. These clusters have an average valence of Re at +2.7, contributing to a weakened interaction between CO and the Pt surface. The CO adsorption on PtReOx/SiO2 exhibits a higher wavenumber compared to Pt/SiO2, indicating a reduced binding strength. The observed enhancements in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions can be attributed to the activation of O2 by the reduced ReOx species and the subsequent spillover of oxidizing species from the ReOx species to the Pt surface.

这些双金属催化剂，尤其是基于铂的催化剂，在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。向Pt/SiO2中添加Re修饰剂可以增强CO在H2存在的条件下的氧化催化活性。发现Re与Pt的最佳摩尔比为0.5，这导致形成ReOx簇在Pt金属颗粒表面上。这些簇的Re平均电荷为+2.7，有助于减弱CO与Pt表面之间的结合强度。在PtReOx/SiO2上的CO吸附表现出与Pt/SiO2更高的波数，表明了Pt表面与CO的结合强度降低。观察到的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的增强可以归因于还原的ReOx物种激活O2以及随后从ReOx物种溢出至Pt表面的氧化物种。
