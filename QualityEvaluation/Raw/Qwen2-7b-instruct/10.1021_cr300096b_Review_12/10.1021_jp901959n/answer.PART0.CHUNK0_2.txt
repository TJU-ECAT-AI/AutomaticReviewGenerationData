<p>The thermal surface chemistry of 2(5H)-furanone (25HF) on Pd(111) and Pt(111) was studied using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).</p>
<p>After adsorbing 25HF on each surface at <140 K, increasing the temperature above 300 K resulted in opening and decomposition of the furanone ring.</p>
<p>On both surfaces, 25HF undergoes decarbonylation and dehydrogenation to form CO and H2 as the principal desorption products.</p>
<p>A key difference between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity is the relatively high amount of CO2 produced from Pt(111), suggesting that 25HF decomposition proceeds in part through an additional surface intermediate on Pt(111).</p>
<p>HREELS provides further indications that the reactions proceed through distinct pathways. On Pd(111), direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne is observed. On Pt(111), two reaction pathways are proposed. One pathway is similar to the reaction pathway for Pd(111) and produces CO during TPD, and the other proceeds through an intermediate that retains the OCO functional group and results in CO2 as a desorption product.</p>

Answer: 
The study revealed that 2(5H)-furanone (25HF) undergoes thermal surface chemistry on Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. At temperatures above 300 K, the furanone ring opens and decomposes into CO and H2 as the main desorption products. A significant difference was observed between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity, with Pt(111) producing a higher amount of CO2. The reaction pathways on Pd(111) involve direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne, while on Pt(111), two pathways are proposed, one similar to Pd(111) yielding CO, and another retaining the OCO functional group that results in CO2.

研究发现，2(5H)-呋喃酮（25HF）在Pd(111)和Pt(111)表面的热表面化学反应。在温度高于300 K时，呋喃酮环打开并分解为CO和H2作为主要脱附产物。Pd(111)和Pt(111)之间的显著差异被观察到，其中Pt(111)产生更多的CO2。Pd(111)上的反应路径涉及直接脱羰基化至表面CO和乙炔，而Pt(111)上有两种路径提出，一种类似于Pd(111)，产生CO，另一种保留OCO功能团，最终形成CO2。
