<p>On both Pd(111) and Pt(111), 25HF undergoes decarbonylation and dehydrogenation to form CO and H2 as the principal desorption products.</p>
<p>A key difference between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity is the relatively high amount of CO2 produced from Pt(111), suggesting that 25HF decomposition proceeds in part through an additional surface intermediate on Pt(111).</p>
<p>HREELS provides further indications that the reactions proceed through distinct pathways. On Pd(111), direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne is observed. On Pt(111), two reaction pathways are proposed. One pathway is similar to the reaction pathway for Pd(111) and produces CO during TPD, and the other proceeds through an intermediate that retains the OCO functional group and results in CO2 as a desorption product.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this section is to further discuss the surface reaction pathways on Pd(111) and Pt(111) in comparison with previous studies of species similar to 25HF. First, it is useful to compare the structures of the intermediates isolated after annealing to 223 K on the two surfaces. At this temperature, 25HF multilayers have desorbed, but the retention of a loss feature in the 17001800 cm1 range (corresponding to the CO stretch of the cyclic ester) suggests that the furanone ring is still intact.</p>
<p>As heating continues, the furanone ring structure opens and begins to decompose by about 300 K. TPD results for 25HF on Pt(111) and on Pd(111) indicate that on Pd(111), decomposition yields CO and H2 almost exclusively, with almost no CO2 forming. In contrast, significant CO2 is detected from Pt(111).</p>
<p>Insights can be gained by comparing current results for 25HF with adsorption and decomposition pathways for an acyclic unsaturated ester vinyl acetate (VA, C4H6O2)on Pd(111).</p>
<p>To assist in interpreting the ring-opening pathways on Pt(111), exploratory DFT calculations were conducted to identify stable intermediates that would hypothetically form from simple scission of each CO bond of 25HF.</p>
<p>It is useful to further compare the thermal chemistry for EpB (C4H6O) to 25HF. Both species can be categorized as four-carbon (C4) unsaturated cyclic oxygenates. EpB contains a three-membered epoxide (ether) ring and an unsaturated functional group, and 25HF is composed of a five-membered lactone (ester) ring which contains an unsaturated CC group.</p>

The document provides detailed insights into the differences in the adsorption and decomposition of 25HF on Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. Key differences include the formation of CO2 on Pt(111), the presence of distinct reaction intermediates, and the different proportions of decomposition products. These findings are compared with previous studies on similar unsaturated oxygenates, providing a foundation for understanding the surface chemistry of 25HF and its implications for heterogeneous catalysis. The document also discusses the role of DFT calculations in elucidating the ring-opening pathways and the potential for future studies to correlate findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts.
