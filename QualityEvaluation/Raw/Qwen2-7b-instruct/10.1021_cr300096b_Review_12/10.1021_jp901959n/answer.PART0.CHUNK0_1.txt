<p>On both surfaces, 25HF undergoes decarbonylation and dehydrogenation to form CO and H2 as the principal desorption products. A key difference between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity is the relatively high amount of CO2 produced from Pt(111), suggesting that 25HF decomposition proceeds in part through an additional surface intermediate on Pt(111).</p>
<p>HREELS provides further indications that the reactions proceed through distinct pathways. On Pd(111), direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne is observed. On Pt(111), two reaction pathways are proposed. One pathway is similar to the reaction pathway for Pd(111) and produces CO during TPD, and the other proceeds through an intermediate that retains the OCO functional group and results in CO2 as a desorption product.</p>

The surface chemistry of 25HF on Pd(111) and Pt(111) differs significantly. On Pd(111), the furanone ring opens via O1C2 bond breakage, leading to an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with carbon monoxide, followed by dehydrogenation and decarbonylation to form final desorption products CO and H2. On Pt(111), 25HF decomposes through two pathways: one similar to Pd(111) producing CO, and another retaining the OCO functional group to form CO2 during decomposition.

25HF在Pd(111)和Pt(111)上的表面化学存在显著差异。在Pd(111)上，环酮结构通过O1C2键断裂打开，形成与一氧化碳共吸附的乙炔中间体，随后进行脱氢和脱羰化，最终产生脱附产物CO和H2。在Pt(111)上，25HF分解通过两种途径：一种类似于Pd(111)，产生CO；另一种保留了OCO功能团，形成CO2作为分解产物。
