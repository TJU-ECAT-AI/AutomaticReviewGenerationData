HoriuchiMeghana RanganBenjamin M. IsraelJ. Will Medlin* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The thermal surface chemistry of 2(5H)-furanone (25HF) on Pd(111) and Pt(111) was studied using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). After adsorbing 25HF on each surface at <140 K, increasing the temperature above 300 K resulted in opening and decomposition of the furanone ring. On both surfaces, 25HF undergoes decarbonylation and dehydrogenation to form CO and H2 as the principal desorption products. A key difference between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity is the relatively high amount of CO2 produced from Pt(111), suggesting that 25HF decomposition proceeds in part through an additional surface intermediate on Pt(111). HREELS provides further indications that the reactions proceed through distinct pathways. On Pd(111), direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne is observed. On Pt(111), two reaction pathways are proposed. One pathway is similar to the reaction pathway for Pd(111) and produces CO during TPD, and the other proceeds through an intermediate that retains the OCO functional group and results in CO2 as a desorption product.This publication is licensed under the terms of your institutional subscription.

(1-4) Such carbohydrates include furan and its related species, including furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and 2(5H)-furanone (25HF). There have been proposals to use furan-related species such as 2,5-dimethylfuran as fuels and fuel additives. (5, 6) It is also desirable to selectively convert some furan-related species to a variety of end products, from larger liquid alkanes C8C15 for use as renewable transportation fuels (7, 8) to pharmaceuticals with leukemia-fighting properties. (9-11) The carbohydrate 25HF, which has the structure below,provides a useful probe molecule for a number of interesting reactions. For example, selective hydrogenation can yield a saturated lactone ring, γ-butyrolactone; hydrogenolysis or ring-opening reactions can produce a variety of ring-opened species such as linear esters, unsaturated carboxylic acids, or diols. Surface science investigations can provide a basic understanding of the thermal surface chemistry of 25HF on metal surfaces. The goal of this work is to study the adsorption and reaction chemistry of 25HF on a pair of catalytic metal surfaces, Pd(111) and Pt(111), in order to ultimately assist in developing design strategies for highly selective catalysts.Many furan-related species like 25HF (as well as several other carbohydrate building block molecules) may be generally classified as unsaturated oxygenates. Because the multiple functional groups of these unsaturated oxygenates can react on metal surfaces, precise control over reaction selectivity is desirable for eliminating unwanted side-products. One strategy for improving selectivity in these reactions is to design catalysts such that the primary surfaceadsorbate interaction is with one of the key functional groups, whereas the other functional group remains unbound and thus less prone to reaction. In previous work, this strategy has been applied to a multifunctional probe molecule, 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB). The EpB molecule interacts with Pt(111) and Pd(111) primarily through the olefin function (12, 13) but undergoes irreversible decomposition to an aldehyde intermediate. On Ag(110), EpB undergoes reversible ring-opening to an oxametallacycle intermediate that is strongly adsorbed through the O atom. (14) In agreement with surface spectroscopy and computational studies, Ag-modified supported Pt catalysts have shown dramatically improved selectivity for hydrogenation of EpB to epoxybutane; recent work has suggested this results from a bifunctional effect. (15) In this study we expand our focus to include a furan-related species, 25HF. This species is representative of a variety of important lactones and furanones in biorefining reactions. (4) Furthermore, 25HF and EpB share some structural similarities; both molecules contain four carbon atoms (C4), a cyclic structure, an oxygenate function, and a CC unsaturated bond. However, the molecular structures also differ in important ways: 25HF consists of a larger, less-strained oxygenate ring, and the cyclic oxygenate is an ester rather than an ether. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were used to explore the surface chemistry for 25HF on Pd(111) and Pt(111). These studies reveal that 25HF proceeds through distinct reaction intermediates and decomposition pathways on Pd(111) and Pt(111), resulting in different proportions of decomposition products. The results of this work are compared to previous work with other unsaturated four-carbon (C4) unsaturated oxygenates, including EpB, vinyl acetate, and furan. 2 Experimental Section All experiments were conducted in one of two ultrahigh vacuum chambers described in detail elsewhere. (16) HREELS experiments were conducted in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum chamber with an LK3000 high-resolution electron energy loss spectrometer (LK Technologies) and a model 9812046 sputter gun for cleaning (Varian). All HREELS experiments were conducted at a specular angle of 60 with respect to the surface normal and beam energy of 6.32 eV. The full-width half-maximum (fwhm) of the elastic peak in HREELS experiments was limited to 32 cm1. HREELS peak positions are reported to the nearest wavenumber, but it is recognized that uncertainties are up to a few cm1 due to the limited instrument resolution. To study the thermal chemistry, the crystal was heated to various temperatures and held constant for 2 min before it was allowed to cool and an HREELS scan performed. All HREEL spectra are normalized to the elastic peak height to enable objective comparison. TPD experiments were conducted in a separate chamber equipped with a Smart-IQ+ quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Scienta) and a model NGI3000-SE sputter gun for cleaning (LK Technologies). A fragmentation pattern for 25HF was obtained by backfilling the TPD chamber to a pressure of 109 Torr (107 Pa).In both chambers, 25HF was dosed to the sample using a direct dosing line facing the sample except where specified otherwise. While direct dosing methods reduce background adsorption and sample contamination, the method of direct dosing makes direct comparison of exposures between chambers problematic; however, it is still possible to perform exposure-dependent measurements to track trends, which is the focus of the reported work. The coverage of 25HF that underwent decarbonylation to CO was determined by integration of the CO desorption peak, which could be related to the area of the CO desorption peak for a 3 L (0.67 and 0.50 ML, saturation for Pd(111) and Pt(111), respectively (17, 18)) dose of CO applied to a clean surface. Cooling below room temperature was accomplished through a liquid nitrogen reservoir located in thermal contact with the sample. Both chambers had a base pressure of 1010 Torr (108 Pa). The minimum sample temperature achievable varied between experimental days due to subtle changes in the sampleliquid nitrogen contact over time, but it was generally in the range of 140160 K.The polished Pd(111) and Pt(111) crystals (Princeton Scientific) were cleaned primarily through cycles of cooling and heating in 5 × 108 Torr O2 (7 × 106 Pa) between 400 and 1000 K for TPD experiments. When this cleaning method was insufficient, mild sputtering with Ar+ ions (13 keV) and annealing were utilized. In HREELS experiments, sputtering, annealing, and oxygen treatments were used for each cleaning cycle. The Pd(111) and Pt(111) crystals were mounted onto a 1.5 mm tantalum disk and held onto a copper stage within each chamber using two metal clips. In the TPD chamber, temperature was measured using a thermocouple welded to the tantalum disk. In the HREELS chamber, temperature was measured by using a thermocouple attached to the copper stage. 25HF was obtained at 98% purity from Sigma-Aldrich and purified using repeated freezepumpthaw cycles. Ultrahigh purity H2, O2, CO, and Ar were obtained from Matheson Trigas.Exploratory density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) using methods described elsewhere. (15, 19) A 3 × 3 Pt(111) unit cell with a thickness of two atomic layers was employed for all calculations. To make the calculations more tractable, a two-layer slab of Pt atoms was employed. The atoms in the bottom layer of the slab were held fixed in the bulk-optimized lattice positions, but the surface layer was allowed to relax; however, similar results were obtained when both layers were fixed. The vacuum thickness between slabs was set to 2.4 nm. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 MonkhorstPack k point mesh and a plane wave energy cut off of 400 eV was used for the calculations. 3 Results
3.1 Temperature Programmed Desorption
TPD experiments were conducted after various exposures of 25HF at low temperature (<140 K) on Pd(111) and Pt(111). Figure 1 shows a summary of the desorption spectra for a dose sufficient to produce multilayers of 25HF on Pd(111). At low temperatures, 25HF (m/e = 84) multilayers desorb by 230 K and further molecular 25HF desorption occurs at 335 K. At higher temperatures, the dominant desorption species is CO. Since signals for all m/e values from 1 to 100 were tracked during experiments, any species besides CO (such as ethylene) can be eliminated from contributing to the m/e = 28 peak based on the lack of other m/e fragments detected. The CO desorption peak is broad, with a large leading shoulder at about 409 K and the peak maximum near 455 K. Hydrogen desorbs in one principal peak at 455 K, which is expected to be limited by a surface decomposition reaction. (20, 21) These results are consistent with decarbonylation and dehydrogenation pathways. No hydrocarbon fragments were detected as reaction products.Figure 1 Figure 1. TPD spectra after direct dose sufficient to produce multilayers of 25HF on Pd(111).Figure 2 shows TPD results for an exposure of 25HF sufficient to produce multilayers on Pt(111). Similar to 25HF on Pd(111), unreacted multilayers desorb by 220 K. (Note: Due to variations in mass spectrometer tuning at the different times these experiments were conducted, it was determined that the best fragment for tracking 25HF desorption from Pt(111) was m/e = 55, as opposed to m/e = 84 from Pd.) At higher temperatures, the dominant desorption species is CO, with relatively large amounts of H2 and CO2 also forming. The CO desorption peak is at 430 K, consistent with desorption-limited behavior. (22, 23) Hydrogen desorption peaks occur at 342, 430, and 490 K, indicative of complex decomposition chemistry. Carbon dioxide desorbs at two peak temperatures, one at 405 K and one at 430 K. Again, no hydrocarbon fragments were detected.Figure 2 Figure 2. TPD spectra after a direct dose sufficient to produce multilayers of 25HF on Pt(111).Figure 3 shows a series of TPD traces for key species resulting from varying the amount of 25HF dosed on Pd(111). Figure 3a shows a series of traces for m/e = 28 (CO) after different exposures of 25HF. Note that the large desorption peak around 230 K results from fragmentation of desorbing 25HF multilayers. As the dose size increases, the large CO desorption shoulder at about 425 K grows and becomes more distinct from the main desorption peak at 460 K. The positions of these peaks are consistent with desorption-limited behavior for CO on Pd(111), (22) and result from decomposition of the lactone ring. The presence of a low-temperature shoulder has been attributed to repulsions between adsorbed CO molecules at high coverages. Figure 3b is a series of traces for m/e = 2 (H2). At low coverage, H2 desorbs at about 320 and 450 K, and as coverage increases, the low-temperature H2 peak weakens, while the peak at 450 K becomes dominant. This higher desorption temperature is consistent with desorption behavior for an ethylidyne species coadsorbed with CO on Pd(111); the ethylidyne intermediate can also be identified by HREELS, as discussed below. (24, 25) The maximum CO desorption yield of 0.41 ML suggests that the total coverage of 25HF molecules undergoing decomposition is 0.2 ML, i.e., each 25HF molecule should generate two CO product molecules from complete decomposition.Figure 3 Figure 3. TPD traces for key species of 25HF on Pd(111). (a) m/e = 28 (CO). (b) m/e = 2 (H2). CO coverage reported on right side of each graph.Figure 4 is a series of TPD traces of key desorption species for varying amounts of 25HF dosed on Pt(111). As the dose amount increases, the m/e = 28 (CO) (Figure 4a) peak grows in height but shows little change in shape or peak temperature. The m/e = 2 (H2) (Figure 4b) desorption traces, however, show a significant change as coverage increases. At low coverage, only two desorption peaks are observed, at 340 and 420 K. As coverage increases, the peak at 340 K gradually decreases, the peak at 420 K becomes large, and a peak at about 490 K increases noticeably. These results indicate that CH scission for surface intermediates becomes more activated as surface coverage is increased; this observation is consistent with studies of similar chemistry on Pt(111). (13) Significant amounts of CO2 were detected desorbing from Pt(111), so the m/e = 44 (CO2) traces are shown in Figure 4c. At lower coverage, the low-temperature 410 K peak is larger, but at higher coverage, the 430 K peak is dominant. The maximum CO desorption yield from Pt(111) was found to be 0.20 ML, while the maximum CO2 yield was estimated to be 0.05 ML. Assuming that decomposition of each 25HF molecule yields one CO2 molecule or two CO molecules, the coverage of 25HF undergoing decomposition is estimated to be 0.15 ML.Figure 4 Figure 4. TPD traces for key species of 25HF on Pt(111). (a) m/e = 28 (CO). (b) m/e = 2 (H2). (c) m/e = 44 (CO2). CO coverage reported on right side of each graph.To summarize the TPD results, 25HF undergoes decomposition in the form of decarbonylation and dehydrogenation on both Pd(111) and Pt(111). In addition, relatively large amounts of CO2 are formed on Pt(111) but not on Pd(111), which suggests the possible presence of a different or additional reaction pathway on the platinum surface. Another significant difference between Pd(111) and Pt(111) is the H2 desorption traces, suggesting that the desorbing H2 may result from different hydrocarbon fragments. This is addressed in the Discussion section.
3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
HREELS experiments were conducted in order to probe the surface chemistry of 25HF on Pd(111) and on Pt(111) as a function of exposure and temperature. Figure 5 shows an overview of the thermal chemistry of a Pd(111) surface precovered by successive, increasing exposures of 25HF at low temperature, and also a greater than saturation exposure which was then annealed to higher temperatures. For the smallest exposure (Figure 5a), the most intense features are at 744, 774, and around 1000 cm1. These modes are very close to the expected values for ring deformations. Small peaks corresponding to C5H2 scissoring also appear to be present, at ca. 1400 cm1. As the exposure of 25HF increases (Figure 5b and c), the emergence of a peak coinciding with a C3C4 stretch at 1612 cm1 indicates that the olefin group is interacting with the Pd surface at low coverage. Major features from the large dose (Figure 5c, dosed at 162 K and held below that temperature) are noted in Table 1 and are consistent with multilayer formation, which, as expected, is very similar to the vibrational spectrum for 25HF vapor. Vibrational mode assignments were made on the basis of both literature reports and DFT frequency calculations for 25HF vapor. (10, 26) Similar to lower coverage spectra, the same principal ring deformation modes are present, and the peak around 1400 cm1 persists. There is significant growth of C3H and C4H stretching modes at ca. 3000 cm1 and C5H2 twisting modes at ca. 1170 cm1. (10, 26) This indicates that the C3C4 and C5H2 groups of the 25HF molecule are perturbed by interaction with the surface at low coverage.

Upon annealing the 25HF-covered Pd(111) surface to 223 K (Figure 5d), the 25HF multilayers desorb and many of the peaks either shift or disappear. There are some relatively constant vibrational modes: ring deformations at about 810 cm1 and C2O6 stretching of the lactone ring, which shifts slightly from about 1760 cm1 at 162 K to about 1740 cm1 at 223 K. In contrast, the C5H2 scissoring mode at 1450 cm1 and C3C4 stretching mode at 1610 cm1 both weaken considerably, indicating that those positions are likely affected by binding to the surface. Further heating to 323 K (Figure 5e) results in the formation of an intermediate species completely unique from 25HF. Major loss peaks for the 323 K spectrum are 1103, 1346, 1860, and 29603020 cm1. The 1103 and 1346 cm1 modes can be identified as CC stretching and CH3 deformation modes of an ethylidyne species, while the modes near 3000 cm1 correspond to ethylidyne CH stretching. (27-30) The 1860 cm1 mode is consistent with surface-bound CO, (31) indicating that the 25HF molecules originally bound to the surface have ring-opened and undergone virtually complete decomposition to small fragments by 323 K. Separate experiments (not shown) indicate that this decomposition chemistry occurs near 300 K; no intermediate structure differing from the traces shown in Figure 5d and e was isolated at intermediate temperatures.
Additional HREELS experiments were performed for 25HF dosed on Pt(111). Figure 6 shows HREEL spectra for some subsaturation exposures of 25HF on Pt(111) (Figure 6a and b), as well as an exposure sufficient to produce 25HF multilayers (Figure 6c) which was then annealed to 223 (Figure 6d) and 323 K (Figure 6e). Quantitative information regarding exposure amounts are unavailable for Figure 6 due to the direct dosing procedure performed, but spectra can still be ordered according to relative exposure. At the lowest exposure (Figure 6a), all peaks are very small, but peaks at ca. 943 and 1153 cm1 are most noticeable. Those modes can be associated with C3H and C4H wagging and C5H2 rocking and twisting. The C2O6 stretching mode is very weak at low coverage, indicating that the carbonyl function is likely oriented parallel to the Pt(111) surface. As exposure increases (Figure 6b), intense features at 367, 821, and 1783 cm1 appear, corresponding to C3C4C5 ring deformations, O1C2C3 ring deformations and C2O6 stretching modes, respectively. This may indicate that 25HF adopts a more upright ring structure as coverage increases. At the large exposure (Figure 6c), multilayers have undoubtedly formed, and the most intense features are in the 10301180 cm1 range, corresponding to C3H and C4H wagging and C5H2 twisting modes which are detectable due to the random orientation of 25HF molecules in the liquid-like multilayer state. (10, 26) That is, because 25HF molecules in the multilayers are not bound to the surface in any particular orientation, those CH and CH2 bonds are not involved in binding to the surface, and so the dipoles can be detected with HREELS. Also note that the C2O6 stretching mode red-shifts slightly to 1761 cm1. See Table 1 for a comparison between observed peaks for the greater than saturation exposure and those of 25HF vapor. (10, 26) As with 25HF on Pd(111), after annealing to 223 K (Figure 6d), the HREEL spectrum has changed. However, the spectrum is distinct from the case of 25HF on Pd(111). On Pt(111), the principal ring deformation peak at ca. 830 cm1 from the low-temperature spectrum has disappeared, and the C2O6 stretching peak is now much weaker. When the sample is annealed to 323 K (Figure 6e), a broad peak at 945 cm1 forms with a small shoulder below 900 cm1, while all other peaks become extremely weak. As discussed in the following section, these modes can be associated primarily with CH and CH2 deformations of a flat-lying intermediate and indicate that the furanone ring has opened. Note that experiments conducted at annealing temperatures higher than 323 K showed no isolation of significant quantities of adsorbed CO. This suggests that the further decomposition of ring-opened intermediates on Pt(111) is reaction-limited, despite the proximity of the CO desorption feature to its desorption limited temperature. The close alignment of the CO, CO2, and H2 desorption features at 430 K are also consistent with a rate-determining decomposition step, though significant CO2 desorption is also evident at 405 K. The higher-temperature H2 desorption features observed in Figure 4 are presumably due to further decomposition of C2 and C3 hydrocarbon fragments on the surface that remain after decarbonylation and decarboxylation.

To summarize HREELS results, 25HF surface chemistry differs significantly on Pd(111) and Pt(111). For both surfaces at high coverage and low temperature, 25HF forms multilayers that have vibrational spectra similar to each other and similar to 25HF vapor. On both Pd(111) and Pt(111), the C3C4 functional group is believed to interact strongly with the catalyst surface. However, upon annealing Pd(111), a C2O6 mode of the lactone ring is clearly present while on Pt(111) the C2O6 mode weakens considerably after annealing, indicating that 25HF may have a more flat-lying conformation on the Pt(111) surface. Further annealing causes thermal 25HF reactions that proceed through distinct intermediate structures. Annealing 25HF on Pd(111) to 323 K leads to direct formation of an ethylidyne intermediate and surface-bound CO, whereas thermal reactions for 25HF on Pt(111) proceed through more complex pathways, which evidently result in production of some CO2 during TPD. 4 Discussion The primary objective of this section is to further discuss the surface reaction pathways on Pd(111) and Pt(111) in comparison with previous studies of species similar to 25HF. First, it is useful to compare the structures of the intermediates isolated after annealing to 223 K on the two surfaces. At this temperature, 25HF multilayers have desorbed, but the retention of a loss feature in the 17001800 cm1 range (corresponding to the CO stretch of the cyclic ester) suggests that the furanone ring is still intact. See Figure 7 for a comparison between observed HREEL spectra and Table 2 for proposed vibrational mode assignments. Assignments have been made on the basis of both assignments from the parent molecule for functional groups and from known vibrational frequencies for common functional groups. On both surfaces there are some ring deformation modes present (CCC, CCO, etc.), but the relative intensities and positions of those features differ considerably, suggesting different adsorbate orientations and perhaps structures. Both spectra have a C2O6 stretching frequency, but on Pt(111) (1780 cm1) the frequency is closer to the frequency for liquid phase 25HF, indicating that the C2O6 group may interact more strongly with Pd(111) (C2O6 stretch at 1739 cm1); however, the relatively strong loss intensity for the C2O6 stretch on Pd(111) still suggests a somewhat upright orientation. Moreover, it is interesting to compare the spectra isolated after annealing to 223 K and the subsaturation exposures at low temperature. Note that on Pt(111) (Figure 6a and d), the major loss features are nearly identical in their frequencies. However, on Pd(111) there has been a shifting of the loss features, with very little alignment between the spectrum in Figure 5d and ab. This discrepancy may indicate that some bond dissociation of the 25HF ring has already occurred on Pd(111) by 223 K. The retention of losses at 1739 and 807 cm1 suggests that ring-opening has not yet occurred, but dehydrogenation may have already been initiated, especially considering the apparent absence of CH2 modes (see assignments in Table 2.).

As heating continues, the furanone ring structure opens and begins to decompose by about 300 K. TPD results for 25HF on Pt(111) and on Pd(111) indicate that on Pd(111), decomposition yields CO and H2 almost exclusively, with almost no CO2 forming. In contrast, significant CO2 is detected from Pt(111). On Pd(111), hydrogen desorbs largely at a single elevated temperature (450 K), which corresponds to decomposition of surface-bound ethylidyne species coadsorbed with carbon monoxide. (24) In the experiments on Pt(111), hydrogen desorption peaks appear at multiple temperatures and change with coverage.
Insights can be gained by comparing current results for 25HF with adsorption and decomposition pathways for an acyclic unsaturated estervinyl acetate (VA, C4H6O2)on Pd(111). (25) Calaza et al. proposed that vinyl acetate decomposes on Pd(111) through two distinct pathways, one involving O-vinyl scission at around 230 K to create acetate and vinyl species, and another involving O-acetyl scission at around 280 K to create vinyloxy and acetyl species. Major decomposition products observed were methane (282 and 336 K), acetaldehyde (310 K), CO (470 K), H2 (335 and 470 K), and CO2 (450 K). The formation and decomposition of an ethylidyne intermediate was also observed.
It is useful to modify the vinyl acetate CO scission pathways by simply taking into account the cyclic nature of 25HF; this exercise results in mechanisms described in Scheme 1. The O-vinyl scission of VA corresponds to O1C5 scission in 25HF, whereas the O-acetyl scission for VA corresponds to 25HF O1C2 scission. Note that since 25HF is a cyclic molecule, only one surface species will be created through each pathway. Because very little CO2 is observed in TPD from Pd(111), it is assumed that nearly all 25HF decomposes through scission of the O1C2 bond. Experiments conducted at annealing temperatures between 223 and 323 K reveal the concerted formation of ethylidyne intermediates, suggesting that (double) decarbonylation of the ring-opened aldehyde is rapid on Pd(111). In contrast, the observation of both CO and CO2 from Pt(111) suggests that both the O1C5 and O1C2 scission pathways may be operable. Furthermore, the absence of surface CO from Figure 6e indicates that the intermediate formed from scission of the O1C2 scission may be isolable on the surface. The high desorption temperature of CO2 is also consistent with the formation of a stable surface intermediate from O1C5 scission, since CO2 does not strongly adsorb on Pt(111). However, whereas the ethylidyne and CO decomposition intermediates can be conclusively identified on Pd(111), on Pt(111) the weak HREELS loss intensity and novelty of the proposed intermediates makes it difficult to identify the decomposition intermediates.

To assist in interpreting the ring-opening pathways on Pt(111), exploratory DFT calculations were conducted to identify stable intermediates that would hypothetically form from simple scission of each CO bond of 25HF. The two optimized structures are shown in Figure 8. The computed vibrational spectrum for each structure is shown in Table 3. The carboxylate intermediate shown in Figure 8a was calculated to be 0.6 eV more stable than the intermediate in Figure 8b, though of course kinetic barriers (not explored here) may dictate the prevalence of the two intermediates that would be formed on the surface. There are several noteworthy features of these two intermediates. Consider first the carboxylate intermediate that is formed from O1C5 scission. The entire backbone of the molecule, including the carboxyl function, is found to be aligned nearly parallel to the Pt(111) surface. It is useful to note that Calaza et al. also found that when the OCO group is part of an acetate species, it adsorbs nearly parallel to the Pd(111) surface, resulting in an attenuated and red-shifted vibrational signal for that mode. Because of this orientation, carboxyl and CC stretches would be expected to be very weak in HREELS, whereas out-of-plane CH bending modes would be expected to be most readily observed. Intriguingly, these out-of-plane modes are predicted to have vibrational frequencies between 857 and 930 cm1, in good agreement with the most intense feature of the experimental spectrum in Figure 6e and with typical frequencies for out-of-plane CH bending modes. (32, 33) Cleavage of the C2C3 bond for this intermediate would result in the formation of CO2 and a surface C3 hydrocarbon moiety.

The intermediate formed from O1C2 scission that hypothetically results in CO formation is considered next. Interestingly, this intermediate is predicted to form a surface oxametallacycle with an aldehyde function on the terminal carbon atom. In fact, the structure of the oxametallacycle is highly reminiscent of the oxametallacycle computed for ring-opening of EpB, but with an aldehyde rather than methylene function at the C5 position. (12) This intermediate is also relatively flat-lying and has CH bending modes in the range of 783913 cm1, again overlapping with the most intense losses from Figure 6e. However, one would expect that additional modes, especially CO stretching, would also be more apparent in the experimental spectrum. The unusually high computed aldehyde stretching frequency of 1805 cm1 may indicate that DFT has not correctly identified the interaction between the aldehyde and the surface, and DFT is known to incorrectly predict the preferred adsorption site for CO on Pt(111). (34) In their studies of VA chemistry on Pd(111), Calaza et al. suggested that the CO and CO functional groups formed during vinyl acetate decomposition lay mostly parallel to the surface, again resulting in very weak vibrational signals. (25) Moreover, it is important to point out that the DFT calculations conducted here are exploratory in nature and intended to reveal the preferred structure of intermediates formed from the initial CO scission steps; additional decomposition steps may change the structure of the intermediates. In particular, scission of one of the CH bonds from the CH2 group that is α to the EpB oxametallacycle oxygen was identified as likely occurring below 200 K on Pt(111), and a similar dehydrogenation may be favorable from the oxametallacycle shown in Figure 8. (12) It is noted that such a dehydrogenation step would likely make the molecule even more flat-lying, again with the expectation that out-of-plane CH deformations would be the main peaks observed in HREELS, consistent with Figure 6e.
It is useful to further compare the thermal chemistry for EpB (C4H6O) to 25HF. Both species can be categorized as four-carbon (C4) unsaturated cyclic oxygenates. EpB contains a three-membered epoxide (ether) ring and an unsaturated functional group, and 25HF is composed of a five-membered lactone (ester) ring which contains an unsaturated CC group. On Pt(111), EpB undergoes irreversible ring-opening below 200 K to form an aldehyde intermediate species. (12) On Pd(111), EpB also undergoes irreversible ring-opening below 200 K and forms an aldehyde intermediate that is similar (but not identical) to the EpB-derived intermediate on Pt(111). (13) Upon further heating, EpB undergoes decomposition to form desorption products CO, H2, and propylene on both Pd(111) and Pt(111). (12, 13) It is important to note that EpB undergoes ring-opening on Pd(111) and Pt(111), just as 25HF does. However, the temperatures at which the reactions occur differ. EpBs epoxide ring-opening reaction begins between 180 and 200 K on Pt(111), and by 190 K on Pd(111), whereas the 25HF lactone ring does not begin to open and decompose until about 300 K. This difference in reactivity can be explained by the reduced ring strain for 25HF, which evidently raises the activation barrier for ring-opening and subsequent decomposition.
The decomposition of furan (C4H4O), another C4 cyclic unsaturated oxygenate, has also been studied on Pd(111). Several studies have established that furan adsorbs in a tilted configuration, with the CC groups at least partially responsible for interacting with the surface. (35-40) These studies indicate that furan then decomposes through a C3H3 intermediate and that the final desorption products are CO and H2. (35, 36, 41) The adsorbed C3H3 products can combine to form small amounts of adsorbed benzene (C6H6), but benzene decomposes on the surface and is not observed as a gaseous desorption product. (38-41) An important difference to note is that while furan forms a C3H3 intermediate that lies almost parallel on Pd(111), 25HF on Pd(111) forms an ethylidyne intermediate. The formation of ethylidyne intermediates from ethylene and similar C2 fragments, however, is well-documented. (25, 29, 30, 42) This difference therefore likely results from the higher oxygen and hydrogen content of 25HF compared to furan, which allows two CO products to be produced per 25HF molecule, leaving a C2 rather than C3 fragment.
Finally, it is useful to close by discussing the present results in the context of heterogeneous catalysis. Manzer has described the use of a number of late-transition metal catalysts, including supported Pd and Pt, for the production of γ-valerolactone from levulinic acid. (43) This reaction proceeds through an angelicalactone intermediate; angelicalactone is identical to 25HF, but with a methyl group attached to the C5 position of the ring. The excellent CC hydrogenation activity of Pd and Pt catalysts is consistent with our findings here the 25HF prefers to adsorb on both surfaces through a strong interaction of the olefin function. Elliot and Frye also studied the reaction of levulinic acid through angelicalactone, and prepared PdRe catalysts which promote reductive ring-opening to 1,4-pentanediol. (44) This pathway may be similar to the ring-opening pathway observed for Pd(111) in the present study, in which two CO functions rather than a single CO2 function are nearly exclusively formed. However, it is important to note that Re was found by Elliot and Frye to greatly accelerate the ring-opening reaction. The results of this study suggest that Pd may have higher intrinsic ring-opening selectivity than Pt for production of diols from furanones and lactones, but further study is necessary to probe the effect of promoters, such as Re, on the decomposition mechanism. 5 Conclusion The surface chemistry of 25HF has been studied on Pd(111) and Pt(111). HREELS and TPD studies indicate that 25HF decomposes on both surfaces, but through different pathways and resulting in different proportions of end products. On Pd(111), the furanone ring opens via O1C2 bond breakage, which likely results in an unobserved four-carbon intermediate with a carbonoxygen group at each end. This intermediate then undergoes dehydrogenation and decarbonylation to form an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with carbon monoxide. Final desorption products are CO and H2. On Pt(111), 25HF decomposes through two reaction pathways. One pathway is similar to the case for Pd(111), involving O1C2 bond breakage and leading to CO and H2 production, while the other involves breaking the O1C5 bond. That second pathway results in an intermediate that retains an OCO moiety, and that eventually undergoes less complete decomposition to produce CO2 and H2.
