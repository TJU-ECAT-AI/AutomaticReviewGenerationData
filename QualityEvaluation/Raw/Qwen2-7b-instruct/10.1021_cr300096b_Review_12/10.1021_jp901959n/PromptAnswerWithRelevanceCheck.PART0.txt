3.1 Temperature Programmed Desorption

At low temperatures, 25HF (m/e = 84) multilayers desorb by 230 K and further molecular 25HF desorption occurs at 335 K. At higher temperatures, the dominant desorption species is CO. 

Figure 1 Figure 1. TPD spectra after direct dose sufficient to produce multilayers of 25HF on Pd(111).

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

For the smallest exposure (Figure 5a), the most intense features are at 744, 774, and around 1000 cm1. These modes are very close to the expected values for ring deformations. As the exposure of 25HF increases (Figure 5b and c), the emergence of a peak coinciding with a C3C4 stretch at 1612 cm1 indicates that the olefin group is interacting with the Pd surface at low coverage.

Figure 5 Figure 5. HREEL spectra of 25HF on Pd(111). Spectra are subsaturation exposures at 162 K of (a) 0.5 and (b) 1.0 L. A large direct exposure sufficient to produce 25HF multilayers at (c) 162 K was annealed to (d) 223 and (e) 323 K.

To summarize HREELS results, 25HF surface chemistry differs significantly on Pd(111) and Pt(111). For both surfaces at high coverage and low temperature, 25HF forms multilayers that have vibrational spectra similar to each other and similar to 25HF vapor. On both Pd(111) and Pt(111), the C3C4 functional group is believed to interact strongly with the catalyst surface.

4 Discussion

On Pd(111), decomposition yields CO and H2 almost exclusively, with almost no CO2 forming. In contrast, significant CO2 is detected from Pt(111).

As heating continues, the furanone ring structure opens and begins to decompose by about 300 K.

The surface chemistry of 25HF on Pd(111) and Pt(111) differs significantly. On Pd(111), the furanone ring opens via O1C2 bond breakage, leading to an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with carbon monoxide, followed by dehydrogenation and decarbonylation to form final desorption products CO and H2. On Pt(111), 25HF decomposes through two pathways: one similar to Pd(111) producing CO, and another retaining the OCO functional group to form CO2 during decomposition.

Answer: 
The study revealed that 2(5H)-furanone (25HF) undergoes thermal surface chemistry on Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. At temperatures above 300 K, the furanone ring opens and decomposes into CO and H2 as the main desorption products. A significant difference was observed between Pd(111) and Pt(111) reactivity, with Pt(111) producing a higher amount of CO2. The reaction pathways on Pd(111) involve direct decarbonylation to surface CO and ethylidyne, while on Pt(111), two pathways are proposed, one similar to Pd(111) yielding CO, and another retaining the OCO functional group that results in CO2.

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

For the smallest exposure (Figure 5a), the most intense features are at 744, 774, and around 1000 cm1. As the exposure of 25HF increases (Figure 5b and c), the emergence of a peak coinciding with a C3C4 stretch at 1612 cm1 indicates that the olefin group is interacting with the Pd surface at low coverage. 

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

Additional HREELS experiments were performed for 25HF dosed on Pt(111). Figure 6 shows HREEL spectra for some subsaturation exposures of 25HF on Pt(111) (Figure 6a and b), as well as an exposure sufficient to produce 25HF multilayers (Figure 6c) which was then annealed to 223 (Figure 6d) and 323 K (Figure 6e).

4 Discussion

On both surfaces there are some ring deformation modes present (CCC, CCO, etc.), but the relative intensities and positions of those features differ considerably, suggesting different adsorbate orientations and perhaps structures.

5 Conclusion

On Pd(111), the furanone ring opens via O1C2 bond breakage, which likely results in an unobserved four-carbon intermediate with a carbonoxygen group at each end. This intermediate then undergoes dehydrogenation and decarbonylation to form an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with carbon monoxide. Final desorption products are CO and H2. On Pt(111), 25HF decomposes through two reaction pathways.
