3.1 Temperature Programmed Desorption

At low temperatures, 25HF (m/e = 84) multilayers desorb by 230 K and further molecular 25HF desorption occurs at 335 K. At higher temperatures, the dominant desorption species is CO.

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

For the smallest exposure (Figure 5a), the most intense features are at 744, 774, and around 1000 cm1. These modes are very close to the expected values for ring deformations. As the exposure of 25HF increases (Figure 5b and c), the emergence of a peak coinciding with a C3C4 stretch at 1612 cm1 indicates that the olefin group is interacting with the Pd surface at low coverage.

To summarize HREELS results, 25HF surface chemistry differs significantly on Pd(111) and Pt(111). For both surfaces at high coverage and low temperature, 25HF forms multilayers that have vibrational spectra similar to each other and similar to 25HF vapor. On both Pd(111) and Pt(111), the C3C4 functional group is believed to interact strongly with the catalyst surface.

4 Discussion

On Pd(111), decomposition yields CO and H2 almost exclusively, with almost no CO2 forming. In contrast, significant CO2 is detected from Pt(111).

As heating continues, the furanone ring structure opens and begins to decompose by about 300 K.

To assist in interpreting the ring-opening pathways on Pt(111), exploratory DFT calculations were conducted to identify stable intermediates that would hypothetically form from simple scission of each CO bond of 25HF.
