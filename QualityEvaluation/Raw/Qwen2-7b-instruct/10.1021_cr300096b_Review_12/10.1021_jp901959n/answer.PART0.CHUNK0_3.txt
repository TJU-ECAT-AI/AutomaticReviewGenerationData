3.1 Temperature Programmed Desorption

At low temperatures, 25HF (m/e = 84) multilayers desorb by 230 K and further molecular 25HF desorption occurs at 335 K. At higher temperatures, the dominant desorption species is CO. 

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

For the smallest exposure (Figure 5a), the most intense features are at 744, 774, and around 1000 cm1. As the exposure of 25HF increases (Figure 5b and c), the emergence of a peak coinciding with a C3C4 stretch at 1612 cm1 indicates that the olefin group is interacting with the Pd surface at low coverage. 

3.2 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

Additional HREELS experiments were performed for 25HF dosed on Pt(111). Figure 6 shows HREEL spectra for some subsaturation exposures of 25HF on Pt(111) (Figure 6a and b), as well as an exposure sufficient to produce 25HF multilayers (Figure 6c) which was then annealed to 223 (Figure 6d) and 323 K (Figure 6e).

4 Discussion

On both surfaces there are some ring deformation modes present (CCC, CCO, etc.), but the relative intensities and positions of those features differ considerably, suggesting different adsorbate orientations and perhaps structures.

5 Conclusion

On Pd(111), the furanone ring opens via O1C2 bond breakage, which likely results in an unobserved four-carbon intermediate with a carbonoxygen group at each end. This intermediate then undergoes dehydrogenation and decarbonylation to form an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with carbon monoxide. Final desorption products are CO and H2. On Pt(111), 25HF decomposes through two reaction pathways.

The document provides detailed analysis of the adsorption and decomposition of 2(5H)-furanone (25HF) on Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. It explains that on Pd(111), 25HF undergoes ring-opening and decomposition to form CO and H2, with the formation of an ethylidyne intermediate coadsorbed with CO. On Pt(111), the decomposition proceeds through two pathways, one similar to Pd(111) yielding CO and H2, and the other involving an intermediate retaining the OCO functional group, which decomposes further to produce CO2 and H2.

本文详细分析了2(5H)-呋喃酮（25HF）在Pd(111)和Pt(111)表面的吸附和分解。它解释说，在Pd(111)表面上，25HF通过环裂解和分解形成CO和H2，同时形成与CO共吸附的乙炔中间体。在Pt(111)表面上，分解通过两个途径进行，一个类似于Pd(111)，产生CO和H2，另一个途径涉及保留OCO功能团的中间体，该中间体进一步分解产生CO2和H2。
