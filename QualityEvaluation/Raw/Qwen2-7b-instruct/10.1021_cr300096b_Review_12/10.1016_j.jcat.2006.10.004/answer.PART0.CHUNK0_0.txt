[1] "In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state on Ni can depend strongly on the position in the catalyst bed, because the partial pressure of introduced oxygen is rather high at the catalyst bed inlet, but it is almost zero at the bed outlet because O2 conversion was almost 100% in all of these experimental conditions at 1123 K."
[2] "This behavior is related to the lower oxygen affinity of Rh and Pt compared with that of Ni [27]; the small temperature gradient in the catalyst bed is explainable by the overlap of the combustion reaction zone with the reforming reaction zone."
[3] "It is thought that this species can be the active site for the steam reforming of methane as well as methane combustion even under the presence of oxygen, which can explain the flat bed temperature profile and the suppression of hot-spot formation."
[4] "In the case of Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9), the contribution of NiPt was not detected in the curve-fitting analysis, which is attributable to the low molar ratio of Pt to Ni (Pt/Ni = 0.06)."
[5] "Furthermore, Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9) showed a sharp peak at about 550 K; the profile of Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) also gave a sharp and low temperature peak."
[6] "In contrast, on the Pt/Ni catalysts, the ratio of reduced species to oxidized species can be much higher, due to the modification effect of Pt in the presence of oxygen."

1. In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state of Ni depends significantly on its location within the catalyst bed. At the inlet, where the oxygen partial pressure is high, Ni is more likely to be oxidized. Conversely, at the outlet, where oxygen conversion is nearly 100%, Ni remains in its metallic state.

2. The lower oxygen affinity of Rh and Pt compared to Ni explains why these metals produce less temperature gradient in the catalyst bed. The overlap of the combustion reaction zone with the reforming reaction zone contributes to this phenomenon.

3. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts are believed to be more accessible on the surface, forming a PtNi alloy, which enhances the catalytic performance and suppresses hot-spot formation.

4. In the EXAFS analysis, the NiPt contribution was not detected in Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9), indicating the low Pt to Ni molar ratio (0.06).

5. The sharp reduction peaks observed at 550K and 530-610K for Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), respectively, suggest enhanced reducibility due to the sequential impregnation method.

6. The modification effect of Pt in the presence of oxygen allows for a higher ratio of reduced Ni species to oxidized ones on Pt/Ni catalysts, leading to better catalytic performance.

1. 在甲烷氧化重整过程中，镍的氧化状态在催化剂床中的位置依赖性很强。在入口处，氧气分压较高，镍更容易被氧化。相反，在出口处，氧气转化接近100%，镍保持其金属状态。

2. 铂和铑较低的氧亲和力与镍相比，解释了这些金属在催化剂床中产生的温度梯度较小。燃烧反应区与重整反应区的重叠是这一现象的原因。

3. Pt/Ni催化剂上的Pt原子被认为更易于接触表面，形成PtNi合金，这增强了催化性能并抑制了热点形成。

4. 在EXAFS分析中，未在Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9)和Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9)中检测到NiPt贡献，表明Pt与Ni的摩尔比（0.06）较低。

5. 观察到的550K和530-610K的尖锐还原峰对于Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9)和Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)分别表示由于顺序浸渍方法的增强可还原性。

6. 在氧气存在的条件下，Pt的修改效果允许Pt/Ni催化剂上具有更高的还原镍物种与氧化物种的比例，从而提高催化性能。
