[1] "Monometallic Ni catalyst showed hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10). This behavior can be explained by the oxidation of Ni metal species with O2 due to the higher oxidation rate of the metallic species compared with the reduction rate of the oxidized species."
[2] "Although the monometallic Ni catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity in the steam reforming of methane without the addition of oxygen (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 30/30/0/40), in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, the Ni species near the bed inlet were oxidized in the presence of oxygen, which greatly decreased the performance."
[3] "The hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane over the monometalic Ni catalysts disappeared with the modification of the catalysts with Pt."
[4] "This is due to the tendency of the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts to be located more preferably on the surface to form PtNi alloy compared with those on the Pt + Ni, as supported by the characterization results."
[5] "The superior performance of the catalyst prepared by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) can be attributed mainly to the effective inhibition of Ni oxidation near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K."
[6] "This can be due to the decrease in oxidation rate and increase in reduction rate caused by surface modification of Ni with Pt."
[7] "The PtNi species are maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, and this can be related to lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than for the monometallic Ni catalysts."

1. Monometallic Ni catalysts exhibit hysteresis in oxidative steam reforming of methane due to the oxidation of Ni metal species, which is faster than their reduction. 
2. Without oxygen, Ni catalysts show high catalytic activity in steam reforming of methane. However, in oxidative conditions, Ni near the bed inlet gets oxidized, leading to a decrease in performance.
3. The addition of Pt modifies the catalysts, eliminating the hysteresis observed in Ni catalysts.
4. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts preferentially locate on the surface to form a PtNi alloy, which supports the better performance.
5. The sequential impregnation method for preparing Pt/Ni catalysts is more effective in inhibiting Ni oxidation near the bed inlet in oxidative steam reforming.
6. The surface modification of Ni with Pt reduces the oxidation rate and increases the reduction rate, enhancing the catalyst's performance.
7. The PtNi species maintain metallic state near the bed inlet, serving as active sites for both reforming and combustion reactions, resulting in lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

1. Ni单金属催化剂在氧化性蒸汽重整甲烷中的滞后现象是由于Ni金属物种的氧化速度比其还原速度快。
2. 在没有氧气的情况下，Ni催化剂在蒸汽重整甲烷中显示出高催化活性。但在氧化条件下，床入口附近的Ni物种会被氧化，导致性能下降。
3. 添加Pt可以修改催化剂，消除Ni催化剂中观察到的滞后现象。
4.Pt原子在Pt/Ni催化剂上更倾向于位于表面形成PtNi合金，这支持了催化剂的更好性能。
5. 通过顺序浸渍方法制备的Pt/Ni催化剂在氧化性蒸汽重整甲烷中更有效地抑制了床入口附近的Ni氧化。
6. 表面修改Ni与Pt降低了氧化速率并提高了还原速率，增强了催化剂的性能。
7. PtNi物种在床入口附近保持金属状态，作为重整和燃烧反应的活性位点，导致更低的床温度和较小的温度梯度，与单金属Ni催化剂相比。
