[1] "Monometallic Ni catalyst showed hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10). This behavior can be explained by the oxidation of Ni metal species with O2 due to the higher oxidation rate of the metallic species compared with the reduction rate of the oxidized species."
[2] "Although the monometallic Ni catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity in the steam reforming of methane without the addition of oxygen (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 30/30/0/40), in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, the Ni species near the bed inlet were oxidized in the presence of oxygen, which greatly decreased the performance."
[3] "The hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane over the monometalic Ni catalysts disappeared with the modification of the catalysts with Pt. The additive effect of Pt by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) was much more significant than that by the co-impregnation method (Pt + Ni)."
[4] "This is due to the tendency of the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts to be located more preferably on the surface to form PtNi alloy compared with those on the Pt + Ni, as supported by the characterization results."
[5] "The superior performance of the catalyst prepared by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) can be attributed mainly to the effective inhibition of Ni oxidation near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K. This can be due to the decrease in oxidation rate and increase in reduction rate caused by surface modification of Ni with Pt."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts are more likely to be located on the surface to form a PtNi alloy, which leads to better performance compared to the co-impregnation method. This modification can inhibit the oxidation of Ni near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, which reduces the oxidation rate and increases the reduction rate. Consequently, the PtNi species can remain in the metallic state near the bed inlet, acting as an active site for both reforming and combustion reactions, leading to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those observed in monometallic Ni catalysts. 

Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies might hinder the direct comparison and understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved at the atomic level. Nonetheless, these studies could offer a deeper understanding of the interaction between Pt and Ni, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts with improved stability and activity.

铂基双金属催化剂在甲烷氧化蒸汽重整反应中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化率的影响机制以及效率优化具有重要作用。铂原子在Pt/Ni催化剂上倾向于位于表面形成PtNi合金，这比共浸润方法显示出更好的性能。这种修改可以抑制甲烷氧化蒸汽重整过程中1123K时Ni近入口处的氧化，降低氧化速率并增加还原速率。因此，PtNi物种可以在床入口附近保持金属状态，作为重整和燃烧反应的活性位点，导致更低的床层温度和更小的温度梯度，与单一金属Ni催化剂相比。

未来在超高真空（UHV）条件下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究可以提供有关模型表面和负载催化剂之间关联的重要见解。然而，当前UHV研究的限制可能阻碍直接比较和理解原子水平的详细机制。不过，这些研究可以深入理解铂和Ni之间的相互作用，有可能推动开发更高效、稳定性更好的催化剂的发展。
