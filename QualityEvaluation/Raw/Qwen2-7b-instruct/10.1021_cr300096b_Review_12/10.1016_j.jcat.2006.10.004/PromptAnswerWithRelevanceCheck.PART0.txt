[1] "In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state on Ni can depend strongly on the position in the catalyst bed, because the partial pressure of introduced oxygen is rather high at the catalyst bed inlet, but it is almost zero at the bed outlet because O2 conversion was almost 100% in all of these experimental conditions at 1123 K."
[2] "This behavior is related to the lower oxygen affinity of Rh and Pt compared with that of Ni [27]; the small temperature gradient in the catalyst bed is explainable by the overlap of the combustion reaction zone with the reforming reaction zone."
[3] "It is thought that this species can be the active site for the steam reforming of methane as well as methane combustion even under the presence of oxygen, which can explain the flat bed temperature profile and the suppression of hot-spot formation."
[4] "In the case of Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9), the contribution of NiPt was not detected in the curve-fitting analysis, which is attributable to the low molar ratio of Pt to Ni (Pt/Ni = 0.06)."
[5] "Furthermore, Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9) showed a sharp peak at about 550 K; the profile of Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) also gave a sharp and low temperature peak."
[6] "In contrast, on the Pt/Ni catalysts, the ratio of reduced species to oxidized species can be much higher, due to the modification effect of Pt in the presence of oxygen."

1. In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state of Ni depends significantly on its location within the catalyst bed. At the inlet, where the oxygen partial pressure is high, Ni is more likely to be oxidized. Conversely, at the outlet, where oxygen conversion is nearly 100%, Ni remains in its metallic state.

2. The lower oxygen affinity of Rh and Pt compared to Ni explains why these metals produce less temperature gradient in the catalyst bed. The overlap of the combustion reaction zone with the reforming reaction zone contributes to this phenomenon.

3. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts are believed to be more accessible on the surface, forming a PtNi alloy, which enhances the catalytic performance and suppresses hot-spot formation.

4. In the EXAFS analysis, the NiPt contribution was not detected in Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9), indicating the low Pt to Ni molar ratio (0.06).

5. The sharp reduction peaks observed at 550K and 530-610K for Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9) and Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), respectively, suggest enhanced reducibility due to the sequential impregnation method.

6. The modification effect of Pt in the presence of oxygen allows for a higher ratio of reduced Ni species to oxidized ones on Pt/Ni catalysts, leading to better catalytic performance.

1. 在甲烷氧化重整过程中，镍的氧化状态在催化剂床中的位置依赖性很强。在入口处，氧气分压较高，镍更容易被氧化。相反，在出口处，氧气转化接近100%，镍保持其金属状态。

2. 铂和铑较低的氧亲和力与镍相比，解释了这些金属在催化剂床中产生的温度梯度较小。燃烧反应区与重整反应区的重叠是这一现象的原因。

3. Pt/Ni催化剂上的Pt原子被认为更易于接触表面，形成PtNi合金，这增强了催化性能并抑制了热点形成。

4. 在EXAFS分析中，未在Pt(0.2) + Ni(0.9)和Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9)中检测到NiPt贡献，表明Pt与Ni的摩尔比（0.06）较低。

5. 观察到的550K和530-610K的尖锐还原峰对于Pt(0.2)/Ni(0.9)和Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)分别表示由于顺序浸渍方法的增强可还原性。

6. 在氧气存在的条件下，Pt的修改效果允许Pt/Ni催化剂上具有更高的还原镍物种与氧化物种的比例，从而提高催化性能。

<p>The bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, showed improved catalytic performance and a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The additive effect of Pt by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) was much more significant than that by the co-impregnation method (Pt + Ni). This is due to the tendency of Pt atoms to be located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy compared to those on the Pt + Ni catalysts.</p>
<p>Characterization results by means of TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts were located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy than those on the Pt + Ni catalysts. The modification of Ni with Pt suppressed the oxidation of Ni species near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K.</p>
<p>Consequently, the PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, and the species can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, which leads to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those seen for the monometallic Ni catalysts.</p>
<p>The modification effect of Pt was evaluated by catalytic performance and catalyst bed temperature profile in the oxidative steam reforming of methane.

<p>In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state on Ni can depend strongly on the position in the catalyst bed. The TPR profile of the catalyst near the inlet and outlet were obtained to elucidate the dependence of the catalyst oxidation state on the position in the catalyst bed.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance and a more uniform bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The sequential impregnation method for adding Pt to Ni catalysts proved more effective than co-impregnation. This is attributed to the preference of Pt atoms for surface locations to form a PtNi alloy. The Pt modification suppresses Ni oxidation near the bed inlet, enabling PtNi species to remain in the metallic state, act as active sites for both reforming and combustion reactions, and result in a lower bed temperature and reduced temperature gradient compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

The characterization results, including TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR, confirm that Pt atoms on Pt/Ni catalysts are more likely to be on the surface forming a PtNi alloy compared to those on Pt + Ni catalysts. The TPR profiles indicate that the reduction ability and resistance to Ni oxidation on PtNi bimetallic catalysts are significantly affected by the preparation method.

In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state of Ni varies depending on the location within the catalyst bed. The TPR profiles near the inlet and outlet reveal the dependence of catalyst oxidation state on the bed position. These profiles show that the sequential impregnation method for Pt addition leads to higher reducibility and better resistance to Ni oxidation compared to co-impregnation.

在氧化性蒸汽甲烷重整过程中，特别是铂基双金属催化剂，展现出增强的催化性能和更均匀的床层温度分布。通过序贯浸渍方法将铂添加到镍催化剂中比共浸渍方法更为有效。这归因于铂原子倾向于在表面位置形成铂镍合金的趋势。铂的修改可以抑制床层入口附近镍物种的氧化，使得铂镍物种能够保持在金属状态，同时作为重整反应和燃烧反应的活性位点，从而导致较低的床层温度和减少的温度梯度与单金属镍催化剂相比。

通过透射电子显微镜、温度程序还原、扩展X射线吸收精细结构和傅里叶变换红外光谱等表征结果证实，铂原子在铂/镍催化剂上的位置更倾向于表面形成铂镍合金，而铂+镍催化剂上则不是这样。温度程序还原图谱表明，铂镍双金属催化剂的可还原性和镍氧化抵抗性受到制备方法的影响较大。

在氧化性蒸汽甲烷重整过程中，镍的氧化状态依赖于催化剂床的位置。靠近入口和出口的温度程序还原图谱揭示了催化剂氧化状态与床层位置之间的依赖关系。这些图谱显示，通过序贯浸渍方法添加铂导致更高的可还原性和更好的镍氧化抵抗性，与共浸渍方法相比。

[1] "Monometallic Ni catalyst showed hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10).

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts are more likely to be located on the surface to form a PtNi alloy, which leads to better performance compared to the co-impregnation method. This modification can inhibit the oxidation of Ni near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, which reduces the oxidation rate and increases the reduction rate. Consequently, the PtNi species can remain in the metallic state near the bed inlet, acting as an active site for both reforming and combustion reactions, leading to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those observed in monometallic Ni catalysts. 

Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies might hinder the direct comparison and understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved at the atomic level. Nonetheless, these studies could offer a deeper understanding of the interaction between Pt and Ni, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts with improved stability and activity.

铂基双金属催化剂在甲烷氧化蒸汽重整反应中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化率的影响机制以及效率优化具有重要作用。铂原子在Pt/Ni催化剂上倾向于位于表面形成PtNi合金，这比共浸润方法显示出更好的性能。这种修改可以抑制甲烷氧化蒸汽重整过程中1123K时Ni近入口处的氧化，降低氧化速率并增加还原速率。因此，PtNi物种可以在床入口附近保持金属状态，作为重整和燃烧反应的活性位点，导致更低的床层温度和更小的温度梯度，与单一金属Ni催化剂相比。

未来在超高真空（UHV）条件下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究可以提供有关模型表面和负载催化剂之间关联的重要见解。然而，当前UHV研究的限制可能阻碍直接比较和理解原子水平的详细机制。不过，这些研究可以深入理解铂和Ni之间的相互作用，有可能推动开发更高效、稳定性更好的催化剂的发展。
