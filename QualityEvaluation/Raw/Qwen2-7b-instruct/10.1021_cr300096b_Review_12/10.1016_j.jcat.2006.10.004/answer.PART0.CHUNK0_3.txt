[1] "Monometallic Ni catalyst showed hysteresis with respect to temperature increases and decreases in the oxidative steam reforming of methane (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10). This behavior can be explained by the oxidation of Ni metal species with O2 due to the higher oxidation rate of the metallic species compared with the reduction rate of the oxidized species."
[2] "In contrast, in the region with no oxygen (e.g., at the catalyst bed outlet), the Ni species can be maintained in the metallic state and presents the reforming activity."
[3] "This is due to the tendency of the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts to be located more preferably on the surface to form PtNi alloy compared with those on the Pt + Ni, as supported by the characterization results."
[4] "The superior performance of the catalyst prepared by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) can be attributed mainly to the effective inhibition of Ni oxidation near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K."
[5] "This can be due to the decrease in oxidation rate and increase in reduction rate caused by surface modification of Ni with Pt."
[6] "The PtNi species are maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, and this can be related to lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than for the monometallic Ni catalysts."

1. The monometallic Ni catalyst showed a hysteresis behavior in oxidative steam reforming of methane, which can be attributed to the faster oxidation rate of metallic Ni species compared to the slower reduction rate of oxidized Ni species. 
2. Without oxygen, the Ni species can maintain their metallic state and exhibit reforming activity. 
3. The Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts tend to be more surface-oriented, forming a PtNi alloy, compared to those on the Pt + Ni catalysts. 
4. The Pt/Ni catalyst prepared by the sequential impregnation method shows superior performance due to its ability to inhibit Ni oxidation near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane. 
5. The effectiveness of Pt in modifying Ni catalysts lies in decreasing the oxidation rate and increasing the reduction rate of Ni species, thanks to the surface modification. 
6. The PtNi species, being in a metallic state near the bed inlet, act as active sites for both reforming and combustion reactions, leading to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

1. 铜基催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中显示出滞后行为，这可以归因于金属铜物种的氧化速率比氧化物种的还原速率更快。
2. 在没有氧气的情况下，铜物种可以保持其金属状态并表现出重整活性。  
3. Pt原子在Pt/Ni催化剂上的倾向更倾向于表面形成PtNi合金，与那些在Pt + Ni催化剂上的相比。  
4. 通过顺序浸渍方法制备的Pt/Ni催化剂显示出了优越的性能，由于其能够在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中抑制床入口附近的铜氧化。  
5. Pt在修改铜催化剂中的有效性在于降低氧化率和增加铜物种的还原率，这是由于表面修改的结果。  
6. PtNi物种，在床入口附近处于金属状态，作为重整和燃烧反应的活性位点，导致更低的床温度和较小的温度梯度，与单金属铜催化剂相比。
