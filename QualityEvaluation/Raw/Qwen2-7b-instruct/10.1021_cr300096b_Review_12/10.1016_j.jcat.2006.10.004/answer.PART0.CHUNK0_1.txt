<p>The bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, showed improved catalytic performance and a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The additive effect of Pt by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) was much more significant than that by the co-impregnation method (Pt + Ni). This is due to the tendency of Pt atoms to be located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy compared to those on the Pt + Ni catalysts.</p>
<p>Characterization results by means of TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts were located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy than those on the Pt + Ni catalysts. The modification of Ni with Pt suppressed the oxidation of Ni species near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K.</p>
<p>Consequently, the PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, and the species can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, which leads to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those seen for the monometallic Ni catalysts.</p>
<p>The modification effect of Pt was evaluated by catalytic performance and catalyst bed temperature profile in the oxidative steam reforming of methane. We found that the introduction of Pt to Ni catalysts by the sequential impregnation enhanced the catalytic performance and gave a flat bed temperature profile.</p>
<p>In the oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state on Ni can depend strongly on the position in the catalyst bed. The TPR profile of the catalyst near the inlet and outlet were obtained to elucidate the dependence of the catalyst oxidation state on the position in the catalyst bed. The TPR profiles demonstrate that the reducibility on PtNi bimetallic catalysts and resistance to Ni oxidation were strongly influenced by the preparation method.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance and a more uniform bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The sequential impregnation method for adding Pt to Ni catalysts proved more effective than co-impregnation. This is attributed to the preference of Pt atoms for surface locations to form a PtNi alloy. The Pt modification suppresses Ni oxidation near the bed inlet, enabling PtNi species to remain in the metallic state, act as active sites for both reforming and combustion reactions, and result in a lower bed temperature and reduced temperature gradient compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

The characterization results, including TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR, confirm that Pt atoms on Pt/Ni catalysts are more likely to be on the surface forming a PtNi alloy compared to those on Pt + Ni catalysts. The TPR profiles indicate that the reduction ability and resistance to Ni oxidation on PtNi bimetallic catalysts are significantly affected by the preparation method.

In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the oxidation state of Ni varies depending on the location within the catalyst bed. The TPR profiles near the inlet and outlet reveal the dependence of catalyst oxidation state on the bed position. These profiles show that the sequential impregnation method for Pt addition leads to higher reducibility and better resistance to Ni oxidation compared to co-impregnation.

在氧化性蒸汽甲烷重整过程中，特别是铂基双金属催化剂，展现出增强的催化性能和更均匀的床层温度分布。通过序贯浸渍方法将铂添加到镍催化剂中比共浸渍方法更为有效。这归因于铂原子倾向于在表面位置形成铂镍合金的趋势。铂的修改可以抑制床层入口附近镍物种的氧化，使得铂镍物种能够保持在金属状态，同时作为重整反应和燃烧反应的活性位点，从而导致较低的床层温度和减少的温度梯度与单金属镍催化剂相比。

通过透射电子显微镜、温度程序还原、扩展X射线吸收精细结构和傅里叶变换红外光谱等表征结果证实，铂原子在铂/镍催化剂上的位置更倾向于表面形成铂镍合金，而铂+镍催化剂上则不是这样。温度程序还原图谱表明，铂镍双金属催化剂的可还原性和镍氧化抵抗性受到制备方法的影响较大。

在氧化性蒸汽甲烷重整过程中，镍的氧化状态依赖于催化剂床的位置。靠近入口和出口的温度程序还原图谱揭示了催化剂氧化状态与床层位置之间的依赖关系。这些图谱显示，通过序贯浸渍方法添加铂导致更高的可还原性和更好的镍氧化抵抗性，与共浸渍方法相比。
