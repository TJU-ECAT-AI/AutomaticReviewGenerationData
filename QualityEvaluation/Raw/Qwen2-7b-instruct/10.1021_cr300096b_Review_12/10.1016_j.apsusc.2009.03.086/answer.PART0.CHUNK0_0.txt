2. "The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2."
3. "Furthermore, Co in the PtCo catalysts changes to Co3O4 with the Co 2p3/2 BE at 779.5 eV. In contrast, in the H2 environment the resulted Co oxides were reduced to metallic Co with Co 2p3/2 BE at 778.0 eV and CoO showing Co 2p3/2 BE around 780.4 eV and a shake-up peak at 786.7 eV."
4. "The reversible structure changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are of great significance in many real catalytic processes."

1. The dynamic behaviors in bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based ones, are influenced by two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at their particle surfaces. In hydrogen (H2) atmosphere, platinum (Pt) tends to segregate onto the surfaces, while in oxygen (O2) atmosphere, nickel (Ni) is driven outward and encapsulated by the formed NiO layer.
   
2. In the PtCo catalyst system, cobalt (Co) transforms into Co3O4 under oxidation conditions, indicating the formation of an oxide layer. In hydrogen (H2) atmosphere, the Co oxides are reduced back to metallic Co, showing the reversibility of the process.

3. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are of significant importance in various real catalytic processes, contributing to the efficiency of reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions.

1. 在双金属催化剂，尤其是铂基催化剂中，动态行为受到粒子表面两种相反的气体驱动质量传输过程的影响。在氢气（H2）气氛下，铂倾向于向表面聚集，而在氧气（O2）气氛下，镍被驱赶到表面并被形成的NiO层包覆。

2. 在PtCo催化剂系统中，在氧化条件下，钴（Co）转化为Co3O4，表明形成了氧化物层。在氢气（H2）气氛下，Co氧化物被还原回金属态Co，说明该过程可逆。

3. 铂基双金属催化剂的可逆结构变化对许多实际催化过程具有重要意义，对反应如CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化的效率有贡献。
