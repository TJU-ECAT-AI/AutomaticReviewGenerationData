2. "The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2."
3. "Furthermore, Co in the PtCo catalysts changes to Co3O4 with the Co 2p3/2 BE at 779.5 eV. In contrast, in the H2 environment the resulted Co oxides were reduced to metallic Co with Co 2p3/2 BE at 778.0 eV and CoO showing Co 2p3/2 BE around 780.4 eV and a shake-up peak at 786.7 eV."
4. "The reversible structure changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are of great significance in many real catalytic processes."

1. The dynamic behaviors in bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based ones, are influenced by two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at their particle surfaces. In hydrogen (H2) atmosphere, platinum (Pt) tends to segregate onto the surfaces, while in oxygen (O2) atmosphere, nickel (Ni) is driven outward and encapsulated by the formed NiO layer.
   
2. In the PtCo catalyst system, cobalt (Co) transforms into Co3O4 under oxidation conditions, indicating the formation of an oxide layer. In hydrogen (H2) atmosphere, the Co oxides are reduced back to metallic Co, showing the reversibility of the process.

3. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are of significant importance in various real catalytic processes, contributing to the efficiency of reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions.

1. 在双金属催化剂，尤其是铂基催化剂中，动态行为受到粒子表面两种相反的气体驱动质量传输过程的影响。在氢气（H2）气氛下，铂倾向于向表面聚集，而在氧气（O2）气氛下，镍被驱赶到表面并被形成的NiO层包覆。

2. 在PtCo催化剂系统中，在氧化条件下，钴（Co）转化为Co3O4，表明形成了氧化物层。在氢气（H2）气氛下，Co氧化物被还原回金属态Co，说明该过程可逆。

3. 铂基双金属催化剂的可逆结构变化对许多实际催化过程具有重要意义，对反应如CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化的效率有贡献。

Bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on Pt, exhibit reversible structural changes when exposed to alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. During oxidation in O2 at 300°C, nickel (Ni) is oxidized and its oxide encapsulates the bimetallic particles. In the reduction phase, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates to the surface, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, forming Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes are driven by the changing redox potentials of the reaction gases and lead to oscillations in the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Similar reversible behaviors are observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported on HOPG.

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through reversible structural changes during oxidation and reduction cycles. During oxidation, Ni within the bimetallic particles is converted to NiO, which encapsulates the particles. Conversely, under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. The larger atomic radius of Pt compared to Cu or Co leads to Pt segregating onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, forming Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 atmospheres are responsible for the oscillations in surface structure and composition at Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems. These findings provide insights into the behavior of these catalysts under real reaction conditions and suggest that future studies on UHV surfaces could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, addressing current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

在氧化和还原周期中，基于Pt的双金属催化剂通过可逆的结构变化影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的机制和效率。在氧化过程中，催化剂中的Ni被转化为NiO，并将颗粒封装。相反，在还原条件下，Pt和Ni都保持其金属状态。由于Pt的原子半径大于Cu或Co，导致Pt向颗粒表面聚集，而Ni扩散到亚表面区域，形成Pt皮肤结构。响应于O2和H2气氛变化的可逆质量传输过程是导致Pt基双金属催化剂系统表面结构和组成振荡的原因。这些发现提供了关于这些催化剂在实际反应条件下的行为的信息，并表明未来对UHV表面的研究可以将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，以解决当前在UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的局限性。

The document describes how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, specifically PtNi, PtCu, and PtCo nanoparticles, exhibit reversible structural changes when exposed to alternating oxidation and reduction cycles. These changes involve the segregation of Pt to the surface, the diffusion of Ni to the subsurface region, and the encapsulation of the particles by oxides. These reversible processes affect the surface structure and composition of the catalysts, impacting their efficiency in reactions like CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions. Future studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts under real reaction conditions, potentially offering insights into the catalytic mechanisms and improving catalyst design.
