20. "Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed during oxidation and reduction cycles. Upon oxidation, Ni becomes oxidized and forms NiO, which encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remain as metallic states. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, resulting in the formation of Pt-skin structures."
21. "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through reversible structural changes during oxidation and reduction cycles. During oxidation, Ni within the bimetallic particles is converted to NiO, which encapsulates the particles. Conversely, under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. The larger atomic radius of Pt compared to Cu or Co leads to Pt segregating onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, forming Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 atmospheres are responsible for the oscillations in surface structure and composition at Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems. These findings provide insights into the behavior of these catalysts under real reaction conditions and suggest that future studies on UHV surfaces could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, addressing current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

在氧化和还原周期中，基于Pt的双金属催化剂通过可逆的结构变化影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的机制和效率。在氧化过程中，催化剂中的Ni被转化为NiO，并将颗粒封装。相反，在还原条件下，Pt和Ni都保持其金属状态。由于Pt的原子半径大于Cu或Co，导致Pt向颗粒表面聚集，而Ni扩散到亚表面区域，形成Pt皮肤结构。响应于O2和H2气氛变化的可逆质量传输过程是导致Pt基双金属催化剂系统表面结构和组成振荡的原因。这些发现提供了关于这些催化剂在实际反应条件下的行为的信息，并表明未来对UHV表面的研究可以将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，以解决当前在UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的局限性。
