[1] "Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres."
[2] "Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles."
[3] "Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures."
[4] "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems."
[5] "The similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG."

Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles are observed during oxidation and reduction cycles. Upon oxidation, nickel becomes oxidized and forms NiO, which encapsulates the bimetallic particles. During reduction, both platinum and nickel remain in their metallic states. Platinum segregates onto the particle surfaces, while nickel diffuses to the subsurface region, forming Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors are observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.

在铂基双金属纳米颗粒的氧化和还原循环中观察到可逆的结构变化。在氧化过程中，镍被氧化并形成NiO，将其包覆在双金属颗粒上。在还原条件下，铂和镍都保持为金属状态。铂沉积在颗粒表面，而镍扩散到亚表面区域，形成Pt皮层结构。这些可逆的质量传输过程导致铂基双金属纳米颗粒表面结构和组成振荡。在PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒中也观察到了类似的可逆动态行为。
