<p>Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems.</p>
<p>The similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG.</p>

The document describes how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, specifically PtNi, PtCu, and PtCo nanoparticles, exhibit reversible structural changes when exposed to alternating oxidation and reduction cycles. These changes involve the segregation of Pt to the surface, the diffusion of Ni to the subsurface region, and the encapsulation of the particles by oxides. These reversible processes affect the surface structure and composition of the catalysts, impacting their efficiency in reactions like CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions. Future studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts under real reaction conditions, potentially offering insights into the catalytic mechanisms and improving catalyst design.

文档描述了当使用交替氧化和还原循环处理以Pt为基础的双金属催化剂，特别是PtNi、PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒时，它们表现出可逆的结构变化。这些变化涉及Pt在表面的聚集，Ni向亚表面区域的扩散，以及由氧化物封装粒子的过程。这些可逆过程影响催化剂的表面结构和组成，影响其在CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化等反应中的效率。未来的研究可以将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂在实际反应条件下的性能进行关联，可能为催化机制提供见解，并改进催化剂设计。
