Bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on Pt, exhibit reversible structural changes when exposed to alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. During oxidation in O2 at 300°C, nickel (Ni) is oxidized and its oxide encapsulates the bimetallic particles. In the reduction phase, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates to the surface, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, forming Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes are driven by the changing redox potentials of the reaction gases and lead to oscillations in the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Similar reversible behaviors are observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported on HOPG.

Pt基双金属催化剂在交替的H2和O2气氛下表现出可逆的结构变化。在300°C的氧化过程中，镍(Ni)被氧化，并在其双金属颗粒上形成氧化物封装。在还原阶段，Pt和Ni均保持其金属状态。Pt向表面聚集，而Ni扩散到亚表面区域，形成Pt皮层结构。这些可逆的质量传输过程由反应气体的红ox电位变化驱动，导致Pt基双金属催化剂表面结构和组成的变化振荡。在HOPG支持下的PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒催化剂中也观察到了类似的可逆行为。
