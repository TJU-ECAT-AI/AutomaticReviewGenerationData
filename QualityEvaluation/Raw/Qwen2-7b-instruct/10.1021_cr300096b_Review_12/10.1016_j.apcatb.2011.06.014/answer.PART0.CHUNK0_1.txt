[1] "Considering the energy efficiency of a combined fuel processor-fuel cell system, the temperature of PROX unit should be ideally in 100130 C range."
[2] "The results clearly showed that the CO oxidation performance of the catalyst strongly depends on Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure and AC pretreatment."
[3] "In this context, preferential CO oxidation performance of the 1% Pt0.25% Sn/AC-N catalyst was studied and determined for various feed conditions including the realistic feed, i.e. a H2-rich feed including CO2, water vapor and CH4, in order to understand the effect of reaction parameters on the PROX activity and selectivity."
[4] "The overall evaluation of the performance test results at 110 C shows that PtSn/AC-N is a very promising PROX catalyst to be used in fuel processors; it reached ca. 90% conversion level with a realistic feed having O2:CO = 1.25."
