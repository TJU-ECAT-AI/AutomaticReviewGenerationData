1. The temperature range for the PROX unit in a combined fuel processor-fuel cell system should ideally be between 100 and 130 degrees Celsius to ensure optimal energy efficiency.

2. To minimize issues arising from adsorption competition, a catalyst should possess distinct active sites for each reactant and/or chemisorption processes to achieve high and stable activity.

3. The performance of CO oxidation for the catalyst significantly depends on factors such as the Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation method, and pretreatment of the activated carbon support.

4. The catalyst's stable activity originates from the stabilized alloy sites on low-coordinated carbon atoms. These Pt3Sn alloy sites have clusters of Pt atoms for CO adsorption and Sn- and SnPt clusters for O- (and potentially OH-) adsorption at atomic distances, creating a bifunctional active surface.

5. The weak CO2 adsorption strength of the catalyst reduces CO2 inhibition during the PROX reaction.

1. 综合燃料处理器-燃料电池系统的功率效率下，PROX单元的理想温度范围应为100至130摄氏度。

2. 为了最小化吸附竞争可能带来的问题，催化剂应具有各自反应物或化学吸附过程的特异性活性位点以实现高且稳定的活性。

3. 催化剂的CO氧化性能显著依赖于Pt:Sn负载比、制备程序和活性炭预处理等因素。

4. 催化剂的稳定活性源自于低配对碳原子上的稳定合金位点。这些Pt3Sn合金位点有Pt簇用于CO吸附，以及Sn-和SnPt簇用于O-（和可能的OH-）吸附，在原子距离上形成双功能活性表面。

5. 催化剂较弱的CO2吸附强度减少了PROX反应中CO2的抑制。
