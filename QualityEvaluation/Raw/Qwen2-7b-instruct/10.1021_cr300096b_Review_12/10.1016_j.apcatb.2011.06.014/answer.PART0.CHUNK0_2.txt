The text discusses the preferential oxidation of CO over a PtSn/AC catalyst, detailing its performance under various feed compositions, including fully realistic feed conditions. It highlights the effect of factors such as temperature, CO2 and H2O presence, and the oxygen concentration on the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The text also delves into the adsorption properties of CO and CO2 on the catalyst, confirming enhanced CO chemisorption on the PtSn/AC-N catalyst compared to Pt/AC-N. The performance results show that CO conversion increases with a decrease in temperature within the 110-135°C range, indicating enhanced CO selectivity as the temperature decreases. The catalyst reaches approximately 90% CO conversion at 110°C for realistic feed conditions.
