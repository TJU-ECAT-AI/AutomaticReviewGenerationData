[1] "Considering the energy efficiency of a combined fuel processor-fuel cell system, the temperature of PROX unit should be ideally in 100130 C range."
[2] "On the other hand, most conventional CO oxidation catalysts require high temperatures, which prevent irreversible CO adsorption, for guaranteeing stable operation."
[3] "Catalytic low temperature CO oxidation has two important reaction steps, which must occur simultaneously; CO chemisorption and dissociative adsorption of O2."
[4] "Therefore, an efficient PROX unit must reduce carbon monoxide level from 1 to 2% down to below 100 ppm while suppressing possible hydrogen oxidation under the presence of CO2, water vapor and CH4."
[5] "The results clearly showed that the CO oxidation performance of the catalyst strongly depends on Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure and AC pretreatment."
[6] "The results hinted that the active phase on PtSn catalyst prepared on nitric acid oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is the Pt3Sn alloy."
[7] "As the active phase on PtSn/AC-N is probably Pt3Sn alloy, a series of density functional studies have been carried out on COPt3Sn and (CO + O)Pt3Sn systems."
[8] "They suggested that the reaction takes place in a bifunctional way at the perimeter of the SnOx islands on/adjacent to PtSn particles or by a spill-over process."

[14] "Thus, it should be somehow an activated type adsorption besides its  should be  chemical nature."
[15] "The stable activity of the catalyst stems from the stabilized alloy sites on low-coordinated carbons; those Pt3Sn alloy sites have ensembles of Pt atoms for CO adsorption, and Sn- and SnPt ensembles for O- (and probably OH-) adsorption at the atomic distances enabling a bifunctional active surface."
[16] "Besides the high CO oxidation activity and the fact that CO adsorption does not lead to CO poisoning, weak CO2 adsorption strength of the catalyst limits CO2 inhibition during PROX reaction."

The document provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Key points include:

1. The temperature of the PROX unit should ideally be in the range of 100 to 130°C for energy efficiency in combined fuel processor-fuel cell systems. This is because conventional CO oxidation catalysts often require high temperatures that prevent stable CO adsorption.

2. Catalytic low-temperature CO oxidation involves simultaneous CO chemisorption and dissociative adsorption of O2, which are critical for efficient CO oxidation.

3. An efficient PROX unit reduces CO levels from 1-2% to below 100 ppm while mitigating hydrogen oxidation under conditions with CO2, water vapor, and methane. 

4. The performance of the catalyst is significantly influenced by factors like the Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure, and pretreatment of the activated carbon support.

5. The active phase on a PtSn catalyst prepared on nitric acid-oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is likely a Pt3Sn alloy, which has unique properties compared to pure Pt or Sn systems.

6. Density functional studies on COPt3Sn and (CO + O)Pt3Sn systems reveal the Pt3Sn alloy's ability to reduce CO adsorption strength and provide specific sites for oxygen adsorption.

7. The bifunctional nature of the Pt3Sn alloy allows for efficient CO oxidation at low temperatures by facilitating CO adsorption and oxygen adsorption at atomic distances.

8. The weak CO2 adsorption strength of the Pt3Sn alloy prevents CO2 inhibition during PROX reactions, contributing to the catalyst's high activity.

9. The document also discusses the use of FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and gravimetric analysis to study CO and CO2 adsorption properties under operating conditions.

10. Realistic feed conditions, including CO, H2, O2, and He, are used to obtain online real-time PROX activity profiles for an AC-supported system.

11. Detailed characterization methods, such as TPD, SEM, XPS, and H2 adsorption studies, are employed to understand the catalyst's structure and properties.

12. The document highlights that CO adsorption on the catalyst samples exhibits chemical nature but cannot be explained by standard adsorption models.

13. The CO adsorption behavior suggests an activated type adsorption in addition to its chemical nature.

14. The stable activity of the catalyst is attributed to the Pt3Sn alloy sites on low-coordinated carbons, which enable bifunctional active surfaces for CO and O2 oxidation.

15. The catalyst's high CO oxidation activity, absence of CO poisoning, and weak CO2 adsorption contribute to its efficiency in reducing CO levels under realistic feed conditions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights into correlating the findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and potential improvements for enhancing catalyst performance.
