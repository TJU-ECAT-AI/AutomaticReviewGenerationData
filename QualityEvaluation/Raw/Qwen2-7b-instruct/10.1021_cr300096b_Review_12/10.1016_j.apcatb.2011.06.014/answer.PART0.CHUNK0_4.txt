[1] "The results of the CO adsorption studies indicate that CO adsorption on the samples should have chemical nature."
[2] "The overall evaluation of the performance test results at 110 C (Fig. 9) shows that PtSn/AC-N is a very promising PROX catalyst to be used in fuel processors; it reached ca. 90% conversion level with a realistic feed having O2:CO = 1.25."
[3] "Considering the fact that oxygen present in the feed was used up completely in all tests, increase in CO conversion shows the increase in CO selectivity of the catalyst with a decrease in reaction temperature."
[4] "The most plausible reason for the lowered activity is that the oxygen level in the feed led to a low O surface concentration that can be used in oxidation of CO."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by enhancing CO adsorption and surface reaction involving intermediate hydroxyl groups, increasing CO conversion and selectivity as the temperature decreases. This is due to the formation of Pt3Sn alloy sites on the activated carbon support. These sites have ensembles of Pt atoms for CO adsorption and Sn- and SnPt ensembles for O- (and probably OH-) adsorption at the atomic distances, enabling a bifunctional active surface. The weak CO2 adsorption strength of the catalyst limits CO2 inhibition during PROX reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, current limitations in UHV studies might hinder the correlation between the findings and the actual catalyst behavior in real-world applications.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中影响一氧化碳氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化，通过增强一氧化碳吸附和表面反应涉及中间羟基团，随着温度的降低增加了一氧化碳转化率和选择性。这是由于在活性碳支持上形成Pt3Sn合金位点。这些位点具有铂原子簇用于一氧化碳吸附和Sn-和SnPt簇用于O-（可能还有OH-）吸附在原子距离，使一个双功能活性表面。催化剂的弱二氧化碳吸附强度限制了在PROX反应中的二氧化碳抑制。未来UHV研究可以为与模型表面和支持催化剂的相关性提供见解，通过在超高真空条件下检查铂基双金属表面的行为。然而，当前UHV研究的局限性可能阻碍了将发现与实际催化剂在实际应用中的行为进行关联。
