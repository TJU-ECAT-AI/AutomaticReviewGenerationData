[1] "Structure-Induced Enhancement in Electrooxidation of Trimetallic FePtAu Nanoparticles"
[2] "The catalytic performance of trimetallic FePtAu nanoparticles was significantly enhanced due to the synergistic effect of the three metals."
[3] "In the context of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions, the bimetallic Pt-based catalysts showed superior activity compared to pure metal catalysts."
[4] "Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the structure-activity relationships on model surfaces and supported catalysts, which might not be accessible under typical reactor conditions."
[5] "However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms."

1. The structure-induced enhancement in electrooxidation of trimetallic FePtAu nanoparticles was due to the synergistic effect of the three metals. In reactor studies, bimetallic Pt-based catalysts demonstrated superior activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions compared to pure metal catalysts. Future UHV studies might offer insights into the correlation between structure and activity on model surfaces and supported catalysts, though they are limited by current constraints.
