[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal-in either the metallic or the oxidized state-can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[3] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[5] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[6] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, exhibit enhanced catalytic properties due to their complex surface structures. These structures allow for the exposure of the second metal in various states on the surface, in the near surface region, or within the bulk, which is crucial for their catalytic activities.

2. The dynamic nature of catalyst surface structures during reactions, including reversible processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion, provides opportunities to tailor the catalytic performance and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

3. By switching the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, researchers can adjust the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

4. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could offer valuable insights into the correlation between catalytic mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies, potentially leading to advancements in model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies might restrict the depth and breadth of these correlations.
