[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."
[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal-in either the metallic or the oxidized state-can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[3] "The surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[4] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[5] "In order to optimize the catalytic performance, it is highly demanding to modulate the surface structure of the bimetallic catalysts."
[6] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[7] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reducing and oxidative conditions."
[8] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based ones, typically exhibit enhanced catalytic performance compared to single-metal catalysts. They are extensively utilized in various catalytic processes due to their complex surface structures, which allow for the presence of the second metal in various states (metallic or oxidized) on the surface, near the surface, or within the bulk.

2. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts featuring a Pt-skin surface with 3d transition metals at the subsurface level demonstrate superior catalytic activities in multiple reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces.

3. Optimizing the catalytic performance requires the modulation of the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts, which is essential due to the dynamic changes in catalyst surface structures during reactions. Processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion, observed in monometallic catalyst systems under varying gas environments, offer opportunities to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. Bimetallic catalysts might display similar dependencies of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, enabling the adjustment of catalytic activity and selectivity. In the study of FePt(111) systems, the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts was found to be switchable between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface.

5. Cycled oxidation and reduction treatments enabled reversible structural modulation, which resulted in tunable surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts.

1. 双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基催化剂，通常展现出与单一金属催化剂相比更优异的催化性能。它们在多种催化过程中被广泛应用，原因在于其复杂的表面结构，允许第二金属以金属态、氧化态或近表面、内部状态存在于表面或内部。

2. 双金属催化剂的表面结构对其催化性质至关重要。例如，Pt基双金属催化剂在表面层含有3d过渡金属的Pt皮肤层表现出多于纯Pt表面的超催化活性，在多种反应中。

3. 优化催化性能需要对双金属催化剂的表面结构进行调整，这源于催化剂表面结构在反应过程中的动态变化。在不同气体环境下的单金属催化剂系统中观察到的润湿-脱湿和烧结分散过程提供了调整催化活性和选择性的机会。

4. 双金属催化剂可能显示出与反应气体的还原电势相关的表面结构依赖性，从而调整催化活性和选择性。在FePt(111)系统的研究中，发现双金属FePt催化剂的表面结构可以切换为包含Fe底下的Pt皮肤表面和富含铁氧化物的Pt表面。

5. 循环氧化和还原处理实现了可逆的结构调节，导致双金属催化剂上表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力的可调性。
