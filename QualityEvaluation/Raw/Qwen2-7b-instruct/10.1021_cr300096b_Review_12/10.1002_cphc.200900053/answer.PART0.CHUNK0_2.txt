1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to their single metal counterparts. They are widely utilized in various catalytic processes due to their enhanced efficiency. A specific example is Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with a Pt-skin surface and a 3d transition metal subsurface, which outperform pure Pt surfaces in multiple reactions.

2. The reversible structural modulation of FePt bimetallic catalysts enables switching between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This dynamic change affects the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability, offering tunability in the catalytic properties of these materials.

1. 含有Pt的双金属催化剂在对比其单一金属时，展现出更优秀的催化性能，并广泛应用于各种催化过程中。一个具体例子是基于Pt的双金属催化剂，具有Pt表皮层和亚表面区域的3d过渡金属，相比纯Pt表面，在多种反应中表现出更高的催化性能。

2. FePt双金属催化剂的可逆结构调制允许在Pt表皮层下具有Fe或富含铁氧化物的Pt表面之间进行切换。这种动态变化影响了表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力，提供了调整这些材料催化性质的灵活性。
