The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to their increased surface structural complexity. This complexity allows for the exposure of the second metal in various states (metallic or oxidized) on the surface, within the near surface region, or embedded in the bulk, which is crucial for their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with a Pt-skin surface containing a 3d transition metal at the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic activities compared to pure Pt surfaces. To optimize the catalytic performance, it is essential to modulate the surface structure of these bimetallic catalysts, which can change dynamically during reactions. The reversible structural modulation of FePt catalysts, achieved through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, shows tunable effects on the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability. This dynamic structural change provides feasible ways to adjust the catalytic activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts, offering opportunities for optimizing their performance in various catalytic processes.

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by providing enhanced surface structural complexity. These catalysts can exhibit different surface structures, such as Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region, which lead to superior catalytic performances compared to pure Pt surfaces. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface during reactions allows for the tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity through the manipulation of the redox potential of the reaction gases.

In future UHV studies, there is potential for correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying these catalytic processes. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder the comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the catalysts and the reaction environments. Further research is needed to overcome these limitations and fully exploit the benefits of bimetallic catalysts in various industrial applications.
