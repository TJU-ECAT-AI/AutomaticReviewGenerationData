[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metalin either the metallic or the oxidized statecan be exposed on the surface,in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[3] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[5] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[6] "Using well-defined FePt systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by providing enhanced surface structural complexity. These catalysts can exhibit different surface structures, such as Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region, which lead to superior catalytic performances compared to pure Pt surfaces. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface during reactions allows for the tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity through the manipulation of the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural modulation of bimetallic catalysts enables the adjustment of surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability, potentially enhancing the efficiency of these reactions.

In future UHV studies, there is potential for correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying these catalytic processes. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder the comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the catalysts and the reaction environments. Further research is needed to overcome these limitations and fully exploit the benefits of bimetallic catalysts in various industrial applications.

特别是Pt基催化剂，通过提供增强的表面结构复杂性，影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换等反应的机制和效率。这些催化剂可以表现出不同的表面结构，如在亚表面区域具有3d过渡金属的Pt薄层表面，这导致与纯Pt表面相比具有更好的催化性能。催化剂表面的动态性质允许通过调节反应气体的还原电位来调整催化活性和选择性。双金属催化剂的可逆结构调制使表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力的调整成为可能，从而可能提高这些反应的效率。

在未来的高真空(UHV)研究中，有可能将发现与模型表面和支持催化剂相联系，提供这些催化过程机制的更深层次理解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究的限制可能阻碍了对催化剂与反应环境之间相互作用的全面理解。需要进一步的研究来克服这些限制，并充分利用双金属催化剂在各种工业应用中的优势。
