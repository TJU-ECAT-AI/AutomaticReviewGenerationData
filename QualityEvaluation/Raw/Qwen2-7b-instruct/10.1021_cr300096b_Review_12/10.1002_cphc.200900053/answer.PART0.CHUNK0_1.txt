The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to their increased surface structural complexity. This complexity allows for the exposure of the second metal in various states (metallic or oxidized) on the surface, within the near surface region, or embedded in the bulk, which is crucial for their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with a Pt-skin surface containing a 3d transition metal at the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic activities compared to pure Pt surfaces. To optimize the catalytic performance, it is essential to modulate the surface structure of these bimetallic catalysts, which can change dynamically during reactions. The reversible structural modulation of FePt catalysts, achieved through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, shows tunable effects on the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability. This dynamic structural change provides feasible ways to adjust the catalytic activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts, offering opportunities for optimizing their performance in various catalytic processes.

文献讨论了双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基催化剂，由于其表面结构复杂性增加而表现出增强的催化性能。这种复杂性允许第二金属以金属态或氧化态在表面、近表面区域或内部晶格中呈现，这对它们的催化性质至关重要。例如，具有Pt表皮层和位于次表面层中的3d过渡金属的Pt基双金属催化剂，在许多反应中的催化活性优于纯Pt表面。为了优化催化性能，必须调整双金属催化剂的表面结构，这在反应过程中会发生动态变化。FePt催化剂通过循环氧化和还原处理实现可逆结构转换，显示了对表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力的可调性。这种动态结构变化提供了调整双金属催化剂催化活性和选择性的可行方法，为优化各种催化过程提供了机会。
