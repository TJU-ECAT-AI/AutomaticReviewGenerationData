[1] "Colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized via self-organization by mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure, which were prepared in advance by a sacrificial hydrogen-reduction method."
[2] "The Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles appeared to have a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure on the basis of UV-vis absorption spectra, FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO, TEM, HR-TEM, and EF-TEM observation."
[3] "Spontaneously formed trimetallic nanoparticles having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal nanoparticle catalysts tested here for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 °C under atmosphere of hydrogen."

聚合物保护的Pd/Ag/Rh三金属纳米粒子的合成涉及聚合物保护的Rh纳米粒子胶体分散液与聚合物保护的Pd/Ag双金属纳米粒子具有内核壳（Pd-核心/Ag-壳）结构的混合。这些纳米粒子基于紫外可见吸收光谱、吸附CO的FT-IR光谱、TEM、HR-TEM和EF-TEM观察，显示出三层内核壳（Pd-核心/Ag-层/壳）结构。自发形成的三金属纳米粒子具有Pd/Ag/Rh=1/2/13.5的原子组成和平均直径为2.2nm，显示出了在30°C氢气气氛下对甲基丙烯酸氢化催化剂中最高催化活性。
