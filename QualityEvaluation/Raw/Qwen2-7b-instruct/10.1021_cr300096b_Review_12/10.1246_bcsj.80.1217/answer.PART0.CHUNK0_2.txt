[1] "The Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles appeared to have a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure on the basis of UVvis absorption spectra, FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO, TEM, HR-TEM, and EF-TEM observation."
[2] "Spontaneously formed trimetallic nanoparticles having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal nanoparticle catalysts tested here for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 °C under an atmosphere of hydrogen."

The synthesis of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles with a core-shell structure was achieved by mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles. These trimetallic nanoparticles exhibited a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure. They demonstrated high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30°C under an atmosphere of hydrogen, with an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm.
