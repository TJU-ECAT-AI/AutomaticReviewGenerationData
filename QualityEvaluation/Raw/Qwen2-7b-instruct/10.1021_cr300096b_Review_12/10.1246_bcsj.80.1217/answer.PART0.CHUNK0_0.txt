[1] "Colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized via self-organization by mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure, which were prepared in advance by a sacrificial hydrogen-reduction method."
[2] "The Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles appeared to have a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure on the basis of UV-vis absorption spectra, FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO, TEM, HR-TEM, and EF-TEM observation."
[3] "The spontaneously formed trimetallic nanoparticles having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal nanoparticle catalysts tested here for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30°C under atmosphere of hydrogen."

The synthesis of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles involved mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles. These bimetallic nanoparticles had a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure. The resulting trimetallic nanoparticles displayed a unique triple coreshell structure (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell). They exhibited the highest catalytic activity for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30°C under hydrogen atmosphere, thanks to their atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm.

聚合物保护的Pd/Ag/Rh三元纳米粒子的合成涉及将聚合物保护的Rh纳米粒子的胶体分散液与聚合物保护的Pd/Ag双金属纳米粒子的胶体分散液混合。这些双金属纳米粒子具有Pd核心/Ag壳的核壳结构。形成的三元纳米粒子表现出独特的三层核壳结构（Pd核心/Ag层/ Rh壳）。它们在30°C下对氢气气氛中的甲基丙烯酸氢化表现出最高的催化活性，这归功于它们的原子组成Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5和平均直径为2.2 nm。
