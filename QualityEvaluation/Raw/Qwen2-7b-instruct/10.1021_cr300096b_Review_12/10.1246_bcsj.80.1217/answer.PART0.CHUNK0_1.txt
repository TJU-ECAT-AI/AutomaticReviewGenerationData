[1] "Colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized via self-organization by mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure, which were prepared in advance by a sacrificial hydrogen-reduction method."
[2] "The Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles appeared to have a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure on the basis of UVvis absorption spectra, FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO, TEM, HR-TEM, and EF-TEM observation."
[3] "The spontaneously formed trimetallic nanoparticles having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal nanoparticle catalysts tested here for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 C under atmosphere of hydrogen."

The synthesis of Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles involved self-organization through the mixing of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with pre-prepared Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a coreshell structure. These trimetallic nanoparticles had a unique triple coreshell structure, consisting of a Pd core, an Ag interlayer, and a Rh shell. Their atomic composition was approximately 1:2:13.5, and they exhibited a high average diameter of 2.2 nm. Notably, these nanoparticles demonstrated superior catalytic activity compared to other metal nanoparticles when used for the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30°C under hydrogen atmosphere.

合成Pd/Ag/Rh三金属纳米粒子涉及通过将聚合物保护的Rh纳米粒子与预先准备的具有核壳结构的Pd/Ag双金属纳米粒子混合进行自我组织。这些三金属纳米粒子具有独特的三层核壳结构，包括一个Pd核心、一个Ag层间和一个Rh外壳。它们的原子组成大约为1:2:13.5，平均直径约为2.2nm。值得注意的是，当用于30°C下氢气气氛下的甲基丙烯酸酯氢化时，这些纳米粒子表现出显著的催化活性，高于其他金属纳米粒子。
