[1] "Colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized via self-organization by mixing colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure, which were prepared in advance by a sacrificial hydrogen-reduction method."
[2] "The Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles appeared to have a triple coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) structure on the basis of UVvis absorption spectra, FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO, TEM, HR-TEM, and EF-TEM observation."
[3] "Spontaneously formed trimetallic nanoparticles having an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm showed the highest catalytic activity among the metal nanoparticle catalysts tested here for hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30 C under atmosphere of hydrogen."

The synthesis of polymer-protected Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles was achieved through self-organization by combining colloidal dispersions of polymer-protected Rh nanoparticles with those of polymer-protected Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles featuring a coreshell (Pd-core/Ag-shell) structure. These nanoparticles exhibited a triple coreshell structure (Pd-core/Ag-interlayer/Rh-shell) as determined by various spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The trimetallic nanoparticles with an atomic ratio of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm demonstrated the highest catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate at 30°C under hydrogen atmosphere.

聚合物保护的Pd/Ag/Rh三元纳米粒子通过自我组织合成，通过将聚合物保护的Rh纳米颗粒的胶体分散液与具有壳芯（Pd核/Ag壳）结构的聚合物保护的Pd/Ag双金属纳米粒子的胶体分散液结合实现。这些纳米粒子表现出三层壳结构（Pd核/Ag层/ Rh壳），通过各种光谱和显微镜分析确定。原子比为Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5且平均直径为2.2 nm的三元纳米粒子在30°C下氢气气氛中对甲基丙烯酸的氢化表现出最高的催化活性。
