1. Preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen is crucial for obtaining CO-free hydrogen for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Supported Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) were found to be more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373-453 K.

2. The kinetic studies revealed that both Co and Cu atoms in the IMCs adsorb oxygen, improving oxygen adsorption on the surface compared to pure Pt, which led to higher activity at low temperatures.

3. In the presence of oxygen atoms, segregation into pure metal and oxide phases can occur if one component has a greater affinity to oxygen than the other.

4. The contribution of Pt3Co IMC to the preferential oxidation of CO was first identified in this study, showing that it is the most effective IMC for the reaction across a wide temperature range, while PtCo has greater activity but lower selectivity.

5. The weak adsorption of CO on the IMC surface is linked to the formation of IMCs, which alters the atomic distances between Pt atoms and their electronic state.

6. The amount of CO adsorbed at 298 K was significantly less on Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 compared to Pt/SiO2, reflecting the weak adsorption of CO on the IMC surface.

7. The TOFs (turnover frequencies) on Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 at 353 K were 0.84 and 0.52 s−1, respectively, demonstrating their high activity.

8. Electron-deficient Pt atoms on IMCs weakly adsorb CO due to decreased back-donation from Pt to CO, affecting the catalytic activity.

9. The surface compositions of Pt3Co and PtCu were similar to their bulk compositions, showing no significant enrichment at the surface.

10. The reaction order with respect to P(CO) was not zero for both IMC catalysts, indicating non-saturated CO adsorption.

11. The reaction order with respect to P(O2) was negative for PtCu/SiO2 in the presence of hydrogen but positive without hydrogen.

12. Hydrogen significantly enhanced the preferential oxidation activity of PtCu/SiO2 in the steady-state reaction, particularly by facilitating the adsorption of oxygen.

1. 在过剩氢中的CO选择性氧化是为质子交换膜燃料电池提供无CO氢的重要过程。在373-453 K的温度范围内，支持的Pt基间金属化合物（IMCs）比Pt/SiO2和Pt/Al2O3更活跃。

2. 动力学研究表明，IMCs中的Co和Cu原子也吸附氧气，改善了表面的氧吸附性能，导致低温下较高的活性。

3. 当反应物含有氧原子时，在其他元素对氧有更大亲和力的情况下，可能会发生纯金属和氧化物相的分离。

4. Pt3Co IMC对CO的选择性氧化贡献首次在本研究中被识别，表明它在广泛的温度范围内是最有效的IMC，而PtCo具有更高的活性但更低的选择性。

5. IMC表面弱吸附CO与IMC的形成有关，这改变了Pt原子之间的原子距离和它们的电子状态。

6. 在298 K时，Pt3Co/SiO2和PtCu/SiO2上吸附的CO量明显少于Pt/SiO2，反映了IMC表面弱吸附CO的特点。

7. 在353 K时，Pt3Co/SiO2和PtCu/SiO2的TOFs（周转频率）分别为0.84和0.52 s−1，显示其高活性。

8. 在IMC表面上，电子缺陷的Pt原子由于Pt到CO的回授减少，弱吸附CO，影响催化活性。

9. Pt3Co和PtCu的表面组成与它们的基体组成相似，表面没有明显的富集。

10. 对P(CO)的反应顺序不是零对于两种IMC催化剂，表明CO吸附没有饱和。
