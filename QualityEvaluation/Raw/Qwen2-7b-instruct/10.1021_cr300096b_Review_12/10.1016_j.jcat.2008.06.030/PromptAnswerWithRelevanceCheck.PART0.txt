<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The study found that Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 373 to 453 K. These IMC catalysts were stable during the reaction at 473 K without irreversible segregation at the surface. The high activity of Pt-based IMCs is related to the ready adsorption of oxygen under the reaction conditions compared to the surface of pure Pt. The formation of IMCs induced an extension of the Pt-Pt atomic distance (geographical effect) and an electron transfer from Pt to Co or Cu (electronic effect), which resulted in the weaker adsorption of CO on the IMC surface compared to the Pt surface.

2. The study evaluated the effect of composition in PtCo/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 on catalytic activity. It was found that the addition of Co onto Pt/SiO2 gradually shifted the peak position to greater angles, suggesting the formation of a solid solution between Pt and Pt3Co. The peak position of Pt3Co appeared at almost the same position as that of Pt3Co (40.5), indicating the presence of Pt3Co as the most effective IMC for the PROX reaction. Similarly, the addition of Cu on Pt/SiO2 shifted the diffraction peak to a greater angle, suggesting the formation of a solid solution between PtCu alloy and PtCu IMC. The diffraction from PtCu3 was observed for PtCu/SiO2 with a Pt/Cu ratio of 1, indicating the presence of PtCu as the most effective IMC between Pt and Cu for the PROX reaction.

3. The study performed kinetic studies to clarify the adsorption of reactant molecules under the stated reaction conditions. It was found that the reaction order with respect to CO and O2 was not zero for both IMC catalysts, indicating that CO adsorption is not saturated. The reaction proceeded through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite. The adsorption of CO was stronger than O2 adsorption irrespective of the presence or absence of hydrogen on Pt3Co/SiO2. Oxygen was adsorbed mainly on Co, because the IR spectra did not indicate CO adsorption on Co. Hydrogen contributed to the high PROX activity of PtCu/SiO2 at low temperatures.

4. The study also studied the enhancing effect of hydrogen on the PROX reaction. It was found that the weak enhancing effect was caused by the hydrogen itself on Pt3Co/SiO2. On the other hand, the addition of hydrogen increased CO conversion by 30% and further by the addition of water on PtCu/SiO2. The enhancing effect of water was reported for PtPd/CeO2 and FeOx/Pt/TiO2. Water molecules adsorbed on Cu may react with adjacent CO on Pt to form a carboxyl group, which accelerates the adsorption of oxygen to oxidize CO into CO2.

1. 研究发现，以二氧化硅为载体的Pt基互金属化合物（IMC）在373至453 K的温度范围内，对CO在过量氢气中的选择性氧化（PROX）比Pt/SiO2和Pt/Al2O3更活跃。这些IMC催化剂在473 K下反应时稳定，表面没有不可逆的分离。这些基于Pt的IMC的高活性与氧在反应条件下的快速吸附有关，与纯Pt表面相比。IMC的形成诱导了Pt-Pt原子距离的扩展（地理效应）以及Pt向Co或Cu的电子转移（电子效应），导致IMC表面CO的吸附较弱。 

2. 研究评估了PtCo/SiO2和PtCu/SiO2中成分对催化活性的影响。研究发现，将Co添加到Pt/SiO2上逐渐将峰位置转移到更大的角度，表明形成了Pt和Pt3Co之间的固溶体。Pt3Co的峰位置与Pt3Co（40.5）的位置几乎相同，表明Pt3Co是PROX反应中最有效的IMC。同样，将Cu添加到Pt/SiO2上将衍射峰位移至更大的角度，表明形成了PtCu合金与PtCu IMC之间的固溶体。对于具有Pt/Cu比例为1的PtCu/SiO2，观察到衍射来自PtCu3，表明存在PtCu作为Pt和Cu之间最有效的IMC进行PROX反应。

3. 研究还进行了动力学研究，以澄清在规定的反应条件下吸附反应物分子的情况。研究发现，对于两种IMC催化剂，CO和O2的反应顺序不是零，表明CO吸附未饱和。反应通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制进行，这已在PtFe/mordenite上提出。无论是否存在氢，Pt3Co/SiO2上的CO吸附强于O2吸附。氧主要吸附在Co上，因为红外光谱未显示Co上CO吸附。氢促进了PtCu/SiO2在低温下提高活性。

4. 研究还研究了氢对PROX反应的增强效果。研究发现，Pt3Co/SiO2中氢的微弱增强效果是由氢本身引起的。另一方面，氢的增加使PtCu/SiO2中的CO转化率提高了30%，并进一步增加了水。水对PtCu/SiO2的增强效果已报告在PtPd/CeO2和FeOx/Pt/TiO2上。水分子在Cu上可能与相邻的CO在Pt上反应形成羧基团，加速氧吸附氧化CO为CO2。
