[1] "Preferential oxidation of CO in an excess amount of hydrogen (PROX) is an important process for obtaining CO-free hydrogen for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."
[2] "However, from an economical standpoint, drawbacks of Pt catalysts include their low activity at temperatures around 370 K (the operating temperature of PEMFCs) and their low selectivity to CO2 due to the higher oxygen concentration to increase the activity."

[4] "The activity of PtSn/carbon compared with Pt/Al2O3 at 353 K. XPS and IR measurements revealed that most of the tin was present in the oxidized state, although some was reduced to form a PtSn solid solution."
[5] "When the reactant contains oxygen atoms, such segregation into pure metal and oxide phases can occur if one component element has a greater affinity to oxygen than the other."

1. The preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen is crucial for producing CO-free hydrogen for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, platinum catalysts face economic challenges due to their low activity at 370 K, the operating temperature of PEMFCs, and low CO2 selectivity due to increased oxygen concentration.

2. In the case of the PtSn catalyst, most of the tin was found in the oxidized state, while some was reduced to form a PtSn solid solution, as indicated by XPS and IR measurements. 

3. In another catalyst, platinum and gold seemed to exist in separate phases.

4. The PROX reaction on the PtSn/carbon catalyst was more active than on Pt/Al2O3 at 353 K. The measurements showed that most tin was in the oxidized state, with some reduced to form a PtSn solid solution.

5. If one component element has a higher affinity for oxygen than the other, segregation into pure metal and oxide phases can occur during the reaction when oxygen atoms are present in the reactant.

1. CO的优选氧化在过量氢中的过程对于获得用于质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）的无CO氢气至关重要。然而，从经济角度看，铂催化剂的缺点包括其在370 K（PEMFC的操作温度）附近的活性低以及由于氧气浓度增加而活性提高导致的较低CO2选择性。

2. 对于PtSn催化剂的研究显示，大部分锡处于氧化状态，而有些则被还原形成PtSn固溶体，这通过XPS和IR测量得到了证实。

3. 在另一个催化剂中，铂和金似乎以分离的相存在。

4. 在353 K时，PtSn/carbon催化剂相对于Pt/Al2O3表现出更高的PROX反应活性。测量结果显示，大部分锡处于氧化状态，部分则还原形成PtSn固溶体。

5. 当反应物中含有氧原子时，在氧亲和力较高的元素一方可能出现纯金属与氧化物相的分离。
