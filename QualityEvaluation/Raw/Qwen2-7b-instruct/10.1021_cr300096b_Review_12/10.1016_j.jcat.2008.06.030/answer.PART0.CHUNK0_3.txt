[1] "Preferential oxidation of CO in an excess amount of hydrogen (PROX) is an important process for obtaining CO-free hydrogen for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."
[2] "Supported platinum catalysts have been widely studied for the PROX reaction."
[3] "The activity of PtRu/SiO2 was found to be between the activities of Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 [2] , although the addition of Pt improved the dispersion of Ru."
[4] "Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are the stoichiometric compounds between two or more metal elements."
[5] "When Pt-based IMCs were used for H2D2 equilibration, Pt3Ge, Pt2Ge, and PtGe gave much lower activity than Pt [9] , and Pt3Ti and PtTi3 gave much higher activity than Pt [13] ."
[6] "This will change the catalytic properties of Pt for the PROX reaction."
[7] "Our aim was to clarify the catalytic properties of Pt-based IMCs for the PROX reaction and to obtain IMC catalysts that are active and selective for the formation of CO2 at lower temperatures."
[8] "All of the IMC catalysts demonstrated greater CO conversions than Pt/SiO2 at 453 K and below."
[9] "Because the combinations of both PtCo [26] and PtCu [27] have several IMC phases in their phase diagrams, we evaluated the effect of composition in PtCo/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 on catalytic activity."
[10] "At temperatures below 400 K, PtCo/SiO2 with Pt/Co = 1 gave the highest conversion."
[11] "Based on these findings, we conclude that Pt3Co was the most effective IMC for the PROX reaction in a wide temperature range."
[12] "Clearly, due to its high selectivity and high activity, Pt3Co/SiO2 is a better catalyst than PtCu/SiO2 for the PROX reaction."
[13] "The diffraction peaks of Pt3Co (1-A, B) and PtCu (2-A, B) did not change significantly, and no diffractions from other oxide species were observed, indicating no segregation in bulk of IMC phases during the reaction."
[14] "Based on the results shown in Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 , we conclude that Pt3Co was the most effective IMC for the PROX reaction in a wide temperature range."
[15] "The formation of IMCs drastically changed the adsorption behavior from pure Pt metal through changes in the atomic distance between the Pt atoms and the electronic state of Pt."
[16] "The adsorption of CO is weakened by IMC formation. The strong adsorption of CO on Pt hinders the adsorption of O2, resulting in low PROX activity at low temperatures. The weaker adsorption of CO on IMCs may be the reason why Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 exhibited greater PROX activity than Pt/SiO2."
[17] "The intensity of the linear CO band on the IMC catalysts was significantly lower than that on the Pt catalysts."
[18] "On both IMCs, the surface compositions were comparable to the bulk ones, Pt/Co = 3 and Pt/Cu = 1."
[19] "Comparing CO2 formation rates obtained with and without hydrogen reveals that the activity of Pt and Pt3Co increased slightly and that of PtCu increased significantly with the addition of hydrogen."
[20] "Such an enhancing effect of water has been reported for PtPd/CeO2 [4] and FeOx/Pt/TiO2 [33] ."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, influence CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions by altering the mechanisms and efficiencies through changes in their structure and reactivity. The addition of Pt improves the dispersion of other metals like Ru, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the catalyst. Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formed between Pt and other metals exhibit unique properties that can lead to improved catalytic activities.

2. The study aimed to understand the catalytic properties of Pt-based IMCs for the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) and develop catalysts that are active and selective for CO2 formation at lower temperatures.

3. IMCs showed greater CO conversions than Pt/SiO2 catalysts at temperatures below 453 K.

4. The combination of Pt and Co or Cu in bimetallic catalysts has several IMC phases, influencing the catalytic activity. At low temperatures, the Pt/Co = 1 composition gave the highest conversion for PtCo/SiO2.

5. The most effective IMC for the PROX reaction across a wide temperature range was found to be Pt3Co, while PtCu showed slightly lower selectivity due to the necessity of water for CO oxidation at low temperatures.

6. The stability of Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 catalysts was confirmed by the lack of significant changes in their XRD patterns during the PROX reaction at 473 K.

7. The adsorption of CO on IMCs was weaker than on pure Pt, which facilitated the adsorption of O2, leading to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

8. The intensity of the linear CO band on IMC catalysts was significantly lower than on Pt catalysts, indicating weaker CO adsorption.

9. The surface compositions of Pt3Co and PtCu IMCs were comparable to their bulk compositions, indicating uniform distribution of elements across the catalyst.

10. The addition of hydrogen and water enhanced the activity of Pt and Pt3Co catalysts, with water having a more significant impact on PtCu catalysts by accelerating O2 adsorption for CO oxidation.

11. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could correlate the findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing deeper insights into the structure-reactivity relationships.
