[1] "The effect of gold particle size and Au/FeO_x interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity using samples of Au/SiO_2/Si(100), Au/FeO_x/SiO_2/Si(100), FeO_x/Au/SiO_2/Si(100) has been modelled."
[2] "Nanosize gold particles of varying size were fabricated by deposition of a 10 nm thick gold film onto SiO_2/Si(100) substrate by electron beam evaporation followed by modification using low energy Ar+ ion bombardment or Ar+ ion implantation."
[3] "The gold/iron oxide interface was prepared by deposition of iron oxide using pulsed laser deposition (PLD)."
[4] "Generally, the formation of gold/iron oxide interface increases the catalytic activity in CO oxidation regardless of the sequence of deposition."
[5] "Furthermore, the interface formed is operative in determining the catalytic activity even if gold is not exposed to the surface, but it is located underneath the iron oxide layer."

This study models the impact of gold particle size and the Au/FeO_x interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity, specifically focusing on CO oxidation. It demonstrates that the formation of an interface between gold and iron oxide enhances the catalytic activity, even when gold is not directly exposed to the surface, highlighting the efficiency of this interface in determining the activity of the catalyst.
