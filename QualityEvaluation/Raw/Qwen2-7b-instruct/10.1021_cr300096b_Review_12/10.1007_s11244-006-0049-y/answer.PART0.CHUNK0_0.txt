The gold/iron oxide interface was prepared by deposition of iron oxide using pulsed laser deposition (PLD).
Generally, the formation of gold/iron oxide interface increases the catalytic activity in CO oxidation regardless of the sequence of deposition, namely either Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100) or FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) is formed.
Furthermore, the interface formed is operative in determining the catalytic activity even if gold is not exposed to the surface, but it is located underneath the iron oxide layer.
This is a promoting effect of the Au nanoparticles, which is more efficient than that of the bulk like Au films.

The modeling of the gold/iron oxide interface system in the study indicates that the formation of this interface significantly enhances the catalytic activity in CO oxidation, irrespective of the deposition sequence. The gold nanoparticles, even when not directly exposed to the surface due to their location beneath the iron oxide layer, still exert a promoting effect on the catalytic activity. This effect is notably more efficient than that observed in bulk gold films. The interface itself plays a crucial role in determining the overall catalytic performance.

研究中对金/氧化铁界面系统的建模表明，该界面的形成显著提高了CO氧化的催化活性，不论沉积顺序如何。即使金纳米粒子没有直接暴露在表面，由于它们位于氧化铁层之下，仍能发挥促进作用。这种效果明显优于纯金薄膜。界面本身在决定整体催化性能方面起着关键作用。
