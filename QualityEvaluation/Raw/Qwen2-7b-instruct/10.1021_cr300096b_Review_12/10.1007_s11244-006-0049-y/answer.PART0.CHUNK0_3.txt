[1] "The effect of gold particle size and Au/FeOx interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity using samples of Au/SiO2/Si(100), Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100), FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) has been modelled."
[2] "Nanosize gold particles of varying size were fabricated by deposition of a 10 nm thick gold film onto SiO2/Si(100) substrate by electron beam evaporation followed by modification using low energy Ar+ ion bombardment or Ar+ ion implantation."
[3] "Generally, the formation of gold/iron oxide interface increases the catalytic activity in CO oxidation regardless of the sequence of deposition, namely either Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100) or FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) is formed."
[4] "This is a promoting effect of the Au nanoparticles, which is more efficient than that of the bulk like Au films."

The modeling of gold/iron oxide interface systems demonstrated that the electronic properties and catalytic activity of these materials are significantly influenced by the size of gold particles and the presence of the Au/FeOx interface. Nanosize gold particles, created through specific fabrication methods, showed enhanced catalytic activity in CO oxidation reactions. The interface between gold and iron oxide, irrespective of the deposition sequence, was found to increase the catalytic activity. The presence of gold nanoparticles in the interface was noted to have a more efficient promoting effect compared to bulk gold films.
