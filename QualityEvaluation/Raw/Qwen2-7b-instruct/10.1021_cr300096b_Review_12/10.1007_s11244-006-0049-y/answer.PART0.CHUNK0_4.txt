[1] "The effect of gold particle size and Au/FeOx interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity using samples of Au/SiO2/Si(100), Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100), FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) has been modelled."
[2] "Nanosize gold particles of varying size were fabricated by deposition of a 10 nm thick gold film onto SiO2/Si(100) substrate by electron beam evaporation followed by modification using low energy Ar+ ion bombardment or Ar+ ion implantation."
[3] "Generally, the formation of gold/iron oxide interface increases the catalytic activity in CO oxidation regardless of the sequence of deposition, namely either Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100) or FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) is formed."
[4] "This is a promoting effect of the Au nanoparticles, which is more efficient than that of the bulk like Au films."

The study models the impact of gold particle size and the gold/iron oxide interface on electronic properties and catalytic activity, specifically in CO oxidation processes. By creating nanosized gold particles through deposition and modification techniques, the researchers observe increased activity in CO oxidation due to the formation of an interface with iron oxide. This interface effect enhances catalytic performance beyond that of bulk gold films, demonstrating the efficiency of gold nanoparticles in catalytic applications.
