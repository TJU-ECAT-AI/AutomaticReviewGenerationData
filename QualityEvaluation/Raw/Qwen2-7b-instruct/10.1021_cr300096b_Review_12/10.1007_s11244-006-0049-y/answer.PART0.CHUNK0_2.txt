[1] "The effect of gold particle size and Au/FeOx interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity using samples of Au/SiO2/Si(100), Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100), FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) has been modelled."
[2] "Nanosize gold particles of varying size were fabricated by deposition of a 10 nm thick gold film onto SiO2/Si(100) substrate by electron beam evaporation followed by modification using low energy Ar+ ion bombardment or Ar+ ion implantation."
[3] "Generally, the formation of gold/iron oxide interface increases the catalytic activity in CO oxidation regardless of the sequence of deposition, namely either Au/FeOx/SiO2/Si(100) or FeOx/Au/SiO2/Si(100) is formed."
[4] "Furthermore, the interface formed is operative in determining the catalytic activity even if gold is not exposed to the surface, but it is located underneath the iron oxide layer."

This study models the impact of gold particle size and the Au/FeOx interface on the electronic properties and catalytic activity in CO oxidation processes. The researchers fabricated nanosize gold particles through electron beam evaporation followed by low energy Ar+ ion bombardment or implantation. They observed that the formation of the gold/iron oxide interface enhances the catalytic activity in CO oxidation, regardless of the deposition sequence. The interface itself, even when not directly exposed to the surface, still influences the catalytic activity due to its presence beneath the iron oxide layer.

这项研究模拟了金颗粒尺寸和Au/FeOx界面对于CO氧化过程中的电子特性和催化活性的影响。研究人员通过电子束蒸发技术制备了纳米尺度的金颗粒，并随后通过低能Ar+离子轰击或植入进行了修饰。他们发现，无论沉积顺序如何，金/氧化铁界面的形成都能增加CO氧化的催化活性。即使金层并未直接暴露在表面，由于其位于氧化铁层之下，该界面仍然能够影响催化活性。
