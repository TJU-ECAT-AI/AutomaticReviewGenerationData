4.4.1 CO Oxidation
"Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."

"The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

"The bimetallic surface transformation study is also carried out over supported Pt3d transition metal (3d = Co, Ni, and Cu) nanoparticles treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres, and the reversible structural changes are also observed."

"Guided by the formation of FeO/Pt(111) surface after the oxidation treatment of Fe/Pt(111) and its importance in controlling PROX, Yao et al. (396) have prepared two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) surface with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure using a two-step process."

"The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."

"The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts."

"4.4.2 Water Gas Shift Reaction"
"Water gas shift (WGS) is an important reaction typically used during and after reforming to increase the yield of H2. CO is oxidized by H2O to produce an additional mole of H2 with CO2 as a waste gas. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, (386, 387) Co, (386) and Au. (388)"

"4.4.3 CH4 Conversion"
"The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel. (289) PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. (390)"

The utilization of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on platinum (Pt), plays a significant role in enhancing the efficiency and mechanisms of CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The insights gained from these studies can potentially inform future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies, aiming to correlate the properties of model surfaces with those of supported catalysts. Despite the current limitations in conducting UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, the existing reactor data suggests that the bimetallic structure can influence the reactivity and stability of the catalysts. For instance, reversible surface transformations between different bimetallic structures, such as FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111), can be controlled through alternating oxidation and reduction treatments. Moreover, the preparation of two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) surfaces demonstrates the potential for enhancing CO oxidation through interface confinement effects. These findings, when correlated with the results from model surfaces, can offer valuable insights into the design and optimization of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for industrial applications.
