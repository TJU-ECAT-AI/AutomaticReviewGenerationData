[1] "Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."
[2] "On the basis of the binding energies of adsorbed CO, O, and H, as well as the activation barriers for elemental reaction steps of CO and H oxidation, Pt-terminated Pt3Ni(111) is identified as an optimum catalyst for CO PROX in excess of hydrogen."
[3] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."
[4] "The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."
[5] "Catalysts with low Mn content show no improvement in catalytic activity, but CO oxidation activity increases dramatically in catalysts with compositions of Mn above 8 wt %. In the presence of CO2, catalytic activity increases and CO conversion reaches 100% for the 15 wt % Mn, PtMn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel."
[7] "For example, PtCo supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics."
[8] "These findings are confirmed by Arishtirova et al., who find that the addition of Pt to Ni catalysts supported on a NaZSM-5 zeolite leads to better reducibility of the catalyst, higher Ni dispersion, and increased activity and stability for CH4 reforming by CO2."

The utilization of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, in reactor studies for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions demonstrates significant efficiency enhancements. These catalysts enable the reversible control of surface structures, such as the FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) configurations for CO oxidation, and the NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces for PtNi systems. Moreover, the addition of specific metals like Mn and Co to the Pt base improves CO oxidation activity, especially in the presence of CO2, and allows for higher conversion rates. The self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics of PtCo catalysts on MgAl2O4, as well as the improved reducibility, Ni dispersion, and activity and stability for CH4 reforming by CO2, highlight the potential of these bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the overall efficiency of these reactions.

Future UHV studies, aiming to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts, could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving the enhanced performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. These studies might uncover the precise interactions between the bimetallic surfaces and their environment, offering a clearer understanding of how surface structures and compositions affect reaction kinetics and product yields. This knowledge could guide the design of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions, potentially leading to advancements in energy production and conversion technologies.
