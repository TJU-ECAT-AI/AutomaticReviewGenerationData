1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They offer enhanced activity compared to monometallic catalysts, often due to improved dispersion, reduced segregation of subsurface metals, and synergistic effects between the metals. The studies highlight the potential for future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms more comprehensively. While current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces exist, these findings suggest that such studies could provide valuable insights into the behavior of these catalysts under ultra-high vacuum conditions.

2. The potential insights from future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could significantly contribute to the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. By correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts, researchers might uncover details on how surface structures and compositions affect catalytic activity and stability. This knowledge could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts, potentially improving the performance of fuel cells and other chemical conversion processes. The findings suggest that bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, could offer enhanced performance through optimized metal interactions and surface structures, which could be further refined and optimized under UHV conditions.

3. The review discusses the extensive utilization of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells, particularly in PEMFCs, for both anodic and cathodic reactions. The study highlights the promising use of PtRu and PtRh-based catalysts as anodes for the electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol, respectively. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with subsurface Pt3dPt structures, are found to be effective due to their optimized binding with atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The review acknowledges the challenge of preventing the segregation of subsurface metals to the surface, which can be thermodynamically favorable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The basic principles, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques discussed in the review are considered relevant to Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts, and interested readers are directed to recent reviews on bimetallic electrocatalysts for further exploration.

4. Recent studies indicate that trimetallic catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to both monometallic and bimetallic systems. For instance, the addition of Sn to the bimetallic PtIr catalyst increases the stability of the catalysts and enhances the selectivity toward toluene in n-heptane reforming. The Au/Co/Fe triple-layered coreshell nanoparticles demonstrate much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane than their monometallic counterparts. Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles exhibit high hydrogenation activity of methyl acrylate, suggesting that the presence of Au facilitates the FePt structure transformation from a chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to a chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure. The mechanism behind the promoted reactivity in trimetallic catalysts involves the synergistic effect between the three different nanostructure components, such as sphere, shell, and islands, as demonstrated by Fang et al. on Au@Pd@Pt NPs, and the presence of Au in FePtAu nanoparticles facilitating the transformation of the FePt structure.
