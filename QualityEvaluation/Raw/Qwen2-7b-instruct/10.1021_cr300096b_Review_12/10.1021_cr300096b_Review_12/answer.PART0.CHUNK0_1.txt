4.4.1 CO Oxidation
"Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."

"Studies on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts."

"The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ results in enhancement of catalytic performance, especially in the temperature region below 423 K."

"Findings by Komatsu and Tamura agree that PtCo/SiO2 catalysts are more effective for PROX than either parent metal."

4.4.2 Water Gas Shift Reaction
"Water gas shift (WGS) is an important reaction typically used during and after reforming to increase the yield of H2."

"Reports by Choung et al show that PtRe catalysts display higher activity because Re increases Pt dispersion on TiO2 and γ-Al2O3."

"Adding Pt to a Au/CeO2 catalyst is much more active for WGS than either parent metal."

"Kugai et al examine the enhancement of water gas shift by the addition of oxygen to the feed stream (OWGS)."

4.4.3 CH4 Conversion
"The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel."

"Studies on catalytic combustion of CH4 over PtPd catalysts show that the bimetallic outperforms monometallic Pd catalysts independent of the catalyst support."

"Castellazzi et al have found that the effect of Pt on PdO for CH4 combustion depends on several factors such as the extent of PdO bond formation and the strength of the Pdsupport interaction."

"Pinheiro et al show that PtNi supported on polytype A of beta-zeolite (BEA) zeolites has superior activity and stability for dry reforming of methane."

4.5 Brief Summary of Pt-Based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts
"Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized for both anodic and cathodic reactions in low-temperature fuel cells, in particular PEMFCs."

"Similar to that described for the hydrogenation reaction in section 4.1, the subsurface Pt3dPt structures are preferred for the ORR reaction due to optimized binding with atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups."

"Preventing the segregation of subsurface 3d metals to the surface is one of the challenges."

4.6 Brief Summary of Trimetallic Catalysts
"Some recent studies show that trimetallic catalysts exhibit better performance than both monometallic and bimetallic systems."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They offer enhanced activity compared to monometallic catalysts, often due to improved dispersion, reduced segregation of subsurface metals, and synergistic effects between the metals. The studies highlight the potential for future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms more comprehensively. While current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces exist, these findings suggest that such studies could provide valuable insights into the behavior of these catalysts under ultra-high vacuum conditions.

2. The potential insights from future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could significantly contribute to the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. By correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts, researchers might uncover details on how surface structures and compositions affect catalytic activity and stability. This knowledge could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts, potentially improving the performance of fuel cells and other chemical conversion processes. The findings suggest that bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, could offer enhanced performance through optimized metal interactions and surface structures, which could be further refined and optimized under UHV conditions.

3. The review discusses the extensive utilization of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells, particularly in PEMFCs, for both anodic and cathodic reactions. The study highlights the promising use of PtRu and PtRh-based catalysts as anodes for the electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol, respectively. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with subsurface Pt3dPt structures, are found to be effective due to their optimized binding with atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The review acknowledges the challenge of preventing the segregation of subsurface metals to the surface, which can be thermodynamically favorable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The basic principles, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques discussed in the review are considered relevant to Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts, and interested readers are directed to recent reviews on bimetallic electrocatalysts for further exploration.

4. Recent studies indicate that trimetallic catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to both monometallic and bimetallic systems. For instance, the addition of Sn to the bimetallic PtIr catalyst increases the stability of the catalysts and enhances the selectivity toward toluene in n-heptane reforming. The Au/Co/Fe triple-layered coreshell nanoparticles demonstrate much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane than their monometallic counterparts. Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles exhibit high hydrogenation activity of methyl acrylate, suggesting that the presence of Au facilitates the FePt structure transformation from a chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to a chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure. The mechanism behind the promoted reactivity in trimetallic catalysts involves the synergistic effect between the three different nanostructure components, such as sphere, shell, and islands, as demonstrated by Fang et al. on Au@Pd@Pt NPs, and the presence of Au in FePtAu nanoparticles facilitating the transformation of the FePt structure.
