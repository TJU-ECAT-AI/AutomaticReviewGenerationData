4.4.1 CO Oxidation
"Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)."
"The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts."
"Guided by the formation of FeO/Pt(111) surface after the oxidation treatment of Fe/Pt(111) and its importance in controlling PROX, Yao et al. (396) have prepared two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) surface with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure using a two-step process."
"The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."

4.4.2 Water Gas Shift Reaction
"Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, (386, 387) Co, (386) and Au. (388)"

4.4.3 CH4 Conversion
"The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel."
"PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on platinum, play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions. In reactor studies, they offer improved performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. The specific mechanisms involve optimized binding with reactants, facilitated chain growth, and enhanced reducibility, among others. Insights from model surfaces and supported catalysts could significantly benefit future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies by providing a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry involved.

2. Platinum-based bimetallic catalysts demonstrate enhanced activity in the water gas shift reaction. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of the alloyed metals and their dispersion, which contribute to the overall catalytic performance. The role of the support in the WGS chemistry is also acknowledged, with the introduction of platinum leading to more active catalysts.

3. Platinum-based catalysts effectively convert methane into more complex products, showcasing higher conversion rates than their monometallic equivalents. This highlights the benefits of bimetallic systems in utilizing methane as a versatile feedstock for hydrogen production, synthesis of complex molecules, and as a direct fuel.
