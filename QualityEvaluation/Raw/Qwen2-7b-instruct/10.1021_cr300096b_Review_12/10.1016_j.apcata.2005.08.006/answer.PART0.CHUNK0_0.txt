<p>The presence of chlorine on the alumina support strongly increases its Brnsted acidity. The deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface, confirming that tin is deposited on both the bimetallic phase and the support. Moreover, the presence of citric acid, leading to the decrease of the chlorine content, induces a drop of the Brnsted acidity.</p>
<p>As far as Lewis acidity is concerned, in our activation conditions, the presence of chlorine, provided by the tin precursor, in the environment of tin, is likely to be at the origin of a part of the Lewis acidity. The Lewis acidity is also influenced by the nature of the parent metallic phase.</p>
<p>The effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium is to decrease the initial activity in n-heptane conversion and to increase the stability of the trimetallic catalysts, compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid, by favouring the interaction between tin and the active metallic phase, by decreasing the chlorine content and then the Brnsted acidity. Moreover, the toluene yield is increased with lower cracking and hydrogenolysis activities, leading to less gaseous products.</p>
<p>It seems that the toluene yield is a function of the amount of Lewis acid sites for both bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic PtIrSn catalysts, the highest the toluene yield, the highest the total amount of Lewis acid sites. The addition of tin increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. Moreover, the same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. However, less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The coke deposition induces a decrease of the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. This decrease of the amount of strong Lewis acid sites involves an increase in the isomer yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 h of reaction. However, in most cases the highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke laid-down. It seems that only few metallic sites take part in the n-heptane conversion at high-pressure since the metal function is strongly affected by the presence of coke but the catalysts remain active after 65 h of reaction.</p>
<p>To conclude, it was demonstrated in the present study that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.</p>

The presence of tin on the bimetallic catalyst reduces its Brnsted acidity, which is not offset by the chlorine promoting effect. The addition of citric acid decreases the chlorine content, thus reducing the Brnsted acidity further. The Lewis acidity is influenced by the presence of chlorine and the nature of the parent metallic phase. The use of citric acid in the preparation medium decreases the initial activity in n-heptane conversion but enhances the stability of the catalysts, leading to a higher toluene yield due to decreased cracking and hydrogenolysis activities. Coke deposition decreases the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, increasing isomer yield. There is no straightforward correlation between coke amount and activity after 65 hours of reaction. The addition of an inactive promoter can replace the sulfiding step for PtIr catalysts, altering both their metal function and acidity.

在本研究中，锡的存在减少了双金属催化剂的Brnsted酸性，这种作用无法被氯化物的促进效果抵消。添加柠檬酸可以降低氯含量，进一步降低Brnsted酸性。Lewis酸性受到氯的存在和母金属相的性质的影响。在制备介质中加入柠檬酸降低了初始的庚烷转化活性，但增强了催化剂的稳定性，导致更高的甲苯产率，由于裂解和氢解活性的减少。焦炭沉积减少了强Lewis和Brnsted酸位点的数量，增加了异构化产物的产率。焦炭量与65小时后反应的活性之间没有简单的相关性。在PtIr催化剂中添加一个惰性促进剂可以替代需要降低氢解活性的硫化步骤，同时改变了它们的金属功能和酸性。
