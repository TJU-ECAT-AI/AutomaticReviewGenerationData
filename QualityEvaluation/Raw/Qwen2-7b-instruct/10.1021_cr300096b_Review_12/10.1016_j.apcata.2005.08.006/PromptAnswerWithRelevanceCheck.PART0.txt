How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

<quotes>
<p>The presence of chlorine on the alumina support strongly increases its Brnsted acidity. The deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface, confirming that tin is deposited on both the bimetallic phase and the support. Moreover, the presence of citric acid, leading to the decrease of the chlorine content, induces a drop of the Brnsted acidity.</p>
<p>As far as Lewis acidity is concerned, in our activation conditions, the presence of chlorine, provided by the tin precursor, in the environment of tin, is likely to be at the origin of a part of the Lewis acidity. The Lewis acidity is also influenced by the nature of the parent metallic phase.</p>
<p>The effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium is to decrease the initial activity in n-heptane conversion and to increase the stability of the trimetallic catalysts, compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid, by favouring the interaction between tin and the active metallic phase, by decreasing the chlorine content and then the Brnsted acidity. Moreover, the toluene yield is increased with lower cracking and hydrogenolysis activities, leading to less gaseous products.</p>
<p>It seems that the toluene yield is a function of the amount of Lewis acid sites for both bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic PtIrSn catalysts, the highest the toluene yield, the highest the total amount of Lewis acid sites. The addition of tin increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. Moreover, the same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. However, less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The coke deposition induces a decrease of the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. This decrease of the amount of strong Lewis acid sites involves an increase in the isomer yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 h of reaction. However, in most cases the highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke laid-down. It seems that only few metallic sites take part in the n-heptane conversion at high-pressure since the metal function is strongly affected by the presence of coke but the catalysts remain active after 65 h of reaction.</p>
<p>To conclude, it was demonstrated in the present study that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.</p>

The presence of tin on the bimetallic catalyst reduces its Brnsted acidity, which is not offset by the chlorine promoting effect. The addition of citric acid decreases the chlorine content, thus reducing the Brnsted acidity further. The Lewis acidity is influenced by the presence of chlorine and the nature of the parent metallic phase. The use of citric acid in the preparation medium decreases the initial activity in n-heptane conversion but enhances the stability of the catalysts, leading to a higher toluene yield due to decreased cracking and hydrogenolysis activities. Coke deposition decreases the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, increasing isomer yield. There is no straightforward correlation between coke amount and activity after 65 hours of reaction. The addition of an inactive promoter can replace the sulfiding step for PtIr catalysts, altering both their metal function and acidity.

在本研究中，锡的存在减少了双金属催化剂的Brnsted酸性，这种作用无法被氯化物的促进效果抵消。添加柠檬酸可以降低氯含量，进一步降低Brnsted酸性。Lewis酸性受到氯的存在和母金属相的性质的影响。在制备介质中加入柠檬酸降低了初始的庚烷转化活性，但增强了催化剂的稳定性，导致更高的甲苯产率，由于裂解和氢解活性的减少。焦炭沉积减少了强Lewis和Brnsted酸位点的数量，增加了异构化产物的产率。焦炭量与65小时后反应的活性之间没有简单的相关性。在PtIr催化剂中添加一个惰性促进剂可以替代需要降低氢解活性的硫化步骤，同时改变了它们的金属功能和酸性。

The document discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, affect the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The presence of chlorine on the alumina support increases its Brnsted acidity. The deposition of tin on the catalyst reduces the Brnsted acidity, despite the chlorine promoting effect. Adding citric acid reduces the chlorine content and decreases the Brnsted acidity further. The toluene yield is positively correlated with the amount of Lewis acid sites. Coke deposition decreases the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, affecting the catalyst's activity. There is no straightforward correlation between the amount of coke and catalyst activity. However, in most cases, higher conversion corresponds to less coke deposition. The metal function is significantly impacted by coke presence, yet the catalysts maintain activity under high-pressure conditions.

文档讨论了双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响。铝氧支撑物上的氯的存在显著提高了其Brnsted酸性。在催化剂上沉积锡降低了Brnsted酸性，尽管氯具有促进作用。添加柠檬酸减少了氯含量并进一步降低了Brnsted酸性。叔丁醇的产量与Lewis酸中心的数量成正比。焦炭沉积减少了强Lewis和Brnsted酸中心的数量，影响了催化剂的活性。焦炭沉积量与催化剂活性之间没有直接关系。然而，在大多数情况下，较高的转化率对应于较少的焦炭沉积。金属功能受到焦炭存在的显著影响，但催化剂在高压条件下仍保持活性。

The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, affect the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The findings suggest that the addition of tin to these catalysts can improve their stability and selectivity towards toluene production, despite potentially reducing their overall activity. The literature also highlights that the deposition of tin affects both the metallic function and the acidity of the catalyst. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are noted, which could hinder the full understanding of these complex interactions.

文献讨论了铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响。发现向这些催化剂中添加锡可以提高它们的稳定性并增强其对苯乙烯的选择性，尽管可能降低整体活性。文献还指出，锡的沉积不仅影响金属功能，也改变了催化剂的酸性。未来在超高真空（UHV）研究中对Pt基双金属表面进行研究可能会为通过模型表面和负载催化剂理解这些复杂相互作用提供见解。然而，文献提到了UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的限制，这可能会阻碍对这些复杂相互作用的全面理解。

Catalytic properties in n-heptane reforming of PtSn and PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction Abstract Multimetallic PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by surface redox reaction, were tested in the conversion of n-heptane, used as model reaction of paraffin dehydrocyclization, under industrial-type conditions. Their catalytic performances were measured after 5 and 65 h of reaction in order to evaluate the stability of the catalysts, and compared to those of a well-known PtSn bimetallic catalyst as a function of the preparation medium, of the tin and iridium contents, of the chorine content and of the resulting acidity, and of the amount of coke deposited. The addition of tin to the monometallic Pt and to the bimetallic PtIr increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. The same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of reaction, but less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalyst. Similar evolutions between the toluene yield and the amount of Lewis acid sites were observed: the highest amount of Lewis sites, the highest toluene yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke deposited after 65 h of reaction and the activity in n-heptane conversion. The coke deposition affects the strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. Whereas catalysts are strongly deactivated after 65 h of reaction for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, they are still active for the n-heptane transformation at higher pressures that means that only few metallic sites take part in this reaction. It was demonstrated that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.

In the study, bimetallic PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via surface redox reaction were utilized for n-heptane conversion under industrial-like conditions. The catalysts' performance was assessed post 5 and 65 hours of reaction to gauge their stability, comparing them to a well-known PtSn bimetallic catalyst. The addition of tin to the monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtIr enhances catalyst stability and toluene selectivity. The same toluene yield was achieved with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 hours of reaction, requiring less tin in the trimetallic catalyst scenario. The toluene yield was observed to correlate with the amount of Lewis acid sites: the higher the amount of Lewis sites, the higher the toluene yield. No straightforward connection exists between the amount of coke deposited after 65 hours of reaction and the n-heptane conversion activity. Coke deposition impacts strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. While catalysts become significantly inactive for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure after 65 hours of reaction, they remain active for n-heptane transformation at higher pressures, suggesting only a few metallic sites participate in this reaction. It was shown that adding an inactive promoter to a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step required to reduce hydrogenolysis activity. However, tin deposition alters not only the metal function but also the catalyst's acidity.

在研究中，通过表面还原反应制备的多金属PtIrSn/Al2O3催化剂被用于庚烷转化下的工业条件。催化剂性能在反应后5小时和65小时进行评估，以评估其稳定性，并与一种知名的PtSn双金属催化剂进行比较。向单金属Pt和双金属PtIr中添加锡可以提高催化剂的稳定性和对二甲苯的选择性。在65小时反应后，使用双金属和三金属催化剂获得相同的二甲苯产率，但需要较少的锡在三金属催化剂中。观察到二甲苯产率与Lewis酸位点的数量之间存在相似的变化：Lewis酸位点数量最多，二甲苯产率也最高。反应65小时后沉积的焦炭量与庚烷转化活性之间没有简单的联系。焦炭沉积影响强Lewis和Brnsted酸位。虽然催化剂在大气压力下65小时反应后对环己烷脱氢化变得显著无活性，但在较高压力下对庚烷转化仍保持活性，表明只有少数金属位点参与此反应。证明向双金属PtIr催化剂中添加不活性促进剂可以替代减少此类催化剂氢解活性所需的硫化步骤。然而，锡沉积不仅改变了金属功能，还改变了催化剂的酸性。
