<p>The presence of chlorine on the alumina support strongly increases its Brnsted acidity.</p>
<p>The deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface, confirming that tin is deposited on both the bimetallic phase and the support.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of citric acid, leading to the decrease of the chlorine content, induces a drop of the Brnsted acidity.</p>
<p>As far as Lewis acidity is concerned, in our activation conditions, the presence of chlorine, provided by the tin precursor, in the environment of tin, is likely to be at the origin of a part of the Lewis acidity.</p>
<p>The Lewis acidity is also influenced by the nature of the parent metallic phase.</p>
<p>The effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium is to decrease the initial activity in n-heptane conversion and to increase the stability of the trimetallic catalysts, compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid, by favouring the interaction between tin and the active metallic phase, by decreasing the chlorine content and then the Brnsted acidity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the toluene yield is increased with lower cracking and hydrogenolysis activities, leading to less gaseous products.</p>
<p>The coke deposition induces a decrease of the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites.</p>
<p>This decrease of the amount of strong Lewis acid sites involves an increase in the isomer yield.</p>
<p>There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 h of reaction.</p>

The literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, affect the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The findings suggest that the addition of tin to these catalysts can improve their stability and selectivity towards toluene production, despite potentially reducing their overall activity. The literature also highlights that the deposition of tin affects both the metallic function and the acidity of the catalyst. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are noted, which could hinder the full understanding of these complex interactions.

文献讨论了铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响。发现向这些催化剂中添加锡可以提高它们的稳定性并增强其对苯乙烯的选择性，尽管可能降低整体活性。文献还指出，锡的沉积不仅影响金属功能，也改变了催化剂的酸性。未来在超高真空（UHV）研究中对Pt基双金属表面进行研究可能会为通过模型表面和负载催化剂理解这些复杂相互作用提供见解。然而，文献提到了UHV研究中对Pt基双金属表面的限制，这可能会阻碍对这些复杂相互作用的全面理解。
