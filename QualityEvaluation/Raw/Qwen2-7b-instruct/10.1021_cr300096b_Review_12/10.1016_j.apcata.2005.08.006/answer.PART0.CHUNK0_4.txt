Catalytic properties in n-heptane reforming of PtSn and PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction Abstract Multimetallic PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by surface redox reaction, were tested in the conversion of n-heptane, used as model reaction of paraffin dehydrocyclization, under industrial-type conditions. Their catalytic performances were measured after 5 and 65 h of reaction in order to evaluate the stability of the catalysts, and compared to those of a well-known PtSn bimetallic catalyst as a function of the preparation medium, of the tin and iridium contents, of the chorine content and of the resulting acidity, and of the amount of coke deposited. The addition of tin to the monometallic Pt and to the bimetallic PtIr increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. The same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of reaction, but less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalyst. Similar evolutions between the toluene yield and the amount of Lewis acid sites were observed: the highest amount of Lewis sites, the highest toluene yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke deposited after 65 h of reaction and the activity in n-heptane conversion. The coke deposition affects the strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. Whereas catalysts are strongly deactivated after 65 h of reaction for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, they are still active for the n-heptane transformation at higher pressures that means that only few metallic sites take part in this reaction. It was demonstrated that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.

In the study, bimetallic PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via surface redox reaction were utilized for n-heptane conversion under industrial-like conditions. The catalysts' performance was assessed post 5 and 65 hours of reaction to gauge their stability, comparing them to a well-known PtSn bimetallic catalyst. The addition of tin to the monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtIr enhances catalyst stability and toluene selectivity. The same toluene yield was achieved with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 hours of reaction, requiring less tin in the trimetallic catalyst scenario. The toluene yield was observed to correlate with the amount of Lewis acid sites: the higher the amount of Lewis sites, the higher the toluene yield. No straightforward connection exists between the amount of coke deposited after 65 hours of reaction and the n-heptane conversion activity. Coke deposition impacts strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. While catalysts become significantly inactive for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure after 65 hours of reaction, they remain active for n-heptane transformation at higher pressures, suggesting only a few metallic sites participate in this reaction. It was shown that adding an inactive promoter to a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step required to reduce hydrogenolysis activity. However, tin deposition alters not only the metal function but also the catalyst's acidity.

在研究中，通过表面还原反应制备的多金属PtIrSn/Al2O3催化剂被用于庚烷转化下的工业条件。催化剂性能在反应后5小时和65小时进行评估，以评估其稳定性，并与一种知名的PtSn双金属催化剂进行比较。向单金属Pt和双金属PtIr中添加锡可以提高催化剂的稳定性和对二甲苯的选择性。在65小时反应后，使用双金属和三金属催化剂获得相同的二甲苯产率，但需要较少的锡在三金属催化剂中。观察到二甲苯产率与Lewis酸位点的数量之间存在相似的变化：Lewis酸位点数量最多，二甲苯产率也最高。反应65小时后沉积的焦炭量与庚烷转化活性之间没有简单的联系。焦炭沉积影响强Lewis和Brnsted酸位。虽然催化剂在大气压力下65小时反应后对环己烷脱氢化变得显著无活性，但在较高压力下对庚烷转化仍保持活性，表明只有少数金属位点参与此反应。证明向双金属PtIr催化剂中添加不活性促进剂可以替代减少此类催化剂氢解活性所需的硫化步骤。然而，锡沉积不仅改变了金属功能，还改变了催化剂的酸性。
