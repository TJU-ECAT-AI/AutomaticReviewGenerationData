[1] "In order to evaluate the role of the metallic and acidic functions in the n-heptane conversion, the activities of an acidic catalyst, the chlorinated alumina and of a metallic one, presulfided bimetallic 0.30.3Ir deposited on a non-acidic support, silica, were compared to that of a bifunctional catalyst, the presulfided 0.3Pt0.3Ir/ClAl2O3 catalyst."
[2] "There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke deposited and the activity in n-heptane conversion at 65 h."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of the metallic and acidic functions in the n-heptane conversion was assessed by comparing the activities of an acidic catalyst (chlorinated alumina), a metallic catalyst (presulfided bimetallic 0.30.3Ir on silica), and a bifunctional catalyst (presulfided 0.3Pt0.3Ir/ClAl2O3). No straightforward correlation exists between the amount of coke deposited and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 hours.

为了评估金属和酸性功能在庚烷转化中的作用，比较了一个酸性催化剂（氯化氧化铝）、一个金属催化剂（硫化的双金属0.30.3Ir在硅上）和一个双功能催化剂（硫化的0.3Pt0.3Ir/ClAl2O3）。在65小时后，沉积的焦炭量与庚烷转化活性之间没有简单的相关关系。

[1] "The highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke laid-down."
[2] "It was demonstrated that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The highest conversion efficiency is associated with the lowest amount of deposited coke. It was shown that adding an inactive promoter to a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding process required to reduce the hydrogenolysis activity of this kind of catalyst.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
最高的转化率与沉积的焦炭最少有关。已经证明，在双金属PtIr催化剂中添加一种不活泼的促进剂可以取代降低这类催化剂氢解活性所需的硫化步骤。
