[1] "The presence of chlorine on the alumina support strongly increases its Brnsted acidity."
[2] "The deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface, confirming that tin is deposited on both the bimetallic phase and the support."
[3] "Moreover, the presence of citric acid, leading to the decrease of the chlorine content, induces a drop of the Brnsted acidity."
[4] "The effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium is to decrease the initial activity in n-heptane conversion and to increase the stability of the trimetallic catalysts, compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid, by favouring the interaction between tin and the active metallic phase, by decreasing the chlorine content and then the Brnsted acidity."
[5] "It seems that the toluene yield is a function of the amount of Lewis acid sites for both bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic PtIrSn catalysts, the highest the toluene yield, the highest the total amount of Lewis acid sites."
[6] "The coke deposition induces a decrease of the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites."
[7] "There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 h of reaction."
[8] "However, in most cases the highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke laid-down."
[9] "It seems that only few metallic sites take part in the n-heptane conversion at high-pressure since the metal function is strongly affected by the presence of coke but the catalysts remain active after 65 h of reaction."

The document discusses how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, affect the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The presence of chlorine on the alumina support increases its Brnsted acidity. The deposition of tin on the catalyst reduces the Brnsted acidity, despite the chlorine promoting effect. Adding citric acid reduces the chlorine content and decreases the Brnsted acidity further. The toluene yield is positively correlated with the amount of Lewis acid sites. Coke deposition decreases the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, affecting the catalyst's activity. There is no straightforward correlation between the amount of coke and catalyst activity. However, in most cases, higher conversion corresponds to less coke deposition. The metal function is significantly impacted by coke presence, yet the catalysts maintain activity under high-pressure conditions.

文档讨论了双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率的影响。铝氧支撑物上的氯的存在显著提高了其Brnsted酸性。在催化剂上沉积锡降低了Brnsted酸性，尽管氯具有促进作用。添加柠檬酸减少了氯含量并进一步降低了Brnsted酸性。叔丁醇的产量与Lewis酸中心的数量成正比。焦炭沉积减少了强Lewis和Brnsted酸中心的数量，影响了催化剂的活性。焦炭沉积量与催化剂活性之间没有直接关系。然而，在大多数情况下，较高的转化率对应于较少的焦炭沉积。金属功能受到焦炭存在的显著影响，但催化剂在高压条件下仍保持活性。
