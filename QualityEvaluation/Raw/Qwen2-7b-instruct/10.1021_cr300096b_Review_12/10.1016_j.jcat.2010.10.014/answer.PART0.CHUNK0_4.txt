The study demonstrates that the addition of oxygen to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction significantly enhances CO conversion and H2 production on ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly in the temperature range of 200 to 300 C. The enhanced efficiency is attributed to the partial oxidation of chemisorbed CO, which creates more active sites for H2O adsorption and reaction. Bimetallic catalysts, specifically those containing Pt or Pd, exhibit higher activity for the oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) process compared to monometallic catalysts, although the improvement in WGS activity is less pronounced. The strong interaction between Pt and Cu or Pd and Cu, indicated by the TPR and OSC measurements, contributes to the bimetallic catalysts' increased resistance to oxidation. This structure, characterized by highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu, also enables CO2 desorption and reduces the surface carbonate on CeO2. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates the desorption of CO2.

研究显示，在铈氧化物支持的双金属催化剂上，微量氧气的添加能显著提高200至300摄氏度范围内的CO转化率和H2产量。这种增强效果归因于部分氧化吸附的CO，从而创造出更多活性位点用于H2O吸附与反应。含Pt或Pd的双金属催化剂在氧增强水煤气转换（OWGS）过程中表现出更高的活性，与单金属催化剂相比，OWGS过程中的活性优势更为明显。通过TPR和OSC测量发现，Pt和Cu或Pd和Cu之间存在强烈的相互作用，这使得双金属催化剂对氧化的抵抗力增强。这种结构特征表现为Pt在Cu或Pd在Cu中的高度分散。此外，这种结构也能够促进CO2脱附并减少CeO2表面的碳酸盐含量。在PdCu/CeO2中，Cu的存在有助于CO2脱附。
