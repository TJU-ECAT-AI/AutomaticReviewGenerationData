[1] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."
[2] "The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric)."
[3] "These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu."
[4] "EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd."
[5] "The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, showed higher efficiency in the oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) reaction compared to monometallic catalysts. They were more effective in converting carbon monoxide and producing hydrogen. However, their superiority was less pronounced in the conventional water gas shift (WGS) reaction.

2. The interaction between the metals in bimetallic catalysts, such as between Pt and Cu, or Pd and Cu, made the catalysts less prone to oxidation, which is beneficial for maintaining their activity under oxidative conditions.

3. The enhanced activity of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the unique structure of these catalysts, which allows for highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu. This dispersion facilitates the reaction by creating more active sites.

4. X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy showed that Cu forms alloys with both Pt and Pd within the bimetallic catalysts. 

5. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 catalysts facilitates the desorption of carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of surface carbonate on ceria, which in turn improves the catalyst's performance.

1.X型双金属催化剂在增强氧增强水煤气变换（OWGS）反应效率方面优于单一金属催化剂，尤其在将一氧化碳转化为氢气方面表现出更高的效率。然而，在常规水煤气变换（WGS）反应中，它们的优越性不如在OWGS反应中明显。

2.Temperature程序化还原（TPR）和氧气存储容量（OSC）测量显示，Pt与Cu或Pd之间的强烈相互作用使催化剂更加耐氧化（不易燃），这有利于维持其在氧化条件下活性。

3.双金属催化剂的增强活性归因于这些催化剂的独特结构，允许铂高度分散在铜或钯中。这种分散促进了反应，通过创建更多的活性位点来提高效率。

4.扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱表明，铜在双金属催化剂中形成了与铂和钯的合金。

5.PdCu/CeO2催化剂中的铜的存在促进了二氧化碳的脱附，减少了氧化铈表面的碳酸盐含量，从而提高了催化剂的性能。
