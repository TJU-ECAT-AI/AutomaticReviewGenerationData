1. The addition of a small amount of oxygen to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction significantly enhances the conversion of CO and the yield of H2 on ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly within the temperature range of 200 to 300 C. This enhancement is observed even at very short contact times, where unreacted oxygen is still present. The observed enhancement is attributed to the partial oxidation of chemisorbed CO, creating vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction.

2. Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, notably those containing platinum (Pt), demonstrated higher activity for oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) compared to monometallic catalysts. While the bimetallic catalysts showed similar enhancements in WGS as monometallic catalysts, the superiority of bimetallic catalysts in WGS was not as pronounced. The distinct properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as strong interaction between the metals and resistance to oxidation, contribute to their enhanced catalytic activity.

3. The presence of copper (Cu) in the PdCu/CeO2 catalyst facilitates the desorption of CO2, reducing the amount of surface carbonate on ceria. This property of the PdCu/CeO2 catalyst potentially improves the efficiency of the water gas shift reaction by minimizing the formation of surface carbonate, which can hinder the reaction process.

1. 在200至300 C的温度范围内，向CeO2支持的双金属催化剂中添加少量氧气有效地增强了水煤气转换（WGS）反应，并且在同时提高了CO转化率和H2产量。这种增强现象甚至在接触时间非常短的情况下也能观察到，此时仍有未反应的氧气存在。观察到的增强被归因于化学吸附的CO部分氧化，从而创建了可供H2O吸附和反应的空位。

2. 含有铂（Pt）的CeO2支持的双金属催化剂在氧增强水煤气转变（OWGS）中表现出更高的活性，与单金属催化剂相比。尽管双金属催化剂在常规WGS中的增强效果不如单金属催化剂显著，但它们的相互作用和抗氧化性特性对于提高催化活性具有重要作用。

3. PdCu/CeO2催化剂中的铜（Cu）促进了CO2的脱附，减少了表面碳酸盐在CeO2上的形成量。这种PdCu/CeO2催化剂的性质可能通过减少阻碍反应过程的表面碳酸盐的形成，从而提高水煤气转变效率。
