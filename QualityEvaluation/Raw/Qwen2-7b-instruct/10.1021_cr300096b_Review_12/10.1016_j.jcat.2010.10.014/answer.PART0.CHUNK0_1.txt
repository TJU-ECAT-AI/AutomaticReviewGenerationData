1. When oxygen was added, the study found an increased dependency on carbon monoxide (CO) concentration for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, whereas the dependency on water vapor (H2O) concentration remained unchanged. This suggests that oxygen addition enhances the WGS reaction by affecting the surface chemistry or sites balance of adsorbed species, specifically by lowering the CO surface coverage.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on platinum (Pt), showed higher activity in the oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) reaction compared to their monometallic counterparts. However, the superiority of bimetallic catalysts in the conventional water gas shift (WGS) reaction was less pronounced.

3. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements indicated that there is a strong interaction between the metals in bimetallic catalysts. This interaction makes the catalysts more resistant to oxidation, contributing to their less pyrophoric nature in oxidative conditions.

4. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that copper (Cu) forms alloys with both platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) in the bimetallic catalysts.

5. The presence of copper in the palladium-copper (PdCu) catalyst on ceria supports facilitates the desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2), reducing the amount of surface carbonate on the ceria support. This property is attributed to the enhanced CO2 desorption capability of the PdCu catalyst.

1. 当添加氧气时，研究发现水气转换（WGS）反应对CO浓度的依赖性增加，而对水蒸气（H2O）浓度的依赖性未发生变化。这表明氧气的添加通过影响吸附物种的表面化学或位点平衡来增强WGS反应，特别是通过降低CO表面覆盖度。

2. 基于铂（Pt）的双金属催化剂在氧增强水气转换（OWGS）反应中表现出更高的活性，与它们的单金属对应物相比。然而，在常规水气转换（WGS）反应中，双金属催化剂的优势不如那么显著。

3. 温度程序化还原（TPR）和氧存储能力（OSC）测量显示，双金属催化剂中的金属之间存在强烈的相互作用。这种相互作用使催化剂更耐氧化，导致它们在氧化条件下具有较少的自燃性质。

4. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱揭示了铜（Cu）在双金属催化剂中与铂（Pt）和钯（Pd）形成合金。

5. 在氧化铈支持的钯铜（PdCu）催化剂中，铜的存在促进了二氧化碳（CO2）的脱附，减少了铈支持体上的表面碳酸盐含量。这一属性归因于PdCu催化剂增强的CO2脱附能力。
