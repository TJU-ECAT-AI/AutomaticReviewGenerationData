1. When oxygen was added to the water gas shift reaction, the dependency on carbon monoxide concentration increased, whereas the dependency on water vapor concentration remained unchanged. This indicates that oxygen addition leads to a more efficient use of carbon monoxide in the reaction.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, showed higher efficiency in oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) compared to monometallic catalysts. However, their superiority was less evident in the conventional water gas shift (WGS) process.

3. The enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to their unique structure, where platinum is highly dispersed within copper particles, creating a complex interplay between the metals.

4. The presence of copper in the PdCu catalyst system facilitates the desorption of carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of carbonate on ceria, which in turn improves the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

1. When oxygen was added, the study found an increased dependency on carbon monoxide (CO) concentration for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, whereas the dependency on water vapor (H2O) concentration remained unchanged. This suggests that oxygen addition enhances the WGS reaction by affecting the surface chemistry or sites balance of adsorbed species, specifically by lowering the CO surface coverage.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on platinum (Pt), showed higher activity in the oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) reaction compared to their monometallic counterparts. However, the superiority of bimetallic catalysts in the conventional water gas shift (WGS) reaction was less pronounced.

3. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements indicated that there is a strong interaction between the metals in bimetallic catalysts. This interaction makes the catalysts more resistant to oxidation, contributing to their less pyrophoric nature in oxidative conditions.

4. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that copper (Cu) forms alloys with both platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) in the bimetallic catalysts.

5. The presence of copper in the palladium-copper (PdCu) catalyst on ceria supports facilitates the desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2), reducing the amount of surface carbonate on the ceria support. This property is attributed to the enhanced CO2 desorption capability of the PdCu catalyst.

1. 当添加氧气时，研究发现水气转换（WGS）反应对CO浓度的依赖性增加，而对水蒸气（H2O）浓度的依赖性未发生变化。这表明氧气的添加通过影响吸附物种的表面化学或位点平衡来增强WGS反应，特别是通过降低CO表面覆盖度。

2. 基于铂（Pt）的双金属催化剂在氧增强水气转换（OWGS）反应中表现出更高的活性，与它们的单金属对应物相比。然而，在常规水气转换（WGS）反应中，双金属催化剂的优势不如那么显著。

3. 温度程序化还原（TPR）和氧存储能力（OSC）测量显示，双金属催化剂中的金属之间存在强烈的相互作用。这种相互作用使催化剂更耐氧化，导致它们在氧化条件下具有较少的自燃性质。

4. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱揭示了铜（Cu）在双金属催化剂中与铂（Pt）和钯（Pd）形成合金。

5. 在氧化铈支持的钯铜（PdCu）催化剂中，铜的存在促进了二氧化碳（CO2）的脱附，减少了铈支持体上的表面碳酸盐含量。这一属性归因于PdCu催化剂增强的CO2脱附能力。

[1] "Addition of a small amount of oxygen effectively enhanced WGS on CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts, resulting in increase in both CO conversion and H2 production in the temperature range of 200 to 300 C."
[2] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."

1. The addition of a small amount of oxygen to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction significantly enhances the conversion of CO and the yield of H2 on ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly within the temperature range of 200 to 300 C. This enhancement is observed even at very short contact times, where unreacted oxygen is still present. The observed enhancement is attributed to the partial oxidation of chemisorbed CO, creating vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction.

2. Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, notably those containing platinum (Pt), demonstrated higher activity for oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) compared to monometallic catalysts. While the bimetallic catalysts showed similar enhancements in WGS as monometallic catalysts, the superiority of bimetallic catalysts in WGS was not as pronounced. The distinct properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as strong interaction between the metals and resistance to oxidation, contribute to their enhanced catalytic activity.

3. The presence of copper (Cu) in the PdCu/CeO2 catalyst facilitates the desorption of CO2, reducing the amount of surface carbonate on ceria. This property of the PdCu/CeO2 catalyst potentially improves the efficiency of the water gas shift reaction by minimizing the formation of surface carbonate, which can hinder the reaction process.

1. 在200至300 C的温度范围内，向CeO2支持的双金属催化剂中添加少量氧气有效地增强了水煤气转换（WGS）反应，并且在同时提高了CO转化率和H2产量。这种增强现象甚至在接触时间非常短的情况下也能观察到，此时仍有未反应的氧气存在。观察到的增强被归因于化学吸附的CO部分氧化，从而创建了可供H2O吸附和反应的空位。

2. 含有铂（Pt）的CeO2支持的双金属催化剂在氧增强水煤气转变（OWGS）中表现出更高的活性，与单金属催化剂相比。尽管双金属催化剂在常规WGS中的增强效果不如单金属催化剂显著，但它们的相互作用和抗氧化性特性对于提高催化活性具有重要作用。

3. PdCu/CeO2催化剂中的铜（Cu）促进了CO2的脱附，减少了表面碳酸盐在CeO2上的形成量。这种PdCu/CeO2催化剂的性质可能通过减少阻碍反应过程的表面碳酸盐的形成，从而提高水煤气转变效率。

The study demonstrates that the addition of oxygen to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction significantly enhances CO conversion and H2 production on ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly in the temperature range of 200 to 300 C. The enhanced efficiency is attributed to the partial oxidation of chemisorbed CO, which creates more active sites for H2O adsorption and reaction. Bimetallic catalysts, specifically those containing Pt or Pd, exhibit higher activity for the oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) process compared to monometallic catalysts, although the improvement in WGS activity is less pronounced. The strong interaction between Pt and Cu or Pd and Cu, indicated by the TPR and OSC measurements, contributes to the bimetallic catalysts' increased resistance to oxidation. This structure, characterized by highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu, also enables CO2 desorption and reduces the surface carbonate on CeO2. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates the desorption of CO2.

研究显示，在铈氧化物支持的双金属催化剂上，微量氧气的添加能显著提高200至300摄氏度范围内的CO转化率和H2产量。这种增强效果归因于部分氧化吸附的CO，从而创造出更多活性位点用于H2O吸附与反应。含Pt或Pd的双金属催化剂在氧增强水煤气转换（OWGS）过程中表现出更高的活性，与单金属催化剂相比，OWGS过程中的活性优势更为明显。通过TPR和OSC测量发现，Pt和Cu或Pd和Cu之间存在强烈的相互作用，这使得双金属催化剂对氧化的抵抗力增强。这种结构特征表现为Pt在Cu或Pd在Cu中的高度分散。此外，这种结构也能够促进CO2脱附并减少CeO2表面的碳酸盐含量。在PdCu/CeO2中，Cu的存在有助于CO2脱附。
