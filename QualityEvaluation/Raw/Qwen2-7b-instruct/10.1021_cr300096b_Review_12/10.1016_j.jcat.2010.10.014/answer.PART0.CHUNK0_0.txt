[1] "The study of kinetics revealed increased dependency on CO concentration when O2 was added, while no change was observed in the dependency on H2O concentration."
[2] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."
[3] "These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu."
[4] "The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2."

1. When oxygen was added to the water gas shift reaction, the dependency on carbon monoxide concentration increased, whereas the dependency on water vapor concentration remained unchanged. This indicates that oxygen addition leads to a more efficient use of carbon monoxide in the reaction.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, showed higher efficiency in oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) compared to monometallic catalysts. However, their superiority was less evident in the conventional water gas shift (WGS) process.

3. The enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to their unique structure, where platinum is highly dispersed within copper particles, creating a complex interplay between the metals.

4. The presence of copper in the PdCu catalyst system facilitates the desorption of carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of carbonate on ceria, which in turn improves the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

1. 当氧气被添加到水煤气变换反应中时，对一氧化碳浓度的依赖性增加，而对水蒸气浓度的依赖性保持不变。这表明氧气的添加使反应中的一氧化碳使用更加高效。

2. 特别包含有铂的双金属催化剂在增强水煤气变换（OWGS）效率方面比单金属催化剂表现更好。然而，在常规水煤气变换（WGS）过程中，它们的优势不如明显。

3. 这些催化剂性能的提升归因于其独特的结构，其中铂高度分散在铜颗粒中，形成复杂的金属间相互作用。

4. PdCu催化剂体系中的铜的存在促进了二氧化碳的脱附，减少了铈上的碳酸盐含量，从而提高了催化剂的整体效率。
