<p>Theoretically, the amount of oxygen necessary for complete CO oxidation is half the molar amount of CO in the feedstream, according to Eq. (1). However, an excess of oxygen is needed due to the simultaneous oxidation of H2. This excess of oxygen is characterized by the process parameter λ, defined as twice the ratio of moles of oxygen to moles of CO in the feedstream (λ = 1 is sufficient for the complete oxidation of CO in the absence of an oxygen-consuming side reaction (H2 oxidation)).</p>
<p>Selectivity is defined as the ratio between oxygen involved in the CO oxidation and the total amount of oxygen reacted (for oxidizing CO and H2). As the selectivity is inversely proportional to oxygen excess, an ideal catalyst should be active even at low λ values, in order to maintain the selectivity at acceptable values.</p>
<p>A traditional catalyst for the PROX reaction consists of a noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ru) supported on alumina [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Oxidation of CO on these catalysts is a multi-step process obeying a single-site competitive Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where CO, H2 and O2 compete for the noble metal surface. These catalysts are characterized by operating at temperatures about 170-200 C—the low temperature WGS reactor outlet temperature—and needing a high λ value (about 2.2) for complete depletion of CO, with the corresponding lack of selectivity (typically 34%) [13]. However, they are resistant to deactivation by water [10], although they are slightly inhibited by CO2 [15].</p>
<p>The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter [16], [17]. An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts [18], [19], [20], [21]. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism. Other promoters reported for Pt-based catalysts are Ce2O3 [22] and cobalt oxide [7], [23]. Other active catalysts reported in the literature are base-oxide supported Au [24], mixed CuOCeria [25], zeolite-based [26], and bimetallic catalysts of PtSn [27], [28], and ceriazirconia-supported Pt [29].</p>
<p>Some authors reported the influence of the promotion by metal oxides with redox properties. In this way, Yan et al. [30] found that the addition of cobalt oxide to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst significantly improve the activity of the catalyst (90% at 90 C and 99.9% at 120 C, compared with 10 and 45% at the same temperature). Sirijaruphan et al. [31] have found that Fe promotes Pt/Al2O3, and reported that the initial CO oxidation reaction rate is 5.7 times higher than the H2 oxidation rate (stabilized at four times higher at steady state). In the same manner, Liu et al. [17] promotes the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with Fe oxide, creating a non-competitive dual site for oxygen adsorption, thus enhancing the activity (with λ = 1, it increases from 13.2% to 68%, having a maximum at 90 C).</p>
<p>MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound [32], [33], [34]. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions [35], [36] and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction [37], [38]. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams) [39], [40]. However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction.</p>

The document discusses the influence of various metal oxides, particularly MnOx, on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It mentions that traditional Pt-based catalysts require high λ values for complete CO oxidation, leading to low selectivity. The addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts creates a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2, enhancing the reaction rate. The document also explores the use of other promoters like Ce2O3 and cobalt oxide for Pt-based catalysts. Base-oxide supported Au, mixed CuOCeria, zeolite-based, and bimetallic catalysts of PtSn and ceriazirconia-supported Pt are also mentioned as active catalysts. The document highlights the positive impact of metal oxides with redox properties on catalyst activity, with examples provided by Yan et al., Sirijaruphan et al., and Liu et al. MnOx is noted for its high oxygen storage capacity, though its use in Pt catalysts for PROX reactions is not widely documented. The document suggests future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but acknowledges current limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces in UHV environments.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物，尤其是MnOx，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制和效率的影响。它提到传统的基于Pt的催化剂需要高λ值才能完全氧化CO，导致低选择性。向Pt催化剂添加Fe作为促进剂创建了CO和O2的竞争非机制，提高了反应速率。文档还探讨了Ce2O3和钴氧化物等其他促进剂在基于Pt的催化剂中的应用。Au基质氧化物、混合CuOCeria、沸石基、双金属催化剂（如PtSn）以及以Pt为支持的ceria-zirconia催化剂也被认为是活性催化剂。文档强调了具有还原性的金属氧化物对催化剂活性的积极影响，提供了由Yan等人、Sirijaruphan等人和Liu等人提供的示例。MnOx被指出具有高氧存储能力，但关于将其用于用于PROX反应的Pt催化剂的研究并不广泛。文档建议未来的UHV研究可以提供有关模型表面和支撑催化剂的发现的相关信息，但承认当前在UHV环境中研究基于Pt的双金属表面的局限性。
