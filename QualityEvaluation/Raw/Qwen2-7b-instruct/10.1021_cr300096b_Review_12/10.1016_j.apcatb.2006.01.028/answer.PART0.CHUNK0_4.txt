[1] "High purity hydrogen for the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) could be produced by means of fuel reforming, which should be followed by WGS reaction in order to remove CO."
[2] "The PROX reaction is a simple and efficient method for removing low levels of CO from H2-rich gas streams."
[3] "As the platinum-based electrodes from PEMFC stack irreversibly deactivate with a CO content above 10 ppm, an additional stage for further CO removal is necessary."
[4] "The PROX reaction consists of adding oxygen to the fuel processor effluent in order to preferentially oxidize CO rather than H2."
[5] "An effective PROX catalyst should show: (a) high activity for CO oxidation, if a stream containing 1 vol.% CO in 60 vol.% H2 must be cleaned down to a maximum CO content of 10 ppm, a CO conversion beyond 99.9% must be reached; (b) high selectivity for oxidizing CO rather than hydrogen."
[6] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2."
[7] "New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter."
[8] "Some authors reported the influence of the promotion by metal oxides with redox properties."
[9] "MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound."
[10] "MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions."
[11] "MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."
[12] "However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction."

[16] "The catalyst P1A presents a conversion of 100% at 194 C for λ = 2, which is in accordance with the results of Anderson [45], who obtains total CO conversion at 185 C for a 1 wt.%Pt/Al2O3 and λ = 2."
[17] "The increase in Mn content enhances the activity for CO oxidation, decreasing the temperature for complete CO depletion to 171 and 169 C, for the catalysts P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI and λ = 2, respectively."
[18] "The presence of H2 produced a shift in the CO conversion versus temperature curves of all catalysts to lower values, which was attributed to inhibition of the known CO self-poisoning effect of the Pt surface, and a maximum in CO conversion, after which conversion decreased with temperature due to competition between CO and H2 for the available O2."
[19] "The maximum Mn content is expected to be limited by the maximum amount of PtMnOx interface, which can be formed."
[20] "The presence of 5 vol.% CO2 produces an increase in the maximum CO conversion obtained, which increases as the Mn content of the catalysts increases."
[21] "The effect of the presence of 5 vol.% H2O in the feedstream strongly depends on the Mn content in the catalyst: without Mn (P1A), the maximum CO conversion, selectivity and yield are slightly improved by steam, which is attributed to inhibition by the CO self-poisoning effect on the Pt surface."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of MnOx to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts enhances the activity for CO oxidation, reducing the temperature required for complete CO depletion. This improvement allows for higher CO conversion rates with lower λ values, which is beneficial for practical applications involving H2 streams as fuel for PEM cells. The presence of MnOx in these catalysts increases the oxygen storage capacity, facilitating a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2, which accelerates the reaction rate. The influence of MnOx on CO oxidation efficiency suggests that future UHV studies correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts could provide valuable insights into the surface chemistry and mechanism of CO oxidation. The results highlight the importance of MnOx doping for improving CO oxidation rates and selectivity, potentially leading to more efficient catalysts for CO removal in H2-rich streams.

In the presence of H2, the CO conversion curves shift to lower temperatures due to the inhibition of the CO self-poisoning effect on the Pt surface. This effect is attributed to the competitive oxidation of CO and H2 for the available oxygen. The maximum CO conversion, selectivity, and yield are influenced by the Mn content in the catalyst. Catalysts with higher MnOx content exhibit improved CO conversion, selectivity, and yield, especially in the presence of steam. The presence of CO2 enhances the maximum CO conversion, which increases with the Mn content of the catalysts. The effect of steam on catalyst performance depends on the Mn content, with P1A experiencing slight improvement in CO conversion, selectivity, and yield, while higher MnOx content leads to a decrease in these parameters. These findings suggest that the simultaneous presence of CO2 and H2O could be an interesting area for future studies, particularly for catalysts with higher Mn contents, aiming to optimize the Mn content for practical applications.

在反应器研究中，特别是针对PEMFC氢气生产、CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化，双金属催化剂尤其是Pt基催化剂在机制和效率方面起着关键作用。通过将MnOx添加到Pt/Al2O3催化剂中，可以提高CO氧化活性，降低完全清除CO所需的温度。这种改进允许在较低的λ值下实现更高的CO转化率，这对于作为PEM细胞燃料的H2流的CO去除具有实际应用价值。MnOx的存在增加了氧气存储能力，促进了CO和O2的非竞争性双位点机制，加速了反应速率。MnOx对CO氧化效率的影响表明，未来使用UHV研究与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的发现，可以为CO氧化的表面化学和机制提供有价值的见解。结果强调了MnOx掺杂对于提高CO氧化速率和选择性的意义，可能导致更高效的催化剂用于H2丰富的流体中的CO去除。

在H2存在的条件下，CO转化曲线向更低的温度偏移，这是由于CO自毒化效应对Pt表面的抑制。这种效应归因于CO和H2之间对可用氧的竞争氧化。最大CO转化率、选择性和产率受催化剂中Mn含量的影响。具有更高MnOx含量的催化剂表现出改善的CO转化率、选择性和产率，特别是在蒸汽存在的情况下。CO2的存在增强了最大CO转化率，随着催化剂中Mn含量的增加而增加。蒸汽对催化剂性能的影响取决于Mn含量，P1A经历轻微的CO转化率、选择性和产率改善，而更高的MnOx含量导致这些参数下降。这些发现表明，同时存在CO2和H2O可能是未来研究的一个有趣领域，特别是对于高Mn含量的催化剂，旨在优化Mn含量以适应实际应用。
