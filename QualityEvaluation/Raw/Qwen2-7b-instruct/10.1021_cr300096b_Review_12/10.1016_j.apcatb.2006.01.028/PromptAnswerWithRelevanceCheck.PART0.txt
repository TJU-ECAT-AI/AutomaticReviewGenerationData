[1] "An effective PROX catalyst should show: (a) high activity for CO oxidation, if a stream containing 1 vol.% CO in 60 vol.% H2 must be cleaned down to a maximum CO content of 10 ppm, a CO conversion beyond 99.9% must be reached; (b) high selectivity for oxidizing CO rather than hydrogen, (c) wide operation window, in order to avoid precise temperature control; (d) effective operation at high GHSV values; (e) resistance to deactivation by carbon dioxide and water present in the feedstream."
[2] "The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of all the studied catalysts at high temperature, whereas the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content."
[3] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter."
[4] "An ideal catalyst should be active even at low λ values, in order to maintain the selectivity at acceptable values."
[5] "In this work, an alumina-supported Pt catalyst has been modified by adding MnOx to the catalyst formulation. The obtained catalysts have been tested for CO oxidation both in H2-free and H2-rich environments."

The document discusses the development of a novel alumina-supported Pt catalyst modified with MnOx for CO oxidation in both H2-free and H2-rich environments. The catalyst demonstrates improved CO conversion efficiency, selectivity, and CO yield compared to a base Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, catalysts with 8 and 15 wt.% MnOx exhibit a lower operation temperature for maximum CO conversion than the base catalyst, and achieve CO conversion of 89.8%, selectivity of 44.9%, and CO yield of 40.3% at 139°C with λ=2. The addition of MnOx enhances the catalytic activity, especially at low temperatures, and allows for higher CO conversion with lower excess oxygen (λ values). The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of the catalysts at high temperatures, while the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content. The document highlights the importance of MnOx in providing additional sites for oxygen adsorption, which enhances the CO oxidation rate and facilitates a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. The catalysts demonstrate resistance to deactivation by carbon dioxide and water present in the feedstream, making them suitable for practical applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cell technologies.

本文讨论了一种用于H2自由和H2丰富的环境中CO氧化的新铝酸盐支持Pt催化剂的开发。该催化剂在纯度和选择性以及CO产量方面表现出改进的CO转化效率。具体来说，含有8％和15％MnOx的催化剂在139°C下以λ=2时实现了89.8％的CO转化率、44.9％的选择性和40.3％的CO产率。MnOx的添加增强了催化活性，尤其是在低温下，并允许使用较低的过剩氧（λ值）实现更高的CO转化率。在流体中添加CO2可以增强催化剂在高温下的催化性能，而蒸汽的存在则抑制了含较高MnOx含量的催化剂。文档强调了MnOx在提供额外的氧吸附位点方面的重要性，这可以增强CO氧化速率并促进CO和O2的非竞争性双站点机制。这些催化剂显示出对流体中CO2和水的抗降解能力，使其适合在质子交换膜燃料电池技术中的实际应用。

<p>Theoretically, the amount of oxygen necessary for complete CO oxidation is half the molar amount of CO in the feedstream, according to Eq. (1). However, an excess of oxygen is needed due to the simultaneous oxidation of H2. This excess of oxygen is characterized by the process parameter λ, defined as twice the ratio of moles of oxygen to moles of CO in the feedstream (λ = 1 is sufficient for the complete oxidation of CO in the absence of an oxygen-consuming side reaction (H2 oxidation)).</p>
<p>Selectivity is defined as the ratio between oxygen involved in the CO oxidation and the total amount of oxygen reacted (for oxidizing CO and H2). As the selectivity is inversely proportional to oxygen excess, an ideal catalyst should be active even at low λ values, in order to maintain the selectivity at acceptable values.</p>
<p>A traditional catalyst for the PROX reaction consists of a noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ru) supported on alumina [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Oxidation of CO on these catalysts is a multi-step process obeying a single-site competitive Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where CO, H2 and O2 compete for the noble metal surface. These catalysts are characterized by operating at temperatures about 170-200 C—the low temperature WGS reactor outlet temperature—and needing a high λ value (about 2.2) for complete depletion of CO, with the corresponding lack of selectivity (typically 34%) [13]. However, they are resistant to deactivation by water [10], although they are slightly inhibited by CO2 [15].</p>
<p>The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter [16], [17]. An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts [18], [19], [20], [21]. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism. Other promoters reported for Pt-based catalysts are Ce2O3 [22] and cobalt oxide [7], [23]. Other active catalysts reported in the literature are base-oxide supported Au [24], mixed CuOCeria [25], zeolite-based [26], and bimetallic catalysts of PtSn [27], [28], and ceriazirconia-supported Pt [29].</p>
<p>Some authors reported the influence of the promotion by metal oxides with redox properties. In this way, Yan et al. [30] found that the addition of cobalt oxide to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst significantly improve the activity of the catalyst (90% at 90 C and 99.9% at 120 C, compared with 10 and 45% at the same temperature). Sirijaruphan et al. [31] have found that Fe promotes Pt/Al2O3, and reported that the initial CO oxidation reaction rate is 5.7 times higher than the H2 oxidation rate (stabilized at four times higher at steady state). In the same manner, Liu et al. [17] promotes the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with Fe oxide, creating a non-competitive dual site for oxygen adsorption, thus enhancing the activity (with λ = 1, it increases from 13.2% to 68%, having a maximum at 90 C).</p>
<p>MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound [32], [33], [34]. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions [35], [36] and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction [37], [38]. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams) [39], [40]. However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction.</p>

The document discusses the influence of various metal oxides, particularly MnOx, on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It mentions that traditional Pt-based catalysts require high λ values for complete CO oxidation, leading to low selectivity. The addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts creates a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2, enhancing the reaction rate. The document also explores the use of other promoters like Ce2O3 and cobalt oxide for Pt-based catalysts. Base-oxide supported Au, mixed CuOCeria, zeolite-based, and bimetallic catalysts of PtSn and ceriazirconia-supported Pt are also mentioned as active catalysts. The document highlights the positive impact of metal oxides with redox properties on catalyst activity, with examples provided by Yan et al., Sirijaruphan et al., and Liu et al. MnOx is noted for its high oxygen storage capacity, though its use in Pt catalysts for PROX reactions is not widely documented. The document suggests future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but acknowledges current limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces in UHV environments.

<p>However, catalysts prepared by successive impregnation with 8 and 15 wt.% Mn have shown a lower operation temperature for maximum CO conversion than the base catalyst with an enhanced catalyst activity at low temperatures with respect to Pt/Al2O3.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of MnOx to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts enhances the activity for CO oxidation, reducing the temperature required for complete CO depletion. This improvement allows for higher CO conversion rates with lower λ values, which is beneficial for practical applications involving H2 streams as fuel for PEM cells. The presence of MnOx in these catalysts increases the oxygen storage capacity, facilitating a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2, which accelerates the reaction rate. The influence of MnOx on CO oxidation efficiency suggests that future UHV studies correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts could provide valuable insights into the surface chemistry and mechanism of CO oxidation. The results highlight the importance of MnOx doping for improving CO oxidation rates and selectivity, potentially leading to more efficient catalysts for CO removal in H2-rich streams.

In the presence of H2, the CO conversion curves shift to lower temperatures due to the inhibition of the CO self-poisoning effect on the Pt surface. This effect is attributed to the competitive oxidation of CO and H2 for the available oxygen. The maximum CO conversion, selectivity, and yield are influenced by the Mn content in the catalyst. Catalysts with higher MnOx content exhibit improved CO conversion, selectivity, and yield, especially in the presence of steam. The presence of CO2 enhances the maximum CO conversion, which increases with the Mn content of the catalysts. The effect of steam on catalyst performance depends on the Mn content, with P1A experiencing slight improvement in CO conversion, selectivity, and yield, while higher MnOx content leads to a decrease in these parameters. These findings suggest that the simultaneous presence of CO2 and H2O could be an interesting area for future studies, particularly for catalysts with higher Mn contents, aiming to optimize the Mn content for practical applications.

在反应器研究中，特别是针对PEMFC氢气生产、CO氧化、水煤气变换和甲烷转化，双金属催化剂尤其是Pt基催化剂在机制和效率方面起着关键作用。通过将MnOx添加到Pt/Al2O3催化剂中，可以提高CO氧化活性，降低完全清除CO所需的温度。这种改进允许在较低的λ值下实现更高的CO转化率，这对于作为PEM细胞燃料的H2流的CO去除具有实际应用价值。MnOx的存在增加了氧气存储能力，促进了CO和O2的非竞争性双位点机制，加速了反应速率。MnOx对CO氧化效率的影响表明，未来使用UHV研究与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的发现，可以为CO氧化的表面化学和机制提供有价值的见解。结果强调了MnOx掺杂对于提高CO氧化速率和选择性的意义，可能导致更高效的催化剂用于H2丰富的流体中的CO去除。

在H2存在的条件下，CO转化曲线向更低的温度偏移，这是由于CO自毒化效应对Pt表面的抑制。这种效应归因于CO和H2之间对可用氧的竞争氧化。最大CO转化率、选择性和产率受催化剂中Mn含量的影响。具有更高MnOx含量的催化剂表现出改善的CO转化率、选择性和产率，特别是在蒸汽存在的情况下。CO2的存在增强了最大CO转化率，随着催化剂中Mn含量的增加而增加。蒸汽对催化剂性能的影响取决于Mn含量，P1A经历轻微的CO转化率、选择性和产率改善，而更高的MnOx含量导致这些参数下降。这些发现表明，同时存在CO2和H2O可能是未来研究的一个有趣领域，特别是对于高Mn含量的催化剂，旨在优化Mn含量以适应实际应用。
