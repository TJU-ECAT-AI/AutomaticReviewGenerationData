1. Catalysts with 8 and 15 wt.% Mn showed a lower operation temperature for maximum CO conversion compared to the base catalyst. They also demonstrated enhanced activity at low temperatures compared to Pt/Al2O3.

2. A maximum CO conversion of 89.8%, with selectivity of 44.9% and CO yield of 40.3% was achieved using a catalyst with 15 wt.% Mn at 139 C and λ = 2.

3. CO2 in the feedstream enhanced the catalytic performance of all catalysts at high temperatures. Steam inhibited catalysts with higher MnOx content.

4. The shift of CO conversion curves to lower temperatures in the presence of H2 indicates the importance of the dual-site reaction mechanism related to the total amount of the MnOxPt interface.

5. The total flow rate was set at 200 cm3 min1, with 1 vol.% CO, 60 vol.% H2, 1 vol.% O2, and He (to balance).

6. The CO conversion curves for catalysts except M2A (without Pt) shifted to lower temperatures in the presence of H2.

7. The presence of 5 vol.% CO2 increased the maximum CO conversion, especially for catalysts with higher Mn content. A catalyst with 15 wt.% MnOx reached nearly 100% CO conversion for λ = 2.

8. The presence of 5 vol.% H2O affected the maximum CO conversion, selectivity, and yield differently depending on the Mn content. Without Mn (P1A), the parameters were slightly improved. Higher Mn content led to a decrease in these parameters when steam was present.

1. 含有8和15 wt.% Mn的催化剂在最高CO转化温度下表现出较低的操作温度，并且在低温下相对于Pt/Al2O3具有增强的活性。

2. 在139°C和λ = 2时，使用含15 wt.% Mn的催化剂实现了89.8%的最大CO转化率，选择性为44.9%，CO产率为40.3%。

3. CO2在进料流中的存在提高了所有催化剂在高温下的催化性能。蒸汽抑制了含有较高MnOx含量的催化剂。

4. 在H2存在的条件下，CO转化曲线向更低的温度偏移，表明双站点反应机制的重要性，该机制与MnOxPt界面的总含量相关联。

5. 总流量设置为200 cm3 min1，包括1 vol.% CO、60 vol.% H2、1 vol.% O2和He（用于平衡）。

6. 除了不含Pt的M2A外，其他催化剂的CO转化曲线在H2存在时向较低的温度偏移。

7. 5 vol.% CO2的存在增加了最大CO转化率，尤其是对于高Mn含量的催化剂。含有15 wt.% MnOx的催化剂在λ = 2时达到了近100%的CO转化率。

8. 5 vol.% H2O的存在对最大CO转化率、选择性和产率的影响取决于Mn含量。在没有Mn（P1A）的情况下，参数略有改善。更高的Mn含量导致当蒸汽存在时这些参数降低。
