[1] "An effective PROX catalyst should show: (a) high activity for CO oxidation, if a stream containing 1 vol.% CO in 60 vol.% H2 must be cleaned down to a maximum CO content of 10 ppm, a CO conversion beyond 99.9% must be reached; (b) high selectivity for oxidizing CO rather than hydrogen, (c) wide operation window, in order to avoid precise temperature control; (d) effective operation at high GHSV values; (e) resistance to deactivation by carbon dioxide and water present in the feedstream."
[2] "The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of all the studied catalysts at high temperature, whereas the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content."
[3] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter."
[4] "An ideal catalyst should be active even at low λ values, in order to maintain the selectivity at acceptable values."
[5] "In this work, an alumina-supported Pt catalyst has been modified by adding MnOx to the catalyst formulation. The obtained catalysts have been tested for CO oxidation both in H2-free and H2-rich environments."

The document discusses the development of a novel alumina-supported Pt catalyst modified with MnOx for CO oxidation in both H2-free and H2-rich environments. The catalyst demonstrates improved CO conversion efficiency, selectivity, and CO yield compared to a base Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, catalysts with 8 and 15 wt.% MnOx exhibit a lower operation temperature for maximum CO conversion than the base catalyst, and achieve CO conversion of 89.8%, selectivity of 44.9%, and CO yield of 40.3% at 139°C with λ=2. The addition of MnOx enhances the catalytic activity, especially at low temperatures, and allows for higher CO conversion with lower excess oxygen (λ values). The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of the catalysts at high temperatures, while the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content. The document highlights the importance of MnOx in providing additional sites for oxygen adsorption, which enhances the CO oxidation rate and facilitates a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. The catalysts demonstrate resistance to deactivation by carbon dioxide and water present in the feedstream, making them suitable for practical applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cell technologies.

本文讨论了一种用于H2自由和H2丰富的环境中CO氧化的新铝酸盐支持Pt催化剂的开发。该催化剂在纯度和选择性以及CO产量方面表现出改进的CO转化效率。具体来说，含有8％和15％MnOx的催化剂在139°C下以λ=2时实现了89.8％的CO转化率、44.9％的选择性和40.3％的CO产率。MnOx的添加增强了催化活性，尤其是在低温下，并允许使用较低的过剩氧（λ值）实现更高的CO转化率。在流体中添加CO2可以增强催化剂在高温下的催化性能，而蒸汽的存在则抑制了含较高MnOx含量的催化剂。文档强调了MnOx在提供额外的氧吸附位点方面的重要性，这可以增强CO氧化速率并促进CO和O2的非竞争性双站点机制。这些催化剂显示出对流体中CO2和水的抗降解能力，使其适合在质子交换膜燃料电池技术中的实际应用。
