[1] "The recent interest in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology has increased the number of publications on selective CO oxidation in H2-rich environments."
[2] "High purity hydrogen for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) could be produced by means of fuel reforming, which should be followed by WGS reaction in order to remove CO."
[3] "As the platinum-based electrodes from PEMFC stack irreversibly deactivate with a CO content above 10 ppm, an additional stage for further CO removal is necessary."
[4] "The PROX reaction is a simple and efficient method for removing low levels of CO from H2-rich gas streams."
[5] "An effective PROX catalyst should show: (a) high activity for CO oxidation, if a stream containing 1 vol.% CO in 60 vol.% H2 must be cleaned down to a maximum CO content of 10 ppm, a CO conversion beyond 99.9% must be reached."
[6] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2."
[7] "MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound."
[8] "MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions."
[9] "MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."
[10] "However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction."
[11] "In this work, an alumina-supported Pt catalyst has been modified by adding MnOx to the catalyst formulation."
[12] "Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure, with a temperature ramp of 3 C min1 from 30 to 300 C."
[13] "CO conversion was calculated based on the CO consumption within the reactor, as follows:"
[14] "The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of all the studied catalysts at high temperature, whereas the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content."
