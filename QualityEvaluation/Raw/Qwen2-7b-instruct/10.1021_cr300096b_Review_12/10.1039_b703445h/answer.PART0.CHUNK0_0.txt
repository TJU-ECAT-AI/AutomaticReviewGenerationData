[1] "The crystalline structure of zeolites is expected to greatly increase the insight into the structure of the catalytic centres (a property lacking when amorphous supports are considered and which is at the origin of many characterization difficulties) and hence to help the characterization of the species formed by interaction with incoming reactants."
[2] "The ability of zeolites to exchange or incorporate single cations in well defined crystallographic positions should allow to control the nuclearity and structure of the metal centre, so favouring the investigation of the analogies between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous counterparts."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are active catalysts in many relevant oxidation reactions, which find close analogues in homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis."
[4] "Fe-ZSM-5 is always more active than Fe-silicalite containing the same amount of Fe."
[5] "The number of active sites is maximum on catalysts formed by high temperature activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites, as compared for example with catalysts obtained with post synthesis impregnation."
[6] "The debate concerning the nuclearity of the catalytic sites (mono- or dinuclear) is still alive."
[7] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are not the ideal samples conceived before and that many types of species are present, some active and some other silent from adsorptive and catalytic point of view."
[8] "Only at the lowest loadings the catalytically active species become the dominant fraction of the iron species."
[9] "On the basis of the spectroscopic titration of the active sites by using NO as a probe, we conclude that the active species on very diluted samples are isolated and highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the crystalline matrix."
[10] "Indication of the constant presence of a smaller fraction of Fe2+ presumably located on small clusters is also obtained."

The crystalline structure of zeolites provides significant insight into the structure of catalytic centers, enabling the characterization of species formed by interaction with reactants. Zeolites' ability to incorporate single cations in defined positions facilitates the investigation of analogies between heterogeneous, enzymatic, and homogeneous catalysts. These materials are active in numerous oxidation reactions that mirror those catalyzed by homogeneous and enzymatic compounds. Fe-ZSM-5 typically exhibits greater activity than Fe-silicalite with similar iron content. High temperature activation maximizes the number of active sites. The nuclearity of catalytic sites remains a debated topic. Contrary to expectations, Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite do not solely contain the ideal active species; they contain a mix of active and inactive species. At lower iron loads, the active species become the majority. Spectroscopic titration with NO indicates that isolated, highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ ions are the primary active species. There is also evidence for a smaller fraction of Fe2+ ions located on small clusters.

晶体结构的沸石为催化中心的结构提供了重要洞察，使得能够对与反应物相互作用形成的物种进行表征。沸石将单个离子在定义位置整合的能力，使研究同质、酶和异质催化剂之间的类比成为可能。这些材料在许多与同质和酶催化的反应相似的氧化反应中表现出活性。Fe-ZSM-5的活性通常高于具有相同铁含量的Fe-silicalite。高温活化可最大化活性位点的数量。催化位点的核性仍然是一个有争议的话题。相反，人们认为Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite并非仅包含理想的活性物种；它们包含活性和非活性物种的混合。在较低的铁负载下，活性物种成为主导。通过使用NO作为探针的光谱滴定显示，孤立的、高度配位不饱和的Fe2+离子是主要的活性物种。还有证据表明，较小的Fe2+离子位于小簇上。
