[1] "In this review we have examined the abundant literature on Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite and summarized the most widely accepted views on the structure, nuclearity and catalytic activity of the iron species."

[2] "By comparing the results obtained with the various characterization techniques with the results derived from catalytic experiments, it is concluded that Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are not the ideal samples conceived before and that many type of species are present, some active and some other silent from adsorptive and catalytic point of view."

[3] "The relative concentration of these species changes with thermal treatments, preparation procedures and Fe loading."

[4] "On the basis of the spectroscopic titration of the active sites by using NO as a probe, we conclude that the active species on very diluted samples are isolated and highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the crystalline matrix."

[5] "Indication of the constant presence of a smaller fraction of Fe2+ presumably located on small clusters is also obtained."

[6] "The nitrosyl species formed upon dosing NO from the gas phase on activated Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite, have been analyzed in detail and the similarities and differences with the cationic, heme and non heme homogeneous counterparts have been evidenced."

[7] "The same has been done for the oxygen species formed by N2O decomposition on isolated sites, whose properties are more similar to those of the (FeO)2+ in cationic complexes (included the [(H2O)5FeO]2+ brown ring complex active in Fenton reaction) than to those of ferryl groups in heme and non heme counterparts."

1. This review has examined the extensive literature on Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite, summarizing the most widely accepted perspectives on the structure, nuclearity, and catalytic activity of iron species.

2. By comparing the outcomes of various characterization techniques with catalytic experiment results, it was concluded that Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are not the optimal samples as initially conceived, with a variety of species present, some active and others silent from adsorptive and catalytic viewpoints.

3. The relative concentration of these species varies with thermal treatments, preparation methods, and iron loading.

4. Based on the spectroscopic titration of active sites using NO as a probe, it was concluded that on very diluted samples, the active species are isolated and highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted onto the crystalline matrix.

5. Evidence of the persistent presence of a smaller fraction of Fe2+ presumably situated on small clusters is also obtained.

6. The nitrosyl species produced upon dosing NO from the gas phase on activated Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite have been thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the similarities and differences with cationic, heme, and non-heme homogeneous counterparts.

7. The oxygen species produced by N2O decomposition on isolated sites have properties more akin to those of the (FeO)2+ in cationic complexes (including the [(H2O)5FeO]2+ brown ring complex active in the Fenton reaction) than to ferryl groups in heme and non-heme counterparts.

1. 这篇综述已经检查了关于Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅酸盐的广泛文献，并总结了铁物种的结构、核性以及催化活性的最广泛接受的观点。

2. 通过将各种表征技术的结果与催化实验结果进行比较，得出结论，Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅酸盐并不是以前设想的理想样品，存在多种类型的存在，有些是活性的，有些是从吸附性和催化性角度来看是沉默的。

3. 这些物种的相对浓度随热处理、制备过程和铁含量的变化而变化。

4. 基于使用NO作为探针的光谱滴定法，得出结论，在非常稀释的样品中，活性物种是孤立的、高度配位不饱和的Fe2+附着在晶格矩阵上。

5. 证据表明，可能存在一小部分Fe2+以较小的簇形式存在。

6. 在激活的Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅酸盐上，从气体相中给NO提供后产生的硝基物种已被详细分析，强调了与阳离子、血红素和非血红素同质对应物之间的相似性和差异性。

7. 由N2O分解在孤立点上产生的氧气物种的性质更类似于含水的FeO（包括在Fenton反应中活跃的（H2O）5FeO）2+棕色环复合物，而不是血红素和非血红素对应物中的铁氧基团。
