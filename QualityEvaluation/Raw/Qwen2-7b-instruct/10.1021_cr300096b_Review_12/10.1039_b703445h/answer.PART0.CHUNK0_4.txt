The document discusses Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite as active catalysts in oxidation reactions, which resemble those catalyzed by homogeneous and enzymatic compounds. The N2O decomposition reaction is considered ideal for studying active oxygen formation and migration on Fe-zeolites. The reaction typically proceeds through the deposition of an oxygen atom per iron atom. This reaction mechanism needs the active participation of at least two iron centers. Fe-ZSM-5 is more active than Fe-silicalite when they contain the same amount of iron. The active sites form during activation in inert atmosphere, and after activation, a significant portion of iron is in the divalent state. The activity increases with higher activation temperatures and the number of active sites. In zeolites with low iron content, the number of iron sites forming adsorbed oxygen species is similar in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite. The document concludes that the active sites likely contain a single iron atom.

文档讨论了Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite作为氧化反应中的活性催化剂，这些反应与均相和酶催化的反应有密切的相似性。N2O分解反应被认为是对研究Fe-沸石上活性氧形成和迁移的理想模型。该反应通常通过每个铁原子沉积一个氧原子进行。此反应机制需要至少两个铁中心的积极参与。Fe-ZSM-5的活性高于Fe-silicalite，当它们具有相同量的铁时。活性位点在惰性气氛中活化后形成，且活化后铁的主要部分为二价状态。随着活化温度的升高和活性位点数量的增加，活性增强。在低铁含量的沸石中，形成吸附氧物种的铁位点数量在Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite中大致相同。文档得出结论，活性位点可能包含单个铁原子。
