[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are active catalysts in many relevant oxidation reactions, which find close analogues in homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis."

[3] "In mechanism (i), the migration of oxygen from one active site (*) to the other is the rate determining step.54,61"
[4] "The debate concerning the nuclearity of the catalytic sites (mono- or dinuclear) is still alive. The number of a-sites grows with the concentration,this growth being smaller than that of clustered species.66"
[5] "All other factors being equal, the number of active sites is maximum on catalysts formed by high temperature activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites,61 as compared for example with catalysts obtained with post synthesis impregnation."
[6] "The more recent improvement appears to be the preparation of diluted samples,because there is a compelling evidence that isolated sites are the active centres, while clusters were found to be detrimental to the catalytic activity (favoring total oxidation of the reductant)124126 or inactive.100"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are active catalysts in oxidation reactions with analogues in homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis.
2. The proposed mechanisms for N2O decomposition include three pathways, each involving oxygen migration and formation of different oxygen species.
3. Oxygen migration is rate-limiting in mechanism (i).
4. The nuclearity of catalytic sites is debated, with active sites increasing in number but growing slower than clustered species.
5. High temperature activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites yields catalysts with the highest number of active sites.
6. Diluted samples with isolated Fe2+ sites show high catalytic activity, whereas clusters are detrimental or inactive.

1.Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite在氧化反应中是活性催化剂，与均相和酶催化有相似之处。
2.N2O分解提出了三种机制，每个机制都涉及氧迁移和不同氧物种的形成。
3.在机制（i）中，氧迁移是速率决定步骤。
4.催化位点的核性存在争议，活性位点的数量随浓度增加，但增长速度比簇状物种慢。
5.通过高温激活等摩尔取代的沸石可以产生活性位点数量最多的催化剂。
6.稀释样品中的孤立Fe2+位点显示出高催化活性，而簇状结构是有害的或无效的。
