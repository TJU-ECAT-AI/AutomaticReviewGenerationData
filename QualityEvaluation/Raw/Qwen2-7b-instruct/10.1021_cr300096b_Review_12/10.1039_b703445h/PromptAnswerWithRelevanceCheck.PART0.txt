[1] "The crystalline structure of zeolites is expected to greatly increase the insight into the structure of the catalytic centres (a property lacking when amorphous supports are considered and which is at the origin of many characterization difficulties) and hence to help the characterization of the species formed by interaction with incoming reactants."
[2] "The ability of zeolites to exchange or incorporate single cations in well defined crystallographic positions should allow to control the nuclearity and structure of the metal centre, so favouring the investigation of the analogies between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous counterparts."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are active catalysts in many relevant oxidation reactions, which find close analogues in homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis."
[4] "Fe-ZSM-5 is always more active than Fe-silicalite containing the same amount of Fe."
[5] "The number of active sites is maximum on catalysts formed by high temperature activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites, as compared for example with catalysts obtained with post synthesis impregnation."
[6] "The debate concerning the nuclearity of the catalytic sites (mono- or dinuclear) is still alive."
[7] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are not the ideal samples conceived before and that many types of species are present, some active and some other silent from adsorptive and catalytic point of view."
[8] "Only at the lowest loadings the catalytically active species become the dominant fraction of the iron species."
[9] "On the basis of the spectroscopic titration of the active sites by using NO as a probe, we conclude that the active species on very diluted samples are isolated and highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the crystalline matrix."
[10] "Indication of the constant presence of a smaller fraction of Fe2+ presumably located on small clusters is also obtained."

The crystalline structure of zeolites provides significant insight into the structure of catalytic centers, enabling the characterization of species formed by interaction with reactants. Zeolites' ability to incorporate single cations in defined positions facilitates the investigation of analogies between heterogeneous, enzymatic, and homogeneous catalysts. These materials are active in numerous oxidation reactions that mirror those catalyzed by homogeneous and enzymatic compounds. Fe-ZSM-5 typically exhibits greater activity than Fe-silicalite with similar iron content. High temperature activation maximizes the number of active sites. The nuclearity of catalytic sites remains a debated topic. Contrary to expectations, Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite do not solely contain the ideal active species; they contain a mix of active and inactive species. At lower iron loads, the active species become the majority. Spectroscopic titration with NO indicates that isolated, highly coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ ions are the primary active species. There is also evidence for a smaller fraction of Fe2+ ions located on small clusters.

晶体结构的沸石为催化中心的结构提供了重要洞察，使得能够对与反应物相互作用形成的物种进行表征。沸石将单个离子在定义位置整合的能力，使研究同质、酶和异质催化剂之间的类比成为可能。这些材料在许多与同质和酶催化的反应相似的氧化反应中表现出活性。Fe-ZSM-5的活性通常高于具有相同铁含量的Fe-silicalite。高温活化可最大化活性位点的数量。催化位点的核性仍然是一个有争议的话题。相反，人们认为Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite并非仅包含理想的活性物种；它们包含活性和非活性物种的混合。在较低的铁负载下，活性物种成为主导。通过使用NO作为探针的光谱滴定显示，孤立的、高度配位不饱和的Fe2+离子是主要的活性物种。还有证据表明，较小的Fe2+离子位于小簇上。

The document discusses Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite as active catalysts in oxidation reactions, which resemble those catalyzed by homogeneous and enzymatic compounds. The N2O decomposition reaction is considered ideal for studying active oxygen formation and migration on Fe-zeolites. The reaction typically proceeds through the deposition of an oxygen atom per iron atom. This reaction mechanism needs the active participation of at least two iron centers. Fe-ZSM-5 is more active than Fe-silicalite when they contain the same amount of iron. The active sites form during activation in inert atmosphere, and after activation, a significant portion of iron is in the divalent state. The activity increases with higher activation temperatures and the number of active sites. In zeolites with low iron content, the number of iron sites forming adsorbed oxygen species is similar in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite. The document concludes that the active sites likely contain a single iron atom.

文档讨论了Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite作为氧化反应中的活性催化剂，这些反应与均相和酶催化的反应有密切的相似性。N2O分解反应被认为是对研究Fe-沸石上活性氧形成和迁移的理想模型。该反应通常通过每个铁原子沉积一个氧原子进行。此反应机制需要至少两个铁中心的积极参与。Fe-ZSM-5的活性高于Fe-silicalite，当它们具有相同量的铁时。活性位点在惰性气氛中活化后形成，且活化后铁的主要部分为二价状态。随着活化温度的升高和活性位点数量的增加，活性增强。在低铁含量的沸石中，形成吸附氧物种的铁位点数量在Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-silicalite中大致相同。文档得出结论，活性位点可能包含单个铁原子。
