The results indicate that the catalytic behavior of Pt is significantly affected by the presence of Fe. The enhancement of the catalytic activity observed for the oxidation of CO in air correlates with the fraction and degree of electronic PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, which can be attributed to either an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites. The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can thus become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, it is possible that PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.

1. The presence of Fe significantly affects the catalytic behavior of Pt. The enhancement of the catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO in air is associated with the degree of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, as well as the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Small amounts of Fe also promote the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, potentially through electronic effects or the formation of bimetallic PtFe sites. The close proximity between Pt and Fe in these sites can lead to the reduction of Fe, enhancing its activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Additionally, PtFe adsorption sites may favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, facilitating the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the production of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.

1. 铁的存在显著影响铂的催化行为。氧化空气中的二氧化碳增强活动与铂和铁之间的电子相互作用的量以及一氧化碳在铂上的吸附强度有关。少量铁也能促进铂的环己烷脱氢和α,β不饱和醛的选择性氢化，可能通过电子效应或铂铁双金属位点的形成。铂和铁在这些位点的接近可以使铁还原，从而增强其对环己烷脱氢的活性。此外，铂铁吸附位点可能会促进α,β不饱和醛的二-σCO吸附模式，从而促进CO键的氢化并产生α,β不饱和醇。

2. The catalytic properties of Pt are notably influenced by the presence of Fe. The observed improvement in catalytic activity for the air oxidation of CO is linked to the proportion and intensity of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, as well as the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Likewise, a small amount of Fe boosts the activity of Pt for cyclohexane dehydrogenation and the selective hydrogenation of citral, possibly due to an electronic effect or the existence of bimetallic PtFe sites. The near proximity of Pt and Fe in these sites facilitates the reduction of Fe, enabling it to become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Moreover, it's plausible that PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus accelerating the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.

2. 铂的催化性质受到铁存在的显著影响。空气中的二氧化碳氧化增强活动与铂和铁之间的电子相互作用的比例和强度以及一氧化碳在铂上的吸附强度相关。同样，少量铁可以提升铂的环己烷脱氢和α,β不饱和醛的选择性氢化活性，这可能归因于电子效应或者铂铁双金属位点的存在。铂和铁在这些位点的接近导致铁的还原，使得铁成为环己烷脱氢的活性物质。此外，铂铁吸附位点可能倾向于促进α,β不饱和醛的二-σCO吸附模式，从而加速CO键的氢化并合成α,β不饱和醇。
