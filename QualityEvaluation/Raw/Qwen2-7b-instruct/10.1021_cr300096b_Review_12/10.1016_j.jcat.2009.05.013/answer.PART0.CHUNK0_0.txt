The introduction discusses how supported PtFe bimetallic catalysts have been used in various industrial applications, such as the hydrogenation of CO, removal of hydrocarbons from auto exhausts, purification of H2 streams, reforming of ethylene glycol to produce hydrogen, and selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The text notes that the catalytic performance of PtFe bimetallic materials is often better than that of monometallic Pt, and the improvements may be attributed to the size, composition, structure, and morphology of the metal nanoparticles formed, as well as electronic effects originating from interactions between the metal constituents.

The results indicate that the catalytic behavior of Pt is significantly affected by the presence of Fe. The enhancement of the catalytic activity observed for the oxidation of CO in air correlates with the fraction and degree of electronic PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, which can be attributed to either an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study shows that the catalytic properties of Pt are notably influenced by the presence of Fe. The increased catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO in air is linked to the proportion and intensity of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, as well as the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Similarly, small amounts of Fe boost the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and selective hydrogenation of citral, potentially due to an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites.

One would assume that the increased availability of Fe in the catalyst formulation would lead to a better statistical probability for mixing with Pt, increasing the percentage of bimetallic versus monometallic interactions. To verify this hypothesis, the fractions of PtFe and FePt interactions were calculated for each PtFe/SiO2 sample from the data obtained at each absorption edge. The values obtained were further normalized by the content of the backscattering metal. The results are summarized in Table 2 and surprisingly, they indicate that there is a progressive decrease in the fraction of bimetallic interactions with increase in the Fe content.

Therefore, we can conclude that the sample with the highest degree of interatomic mixing (as evidenced by the larger value of the normalized fraction of FePt interactions) is also the sample characterized by the lowest temperature of 50% CO conversion and, therefore, by the highest activity. Hence, we can safely conclude that direct contact between Pt and Fe is essential for the enhancement of the Pt activity for the oxidation of CO, as we proposed earlier [15] .

Furthermore, the observed increase in the strength of CO adsorption with the increase in the Fe content can be attributed to differences in the electronic structures of the different PtFe/SiO2 samples. For example, the charge transfer for Pt3Fe and Fe3Pt units was previously found to be 0.32 and 0.06 electrons per Fe atom, respectively [60] . This suggests that the transfer of electron density between Fe and Pt strongly depends on the Pt/Fe ratio and decreases with increasing Fe content.

The observed enhancement in the strength of CO adsorption with an increment in the Fe content can be attributed to variations in the electronic structures across the PtFe/SiO2 samples. For instance, the charge transfer for Pt3Fe and Fe3Pt units was earlier reported to be 0.32 and 0.06 electrons per Fe atom, respectively [60]. This implies that the electron density exchange between Fe and Pt is significantly contingent on the Pt/Fe ratio and diminishes with a rise in Fe content.
