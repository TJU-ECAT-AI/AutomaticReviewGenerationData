[1] "The H2 treatment at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, of which some are bimetallic in nature."
[2] "The catalytic behavior of Pt is significantly affected by the presence of Fe."

[4] "The extent of electron density transfer between Fe and Pt depends on the composition and decreases with increasing content of Fe."
[5] "The adsorption of probe molecules (i.e., CO and NO) on samples with different compositions indicates the presence of electron-rich Pt sites formed due to the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe."
[6] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air."
[7] "Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[8] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can be active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[9] "Furthermore, PtFe adsorption sites could favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."
