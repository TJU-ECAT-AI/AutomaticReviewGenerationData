[1] "The H2 treatment at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, of which some are bimetallic in nature and likely exhibit raft-type geometry."
[2] "The fraction of PtFe interactions in each sample depends on the Fe content."
[3] "The adsorption of probe molecules (i.e., CO and NO) on samples with different compositions indicates the presence of electron-rich Pt sites formed due to the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe."
[4] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air."
[5] "These promoting effects can be attributed to an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites."
[6] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can be active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[7] "Furthermore, PtFe adsorption sites could favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."

1. The hydrogen treatment at 350 degrees Celsius results in the creation of metal particles around 2.6 nanometers in size, with some being bimetallic and possibly having a raft-like structure.
2. The proportion of interactions involving both platinum (Pt) and iron (Fe) in each sample is influenced by the amount of iron present.
3. The adsorption of molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) on samples with varying compositions demonstrates the presence of platinum sites with an enriched electron density due to the electronic interactions between platinum and iron.
4. Bimetallic platinum-iron (PtFe) catalysts are more effective than pure platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) in air.
5. These enhancements in catalytic activity are attributed to both an electronic effect and the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites.
6. The close proximity of platinum and iron in such sites facilitates the reduction of iron, making it active for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane.
7. Platinum-iron adsorption sites tend to favor the di-sigma carbon-oxygen (CO) bonding mode for alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes, thereby promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the production of alpha-beta unsaturated alcohols.

1. 在350度的氢处理下，形成了大约2.6纳米大小的金属颗粒，其中一些具有双金属性质，并可能表现出筏状结构。
2. 每个样本中Pt和Fe之间相互作用的比例取决于Fe的含量。
3. 对不同组成样品的吸附分子（如CO和NO）显示铂位点具有富电子性，这是由于Pt与Fe之间的电子交互作用。
4. PtFe双金属催化剂在空气中氧化CO的活性比纯Pt催化剂高。
5. 这些催化活性的增强归因于电子效应以及PtFe双金属位的存在。
6. Pt和Fe在这些位点的近距离结合促进了铁的还原，使其对于环己烷脱氢化活跃。
7. PtFe吸附位倾向于促进α-β不饱和醛中的碳氧双键（CO）吸附模式，从而促进CO键的选择性氢化以及α-β不饱和醇的形成。
