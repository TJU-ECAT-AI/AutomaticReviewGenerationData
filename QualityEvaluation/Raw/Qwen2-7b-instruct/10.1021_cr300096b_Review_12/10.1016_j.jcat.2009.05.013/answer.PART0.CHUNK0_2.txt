[1] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air. This enhancement of the catalytic activity strongly depends on the degree of electronic interaction between the metals and the strength of CO adsorption."
[2] "Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, which can be attributed to either an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites."
[3] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can thus become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Furthermore, it is possible that PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."

1. Bimetallic PtFe catalysts enhance the catalytic activity of CO oxidation in air compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This improvement is largely dependent on the electronic interaction between Pt and Fe and the strength of CO adsorption.

2. Small amounts of Fe can boost the activity of Pt catalysts for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral. These effects might be attributed to either an electronic influence or the presence of PtFe bimetallic sites.

3. The proximity between Pt and Fe in bimetallic sites enables the reduction of Fe, which becomes active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.

4. PtFe adsorption sites may favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, promoting selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the production of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.

1.PtFe/SiO2催化剂在空气中的CO氧化活性比单金属Pt/SiO2催化剂高。这种催化活性的增强主要依赖于Pt和Fe之间的电子相互作用以及CO吸附强度。

2.少量的Fe可以提升Pt催化剂在环己烷脱氢和citral选择性氢化方面的活性。这些效果可能归因于电子效应或者PtFe双金属位点的存在。

3.Pt和Fe在双金属位点的接近使Fe被还原，从而使其在环己烷脱氢中发挥作用。

4.PtFe吸附位点可能有利于α,β-不饱和醛类分子的di-σCO吸附模式，促进CO键的选择性氢化并生成α,β-不饱和醇。
