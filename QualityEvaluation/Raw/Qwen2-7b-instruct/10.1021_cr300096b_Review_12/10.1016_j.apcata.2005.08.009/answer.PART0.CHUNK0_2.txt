1. The addition of Re notably enhances the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in Pd/TiO2 catalysts, whereas its effect on Pt/TiO2 catalysts is less pronounced and depends on the reducing temperature. The formation of bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re in Pt/TiO2 catalysts contributes to the increased activity at higher Re contents.

2. The efficiency of the WGS reaction over Pt-based catalysts improves with the addition of Re, leading to increased metal particle sizes and the formation of specific bimetallic clusters. The TOF of H2 formation reaches a saturation point at a Pt:Re ratio of approximately 2:2, yet the TOF still increases, indicating the presence of bimetallic clusters.

3. In PdRe/TiO2 catalysts, the addition of Re leads to a significant acceleration in the H2 formation rate, especially in catalysts with a 1:1 Pd:Re ratio. However, a different addition mode might be involved for the enhancement effect in catalysts with a 1:10 Pd:Re ratio. 

4. The introduction of Re affects the CO adsorption mechanism on both Pt and Pd catalysts, as evidenced by distinct patterns observed in the IR spectra post-WGS reaction.

5. The WGS reaction over Pt and Pd catalysts with Re addition proceeds via the formation of surface-formate anions, with this step being rate-determining for the reaction.

1. 在Pd/TiO2催化剂中，添加Re显著提高了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换的效率，而Pt/TiO2催化剂中的效果则不太明显，并且依赖于还原温度。在Pt/TiO2催化剂中，随着Re含量的增加，金属颗粒尺寸增大，并形成特定的双金属簇，这有助于提高活性。

2. 在Pt基催化剂中，添加Re能提高WGS反应效率，导致金属颗粒尺寸增大，并形成特定的双金属簇。TOF的H2生成速率在约2:2的Pt:Re比例下达到饱和点，但TOF仍然增加，表明存在双金属簇。

3. 在PdRe/TiO2催化剂中，添加Re导致H2生成速率显著加速，特别是在Pd:Re比为1:1的催化剂中。然而，在Pd:Re比为1:10的催化剂中，可能涉及不同的添加方式来增强性能。

4. 添加Re改变了Pt和Pd催化剂上的CO吸附机制，通过观察WGS反应后IR光谱的不同模式得到了证明。

5. Pt和Pd催化剂中添加Re进行WGS反应时，通过表面-形式酸根离子的形成，该步骤是反应的决定性步骤。
