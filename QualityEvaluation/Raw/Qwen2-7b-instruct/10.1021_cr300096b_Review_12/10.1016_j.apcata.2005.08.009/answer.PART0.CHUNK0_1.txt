3. "WGS activity was increased by addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts."
4. "While the effect of Re-addition is very remarkable in Pd/TiO2, the effect is not so clear in Pt/TiO2, and is rather dependent upon the reducing temperature."
5. "In the cases of Pt catalysts, the metal particle sizes increased, accompanied with the increase of Re contents. Accordingly, although H2 formation rate was saturated at around Pt:Re = 2:2 ratio, their TOFs still increased, indicating the formation of a certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re."
6. "Obvious acceleration was observed in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalyst, which became several times larger over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2. The formation of bimetallic clusters may be responsible for the initial acceleration of H2 formation rate; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."
7. "Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction."
8. "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

1. The addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts enhances their water gas shift (WGS) activity.
2. The impact of Re addition is notably significant in Pd/TiO2 catalysts, whereas its effect on Pt/TiO2 catalysts is less pronounced and temperature-dependent.
3. With the increment of Re content in Pt catalysts, the particle sizes increase, leading to a saturation in the hydrogen formation rate at a Pt:Re ratio of approximately 2:2. However, their turnover frequencies (TOFs) continue to rise, suggesting the formation of specific bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re.
4. A clear acceleration in the hydrogen formation rate is evident in PdRe(1:1) catalysts, becoming several times faster over PdRe(1:10) catalysts. The formation of bimetallic clusters is hypothesized to account for the initial acceleration, yet a different mode of addition is proposed for the subsequent acceleration in PdRe(1:10) catalysts.
5. The introduction of Re leads to altered CO adsorption phenomena, which are detectable in infrared spectra post-WGS reaction.
6. The water gas shift reaction occurs through the formation of a surface-formate anion on Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, with this formation step being the rate-limiting step of the WGS reaction.

1. 添加Re到Pt/TiO2和Pd/TiO2催化剂中可以提高它们的水煤气变换（WGS）活性。
2. Re添加对Pd/TiO2催化剂的影响非常明显，而对Pt/TiO2催化剂的影响则较小且依赖于还原温度。
3. 随着Re含量的增加，Pt催化剂的颗粒尺寸增大，导致氢形成速率在约2:2的Pt:Re比时达到饱和。然而，它们的周转频率（TOFs）仍然增加，表明形成了特定的Pt和Re之间的双金属簇。
4. 明显的加速在PdRe(1:1)催化剂中观察到，相对于PdRe(1:10)催化剂增加了几倍。双金属簇的形成可能解释了初始加速的原因，但对于PdRe(1:10)催化剂的后续加速，提出了不同的添加方式。
5. Re的引入导致了CO吸附现象的变化，在WGS反应后可检测到红外光谱中的变化。
6. 水煤气变换反应通过在添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂上形成的表面-形酸根进行，该形成步骤是WGS反应的速率限制步骤。
