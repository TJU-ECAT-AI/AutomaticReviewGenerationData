[1] "WGS activity was increased by addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts."
[2] "While the effect of Re-addition is very remarkable in Pd/TiO2, the effect is not so clear in Pt/TiO2, and is rather dependent upon the reducing temperature."
[3] "In the cases of Pt catalysts, the metal particle sizes increased, accompanied with the increase of Re contents. Accordingly, although H2 formation rate was saturated at around Pt:Re = 2:2 ratio, their TOFs still increased, indicating the formation of a certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re."
[4] "Obvious acceleration was observed in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalyst, which became several times larger over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2. The formation of bimetallic clusters may be responsible for the initial acceleration of H2 formation rate; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."
[5] "Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction."
[6] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

1. The addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts increases their water gas shift (WGS) activity. 
2. The impact of adding Re is more noticeable in Pd/TiO2 catalysts than in Pt/TiO2, and its effect on Pt/TiO2 depends on the reduction temperature.
3. The addition of Re leads to an increase in the size of Pt particles in Pt/TiO2 catalysts, resulting in an increase in their turnover frequency (TOF) even when the hydrogen formation rate saturates at a Pt:Re ratio of 2:2.
4. The addition of Re to Pd/TiO2 catalysts results in an acceleration of the hydrogen formation rate, which is attributed to the formation of bimetallic clusters. However, the mechanism for the later acceleration effect in PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts is different.
5. The addition of Re alters the CO adsorption characteristics in Pd/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts, influencing the WGS reaction mechanism.
6. The water gas shift reaction over Pt and Pd catalysts with Re addition proceeds via the formation of surface formate anions, which is the rate-determining step in the reaction.

1. 向Pt/TiO2和Pd/TiO2催化剂中添加Re可以提高它们的水气转换（WGS）活性。
2. 在Pd/TiO2催化剂中，添加Re的影响更为显著，而Pt/TiO2催化剂中的影响则依赖于还原温度。
3. 添加Re导致Pt/TiO2催化剂中的Pt颗粒尺寸增加，即使在Pt:Re比例为2:2时氢生成速率饱和，其转速（TOF）仍然增加，这表明形成了Pt与Re之间的特定双金属簇。
4. 对Pd/TiO2催化剂添加Re会导致氢生成速率加速，这归因于形成双金属簇。然而，对于PdRe(1:10)/TiO2催化剂的后期加速机制不同。
5. 添加Re改变了Pd/TiO2和Pt/TiO2催化剂中的CO吸附特性，影响了WGS反应机制。
6. Pt和Pd催化剂中添加Re进行水气转换反应通过表面形酸离子的形成进行，这是反应的决定性步骤。
