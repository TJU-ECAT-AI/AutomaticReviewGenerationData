[1] "WGS activity was increased by addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts."
[2] "While the effect of Re-addition is very remarkable in Pd/TiO2, the effect is not so clear in Pt/TiO2, and is rather dependent upon the reducing temperature."
[3] "In the cases of Pt catalysts, the metal particle sizes increased, accompanied with the increase of Re contents. Accordingly, although H2 formation rate was saturated at around Pt:Re = 2:2 ratio, their TOFs still increased, indicating the formation of a certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re."
[4] "Obvious acceleration was observed in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalyst, which became several times larger over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2. The formation of bimetallic clusters may be responsible for the initial acceleration of H2 formation rate; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."
[5] "Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction."
[6] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

The addition of Re to Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts enhances their activity in the water gas shift reaction. The impact is more pronounced in Pd/TiO2 catalysts, being influenced by the reduction temperature in Pt/TiO2 catalysts. The particle size of Pt increases with the addition of Re, leading to a saturation in the hydrogen formation rate at a Pt:Re ratio of 2:2, yet the turnover frequency (TOF) continues to rise, indicating the formation of bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re. Acceleration is observed in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts, becoming several times faster than in PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts, likely due to the formation of bimetallic clusters responsible for the initial acceleration, with a different addition method suggested for the subsequent acceleration effect in PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts. The addition of Re alters CO adsorption in the water gas shift reaction, forming surface-formate anions, which are the rate-determining step in the reaction.

向Pt/TiO2和Pd/TiO2催化剂中添加Re可以增强它们在水煤气转换反应中的活性。在Pd/TiO2催化剂中，影响更为明显，并且Pt/TiO2催化剂的活性受到还原温度的影响。Pt的颗粒尺寸随着Re的增加而增大，在Pt:Re比例为2:2时氢生成速率达到饱和，但TOF继续增加，表明形成了Pt和Re之间的二元合金簇。在PdRe(1:1)/TiO2催化剂中观察到加速作用，其氢生成速率比PdRe(1:10)/TiO2催化剂快几倍，这可能归因于形成二元合金簇导致的初始加速，对于PdRe(1:10)/TiO2催化剂的后续加速作用提出了不同的添加方式。Re的添加改变了水煤气转换反应中的CO吸附，形成了表面-形酸根离子，这是反应的决定性步骤。
