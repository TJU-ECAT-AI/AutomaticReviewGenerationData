3.1. WGS reaction activity
The WGS reaction activities over bimetallic AuM/CeO2 (M = Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Pd) catalysts were evaluated and the results are shown in Fig. 1 a. The activity is found to be as function of reaction temperature for all the catalysts studied. And different catalyst shows very different catalytic activity. For example, the AuPt/CeO2 catalyst displays a higher activity than other catalysts. The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2.

3.2. XRD patterns
Fig. 3 represents the XRD patterns of bimetallic AuM/CeO2 (M = Cu, Ni, Ag, Pd, and Pt) catalysts. In the XRD patterns of all samples, the diffraction lines of Au, Pt or AuxPty alloy phases are not visible and the diffraction lines of ceria are typical of the cubic crystal structure of fluorite type oxide. The fact that the interplanar crystal space d(1 1 1) of all studied samples are higher than that of stoichiometric ceria indicates that the addition of Au and M has an effect on the structure of ceria, resulting in the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ species. Moreover, the introduction of Au and M to ceria makes the size of ceria smaller.

3.3. H2-TPR analysis
Ceria is capable of being readily reduced and reoxidized, so H2-TPR is employed to study the reducibility of ceria-based catalysts. Fig. 4 shows TPR profiles of CeO2, Au/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and AuPt/CeO2 samples. The TPR profile of pure CeO2 consists of a low-temperature reduction peak at Tmax = 475 C and a high-temperature reduction peak at Tmax = 790 C. The former is assigned to the reduction of surface ceria and the later is connected to the reduction of bulk ceria. When gold was supported on CeO2, the reduction of CeO2 remains unchanged but there appears a new reduction peak at Tmax = 175 C which could be related to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles. In Pt/CeO2, the high-temperature reduction peak shifts significantly to the lower temperature at Tmax = 720 C, indicating that the reduction of surface ceria can be enhanced by Pt. And moreover, there is an overlap between the reduction of the Pt2+ and the reduction of the surface ceria oxygen species. For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C.

3.4. UVvis DRS analysis
Fig. 5 shows UVvis diffuse reflection spectra of CeO2, Au/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, AuPt/CeO2, Au(Pt)/CeO2, and PtAu/CeO2 samples. Ceria possesses two characteristic bands centered at 355 and 370 nm, assigned to the charge transfer band of ceria (Ce4f  O2p). After doping Au to ceria, the two bands disappear and a new band centered at about 450 nm is observed. The band is assigned to the typical plasmon resonance absorption of gold nanoparticles. For Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the present of Pt also makes the two bands of ceria disappearance. We do not observe the absorption peak of Pt in UV region. AuPt/CeO2, Au(Pt)/CeO2, and PtAu/CeO2 catalysts give very similar spectra as Au/CeO2. Due to the presence of Pt, however, the intensity of Au absorption band enhances distinctly.

3.5. XPS analysis
XPS is used to investigate the interaction between gold and platinum in goldplatinum catalysts supported on ceria. The XPS spectra of Au 4f, Pt 3d, Ce 3d, and O 1s for the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 , Fig. 9 , respectively, and the derived XPS data are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the Au 4f7/2 peak is centered at 84.0, 84.1 and 84.3 eV for Au/CeO2, for AuPt/CeO2 and for Au(Pt)/CeO2, respectively. According to the reports of Chastain, the Au 4f7/2 peaks of Au0, Au+, and Au3+ appear at 83.8, 86.2, and 87.3 eV, respectively. So it can be certain that most of gold in these catalysts is metallic, but part of gold remains ionic. Moreover, the presence of Pt can achieve a strong metal-support interaction to stabilize gold ions.

The introduction of platinum in the AuPt/CeO2 catalyst leads to a higher activity in the water gas shift reaction compared to other catalysts. This is evidenced by the fact that the WGS reaction activities over the catalysts decrease in the order AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2. The XRD patterns reveal that the addition of Au and M affects the structure of ceria, creating oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ species. The size of ceria is also reduced due to the introduction of Au and M. The H2-TPR analysis shows that the presence of platinum enhances the reduction of ceria, leading to an overlap between the reduction of Pt2+ and the surface ceria oxygen species. In the UVvis DRS analysis, the presence of Au and Pt affects the absorption spectra of ceria, with the intensity of the Au absorption band increasing distinctly due to the presence of Pt. The XPS analysis confirms that most of the gold in the catalysts is metallic, with the presence of Pt achieving a strong metal-support interaction to stabilize gold ions.

铂在AuPt/CeO2催化剂中的引入导致水煤气变换反应活性更高，与其他催化剂相比。这体现在水煤气变换反应活性随催化剂的不同而下降的顺序为：AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2。XRD图谱显示，Au和M的加入影响了氧化铈的结构，产生了氧空位和Ce3+物种。氧化铈的大小也由于Au和M的引入而减小。H2-TPR分析表明，铂的存在增强了氧化铈的还原性，导致了Pt2+和表面氧化铈氧物种之间的重叠。在UVvis DRS分析中，Au和Pt的存在影响了氧化铈的吸收光谱，由于铂的存在，Au吸收带的强度显著增加。XPS分析证实，在催化剂中的大部分金是金属态的，铂的存在实现了强大的金属支持相互作用，稳定了金离子。
