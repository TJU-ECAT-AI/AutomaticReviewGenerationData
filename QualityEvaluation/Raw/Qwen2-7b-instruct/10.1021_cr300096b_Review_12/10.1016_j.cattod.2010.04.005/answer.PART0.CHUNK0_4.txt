3.1. WGS reaction activity
"The WGS reaction activities over bimetallic AuM/CeO2 (M = Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Pd) catalysts were evaluated and the results are shown in Fig. 1 a. The activity is found to be as function of reaction temperature for all the catalysts studied. And different catalyst shows very different catalytic activity. For example, the AuPt/CeO2 catalyst displays a higher activity than other catalysts. The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2."

3.2. XRD patterns
"In the XRD patterns of all samples, the diffraction lines of Au, Pt or AuxPty alloy phases are not visible and the diffraction lines of ceria are typical of the cubic crystal structure of fluorite type oxide. The fact that the interplanar crystal space d(1 1 1) of all studied samples are higher than that of stoichiometric ceria indicates that the addition of Au and M has an effect on the structure of ceria, resulting in the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ species [22] . Moreover, the introduction of Au and M to ceria makes the size of ceria smaller."

3.3. H2-TPR analysis
"When gold was supported on CeO2, the reduction of CeO2 remains unchanged but there appears a new reduction peak at Tmax = 175 C which could be related to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles [2] . In Pt/CeO2, the high-temperature reduction peak shifts significantly to the lower temperature at Tmax = 720 C, indicating that the reduction of surface ceria can be enhanced by Pt. And moreover, there is an overlap between the reduction of the Pt2+ and the reduction of the surface ceria oxygen species."

3.4. UVvis DRS analysis
"Ceria possesses two characteristic bands centered at 355 and 370 nm, assigned to the charge transfer band of ceria (Ce4f  O2p). After doping Au to ceria, the two bands disappear and a new band centered at about 450 nm is observed. The band is assigned to the typical plasmon resonance absorption of gold nanoparticles [23] . For Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the present of Pt also makes the two bands of ceria disappearance. We do not observe the absorption peak of Pt in UV region."

3.5. XPS analysis
"It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the Au 4f7/2 peak is centered at 84.0, 84.1 and 84.3 eV for Au/CeO2, for AuPt/CeO2 and for Au(Pt)/CeO2, respectively. According to the reports of Chastain [24] , the Au 4f7/2 peaks of Au0, Au+, and Au3+ appear at 83.8, 86.2, and 87.3 eV, respectively. So it can be certain that most of gold in these catalysts is metallic, but part of gold remains ionic."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, show enhanced activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions compared to their monometallic counterparts. The addition of metals like Pt to catalysts supports the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions, which contribute to the increased catalytic efficiency. The introduction of Pt facilitates the formation of partly oxidized gold species, which likely play a crucial role in the enhanced activity. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could offer insights into the interactions between Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and model surfaces or supported catalysts, potentially elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing their catalytic behavior. These studies might reveal how the specific structures and compositions of Pt-based catalysts affect their activity in various chemical reactions, offering a deeper understanding of their performance and guiding the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.
