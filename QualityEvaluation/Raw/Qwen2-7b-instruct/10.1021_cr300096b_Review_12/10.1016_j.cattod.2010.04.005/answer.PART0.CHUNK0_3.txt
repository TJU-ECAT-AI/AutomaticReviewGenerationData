[1] "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."
[2] "The action of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, UVvis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[3] "The introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."
[4] "The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."
[5] "The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2."
[6] "The addition of such as platinum or nickel components brings a positive effect on gold catalysts for WGS reaction."
[7] "For Au-based bimetallic catalyst, Lee et al. and Sarkany et al. suggested that the increase in Pd d-band electron density for AuPd bimetallic particles originates from the charge transfer from the Au 5d10 to Pd d-band."
[8] "These changes are considered as the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions."

Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing Pt, enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The Pt component facilitates the formation of partly oxidized gold species via interatomic charge transfer, contributing to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species and the creation of oxygen vacancies. This results in a smaller average size of ceria, which correlates positively with increased activity in these reactions. Platinum also improves the catalytic activity of gold-based catalysts, as evidenced by studies comparing the activity of AuPt/CeO2 catalysts with other bimetallic systems. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide deeper insights into the interactions between Pt and Au on model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially elucidating the mechanisms behind their enhanced performance. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces highlight the need for further investigation to fully understand and optimize the behavior of these catalysts under realistic conditions.

铂基双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水气转换反应和甲烷转化的反应器研究中提高了效率。铂成分通过原子间电荷转移促进了部分氧化金物种的形成，有助于铈的还原至Ce3+物种以及氧空位和Ce3+离子的产生。这导致了铈平均粒径的减小，与这些反应活性的增加相关。铂也提高了基于金的催化剂的活性，如Lee等人和Sarkany等人所研究的AuPd双金属粒子中Pd d带电子密度的增加起源于从Au 5d10到Pd d带的电荷转移。这些变化被认为是从Au 5d到Pt 5d带的原子间电荷转移，伴随着原子内电荷重分布。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以为模型表面和支撑催化剂上的Pt与Au之间的相互作用提供更深入的见解，可能揭示它们增强性能的机制。目前对基于铂的双金属表面的UHV研究的限制强调了进一步研究以完全理解并优化在实际条件下这些催化剂行为的重要性。
