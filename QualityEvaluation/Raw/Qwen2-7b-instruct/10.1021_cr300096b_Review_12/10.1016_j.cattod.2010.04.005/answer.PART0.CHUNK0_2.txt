[1] "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."
[2] "It is found that the introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."
[3] "The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."
[4] "The addition of metal M has an influence on catalytic activity due to the nature of modifier metal. The components such as platinum and nickel exert an advance effect on catalysis by metals for WGSR."
[5] "The introduction of gold or platinum active component not only makes the size of CeO2 smaller but also affects the structure of CeO2, resulting in the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions."
[6] "Furthermore, the addition of Pt is conducive to the formation of Auδ+ because of the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions."

1. The introduction of platinum in the AuPt/CeO2 catalyst leads to the formation of partly oxidized gold species, enhancing its catalytic activity. This is due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band. The combination of both gold and platinum components benefits the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species, creates oxygen vacancies, and makes the average size of ceria smaller, contributing to higher efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions.

2. Platinum and nickel, as modifier metals, positively impact catalytic activity in water gas shift reaction (WGSR). They improve the performance of the catalysts by affecting the structure of the support material, ceria, and facilitating the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions.

3. The presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, along with a high concentration of surface oxygen and a low degree of Ce3+ surface defects, is crucial for the enhanced catalytic activity of the bimetallic AuPt catalyst in the water gas shift reaction.

1. 铂在AuPt/CeO2催化剂中的引入导致部分氧化的金物种形成，增强了其催化活性。这是由于Au 5d到Pt 5d带的原子间电荷转移所致。金和铂成分的组合不仅使铈氧化物的大小变小，而且影响铈氧化物的结构，导致氧空位和Ce3+离子的产生，从而对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换效率有更高的提升。

2. 铂和镍作为修饰金属，在水煤气变换反应中能显著提高催化剂的活性。它们通过改变支持材料氧化铈的结构，并促进氧空位和Ce3+离子的生成来改善催化剂性能。

3. 两种金态和离子态金物种的存在，以及表面氧的高浓度和Ce3+表面缺陷的低程度，对于AuPt双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应中的增强催化活性至关重要。
