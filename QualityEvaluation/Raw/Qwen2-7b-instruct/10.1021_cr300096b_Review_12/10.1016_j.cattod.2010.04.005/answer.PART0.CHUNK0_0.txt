3.1. WGS reaction activity
The WGS reaction activities over bimetallic AuM/CeO2 (M = Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Pd) catalysts were evaluated and the results are shown in Fig. 1 a. The activity is found to be as function of reaction temperature for all the catalysts studied. And different catalyst shows very different catalytic activity. For example, the AuPt/CeO2 catalyst displays a higher activity than other catalysts. The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2. Recently, Hurtado-Juan's work also showed AuPt/CeO2 had the highest WGS reaction activity [18].

3.2. XRD patterns
Fig. 3 represents the XRD patterns of bimetallic AuM/CeO2 (M = Cu, Ni, Ag, Pd, and Pt) catalysts. In the XRD patterns of all samples, the diffraction lines of Au, Pt or AuxPty alloy phases are not visible and the diffraction lines of ceria are typical of the cubic crystal structure of fluorite type oxide. The fact that the interplanar crystal space d(1 1 1) of all studied samples are higher than that of stoichiometric ceria indicates that the addition of Au and M has an effect on the structure of ceria, resulting in the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ species [22]. Moreover, the introduction of Au and M to ceria makes the size of ceria smaller.

3.3. H2-TPR analysis
Ceria is capable of being readily reduced and reoxidized, so H2-TPR is employed to study the reducibility of ceria-based catalysts. Fig. 4 shows TPR profiles of CeO2, Au/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and AuPt/CeO2 samples. The TPR profile of pure CeO2 consists of a low-temperature reduction peak at Tmax = 475 C and a high-temperature reduction peak at Tmax = 790 C. The former is assigned to the reduction of surface ceria and the later is connected to the reduction of bulk ceria [14]. When gold was supported on CeO2, the reduction of CeO2 remains unchanged but there appears a new reduction peak at Tmax = 175 C which could be related to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles [2]. In Pt/CeO2, the high-temperature reduction peak shifts significantly to the lower temperature at Tmax = 720 C, indicating that the reduction of surface ceria can be enhanced by Pt. And moreover, there is an overlap between the reduction of the Pt2+ and the reduction of the surface ceria oxygen species. For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria.

3.4. UVvis DRS analysis
Fig. 5 shows UVvis diffuse reflection spectra of CeO2, Au/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, AuPt/CeO2, Au(Pt)/CeO2, and PtAu/CeO2 samples. Ceria possesses two characteristic bands centered at 355 and 370 nm, assigned to the charge transfer band of ceria (Ce4f  O2p). After doping Au to ceria, the two bands disappear and a new band centered at about 450 nm is observed. The band is assigned to the typical plasmon resonance absorption of gold nanoparticles [23]. For Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the present of Pt also makes the two bands of ceria disappearance. We do not observe the absorption peak of Pt in UV region. AuPt/CeO2, Au(Pt)/CeO2, and PtAu/CeO2 catalysts give very similar spectra as Au/CeO2. Due to the presence of Pt, however, the intensity of Au absorption band enhances distinctly. It suggests that the addition of Pt promotes the reduction of Au3+ and the production of Au particles.

3.5. XPS analysis
XPS is used to investigate the interaction between gold and platinum in gold-platinum catalysts supported on ceria. The XPS spectra of Au 4f, Pt 3d, Ce 3d, and O 1s for the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 , Fig. 9 , respectively, and the derived XPS data are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the Au 4f7/2 peak is centered at 84.0, 84.1 and 84.3 eV for Au/CeO2, for AuPt/CeO2 and for Au(Pt)/CeO2, respectively. According to the reports of Chastain [24], the Au 4f7/2 peaks of Au0, Au+, and Au3+ appear at 83.8, 86.2, and 87.3 eV, respectively. So it can be certain that most of gold in these catalysts is metallic, but part of gold remains ionic. Moreover, the presence of Pt can achieve a strong metal-support interaction to stabilize gold ions. While metallic gold on ceria surface decreases, ionic gold component increases with the platinum content in the samples. This result is in agreement with the higher active Au(Pt)/CeO2 and AuPt/CeO2 catalysts.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, enhance the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by influencing the structure and reducibility of ceria support. Platinum introduces a positive effect on the formation of partly oxidized gold species, which facilitates the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species and the creation of oxygen vacancies. This results in the formation of smaller-sized ceria particles, improving the catalyst's activity. The presence of both gold and platinum components in AuPt/CeO2 catalysts leads to higher WGS reaction activities compared to other systems. The Pt-based bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher concentrations of surface oxygen and lower degrees of Ce3+ surface defects, contributing to their superior catalytic performance.

Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into the correlation between the findings and model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies might hinder the detailed exploration of surface interactions and the dynamics of Pt and Au species on ceria surfaces under realistic reaction conditions. These studies could potentially reveal the specific adsorption energies, coordination geometries, and reaction pathways of key species involved in the WGS reaction, offering a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism and guiding the rational design of more efficient Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

铂基双金属催化剂通过影响氧化铈支持体的结构和可还原性，增强了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率。铂引入了部分氧化金物种的形成，这促进了氧化铈的还原到Ce3+物种以及氧空位的产生。这导致了氧化铈粒子尺寸的减小，从而提高了催化剂的活性。在AuPt/CeO2双金属催化剂中，铂和金成分的存在导致更高的WGS反应活性，与其他系统相比。Pt基双金属催化剂表现出较高的表面氧浓度和较低的Ce3+表面缺陷度，这是它们优越催化性能的原因。

未来对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究可以提供模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的发现的相关性。然而，当前UHV研究的限制可能阻碍了对真实反应条件下Pt和Au物种与氧化铈表面相互作用的详细探索。这些研究可能揭示关键物种吸附能、配位几何和反应途径的具体细节，为更深入理解催化机制并指导设计更高效的Pt基双金属催化剂提供洞见。
