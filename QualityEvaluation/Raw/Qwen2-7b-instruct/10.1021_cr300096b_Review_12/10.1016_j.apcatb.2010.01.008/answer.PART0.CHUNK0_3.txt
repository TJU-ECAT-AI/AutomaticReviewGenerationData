<p>The results obtained in this work on CH4 combustion activity and reduction/re-oxidation behavior of bimetallic Pd-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with constant Pd loading (2%, w/w) and different Pt/Pd atomic ratios (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 1) pointed out the following main conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample.</li>
<li>Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work. Reduction/re-oxidation cycles are also beneficial for the specific activity of PdO in Pt/Pd-0.25, but overall catalytic performances of this system are limited by the extent of PdO formation under the investigated conditions. Complete suppression of PdO formation is also responsible for the marked deactivation of Pt/Pd-1 upon reduction, proving that PdO is the active phase in CH4 combustion since when absent CH4 conversion is negligible.</li>
<li>Pt inhibiting effect on palladium re-oxidation also affects reactivation dynamics, which is progressively slower the higher is the Pt/Pd ratio. This may have negative practical consequences when periodical reduction would be applied for catalyst regeneration. In fact, the longer period required to achieve high conversion performances would result in higher CH4 emissions in the overall working cycle.</li>
<li>The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples. Such lack of correlation is possibly due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective onto the metallic surface which prevails in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and poor onto the passivated surface which occur in the presence of excess of oxygen (lean combustion).</li>
<li>As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity.</li>

The study concludes that the addition of platinum to palladium catalysts influences their efficiency in methane combustion and other reactions. Platinum enhances the decomposition and chemical reduction of palladium oxide (PdO) and inhibits the oxidation of metallic palladium, especially at higher Pt/Pd ratios. Repeated reduction and oxidation cycles increase the activity of certain bimetallic catalysts, notably those with lower Pt/Pd ratios, up to their highest levels among tested catalysts. The extent of palladium oxidation affects the reactivation dynamics, which are slower with higher Pt/Pd ratios, potentially leading to increased methane emissions during regeneration. The study also finds that the correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity is less pronounced in bimetallic catalysts due to the differing abilities of platinum to activate CH4 in different environments. Overall, the effect of platinum on palladium oxide's catalytic activity is complex and depends on various factors such as the formation of palladium oxide, the strength of the palladium-support interaction, and the stabilization of metallic palladium.

研究得出，铂金添加到钯催化剂中会影响它们在甲烷燃烧和其他反应中的效率。铂金增强了钯氧化物（PdO）的分解和化学还原，并抑制了金属钯的氧化，尤其是在较高的Pt/Pd比的情况下。重复的还原和氧化周期增加了某些二元催化剂的活性，特别是那些较低的Pt/Pd比，达到了测试催化剂中的最高水平。钯氧化的程度影响了重新激活的动力学，随着Pt/Pd比例的增加而变慢，这可能导致再生期间甲烷排放量的增加。研究还发现，在不同的环境中，铂金激活甲烷的能力不同，导致了PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性在二元催化剂中较少。总的来说，铂对钯氧化物的催化活性的影响是复杂的，取决于各种因素，如钯氧化物的形成、钯支持相互作用的强度以及金属钯的稳定化。
