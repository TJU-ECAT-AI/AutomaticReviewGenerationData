[1] "The results obtained in this work on CH4 combustion activity and reduction/re-oxidation behavior of bimetallic Pd-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with constant Pd loading (2%, w/w) and different Pt/Pd atomic ratios (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 1) pointed out the following main conclusions:(1) Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, have a profound influence on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts enhance the catalytic activity through their ability to promote the thermal decomposition and chemical reduction of PdO. The presence of Pt not only accelerates the reduction of PdO by CH4 but also inhibits the oxidation of metallic Pd, which is completely halted in the Pt/Pd-1 sample. This inhibitory effect of Pt on PdO formation leads to a slower reactivation dynamics, as the higher the Pt/Pd ratio, the slower the reactivation process becomes. Moreover, the relationship between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity is observed in monometallic catalysts but does not apply to bimetallic samples. The overall effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward, depending on various factors such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pd-support interactions, and the stabilization of metallic Pd.

这些双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换机制及效率产生了深远影响。这些催化剂通过促进PdO的热分解和化学还原来增强催化活性。Pt不仅加速了PdO由CH4还原，而且抑制了金属Pd的氧化，Pt/Pd-1样品中的氧化完全停止。Pt对PdO形成的抑制作用导致了重新激活动态的减慢，随着Pt/Pd比例的增加，重新激活过程变得更加缓慢。此外，PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的关系在单金属催化剂中被观察到，但在双金属样品中并不适用。总体而言，Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响并不直接，这取决于各种因素，如PdO形成的程度、Pd支持相互作用的强度以及金属Pd的稳定化。

1. The addition of Pt to bimetallic catalysts enhances the thermal decomposition and chemical reduction of PdO, while oxidation of metallic Pd is inhibited, especially in samples with a Pt/Pd ratio of 1. 
2. Repeated reduction/re-oxidation cycles significantly boost the catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 catalysts, achieving the highest activity levels among the tested catalysts.
3. The correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity, which is observed in monometallic catalysts, does not hold for bimetallic catalysts due to the contrasting abilities of Pt to activate CH4 in the presence and absence of oxygen.
4. The effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is complex, influenced by factors such as PdO formation extent, Pd-support interaction strength, and metallic Pd stabilization. Pt can act as either an inhibitor or promoter of catalytic activity depending on these conditions.

1. 添加Pt到双金属催化剂中，促进了PdO的热分解和化学还原，同时增加了Pd的氧化抑制，特别是在Pt/Pd比例为1的样品中。
2. 反复的还原/氧化循环显著提高了Pt/Pd-0和Pt/Pd-0.10催化剂的催化活性，达到测试催化剂中的最高水平。
3. 在单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO可还原性与甲烷燃烧活性之间的相关性，在双金属催化剂中并不适用，这是由于在有氧和无氧条件下，Pt激活甲烷的能力不同所致。
4. Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响复杂，受到PdO形成程度、Pd支持相互作用强度和金属Pd稳定性的影响。根据这些条件，Pt可以作为催化活性的抑制剂或促进剂。

<p>In the specific conditions of the exhausts (low temperature, 300400 C; presence of 1015% of H2O; large excess of O2, low CH4 concentrations, 5001000 ppm) Pd supported catalysts are widely recognized as the most active in CH4 combustion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ; nevertheless, Pd catalysts suffer from deactivation problems due to the prolonged exposure to reaction conditions containing both H2O and S-containing compounds which are strong poisons for Pd-based systems [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] .

1. In the conditions of exhaust gases, Pd-based catalysts are highly effective for CH4 combustion, but they face deactivation issues due to prolonged exposure to environments with H2O and sulfur-containing compounds. Adding Pt to Pd-containing catalysts enhances their stability compared to Pd monometallic catalysts.

2. The correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity, as seen in monometallic catalysts, does not apply to bimetallic samples. This discrepancy could be attributed to the varying capacities of Pt to activate CH4, which is more effective on the metallic surface in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and less so on the passivated surface in the presence of excess oxygen (lean combustion).

2. 单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性，在双金属样品的情况下并不适用。这种不一致可能是由于Pt激活CH4的能力不同所导致的，它在无氧环境下对金属表面更有效（CH4-TPR），而在氧气过剩环境下对被钝化的表面效果较差。

The study concludes that the addition of platinum to palladium catalysts influences their efficiency in methane combustion and other reactions. Platinum enhances the decomposition and chemical reduction of palladium oxide (PdO) and inhibits the oxidation of metallic palladium, especially at higher Pt/Pd ratios. Repeated reduction and oxidation cycles increase the activity of certain bimetallic catalysts, notably those with lower Pt/Pd ratios, up to their highest levels among tested catalysts. The extent of palladium oxidation affects the reactivation dynamics, which are slower with higher Pt/Pd ratios, potentially leading to increased methane emissions during regeneration. The study also finds that the correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity is less pronounced in bimetallic catalysts due to the differing abilities of platinum to activate CH4 in different environments. Overall, the effect of platinum on palladium oxide's catalytic activity is complex and depends on various factors such as the formation of palladium oxide, the strength of the palladium-support interaction, and the stabilization of metallic palladium.

研究得出，铂金添加到钯催化剂中会影响它们在甲烷燃烧和其他反应中的效率。铂金增强了钯氧化物（PdO）的分解和化学还原，并抑制了金属钯的氧化，尤其是在较高的Pt/Pd比的情况下。重复的还原和氧化周期增加了某些二元催化剂的活性，特别是那些较低的Pt/Pd比，达到了测试催化剂中的最高水平。钯氧化的程度影响了重新激活的动力学，随着Pt/Pd比例的增加而变慢，这可能导致再生期间甲烷排放量的增加。研究还发现，在不同的环境中，铂金激活甲烷的能力不同，导致了PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性在二元催化剂中较少。总的来说，铂对钯氧化物的催化活性的影响是复杂的，取决于各种因素，如钯氧化物的形成、钯支持相互作用的强度以及金属钯的稳定化。

1. Adding Pt enhances the breakdown and reduction of PdO. The higher the Pt/Pd ratio, the more the oxidation of metallic Pd is inhibited, leading to no oxidation for the Pt/Pd-1 sample.
2. Repeating reduction and oxidation cycles boosts the catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples, reaching the highest levels among the tested catalysts during conditioning.
3. The effect of Pt on the re-oxidation of palladium slows down the reactivation process, making it progressively slower with an increase in the Pt/Pd ratio. This could have negative implications for periodic catalyst regeneration.
4. The relationship between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity seen in monometallic catalysts doesn't apply to bimetallic samples. This discrepancy might be due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective on the metallic surface in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and ineffective on the passivated surface in the presence of excess oxygen (lean combustion).
5. The impact of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not clear-cut. The outcome depends on various factors, including the extent of PdO formation, the strength of metal-support interactions, and the stabilization of metallic Pd. Pt can either inhibit or enhance catalytic activity based on these factors.

1. 添加Pt可以促进PdO的热分解和化学还原。Pt/Pd比率越高，金属Pd的氧化越受抑制，Pt/Pd-1样品中不存在氧化。
2. 反复进行还原和氧化循环可以提高Pt/Pd-0和Pt/Pd-0.10催化剂的催化活性，在条件处理过程中达到最高水平。
3. Pt对钯的再氧化作用降低了再活化动力学，随着Pt/Pd比率的增加，再活化过程逐渐变慢。这可能对周期性催化剂再生产生负面影响。
4. 在单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性不适用于双金属样本。这种差异可能是由于Pt激活CH4的能力不同，它在缺乏氧气的情况下（CH4-TPR）在金属表面有效，在过剩氧气的情况下（稀燃条件下），在钝化表面上效果不佳。
5. Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响并不明确。结果取决于多种因素，包括PdO形成的程度、金属-支持相互作用的强度以及金属Pd的稳定化。Pt可以根据这些因素是抑制或增强催化活性。
