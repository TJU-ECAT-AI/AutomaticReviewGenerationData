<p>In the specific conditions of the exhausts (low temperature, 300400 C; presence of 1015% of H2O; large excess of O2, low CH4 concentrations, 5001000 ppm) Pd supported catalysts are widely recognized as the most active in CH4 combustion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ; nevertheless, Pd catalysts suffer from deactivation problems due to the prolonged exposure to reaction conditions containing both H2O and S-containing compounds which are strong poisons for Pd-based systems [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] . Some literature reports [15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] suggest that the addition of Pt to Pd-containing catalysts leads to an improvement of catalyst stability under reaction conditions with respect to the Pd monometallic catalyst.</p>

1. In the conditions of exhaust gases, Pd-based catalysts are highly effective for CH4 combustion, but they face deactivation issues due to prolonged exposure to environments with H2O and sulfur-containing compounds. Adding Pt to Pd-containing catalysts enhances their stability compared to Pd monometallic catalysts.

1. 在排气气体条件下，Pd基催化剂在甲烷燃烧中表现出高效率，但它们面临由于长时间暴露于含有水和硫化物的环境而导致的失活问题。向Pd含有的催化剂中添加Pt可以增强其稳定性，与单金属Pd催化剂相比。

<p>The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples. Such lack of correlation is possibly due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective onto the metallic surface which prevails in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and poor onto the passivated surface which occur in the presence of excess of oxygen (lean combustion).</p>

2. The correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity, as seen in monometallic catalysts, does not apply to bimetallic samples. This discrepancy could be attributed to the varying capacities of Pt to activate CH4, which is more effective on the metallic surface in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and less so on the passivated surface in the presence of excess oxygen (lean combustion).

2. 单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性，在双金属样品的情况下并不适用。这种不一致可能是由于Pt激活CH4的能力不同所导致的，它在无氧环境下对金属表面更有效（CH4-TPR），而在氧气过剩环境下对被钝化的表面效果较差。
