[1] "The results obtained in this work on CH4 combustion activity and reduction/re-oxidation behavior of bimetallic Pd-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with constant Pd loading (2%, w/w) and different Pt/Pd atomic ratios (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 1) pointed out the following main conclusions:(1) Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."
[2] "Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work."
[3] "Pt inhibiting effect on palladium re-oxidation also affects reactivation dynamics, which is progressively slower the higher is the Pt/Pd ratio."
[4] "The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples."
[5] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, have a profound influence on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts enhance the catalytic activity through their ability to promote the thermal decomposition and chemical reduction of PdO. The presence of Pt not only accelerates the reduction of PdO by CH4 but also inhibits the oxidation of metallic Pd, which is completely halted in the Pt/Pd-1 sample. This inhibitory effect of Pt on PdO formation leads to a slower reactivation dynamics, as the higher the Pt/Pd ratio, the slower the reactivation process becomes. Moreover, the relationship between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity is observed in monometallic catalysts but does not apply to bimetallic samples. The overall effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward, depending on various factors such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pd-support interactions, and the stabilization of metallic Pd.

这些双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换机制及效率产生了深远影响。这些催化剂通过促进PdO的热分解和化学还原来增强催化活性。Pt不仅加速了PdO由CH4还原，而且抑制了金属Pd的氧化，Pt/Pd-1样品中的氧化完全停止。Pt对PdO形成的抑制作用导致了重新激活动态的减慢，随着Pt/Pd比例的增加，重新激活过程变得更加缓慢。此外，PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的关系在单金属催化剂中被观察到，但在双金属样品中并不适用。总体而言，Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响并不直接，这取决于各种因素，如PdO形成的程度、Pd支持相互作用的强度以及金属Pd的稳定化。
