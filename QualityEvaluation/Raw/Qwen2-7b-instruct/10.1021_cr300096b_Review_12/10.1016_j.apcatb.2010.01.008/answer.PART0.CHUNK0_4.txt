<p>The addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample.</p>
<p>Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work.</p>
<p>PT inhibiting effect on palladium re-oxidation also affects reactivation dynamics, which is progressively slower the higher is the Pt/Pd ratio. This may have negative practical consequences when periodical reduction would be applied for catalyst regeneration.</p>
<p>The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples. Such lack of correlation is possibly due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective onto the metallic surface which prevails in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and poor onto the passivated surface which occur in the presence of excess of oxygen (lean combustion).</p>
<p>As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity.</p>

1. Adding Pt enhances the breakdown and reduction of PdO. The higher the Pt/Pd ratio, the more the oxidation of metallic Pd is inhibited, leading to no oxidation for the Pt/Pd-1 sample.
2. Repeating reduction and oxidation cycles boosts the catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples, reaching the highest levels among the tested catalysts during conditioning.
3. The effect of Pt on the re-oxidation of palladium slows down the reactivation process, making it progressively slower with an increase in the Pt/Pd ratio. This could have negative implications for periodic catalyst regeneration.
4. The relationship between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity seen in monometallic catalysts doesn't apply to bimetallic samples. This discrepancy might be due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective on the metallic surface in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and ineffective on the passivated surface in the presence of excess oxygen (lean combustion).
5. The impact of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not clear-cut. The outcome depends on various factors, including the extent of PdO formation, the strength of metal-support interactions, and the stabilization of metallic Pd. Pt can either inhibit or enhance catalytic activity based on these factors.

1. 添加Pt可以促进PdO的热分解和化学还原。Pt/Pd比率越高，金属Pd的氧化越受抑制，Pt/Pd-1样品中不存在氧化。
2. 反复进行还原和氧化循环可以提高Pt/Pd-0和Pt/Pd-0.10催化剂的催化活性，在条件处理过程中达到最高水平。
3. Pt对钯的再氧化作用降低了再活化动力学，随着Pt/Pd比率的增加，再活化过程逐渐变慢。这可能对周期性催化剂再生产生负面影响。
4. 在单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO还原性与CH4燃烧活性之间的相关性不适用于双金属样本。这种差异可能是由于Pt激活CH4的能力不同，它在缺乏氧气的情况下（CH4-TPR）在金属表面有效，在过剩氧气的情况下（稀燃条件下），在钝化表面上效果不佳。
5. Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响并不明确。结果取决于多种因素，包括PdO形成的程度、金属-支持相互作用的强度以及金属Pd的稳定化。Pt可以根据这些因素是抑制或增强催化活性。
