[1] "The results obtained in this work on CH4 combustion activity and reduction/re-oxidation behavior of bimetallic Pd-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with constant Pd loading (2%, w/w) and different Pt/Pd atomic ratios (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 1) pointed out the following main conclusions:(1) Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."
[2] "Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work."
[3] "The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples. Such lack of correlation is possibly due to the different abilities of Pt to activate CH4, which is effective onto the metallic surface which prevails in the absence of oxygen (CH4-TPR) and poor onto the passivated surface which occur in the presence of excess of oxygen (lean combustion)."
[4] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

1. The addition of Pt to bimetallic catalysts enhances the thermal decomposition and chemical reduction of PdO, while oxidation of metallic Pd is inhibited, especially in samples with a Pt/Pd ratio of 1. 
2. Repeated reduction/re-oxidation cycles significantly boost the catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 catalysts, achieving the highest activity levels among the tested catalysts.
3. The correlation between PdO reducibility and CH4 combustion activity, which is observed in monometallic catalysts, does not hold for bimetallic catalysts due to the contrasting abilities of Pt to activate CH4 in the presence and absence of oxygen.
4. The effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is complex, influenced by factors such as PdO formation extent, Pd-support interaction strength, and metallic Pd stabilization. Pt can act as either an inhibitor or promoter of catalytic activity depending on these conditions.

1. 添加Pt到双金属催化剂中，促进了PdO的热分解和化学还原，同时增加了Pd的氧化抑制，特别是在Pt/Pd比例为1的样品中。
2. 反复的还原/氧化循环显著提高了Pt/Pd-0和Pt/Pd-0.10催化剂的催化活性，达到测试催化剂中的最高水平。
3. 在单金属催化剂中观察到的PdO可还原性与甲烷燃烧活性之间的相关性，在双金属催化剂中并不适用，这是由于在有氧和无氧条件下，Pt激活甲烷的能力不同所致。
4. Pt对PdO CH4燃烧活性的影响复杂，受到PdO形成程度、Pd支持相互作用强度和金属Pd稳定性的影响。根据这些条件，Pt可以作为催化活性的抑制剂或促进剂。
