The preferential CO oxidation over Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is greatly influenced by the composition of the metal core and shell, which is essential for understanding their reactivity in chemical transformations such as water gas shift reaction and methane conversions. Future UHV studies could offer more profound insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite existing constraints.
