1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on platinum (Pt), have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts show distinct reactivity patterns compared to monometallic catalysts. Future studies utilizing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques may provide crucial insights into the surface chemistry of Pt-based bimetallic systems, correlating surface properties with catalytic activity. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder a comprehensive understanding of these correlations.
