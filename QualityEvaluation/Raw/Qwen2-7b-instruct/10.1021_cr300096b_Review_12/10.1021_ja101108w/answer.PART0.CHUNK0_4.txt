The scientific literature discusses how bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum, impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, the water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The use of core-shell nanoparticles provides insights into the reactivity patterns of these processes. Future UHV studies seek to bridge the gap between theoretical model surfaces and practical applications, aiming to correlate findings from model systems with real-world catalysts despite existing limitations.
