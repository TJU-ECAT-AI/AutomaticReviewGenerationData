Radiative forcings and global warming potentials for 39 greenhouse gases were evaluated using narrowband and broadband radiative transfer models. The calculations were performed on a 5 latitude grid from 82.5S to 82.5N, and the vertical profiles of the gases were found to be crucial in determining the radiative forcings. Neglecting the seasonal and latitudinal distributions of greenhouse gases and atmospheres led to smaller errors than those caused by using height-independent vertical distributions. The total radiative forcing due to increased major greenhouse gas concentrations from 1765 to 1992 was 2.32 Wm2, which is 2% higher than other recent estimates.

评估了39种温室气体的辐射强迫和全球变暖潜力，使用窄带和宽带辐射传输模型。计算是在从82.5S到82.5N的5纬度网格上进行的，气体的垂直分布被发现对于确定辐射强迫至关重要。忽略温室气体和大气的季节性和纬度分布导致的误差小于使用高度不变的垂直分布所导致的误差。从1765年到1992年，主要温室气体浓度增加导致的总辐射强迫为2.32 Wm2，比其他最近的估计高2%。
