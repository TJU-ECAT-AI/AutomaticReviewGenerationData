[1] "Unlike many previous studies, latitudinal and seasonal variations are considered explicitly, using distributions of major greenhouse gases from a combination of chemical-transport model results and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measurements and cloud statistics from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project."
[2] "The gases examined include CO2, CH4, N2O, plus a number of chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, bromocarbons, iodocarbons, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)."
[3] "Our total radiative forcing due to increase in major greenhouse gas concentrations for the period 17651992 is 2.32 Wm2, only 2% higher than other recent estimates."

Radiative forcings and global warming potentials for 39 greenhouse gases were evaluated using narrowband and broadband radiative transfer models, taking into account explicit latitudinal and seasonal variations. The gases considered included CO2, CH4, N2O, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, bromocarbons, iodocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The total radiative forcing due to increased major greenhouse gas concentrations over the period 1765-1992 was 2.32 Wm2, which is only 2% higher than other recent estimates.

对39种温室气体的辐射强迫和全球增温潜力进行了评估，使用了窄带和宽带辐射传输模型，并考虑了纬度和季节的明确变化。考虑的气体包括CO2、CH4、N2O、氯氟碳化合物、氢氯氟碳化合物、氢氟碳化合物、氢氯碳化合物、溴碳化合物、碘碳化合物和全氟碳化合物。1765年至1992年间主要温室气体浓度增加导致的总辐射强迫为2.32 Wm2，这比其他最近的估计高出仅2%。
