[1] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."
[2] "Specifically, the effect of tin oxidation on the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on an α-Al2O3 supported, PtSn catalyst has been studied by Grass and Lintz [29]."
[3] "In that work, oxygen desorption below 850 K was associated with reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species."
[4] "This condition also produces a (4 × 4) LEED pattern."
[5] "Oxygen associated with Sn sites after more extensive oxidation reactions corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, offer enhanced resistance to coking and improved selectivity towards aromatic compounds compared to pure Pt catalysts. 

2. The kinetic behavior of CO oxidation by O2 on a supported PtSn catalyst has been analyzed by Grass and Lintz, focusing specifically on the impact of tin oxidation.

3. The oxygen desorption process below 850 K in certain conditions is linked to the reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species.

4. The formation of a (4 × 4) LEED pattern signifies the presence of an ordered surface film composed of SnO1.5 species.

5. Oxygen associated with Sn sites post extensive oxidation reactions results in the formation of SnO1.5 species, confirming the absence of a fully oxidized SnO2 layer.

1. PtSn双金属催化剂相较于单纯的Pt催化剂，具有更强的抗结焦能力以及更高的芳烃选择性。

2. 草与林兹对在支持型PtSn催化剂上CO氧化由O2引发的反应动力学行为进行了具体研究，特别关注了锡氧化的影响。

3. 在特定条件下，氧脱附过程低于850K与氧化的Pt物种的还原有关，而非SnOx物种。

4. 形成（4×4）LEED图案表示存在一个由SnO1.5物种组成的有序表面薄膜。

5. 在充分氧化后，与Sn位点关联的氧形成了SnO1.5物种，证实了无法迅速形成完全氧化的SnO2层。
