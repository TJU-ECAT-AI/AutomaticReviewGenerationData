1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, have improved resistance to coking and enhanced selectivity for aromatic compounds. Surface science model studies have explored the impact of tin alloying with platinum on hydrocarbon surface chemistry. Grass and Lintz conducted research on how tin oxidation affects the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on a supported PtSn catalyst, specifically on an α-Al2O3 substrate. 

2. The study on NO2 adsorption on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy revealed that the maximum oxygen coverage after heating the N2O4 monolayer to 900 K was 0.2 ML, associated with oxidized Sn species. By applying NO2 at 600 K on the alloy surface, the oxygen coverage can be increased to 1.1 ML, surpassing the limitation imposed by coadsorbed NO.

3. The 1077-K peak in the O2 desorption spectra is attributed to the desorption of O2 from the reduction of SnOSn species, while the peak at 910 K signifies the desorption of O2 from the reduction of SnOPt species.

4. When NO2 is exposed to the surface at 600 K, it allows for the initial acquisition of an oxygen coverage of 1.1 ML. This condition enables the removal of inhibition by coadsorbed NO and facilitates the subsequent heating process to reach a desired oxygen coverage.

5. The observations of NO2 decomposition leading to the release of surface oxygen and the oxidation of Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures are in agreement with the expectation of a higher SnO bond strength compared to PtO2 and Pt3O4. The Sn1.5O species that forms upon oxidation corresponds to the stoichiometry of SnO.

1. Pt基双金属催化剂具有更好的焦炭抵抗能力和更高的芳烃选择性。表面科学模型研究探讨了锡与铂合金化对烃表面化学的影响。Grass和Lintz研究了锡氧化如何影响在α-Al2O3支持下的PtSn催化剂上由O2进行CO氧化的反应动力学，特别是针对该催化剂的表面。

2. 在对(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的N2O4单层加热至900 K后，获得的最大氧覆盖度为0.2 ML，与氧化的Sn物种相关联。通过在600 K时在合金表面上应用NO2，可以获得初始的1.1 ML氧覆盖度，这超过了由共吸附NO施加的限制。

3. 1077-K峰中的O2脱附谱是SnOSn物种还原导致的O2脱附的标志，而910 K的峰则表示从SnOPt物种还原中释放出O2。

4. 当在600 K时将NO2暴露于表面时，可以实现初始的1.1 ML氧覆盖度。这种条件允许去除由共吸附NO引起的抑制，并促进后续加热过程以达到所需的氧覆盖度。

5. 观察到NO2分解导致表面氧的释放和Sn在3合金中的氧化，与预期的SnO键强高于PtO2和Pt3O4相符。氧化后的Sn1.5O物种对应于SnO的化学式。
