The study investigates the synergetic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation. It is revealed that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies might provide insights into relating these findings to model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite the current constraints in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.
