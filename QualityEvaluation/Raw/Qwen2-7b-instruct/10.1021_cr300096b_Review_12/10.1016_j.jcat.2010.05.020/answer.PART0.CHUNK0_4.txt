Characterization of alumina-supported Pt, Ni and PtNi alloy catalysts for the dry reforming of methane.

The activity of the catalysts has been described in detail in [28]. The CO2 and CH4 conversion values obtained with the catalyst at 650 C and at 700 C are presented in Table 2. The CO2 conversion values are higher than those of methane, due to the presence of side reactions, such as the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction. In agreement with this, the H2/CO ratio values reached with all of the catalysts are similar, between 0.64 and 0.68 ( Table 2 ). The activity of the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst does not present significant modifications with respect to the monometallic Ni catalyst. The conversion of both methane and CO2 is maximum for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.

Table 2. Catalytic activity data.

Catalyst XCO2
(%) XCH4
(%) H2/CO XCO2 loss (% h1) 4Ni/Al2O3 50 70 0.66 0.66 1.4
0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 52 70 0.65 0.64 0.4
0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 59 76 0.65 0.66 0.3
0.4Pt/Al2O3 54 76 0.64 0.68 0.3

In Table 2, the CO2 conversion loss expressed as conversion loss per hour of time-on-stream (% h1) over the catalysts under study working at 700 C are also shown, as a rough measure of deactivation kinetics. It is evident that the deactivation rate decreases strongly by the addition of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Indeed, the Pt-containing catalysts supported on the fibrous alumina are rather stable for the DRM. This is in agreement with literature data showing that on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, carbon is removed by oxidation by CO2, ensuring a longer accessibility to active Pt sites.

In the case of spent Ni-containing catalysts, an additional XRD peak is observed, which can be confidently assigned to graphitic carbon. In fact, it is well known that Ni-based catalysts tend to form carbonaceous materials under steam-reforming conditions, producing carbon whiskers or nanotubes, as well as, possibly, other forms of carbonaceous materials. It is evident from the XRD pattern that the amount of graphitic carbon strongly decreases by adding Pt to Ni on the catalyst, in agreement with the carbon content in the catalysts after reaction obtained by elemental analysis.

The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature, are shown in Fig. 3, left. At the highest CO coverage (140 C), a main band is observed at 2069 cm1 with a broad weaker band centered at 1794 cm1. The positions and relative intensities of these bands are typical for CO adsorption on Pt metal particles, where terminal carbonyls (absorbing at 20502100 cm1) usually largely predominate over bridging ones (absorbing at lower frequencies).

The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, at room temperature, are presented in Fig. 3, right. In contact with the gas, the largely predominant band is centered at 2064 cm1, still in the region of terminal carbonyls, while the band of bridging species is observed at 1815 cm1. The latter disappears faster than the former during outgassing upon heating, in agreement with the lower stability of bridging carbonyls on most Pt single crystal faces (such as Pt{1 1 1} and Pt{1 1 0}), as well as on its steps.

In the spectra recorded at room temperature (Fig. 6, right) confirm the existence of terminal carbonyls over a Pt{1 0 0}-like surface, whose νCO is shifting from 2071 down to 2025 cm1, and weak and labile bridging species whose νCO is centered at 1920 cm1.

The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature, are presented in Fig. 4, left. In the typical region of carbonyls interacting with metal cations, two well-resolved bands were detected at 2184 and 2167 cm1. These bands appear to be more resistant to outgassing and a little stronger than those observed in the same region on 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Interestingly, the lower frequency one resists more than the higher frequency one to outgassing, shifting also upwards to 2173 cm1, which is anomalous for CO interacting with σ-bonds to cationic centers. This suggests that, in the case of the species responsible for the lower frequency band, some additional π-type back-bonding should occur.

In the spectra recorded at room temperature (Fig. 6, right), besides these species, other more labile ones can be found, in particular at 2185, 2166, 2037 and 2010 cm1. The assignment of the band at 2185 cm1 to Al3+CO carbonyls, and of the bands at 2037 and 2010 cm1 to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3 species, seems straightforward, in agreement to the earlier discussion. The higher frequency component of the triplet is superimposed to the main band. Based on its frequency, the assignment of the band at 2166 cm1, to either H-bonded CO species or to Pt2+CO species is likely.

Interestingly, we do not find here the features associated with carbonyl species on unreduced Ni, like Ni2+CO and Ni+(CO)2, found in the case of 4Ni/Al2O3 and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. This suggests that, in this case, due to the relevant amount of Pt present, nickel is more easily reduced. 

The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, have been shown to improve the efficiency of CO oxidation, the water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. By adding Pt to Ni-based catalysts, the deactivation rate decreases, and the stability of the catalysts is enhanced. This is due to the ability of Pt to remove carbon by oxidation by CO2, thus maintaining a longer accessibility to active Pt sites. The Pt-rich surface leads to a lower tendency to form carbonaceous materials, increasing the stability of the catalysts. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering insights into the mechanisms involved in these reactions. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder the direct observation of these mechanisms.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中提高了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的效率。通过向镍基催化剂中添加铂，催化剂的失活速率降低，稳定性增强。这是由于铂能够通过CO2氧化去除碳，从而保持活性铂位点的长期可访问性。铂丰富的表面导致形成碳质材料的倾向降低，增加了催化剂的稳定性。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的关联，为这些反应机制提供见解。然而，当前UHV研究中对铂基双金属表面的限制可能阻碍直接观察这些机制。
