          [1] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."
          [2] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results."
          [3] "The application of the Vegards rule to the data arising from XRD for spent catalyst suggest that the real composition of the solid solution (in terms of Ni to Pt ratio) is similar to that of the virtual composition of the catalyst."
          [4] "The data suggest that the alloy is enriched at the surface by Pt but has also a definitely smaller crystal size than the metal particles on pure Pt and Ni catalyst, and this may be the main reason of higher νCO for terminal carbonyls."
          [5] "As for the bimetallic catalysts, it is evident that at least for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, a fcc solid solution certainly forms, as previously found for silica-supported PtNi catalysts."
          [6] "The application of the Vegards rule to the data arising from XRD for spent catalyst suggest that the real composition of the solid solution (in terms of Ni to Pt ratio) is similar to that of the virtual composition of the catalyst."
          [7] "The data suggest that the alloy is enriched at the surface by Pt but has also a definitely smaller crystal size than the metal particles on pure Pt and Ni catalyst, and this may be the main reason of higher νCO for terminal carbonyls."
          [8] "In agreement with very recent results reported by Mukainakano et al. [67] , in spite of the larger concentration on nickel, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be due to Pt-rich metal surfaces together with mostly dispersed and easily oxidized Ni centers."

          The addition of platinum to bimetallic catalysts results in smaller metal particles, enhancing the electron-withdrawing capability of Pt centers. This modification affects Ni's chemical behavior, increasing its reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data. The Vegards rule applied to XRD data on spent catalysts indicates a similar composition of the solid solution to the catalyst's virtual composition. The alloy exhibits a surface enrichment with Pt, featuring a smaller crystal size than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, which might explain the higher νCO for terminal carbonyls. A fcc solid solution is confirmed for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, consistent with previous silica-supported PtNi catalyst studies. The surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts is characterized by Pt-rich metal surfaces with dispersed, easily oxidized Ni centers, as reported by Mukainakano et al.

          向双金属催化剂中添加铂会导致形成更小的金属颗粒，显著提高铂中心的电子吸电子能力。这改变了镍的化学行为，通过XPS和程序升温还原结果证实，提高了镍的可还原性。应用Vegards规则对耗尽催化剂的XRD数据进行分析，表明固体溶液的真实组成与催化剂的虚拟组成相似。合金表面富集有铂，其晶粒尺寸明显小于纯铂和镍催化剂中的颗粒，这可能是导致终端羰基νCO值较高的主要原因。对于0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3样品，确认形成fcc固溶体，与先前的二氧化硅支持的PtNi催化剂研究一致。Mukainakano等人的最新研究表明，双金属NiPt/Al2O3催化剂的表面主要由富含铂的金属表面以及分散且易于氧化的镍中心组成。

          [1] "The activity of the catalysts has been described in detail in [28] ."
          [2] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content."
          [3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion."
          [4] "The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs."
          [5] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results."

          The detailed activity of the catalysts is documented in reference [28]. The data indicate that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits greater activity than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, despite having less metal content. There is evidence of a synergistic effect between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, enhancing the direct methane reforming (DMR) activity. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst undergoes significant oxidation not only after mild reduction treatment but also during dry reforming of methane catalytic processes. The presence of particles alters the chemical properties of Ni, increasing its reducibility as revealed by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction data.

          催化剂的详细活性记录在参考文献[28]中。数据显示，单金属0.4Pt/Al2O3催化剂在干甲烷重整过程中的活性高于4Ni/Al2O3催化剂，尽管其金属含量较少。在氧化铝载体上，Ni和Pt之间存在协同效应，提高了直接甲烷重整（DMR）的活性。Ni/Al2O3催化剂不仅在轻微还原处理后，而且在干甲烷重整催化运行过程中也经历了显著氧化。这些颗粒的存在改变了Ni的化学性质，通过XPS和程序升温还原结果揭示了其可还原性的增加。
