[1] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."
[2] "It has also been confirmed the formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts."
[3] "The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs."
[4] "As expected, our Pt/Al2O3 catalyst appears to be fully reduced both after reaction and after hydrogen treatment in the cell, producing small but well-characterized nanocrystals whose surface appears to be formed by both Pt{1 0 0}-like and Pt{1 1 1}-like faces."
[5] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results."

1. The addition of platinum to bimetallic catalysts leads to the formation of smaller metal particles, increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the Pt centers. This contributes to enhanced catalytic efficiency for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies.

2. The PtNi alloy formed in these catalysts is surface-enriched with Pt, having a smaller metal crystal size compared to pure Pt or Ni particles. This structure facilitates more effective CO oxidation and methane conversions.

3. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows significant oxidation not only after mild reduction but also during the dry reforming of methane, suggesting dynamic redox cycling of catalyst components.

4. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, after reaction and hydrogen treatment, forms small, well-characterized nanocrystals with a surface enriched in both Pt{1 0 0}-like and Pt{1 1 1}-like faces. This structure improves catalytic activity for CO oxidation and methane conversions.

5. The incorporation of Pt enhances the reducibility of Ni, contributing to the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert CO and methane. This is substantiated by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction results.

1. 添加铂到双金属催化剂中导致形成更小的金属颗粒，提高了铂中心的电子吸电子能力。这有助于增强反应器研究中的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的催化效率。

2. 形成的PtNi合金在表面富集了铂，具有比纯铂或镍粒子更小的金属晶粒尺寸。这种结构有助于更有效地进行CO氧化和甲烷转化。

3. Ni/Al2O3催化剂在轻微还原处理后以及干法重整甲烷过程中显示出显著氧化，表明催化剂成分存在动态氧化还原循环。

4. 经过反应和氢处理后，Pt/Al2O3催化剂形成了小而特征明显的纳米晶体，其表面同时富含Pt{1 0 0}-样和Pt{1 1 1}-样面。这种结构提高了CO氧化和甲烷转化的催化活性。

5. 铂的加入增强了Ni的可还原性，从而促进了催化剂对CO和甲烷的有效转换。这得到了XPS和程序升温还原结果的支持。
