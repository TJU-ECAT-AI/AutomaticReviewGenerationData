[1] "The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs. XPS data show Ni aluminate, whose formation implies a slow reaction at high temperature with the support, as the predominant Ni species."
[2] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results."
[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion."
[4] "The most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28] ) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."
[5] "As for the bimetallic catalysts, it is evident that at least for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, a fcc solid solution certainly forms, as previously found for silica-supported PtNi catalysts [31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] ."
[6] "The application of the Vegards rule to the data arising from XRD for spent catalyst suggest that the real composition of the solid solution (in terms of Ni to Pt ratio) is similar to that of the virtual composition of the catalyst."
[7] "The data suggest that the alloy is enriched at the surface by Pt but has also a definitely smaller crystal size than the metal particles on pure Pt and Ni catalyst, and this may be the main reason of higher νCO for terminal carbonyls."
[8] "In agreement with very recent results reported by Mukainakano et al. [67] , in spite of the larger concentration on nickel, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be due to Pt-rich metal surfaces together with mostly dispersed and easily oxidized Ni centers."

1. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows significant oxidation even after mild treatment and dry reforming, with Ni aluminate being the predominant species, indicating a slow reaction with the support.

2. The chemical behavior of Ni is modified, increasing its reducibility as evidenced by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction results.

3. There is a synergy between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, enhancing the direct methane reforming (DMR) activity.

4. Adding small amounts of Pt notably reduces catalyst deactivation by decreasing carbon nanotube formation.

5. For the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, a fcc solid solution is confirmed, similar to previous silica-supported PtNi catalyst studies.

6. The solid solution's composition, in terms of Ni to Pt ratio, aligns with the catalyst's theoretical composition, as suggested by XRD data.

7. The alloy surface is enriched in Pt, with smaller crystal sizes than in pure Pt and Ni catalysts, contributing to higher νCO for terminal carbonyls.

8. Despite the higher nickel concentration, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts is characterized by Pt-rich metal surfaces with dispersed, easily oxidized Ni centers, according to recent studies by Mukainakano et al.

1. Ni/Al2O3催化剂在轻微处理和干重整催化运行后显示显著氧化，主要物种为Ni铝酸盐，表明与支持物的缓慢反应。

2. 镍的化学性质被修改，其可还原性通过XPS和程序升温还原结果得到增强。

3. 在氧化铝载体上，镍和铂之间存在协同作用，提高了直接甲烷重整（DMR）的活性。

4. 添加少量铂显着减少了催化剂的降解，通过减少碳纳米管的形成。

5. 对于0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3样本，形成fcc固溶体，类似于先前的二氧化硅支持的PtNi催化剂研究。

6. 固溶体的组成，在镍到铂的比例方面，与催化剂的理论组成一致，根据XRD数据提出。

7. 合金表面富含铂，与纯铂和镍催化剂相比具有更小的晶体尺寸，这可能是导致终端羰基νCO更高的主要原因。

8. 尽管镍浓度较高，但是双金属NiPt/Al2O3催化剂的表面由富含铂的金属表面以及分散且容易氧化的镍中心构成，根据Mukainakano等人的最新研究。
