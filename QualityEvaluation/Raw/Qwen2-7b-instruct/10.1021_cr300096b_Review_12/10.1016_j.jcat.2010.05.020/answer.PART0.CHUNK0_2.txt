[1] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."
[2] "It is evident that the surface of the PtNi catalysts is dominated by Pt centers, whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by Ni."
[3] "The application of the Vegards rule to the data arising from XRD for spent catalyst suggest that the real composition of the solid solution (in terms of Ni to Pt ratio) is similar to that of the virtual composition of the catalyst."
[4] "The data suggest that the alloy is enriched at the surface by Pt but has also a definitely smaller crystal size than the metal particles on pure Pt and Ni catalyst, and this may be the main reason of higher νCO for terminal carbonyls."
[5] "In agreement with very recent results reported by Mukainakano et al., in spite of the larger concentration on nickel, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be due to Pt-rich metal surfaces together with mostly dispersed and easily oxidized Ni centers."

The bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit enhanced efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions compared to monometallic catalysts. The introduction of platinum leads to the formation of smaller metal particles, increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the Pt centers. This results in a surface dominated by Pt centers, whose electron-withdrawing character is enhanced by the presence of nickel. The formation of a PtNi alloy on the surface of these catalysts is enriched with Pt, and the crystal size is significantly smaller than those of pure Pt and Ni catalysts. This contributes to a higher νCO for terminal carbonyls. Moreover, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts is predominantly Pt-rich, alongside easily oxidized Ni centers, which is in accordance with recent findings by Mukainakano et al.

铂基双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面的效率相较于单一金属催化剂有所提升。铂的引入导致形成更小的金属颗粒，增强了铂中心的电子吸电子能力。这使得催化剂表面主要由铂中心占据，其吸电子性质因镍的存在而增强。合金表面富集有铂，并且晶粒尺寸显著小于纯铂和镍催化剂。这导致终端羰基的νCO值较高。此外，根据Mukainakano等人最近的研究结果，NiPt/Al2O3双金属催化剂的表面主要为富含铂的区域，伴随着易于氧化的镍中心。
