[2] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content."
[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion."
[4] "The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs."

1. The detailed description of the catalyst's activity can be found in reference [28].
2. The 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits greater activity than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, despite having a lower metal content.
3. There is a synergy between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier that enhances the direct methane reforming (DMR) efficiency.
4. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst undergoes oxidation not only after mild reduction but also after catalytic runs in the dry reforming of methane.
5. The Pt particles modify the chemical properties of Ni, increasing its reducibility as indicated by XPS and Temperature-Programmed Reduction results.
