[1] "The preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over PtNi/γ-Al2O3."
[2] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."
[3] "The PROX activity was affected by the reductive pretreatment condition."
[4] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."
[5] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."
[6] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, play a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The study over PtNi/γ-Al2O3 revealed that a co-impregnated PtNi catalyst outperformed those prepared by sequential impregnation of Pt and Ni separately. The catalytic activity was influenced by the reductive pretreatment conditions, and increasing the reduction temperature led to a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the Ni content within the PtNi bimetallic phase. These catalysts demonstrated high CO conversion capacity even under challenging conditions, such as the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 across a broad range of temperatures, suggesting their robustness in practical applications. The bimetallic structure appears to contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance for PROX in hydrogen-rich streams.

在反应器研究中，特别是Pt基双金属催化剂，在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面发挥着重要作用。对PtNi/γ-Al2O3的研究显示，共浸渍的PtNi催化剂优于通过分步浸渍Pt和Ni各自成分到氧化铝载体上的催化剂。催化活性受到还原预处理条件的影响，提高还原温度导致CO2选择性下降，并增加了PtNi二元合金相中的Ni含量。这些催化剂即使在存在2%H2O和20%CO2的复杂条件下也能表现出高的CO转化能力，这表明它们在实际应用中的稳定性。二元结构似乎为氢富集流体中的PROX提供了增强的催化性能。
