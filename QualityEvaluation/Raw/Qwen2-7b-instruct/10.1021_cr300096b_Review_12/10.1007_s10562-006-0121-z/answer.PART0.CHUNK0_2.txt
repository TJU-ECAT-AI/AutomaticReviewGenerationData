[1] "The preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over PtNi/γ-Al2O3."
[2] "CO chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction were conducted to characterize active catalysts."
[3] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."
[4] "The PROX activity was affected by the reductive pretreatment condition."
[5] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."
[6] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."
[7] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

The bimetallic catalyst, specifically the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through its unique structure and properties. The co-impregnation of Pt and Ni on γ-Al2O3 provides an active surface for CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen. The reductive pretreatment condition significantly affects the PROX activity, with an optimal condition leading to high CO conversion even under challenging conditions with 2% H2O and 20% CO2. The increase in reduction temperature above 423 K results in a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic phase, which contributes to the high catalytic activity in hydrogen-rich streams. Future UHV studies may provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces pose challenges.

铂镍双金属催化剂，特别是铂镍/γ-氧化铝催化剂，在反应器研究中通过其独特的结构和性质，影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的机制和效率。铂和镍在γ-氧化铝上的共浸渍提供了氢过量存在下的活性表面，用于CO氧化。预还原处理条件对PROX活性有显著影响，最佳条件可导致高CO转化率，即使在含有2%H2O和20%CO2的条件下。提高还原温度至423K以上会导致CO2选择性降低，并增加铂镍二元相中的镍原子百分比，这有助于在氢富集流体中产生高催化活性。未来UHV研究可能为将这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂相关联提供有价值的见解，尽管当前UHV研究中Pt基双金属表面的限制带来了挑战。
