[1] "The preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over PtNi/γ-Al2O3."
[2] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."
[3] "The PROX activity was affected by the reductive pretreatment condition."
[4] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."
[5] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."
[6] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They offer enhanced catalytic activity compared to their single-metal counterparts. The PROX activity is sensitive to the reductive pretreatment conditions. Higher reduction temperatures lead to a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the atomic percentage of Ni in the PtNi bimetallic phase, which contributes to high CO conversion even under humid conditions with CO2. These findings suggest that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are promising for efficient catalytic processes in industrial applications.

这些双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率产生了显著影响。它们在活性上优于单一金属催化剂。选择性催化还原（PROX）的活性受到还原预处理条件的影响。随着还原温度的升高，CO2的选择性降低，PtNi双金属相中的Ni原子百分比增加，这有助于即使在高湿度条件下含有CO2的情况下也能实现高效的CO转换。这些发现表明，基于Pt的双金属催化剂在工业应用中具有前景。
