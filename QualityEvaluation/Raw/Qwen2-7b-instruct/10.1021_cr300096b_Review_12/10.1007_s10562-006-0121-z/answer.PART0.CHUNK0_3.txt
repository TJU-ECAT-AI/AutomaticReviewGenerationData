The study focuses on the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) process, specifically over PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of excess hydrogen. It highlights that the co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst outperforms its counterparts prepared through sequential impregnation of individual components on an alumina support. The activity of the catalyst is influenced by the reductive pretreatment conditions. As the reduction temperature surpasses 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreases while the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increases. Notably, the catalyst maintains high CO conversion even under the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 across a broad range of reaction temperatures. The bimetallic structure of PtNi is attributed to its enhanced catalytic activity for PROX in hydrogen-rich streams.

研究集中在存在过量氢气的条件下，对CO选择性氧化（PROX）过程的研究，特别是PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂。它强调了共浸渍的PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂在通过逐个成分在氧化铝载体上浸渍制备的同类催化剂中表现出色。催化剂的活性受到还原预处理条件的影响。当还原温度超过423 K时，CO2选择性降低，而PtNi相中的Ni原子百分比增加。值得注意的是，即使在2%的H2O和20%的CO2的环境中，催化剂也能在较宽的反应温度范围内保持高CO转化率。PtNi双金属结构被认为是对富含氢的流体中的PROX具有增强催化活性的原因。
