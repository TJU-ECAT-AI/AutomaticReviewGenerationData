Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, have been shown to significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The co-impregnation of Pt and Ni on γ-Al2O3 support has been found to be superior to separate impregnations of Pt and Ni or Ni and Pt. The reductive pretreatment conditions play a crucial role in determining the PROX activity, with higher temperatures leading to a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi. These catalysts demonstrate high CO conversion even in the presence of water vapor and carbon dioxide, showing their robustness across a wide range of reaction temperatures. The bimetallic structure of PtNi appears to enhance the catalytic activity for the preferential CO oxidation in a hydrogen-rich stream.

The potential insights from future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may hinder such correlations due to the inability to accurately mimic industrial conditions and the complexity of surface interactions at the atomic level. Further research could explore the detailed mechanisms of bimetallic interactions and their effects on catalytic properties under industrially relevant conditions.

在反应器研究中，特别是Pt基双金属催化剂，已被证明能够显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。在γ-Al2O3载体上共浸渍Pt和Ni被发现比单独浸渍Pt和Ni或Ni和Pt更优。还原预处理条件对PROX活性至关重要，随着温度升高，CO2选择性降低，PtNi相中的Ni原子百分比增加。这些催化剂即使在含有2%水蒸气和20%二氧化碳的情况下也能表现出高CO转化率，显示出它们在宽反应温度范围内的鲁棒性。PtNi结构的双金属似乎增强了H2富集流中的选择性CO氧化的催化活性。

未来在超高真空(UHV)研究中可能从这些发现中获得有关模型表面和支持催化剂的见解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究的局限性可能阻碍了此类关联，因为无法准确模拟工业条件以及原子水平上表面相互作用的复杂性。进一步的研究可以探索双金属相互作用的详细机制及其对催化性质的影响，在工业相关条件下。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, play a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The study over PtNi/γ-Al2O3 revealed that a co-impregnated PtNi catalyst outperformed those prepared by sequential impregnation of Pt and Ni separately. The catalytic activity was influenced by the reductive pretreatment conditions, and increasing the reduction temperature led to a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the Ni content within the PtNi bimetallic phase. These catalysts demonstrated high CO conversion capacity even under challenging conditions, such as the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 across a broad range of temperatures, suggesting their robustness in practical applications. The bimetallic structure appears to contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance for PROX in hydrogen-rich streams.

The bimetallic catalyst, specifically the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through its unique structure and properties. The co-impregnation of Pt and Ni on γ-Al2O3 provides an active surface for CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen. The reductive pretreatment condition significantly affects the PROX activity, with an optimal condition leading to high CO conversion even under challenging conditions with 2% H2O and 20% CO2. The increase in reduction temperature above 423 K results in a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic phase, which contributes to the high catalytic activity in hydrogen-rich streams. Future UHV studies may provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces pose challenges.

The study focuses on the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) process, specifically over PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of excess hydrogen. It highlights that the co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst outperforms its counterparts prepared through sequential impregnation of individual components on an alumina support. The activity of the catalyst is influenced by the reductive pretreatment conditions. As the reduction temperature surpasses 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreases while the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increases. Notably, the catalyst maintains high CO conversion even under the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 across a broad range of reaction temperatures. The bimetallic structure of PtNi is attributed to its enhanced catalytic activity for PROX in hydrogen-rich streams.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They offer enhanced catalytic activity compared to their single-metal counterparts. The PROX activity is sensitive to the reductive pretreatment conditions. Higher reduction temperatures lead to a decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in the atomic percentage of Ni in the PtNi bimetallic phase, which contributes to high CO conversion even under humid conditions with CO2. These findings suggest that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are promising for efficient catalytic processes in industrial applications.
