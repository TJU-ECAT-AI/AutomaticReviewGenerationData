Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3.

It was found that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 gradually decreases with time at temperatures well below that of PdO decomposition.

The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.

The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.

The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time.

Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation.

For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time.

The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts.

The difference in aging may be attributed both to changes in the morphology and to the loss of palladium of the monometallic catalyst, which is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst.

The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of methane over palladium (Pd) and bimetallic palladium-platinum (PdPt) catalysts supported on alumina (Al2O3). It highlights that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 decreases with time at temperatures below PdO decomposition, while the activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increases with time. This suggests that bimetallic catalysts show better stability and efficiency in methane conversion compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. The increase in activity for PdPt/Al2O3 is attributed to the formation of more palladium oxide (PdO) during operation. Moreover, the study indicates that both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface of the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, which enables stable methane conversion, unlike the monometallic Pd catalyst where all Pd transforms into PdO over time. Additionally, the document notes that thermal aging affects Pd/Al2O3 more severely than PdPt/Al2O3, suggesting that the presence of platinum in the bimetallic catalyst helps prevent aging of the palladium component.

文档讨论了在氧化铝支持下钯(Pd)和钯-铂(PdPt)双金属催化剂对甲烷的催化氧化。它指出，Pd/Al2O3在低于PdO分解温度的情况下随时间逐渐降低活性，而PdPt/Al2O3的活性随时间增加。这表明，双金属催化剂在甲烷转化方面表现出更好的稳定性和效率与单金属Pd催化剂相比。PdPt/Al2O3活性增加的原因归因于操作过程中形成更多钯氧化物(PdO)。此外，研究指出，在PdPt/Al2O3催化剂的表面上同时存在金属钯(Pd)和PdO，这使得甲烷转化保持稳定，而单金属Pd催化剂中的所有Pd会随着时间转化为PdO。此外，文档还指出，Pd/Al2O3的热老化比PdPt/Al2O3更严重，表明铂的存在有助于防止Pd催化剂的老化。
