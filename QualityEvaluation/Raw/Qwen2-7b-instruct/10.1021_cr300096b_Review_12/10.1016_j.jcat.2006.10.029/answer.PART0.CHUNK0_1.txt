<p>The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3. It was found that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 gradually decreases with time at temperatures well below that of PdO decomposition. The opposite was observed for PdPt/Al2O3, of which the activity decreases slightly with time.</p>
<p>Morphological studies of the two catalysts showed major changes during operation. The palladium particles in Pd/Al2O3 are initially composed of smaller, randomly oriented crystals of both PdO and Pd. In oxidising atmospheres, the crystals become more oxidised and form larger crystals. The activity increase of PdPt/Al2O3 is probably related to more PdO being formed during operation. The particles in PdPt/Al2O3 are split into two different domains: one with PdO and the other likely consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. The alloy is initially rich in palladium, but the composition changes to a more equalmolar PdPt structure during operation. The ejected Pd is oxidised into PdO, which is more active than its metallic phase.</p>
<p>In this work, the combustion behaviour during methane oxidation is correlated to morphologic changes of the catalyst on various treatments. To investigate the reason for the decrease or increase in activity for the monometallic palladium catalyst and the bimetallic PdPt catalyst, respectively, various temperature-programmed oxidation analyses were carried out. The samples were also studied by TEM, EDS, PXRD, and XPS. Furthermore, the thermal aging properties were evaluated for both the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by altering the surface composition and structure of the catalyst. This leads to improved activity and selectivity. The efficiency gains are attributed to the synergistic effects between the two metals, allowing for better adsorption and activation of reactants. Future UHV studies can provide insights into the detailed surface chemistry and reaction pathways, potentially correlating them with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces prevent a complete understanding of the complex interplay between metal interactions and catalytic performance.

In reactor studies, bimetallic catalysts demonstrate superior activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic counterparts. The incorporation of Pt into the bimetallic system enhances the catalytic performance by facilitating the dissociative adsorption of reactants, leading to faster activation and subsequent reactions. The morphological changes observed during operation, such as the formation of larger crystals and the development of a more active structure, contribute to the increased efficiency of bimetallic catalysts. 

Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies can offer valuable insights into the detailed surface chemistry of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. These studies enable the examination of atomic-scale interactions and reaction mechanisms, providing a deeper understanding of how the surface composition and structure influence the catalytic performance. By correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for industrial applications. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as the complexity of simulating realistic reaction environments and the challenge of maintaining surface integrity under extreme conditions, hinder a comprehensive exploration of these systems. 

The potential insights from UHV studies can guide the development of new catalyst designs that exploit the unique properties of bimetallic systems, leading to improved catalyst performance in various chemical transformations. These advancements can significantly impact industries relying on catalytic processes, including petrochemicals, energy production, and environmental remediation. While progress in this field is ongoing, addressing the challenges posed by UHV studies is crucial for unlocking the full potential of bimetallic catalysts in practical applications.
