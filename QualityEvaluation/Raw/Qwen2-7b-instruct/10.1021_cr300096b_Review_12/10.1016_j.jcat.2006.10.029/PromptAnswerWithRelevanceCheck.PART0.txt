Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

Introduction:
Catalytic oxidation of methane under oxygen-rich conditions has received considerable attention. One of the reasons is the increasing interest in lean-burn natural gas vehicles (NGVs). Compared with diesel engines, NGV engines produce less NOx and particulates [1] ,[2] ,[3] . However, a problem with NGV engines is the high level of unburned methane in the exhaust. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, it is important to reduce the amount emitted into the atmosphere. One approach to abating methane emission is the use of catalytic exhaust converters, in which the abatement is achieved by catalytic oxidation.
Another application for catalytic oxidation of methane is in catalytic gas turbine combustors [4] ,[5] . Instead of combusting the fuel homogeneously using a flame, the fuel is combusted over catalysts. In this way, the combustion temperature is considerably reduced, and the formation of thermal NOx is decreased. Natural gas is a frequently used fuel in gas turbines, and the major combustible component in natural gas is methane.
A catalyst that often has been used for these applications is palladium supported on various washcoats [6] ,[7] . Many studies have shown that the activity over fresh palladium catalysts is excellent for methane oxidation under lean conditions. However, it has recently been reported that palladium-supported catalysts have poor stability for methane conversion when the temperature is kept constant [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] . The initially high activity when the catalysts are fresh drops significantly during operation, resulting in increasing difficulty in igniting the methane at desirable temperatures.

Experimental:
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A palladium catalyst and a palladiumplatinum catalyst, both supported on γ-Al2O3 (PURALOX HP-14/150, Sasol Germany GmbH), were investigated in this study. The two catalysts were prepared so as to have equal loadings of noble metals (470 μmol metal/g catalyst powder). The molar ratio between Pd and Pt in the bimetallic catalyst was 2:1. More details on the catalysts are given in Table 1 .
Table 1. A summary of the catalysts and their textural properties Sample Composition Pd loading (wt%) Pt loading (wt%) BET surface area (m2/g) Crystal size a PdO (nm) Crystal size a PdPt (nm) Pd/Al2O3 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 5.1 0 102 26 Pd/Al2O3-aged 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3-aged 4.8 0 84 27 PdPt/Al2O3 2:1 Pd:Pt/Al2O3 3.0 3.3 91 19 34 PdPt/Al2O3-aged 2:1 Pd:Pt/Al2O3-aged 3.0 2.8 71 20 33 a Estimated by TOPASFundamental Parameter Approach.

Results and discussion:
3.1. Catalytic activity
The results from the activity measurements over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , respectively. The black curves display the activity over 12 h with the inlet temperature to the catalyst maintained at 500C. As shown in Fig. 1 , the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst initially had excellent activity with 53% methane conversion, but the activity dropped rapidly with time. After 12 h, the conversion was only 11%.
In the same figure, the gray dotted curve represents the activity of Pd/Al2O3 with the temperature alternated among 500, 550, and 600C. It is clear that the deactivation was enhanced at higher temperatures, because the activity already at the third temperature step was lower than the activity measured when the temperature was maintained at 500C. The conversion at the end of the test was only 4%, whereas that after the same time for the sample maintained at 500C was 14%.

Conclusion:
• The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.
• The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.
• The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation. The palladium-containing particles were composed of polycrystalline domains of both PdO and Pd randomly oriented inside the particles.
• The thermal decomposition of PdO was initiated by creating one or two nuclei of Pd on each PdO crystal. The completely reduced sample consisted of large facetted crystals.

Future UHV studies:
Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide valuable insights into correlating the findings from model surfaces and supported catalysts. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might include difficulties in accurately simulating the complex environments and interactions present in real-world catalytic processes. Future research could focus on developing more advanced UHV techniques capable of probing the detailed surface chemistry and structure of Pt-based bimetallic systems under conditions closely resembling those encountered in practical applications. Such studies would enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing the performance and stability of these catalysts, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and durable catalysts for applications such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial processes.

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit higher efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. They maintain stability and activity over longer periods, especially when subjected to temperature fluctuations.

2. The stability and activity of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are enhanced due to the formation of a stable alloy structure that allows for the coexistence of both metallic Pd and PdO phases. This structure facilitates the dissociative adsorption of methane molecules, which are then efficiently reduced at the Pd-PdO interface.

3. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the detailed surface chemistry and structure of Pt-based bimetallic systems, enabling a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing their performance and stability. These studies would be crucial for optimizing catalyst design for various applications, including CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies by altering the surface composition and structure of the catalyst. This leads to improved activity and selectivity. The efficiency gains are attributed to the synergistic effects between the two metals, allowing for better adsorption and activation of reactants. Future UHV studies can provide insights into the detailed surface chemistry and reaction pathways, potentially correlating them with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces prevent a complete understanding of the complex interplay between metal interactions and catalytic performance.

In reactor studies, bimetallic catalysts demonstrate superior activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic counterparts. The incorporation of Pt into the bimetallic system enhances the catalytic performance by facilitating the dissociative adsorption of reactants, leading to faster activation and subsequent reactions. The morphological changes observed during operation, such as the formation of larger crystals and the development of a more active structure, contribute to the increased efficiency of bimetallic catalysts. 

Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies can offer valuable insights into the detailed surface chemistry of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. These studies enable the examination of atomic-scale interactions and reaction mechanisms, providing a deeper understanding of how the surface composition and structure influence the catalytic performance. By correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for industrial applications. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as the complexity of simulating realistic reaction environments and the challenge of maintaining surface integrity under extreme conditions, hinder a comprehensive exploration of these systems. 

The potential insights from UHV studies can guide the development of new catalyst designs that exploit the unique properties of bimetallic systems, leading to improved catalyst performance in various chemical transformations. These advancements can significantly impact industries relying on catalytic processes, including petrochemicals, energy production, and environmental remediation. While progress in this field is ongoing, addressing the challenges posed by UHV studies is crucial for unlocking the full potential of bimetallic catalysts in practical applications.

Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3.

It was found that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 gradually decreases with time at temperatures well below that of PdO decomposition.

The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.

The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.

The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time.

Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation.

For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time.

The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts.

The difference in aging may be attributed both to changes in the morphology and to the loss of palladium of the monometallic catalyst, which is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst.

The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of methane over palladium (Pd) and bimetallic palladium-platinum (PdPt) catalysts supported on alumina (Al2O3). It highlights that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 decreases with time at temperatures below PdO decomposition, while the activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increases with time. This suggests that bimetallic catalysts show better stability and efficiency in methane conversion compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. The increase in activity for PdPt/Al2O3 is attributed to the formation of more palladium oxide (PdO) during operation. Moreover, the study indicates that both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface of the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, which enables stable methane conversion, unlike the monometallic Pd catalyst where all Pd transforms into PdO over time. Additionally, the document notes that thermal aging affects Pd/Al2O3 more severely than PdPt/Al2O3, suggesting that the presence of platinum in the bimetallic catalyst helps prevent aging of the palladium component.

Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3. It was found that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 gradually decreases with time at temperatures well below that of PdO decomposition. The opposite was observed for PdPt/Al2O3, of which the activity decreases slightly with time. 

Morphological studies of the two catalysts showed major changes during operation. The palladium particles in Pd/Al2O3 are initially composed of smaller, randomly oriented crystals of both PdO and Pd. In oxidising atmospheres, the crystals become more oxidised and form larger crystals. The activity increase of PdPt/Al2O3 is probably related to more PdO being formed during operation. The particles in PdPt/Al2O3 are split into two different domains: one with PdO and the other likely consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. The alloy is initially rich in palladium, but the composition changes to a more equalmolar PdPt structure during operation. The ejected Pd is oxidised into PdO, which is more active than its metallic phase. The amount of PdO formed depends on the oxidation time and temperature.

The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation. The palladium-containing particles were composed of polycrystalline domains of both PdO and Pd randomly oriented inside the particles. Preoxidising the sample at 500 or 600C changed the morphology of the particles into larger crystals and caused the sample to become fully oxidised. The decline in activity may be due to this reconstruction.

The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation. By increasing the oxidation temperature, more PdO was formed and stabilisation occurred more rapidly. However, the oxidation temperature must be below the PdO decomposition temperature for this to occur.

For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time.

The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts. The difference in aging may be attributed both to changes in the morphology and to the loss of palladium of the monometallic catalyst, which is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst.

The catalyst in the present study was calcined at considerably higher temperature than that used in most aging studies, resulting in larger initial sizes of the palladium-containing particles. Due to the larger palladium particles, and thus the larger distance between them, the ability to move in the alumina matrix to obtain growing and sintering was reduced. Nevertheless, the smaller crystals might migrate through the alumina material.

Glin et al. have shown that alumina-supported Pt catalysts are less resistant to thermal aging in steam at 600C than Pd catalysts. The dispersion of Pt on the alumina decreased significantly, resulting in lower activity. In contrast to monometallic Pt catalysts, the alloyed PdPt system showed significant stabilisation against sintering.

Vaporisation of the noble metals also may decrease the activity. According to the literature, Pt is more easily vaporised than Pd, but the combination of the two make the platinum more resistant against vaporisation.

The loss of activity at temperatures above 670C is most likely related to the PdO decomposition, because the TPO experiments showed PdO decomposition in this temperature range. However, the TPO decomposition started already at 625C. The lower decomposition temperature is probably related to the fourfold lower partial pressure of oxygen used in the TPO experiments compared with the activity test.

The values of BET surface areas, crystal sizes, and noble metal loadings of the samples are compiled in Table 1. The drop of surface area with aging may decrease the activity of both catalysts to some extent. But because the drop is in the same range for the two catalysts, the differences in activity loss are most likely not associated with the different surface areas.

As shown in Table 1, the increase in the average crystal size of PdO determined from the PXRD data was similar for the two catalysts as well. Thus, the greater activity loss of Pd/Al2O3 with aging may not be attributed to increasing crystal size, but rather may be an effect of Pd being encapsulated into a surface coating layer of PdO over the metal, preventing good contact with both Pd and PdO surfaces.

The loss in Pt probably will not decrease the activity severely. It is interesting to note that the alloy appeared to stabilise the Pd phase, probably related to the solid solution formation at higher temperatures having the nominal composition value.

Thermal aging achieved a structure similar to that after preoxidation at 500C; that is, the metallic Pd in Pd/Al2O3 oxidised into PdO at the same time as the crystals grew, whereas PdPt/Al2O3 maintained the two-domain structure in which the PdO part became larger and the alloy obtained a structure closer to the nominal composition. Thus, Pd/Al2O3 acquired a less active structure over time, whereas PdPt/Al2O3 achieved a more active structure. However, thermal aging also causes other phenomena that may result in a drop in activity for both catalysts, such as decreased surface area and vaporisation of noble metals.

Conclusions:
• The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.
• The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.
• The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation.
• The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time due to significantly greater PdO production during operation.
• For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface.

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit better activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. This is due to the enhanced PdO formation during operation, which leads to increased activity and stability. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into the correlation between the catalytic performance and the surface chemistry, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies pose challenges in fully understanding the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under realistic reaction conditions.

2. The presence of Pt in bimetallic catalysts, such as PdPt, contributes to the stabilization of Pd against thermal aging. This results in improved long-term stability compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. The alloy structure allows for a more active surface to maintain activity during prolonged operation, making Pt-based bimetallic catalysts more suitable for industrial applications requiring high stability.

3. The bimetallic PdPt catalysts achieve higher methane conversion rates compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. This is attributed to the coexistence of metallic Pd and PdO on the surface, which enhances the catalytic activity for methane oxidation. In contrast, monometallic Pd catalysts experience complete transformation of Pd into PdO over time, leading to a decline in activity.

4. The activity of the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst increases with time due to the formation of more PdO during operation. This leads to a more active structure with higher stability against thermal aging compared to the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The bimetallic structure allows for a more efficient utilization of the noble metals, resulting in improved catalytic performance.

5. The thermal aging of bimetallic PdPt catalysts is less severe than that of monometallic Pd catalysts. This is mainly attributed to changes in the morphology and the loss of palladium in monometallic catalysts, which is not observed in bimetallic catalysts. The Pt component in bimetallic catalysts provides additional resistance against aging, contributing to the overall stability of the catalysts under thermal stress.

1. 含铂双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化中表现出更好的活性，与单金属钯催化剂相比。这主要是由于操作过程中形成的更多PdO促进了活性和稳定性。未来对含铂双金属表面的超高真空研究可以提供关于催化性能与表面化学之间关系的见解，从而推动更高效催化剂的发展。然而，当前的超高真空研究限制使得完全理解含铂双金属表面在实际反应条件下的行为存在挑战。

2. 在双金属催化剂，如PdPt，中添加铂有助于Pd的热老化稳定化，与单金属钯催化剂相比，这导致了更长的稳定性。合金结构允许在长时间运行中保持活性表面，使其更适合需要高稳定性的工业应用。

3. 与单金属钯催化剂相比，双金属PdPt催化剂的甲烷转化率更高。这是由于表面同时存在金属态Pd和PdO，增强了甲烷氧化的催化活性。相比之下，单金属Pd催化剂经历完全转化为PdO的过程，导致活性下降。

4. 随时间增加的PdPt/Al2O3催化剂活性归因于操作过程中形成更多的PdO。这导致了一个更活跃的结构，具有更高的抗热老化稳定性。双金属结构允许更有效地利用贵金属，从而提高催化剂性能。

5. 双金属PdPt催化剂的热老化比单金属Pd催化剂轻微。这主要归因于形态变化和单金属催化剂中的钯损耗，而这种现象在双金属催化剂中未观察到。铂成分在双金属催化剂中提供了额外的抗老化性，从而提高了催化剂的整体稳定性。

6. 提高含铂双金属催化剂在甲烷转化中的稳定性和效率可以通过优化催化剂的组成和结构来实现。未来的研究可以专注于开发先进的合成方法以控制双金属催化剂的形态和组成，旨在改善其在实际应用中的性能和稳定性。
