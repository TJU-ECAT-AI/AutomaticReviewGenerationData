Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

Introduction:
Catalytic oxidation of methane under oxygen-rich conditions has received considerable attention. One of the reasons is the increasing interest in lean-burn natural gas vehicles (NGVs). Compared with diesel engines, NGV engines produce less NOx and particulates [1] ,[2] ,[3] . However, a problem with NGV engines is the high level of unburned methane in the exhaust. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, it is important to reduce the amount emitted into the atmosphere. One approach to abating methane emission is the use of catalytic exhaust converters, in which the abatement is achieved by catalytic oxidation.
Another application for catalytic oxidation of methane is in catalytic gas turbine combustors [4] ,[5] . Instead of combusting the fuel homogeneously using a flame, the fuel is combusted over catalysts. In this way, the combustion temperature is considerably reduced, and the formation of thermal NOx is decreased. Natural gas is a frequently used fuel in gas turbines, and the major combustible component in natural gas is methane.
A catalyst that often has been used for these applications is palladium supported on various washcoats [6] ,[7] . Many studies have shown that the activity over fresh palladium catalysts is excellent for methane oxidation under lean conditions. However, it has recently been reported that palladium-supported catalysts have poor stability for methane conversion when the temperature is kept constant [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] . The initially high activity when the catalysts are fresh drops significantly during operation, resulting in increasing difficulty in igniting the methane at desirable temperatures.

Experimental:
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A palladium catalyst and a palladiumplatinum catalyst, both supported on γ-Al2O3 (PURALOX HP-14/150, Sasol Germany GmbH), were investigated in this study. The two catalysts were prepared so as to have equal loadings of noble metals (470 μmol metal/g catalyst powder). The molar ratio between Pd and Pt in the bimetallic catalyst was 2:1. More details on the catalysts are given in Table 1 .

Results and discussion:
3.1. Catalytic activity
The results from the activity measurements over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , respectively. The black curves display the activity over 12 h with the inlet temperature to the catalyst maintained at 500C. As shown in Fig. 1 , the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst initially had excellent activity with 53% methane conversion, but the activity dropped rapidly with time. After 12 h, the conversion was only 11%.
In the same figure, the gray dotted curve represents the activity of Pd/Al2O3 with the temperature alternated among 500, 550, and 600C. It is clear that the deactivation was enhanced at higher temperatures, because the activity already at the third temperature step was lower than the activity measured when the temperature was maintained at 500C. The conversion at the end of the test was only 4%, whereas that after the same time for the sample maintained at 500C was 14%.

Conclusion:
• The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.
• The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.
• The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation. The palladium-containing particles were composed of polycrystalline domains of both PdO and Pd randomly oriented inside the particles.
• The thermal decomposition of PdO was initiated by creating one or two nuclei of Pd on each PdO crystal. The completely reduced sample consisted of large facetted crystals.

Future UHV studies:
Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide valuable insights into correlating the findings from model surfaces and supported catalysts. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might include difficulties in accurately simulating the complex environments and interactions present in real-world catalytic processes. Future research could focus on developing more advanced UHV techniques capable of probing the detailed surface chemistry and structure of Pt-based bimetallic systems under conditions closely resembling those encountered in practical applications. Such studies would enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing the performance and stability of these catalysts, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and durable catalysts for applications such as CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in industrial processes.

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit higher efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. They maintain stability and activity over longer periods, especially when subjected to temperature fluctuations.

2. The stability and activity of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are enhanced due to the formation of a stable alloy structure that allows for the coexistence of both metallic Pd and PdO phases. This structure facilitates the dissociative adsorption of methane molecules, which are then efficiently reduced at the Pd-PdO interface.

3. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the detailed surface chemistry and structure of Pt-based bimetallic systems, enabling a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing their performance and stability. These studies would be crucial for optimizing catalyst design for various applications, including CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions.
