<p>The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.</p>
<p>The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation. The palladium-containing particles were composed of polycrystalline domains of both PdO and Pd randomly oriented inside the particles.</p>
<p>Preoxidising the sample at 500 or 600C changed the morphology of the particles into larger crystals and caused the sample to become fully oxidised.</p>
<p>The decline in activity may be due to this reconstruction.</p>
<p>The thermal decomposition of PdO was initiated by creating one or two nuclei of Pd on each PdO crystal.</p>
<p>The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation.</p>
<p>The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt.</p>
<p>These two parts were always found in close contact. The alloy initially had a palladium-rich composition.</p>
<p>During operation below the PdO decomposition temperature, the composition of the alloy changed toward a structure of equal molarity of Pd and Pt.</p>
<p>The metallic palladium ejected from the solid solution was oxidised into PdO, which is more active for methane combustion, resulting in increased activity.</p>

This document discusses the influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The findings suggest that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts can lead to increased activity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, especially in terms of methane conversion. The document also highlights that future studies utilizing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques could provide valuable insights into the behavior of these catalysts on model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, it notes that current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces pose challenges in correlating the findings with real-world applications.

The key insights from the document are:
1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit greater efficiency in methane conversions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.
2. The activity of monometallic Pt catalysts decreases over time, especially at higher temperatures.
3. The initial incomplete oxidation of the Pt catalyst leads to the formation of more PdO during operation, affecting the catalyst's activity.
4. Preoxidation at temperatures above 500°C changes the catalyst's morphology, contributing to the decline in activity.
5. The thermal decomposition of PdO initiates when Pt nuclei form on PdO crystals.
6. The Pt-based bimetallic catalysts show increased activity over time due to the formation of more PdO during operation.
7. The catalyst's morphology includes two distinct parts: one rich in PdO and the other an alloy between Pd and Pt.
8. The alloy's composition changes during operation, allowing for the ejection of metallic Pd, which oxidizes into PdO, enhancing the catalyst's activity.
9. The Pt component in the bimetallic catalyst helps prevent aging, leading to better stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.
10. Future UHV studies could offer deeper insights into the catalyst's behavior on model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially overcoming current limitations.

The document provides a detailed analysis of the catalytic behavior of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, highlighting their potential advantages in industrial applications. However, it acknowledges the ongoing challenges in translating these findings to practical scenarios due to limitations in UHV studies. Further research could leverage these insights to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions.

本文讨论了含Pt的双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换机制与效率的影响。研究发现，基于Pt的双金属催化剂在甲烷转化方面表现出更高的活性和稳定性，特别是对于甲烷转化。文档还指出，未来利用超高真空（UHV）技术进行的研究可以为这些催化剂在模型表面和支持催化剂上的行为提供宝贵见解。然而，当前在UHV技术下对基于Pt的双金属表面的研究限制使得将这些发现与实际应用相关联存在挑战。

本文的关键洞察包括：
1. 含有Pt的双金属催化剂在甲烷转化方面的效率高于单一金属Pt催化剂。
2. 单一金属Pt催化剂的活性随时间显著下降，尤其是在较高温度下。
3. 初始不完全氧化的Pt催化剂在运行过程中形成了更多的PdO，影响催化剂的活性。
4. 在超过500°C的预氧化温度下，催化剂的形态变化导致活性下降。
5. PtO的热分解在Pt核形成于PdO晶体上时开始。
6. 含有Pt的双金属催化剂在运行过程中显示出随时间增加的活性，由于操作期间形成了更多PdO。
7. 催化剂的形态包括两个不同的部分：富含PdO的部分和Pd和Pt之间的合金部分。
8. 合金的组成在运行过程中发生变化，允许从固体溶液中喷射出金属Pd，氧化成PdO，增强催化剂的活性。
9. Pt成分在双金属催化剂中有助于防止老化，导致稳定性比单一金属Pt催化剂更好。
10. 进一步的UHV研究可以提供对模型表面和支持催化剂上催化剂行为的更深入理解，可能克服当前的局限性。

本文提供了对含Pt的双金属催化剂催化行为的详细分析，突出了它们在工业应用中的潜在优势。然而，它承认将这些发现应用于实际场景时仍面临着挑战，主要是由于UHV研究的限制。进一步的研究可以利用这些见解开发更高效稳定的催化剂，用于CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化。
