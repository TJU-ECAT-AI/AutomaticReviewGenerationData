Characterisation and microstructure of Pd and bimetallic PdPt catalysts during methane oxidation.

The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over Pd/Al2O3 and PdPt/Al2O3. It was found that the activity of Pd/Al2O3 gradually decreases with time at temperatures well below that of PdO decomposition. The opposite was observed for PdPt/Al2O3, of which the activity decreases slightly with time. 

Morphological studies of the two catalysts showed major changes during operation. The palladium particles in Pd/Al2O3 are initially composed of smaller, randomly oriented crystals of both PdO and Pd. In oxidising atmospheres, the crystals become more oxidised and form larger crystals. The activity increase of PdPt/Al2O3 is probably related to more PdO being formed during operation. The particles in PdPt/Al2O3 are split into two different domains: one with PdO and the other likely consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. The alloy is initially rich in palladium, but the composition changes to a more equalmolar PdPt structure during operation. The ejected Pd is oxidised into PdO, which is more active than its metallic phase. The amount of PdO formed depends on the oxidation time and temperature.

The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation. The palladium-containing particles were composed of polycrystalline domains of both PdO and Pd randomly oriented inside the particles. Preoxidising the sample at 500 or 600C changed the morphology of the particles into larger crystals and caused the sample to become fully oxidised. The decline in activity may be due to this reconstruction.

The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation. By increasing the oxidation temperature, more PdO was formed and stabilisation occurred more rapidly. However, the oxidation temperature must be below the PdO decomposition temperature for this to occur.

For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time.

The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts. The difference in aging may be attributed both to changes in the morphology and to the loss of palladium of the monometallic catalyst, which is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst.

The catalyst in the present study was calcined at considerably higher temperature than that used in most aging studies, resulting in larger initial sizes of the palladium-containing particles. Due to the larger palladium particles, and thus the larger distance between them, the ability to move in the alumina matrix to obtain growing and sintering was reduced. Nevertheless, the smaller crystals might migrate through the alumina material.

Glin et al. have shown that alumina-supported Pt catalysts are less resistant to thermal aging in steam at 600C than Pd catalysts. The dispersion of Pt on the alumina decreased significantly, resulting in lower activity. In contrast to monometallic Pt catalysts, the alloyed PdPt system showed significant stabilisation against sintering.

Vaporisation of the noble metals also may decrease the activity. According to the literature, Pt is more easily vaporised than Pd, but the combination of the two make the platinum more resistant against vaporisation.

The loss of activity at temperatures above 670C is most likely related to the PdO decomposition, because the TPO experiments showed PdO decomposition in this temperature range. However, the TPO decomposition started already at 625C. The lower decomposition temperature is probably related to the fourfold lower partial pressure of oxygen used in the TPO experiments compared with the activity test.

The values of BET surface areas, crystal sizes, and noble metal loadings of the samples are compiled in Table 1. The drop of surface area with aging may decrease the activity of both catalysts to some extent. But because the drop is in the same range for the two catalysts, the differences in activity loss are most likely not associated with the different surface areas.

As shown in Table 1, the increase in the average crystal size of PdO determined from the PXRD data was similar for the two catalysts as well. Thus, the greater activity loss of Pd/Al2O3 with aging may not be attributed to increasing crystal size, but rather may be an effect of Pd being encapsulated into a surface coating layer of PdO over the metal, preventing good contact with both Pd and PdO surfaces.

The loss in Pt probably will not decrease the activity severely. It is interesting to note that the alloy appeared to stabilise the Pd phase, probably related to the solid solution formation at higher temperatures having the nominal composition value.

Thermal aging achieved a structure similar to that after preoxidation at 500C; that is, the metallic Pd in Pd/Al2O3 oxidised into PdO at the same time as the crystals grew, whereas PdPt/Al2O3 maintained the two-domain structure in which the PdO part became larger and the alloy obtained a structure closer to the nominal composition. Thus, Pd/Al2O3 acquired a less active structure over time, whereas PdPt/Al2O3 achieved a more active structure. However, thermal aging also causes other phenomena that may result in a drop in activity for both catalysts, such as decreased surface area and vaporisation of noble metals.

Conclusions:
• The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study.
• The activity over Pd/Al2O3 dropped significantly with time, and the loss was larger at higher temperatures.
• The as-prepared Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was incompletely oxidised initially, but formed more PdO during operation.
• The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time due to significantly greater PdO production during operation.
• For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface.
• Thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3, and the difference in aging may be attributed both to changes in the morphology and to the loss of palladium of the monometallic catalyst, which is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst.

1. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit better activity in CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. This is due to the enhanced PdO formation during operation, which leads to increased activity and stability. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into the correlation between the catalytic performance and the surface chemistry, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies pose challenges in fully understanding the behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under realistic reaction conditions.

2. The presence of Pt in bimetallic catalysts, such as PdPt, contributes to the stabilization of Pd against thermal aging. This results in improved long-term stability compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. The alloy structure allows for a more active surface to maintain activity during prolonged operation, making Pt-based bimetallic catalysts more suitable for industrial applications requiring high stability.

3. The bimetallic PdPt catalysts achieve higher methane conversion rates compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. This is attributed to the coexistence of metallic Pd and PdO on the surface, which enhances the catalytic activity for methane oxidation. In contrast, monometallic Pd catalysts experience complete transformation of Pd into PdO over time, leading to a decline in activity.

4. The activity of the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst increases with time due to the formation of more PdO during operation. This leads to a more active structure with higher stability against thermal aging compared to the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The bimetallic structure allows for a more efficient utilization of the noble metals, resulting in improved catalytic performance.

5. The thermal aging of bimetallic PdPt catalysts is less severe than that of monometallic Pd catalysts. This is mainly attributed to changes in the morphology and the loss of palladium in monometallic catalysts, which is not observed in bimetallic catalysts. The Pt component in bimetallic catalysts provides additional resistance against aging, contributing to the overall stability of the catalysts under thermal stress.

6. The stability and efficiency of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in methane conversion can be further enhanced by optimizing the composition and structure of the catalysts. Future research could focus on developing advanced synthesis methods to control the morphology and composition of bimetallic catalysts, aiming to improve their performance and stability in real-world applications.
