[1] "In the case of Wang et al., they optimised their annealing procedure to the extent that they were able to maintain the Pt dispersion and stabilise the catalyst upon extended cycling in RDE experiments."
[2] "Inspired by work on single crystals, some research groups have aimed to improve the ORR activity of Pt and Pt-alloy nanoparticles by controlling the catalyst shape."
[3] "Although the ORR activity of Pt can be substantially enhanced by alloying, further improvements are required that will allow for (a) the high activity achieved on extended surfaces to be realised on the nanoparticulate catalysts used in a fuel cell and (b) the activity of these catalysts being stabilised for long periods of time and with extensive cycling."
[4] "The improved retainment of the surface area of Pt-alloys/C over Pt/C in a PEMFC may suggest that the presence of the less noble solute metal actually stabilises the catalyst."

1. Wang et al. optimized their annealing process to preserve Pt dispersion and stabilize the catalyst during prolonged cyclic RDE testing.
2. Some groups have attempted to enhance the ORR activity of Pt and Pt-alloy nanoparticles by manipulating the catalyst's shape, inspired by studies on single crystals.
3. Alloying Pt significantly boosts ORR activity, yet improvements are needed to replicate this efficiency on nanoparticulate catalysts and maintain stability over extended periods.
4. The better surface retention of Pt-alloys compared to pure Pt in PEMFCs could imply that the less noble metal in the alloy contributes to catalyst stabilization.

1. 王等人优化了热处理过程，以保持铂的分散度并稳定催化剂，即使在长时间循环的RDE实验中也是如此。
2. 一些研究小组试图通过改变催化剂形状来提高铂和铂基合金纳米颗粒的ORR活性，这是受到单晶研究的启发。
3. 铂合金在提升ORR活性方面表现出色，但需要进一步改进，以便在纳米颗粒催化剂上重现这种效率，并长期维持稳定性。
4. 在PEMFC中，铂合金比纯铂更好地保留表面面积，这可能意味着合金中的较不贵重金属实际上有助于催化剂的稳定性。
