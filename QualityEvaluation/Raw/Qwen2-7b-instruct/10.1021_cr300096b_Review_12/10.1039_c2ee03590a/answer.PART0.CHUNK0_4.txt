<p>However, it turns out that the constant difference of 3.2 eV between the binding energy of the HO* and HOO* intermediates not only holds for metal surfaces, but also for oxides and N-functionalised graphitic materials.21,87 Although these relations are useful in describing known trends and can predict new metallic catalysts, they impose a limit on the extent to which the ORR can be catalysed at low overpotentials.</p>
<p>Even so, the scaling relations might not be universal if the two-dimensional limitations considered here could be broken. Enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase exhibit flatter free energy landscapes at the reversible potential than even the most active of man made catalysts, such as Pt3Ni.200 Emulating these enzymes would lead to new, more efficient classes of man-made catalysts for the ORR where the stabilities of O*, HO* and HOO* are uncorrelated.</p>
<p>The main outcome of the theoretical screening study is summarised in Fig. 13a, where the descriptor for activity, ΔGO*, is plotted as a function of the descriptor for stability, ΔEalloy, the alloying energy. All the previously known alloys such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ni have close to the ideal value of ΔGO* for optimal activity but have a negligible alloying energy. This could explain their propensity towards dealloying. On the other hand, two candidates in particular, Pt3Y and Pt3Sc, stand out as having both the optimal ΔGO* and exceptionally negative alloying energies.</p>
<p>Despite the alloy stability, under the operating conditions of a PEMFC, there would be a strong thermodynamic driving force towards the dissolution of Y or Sc from Pt3Y or Pt3Sc. For instance, the standard dissolution potential, U0, for Y to Y3+ is 2.372 V with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)13 and the alloying energy of Pt3Y stabilises each Y atom by 4 eV; this means that at a potential of 1 V, there is a driving force of (2.372  1) × 3  (4) = 6.1 eV for the dissolution of each Y atom. Nonetheless, the negative alloying energy would set a significantly higher barrier for solute metal diffusion in these compounds than in alloys of Pt with late transition metals, such as PtxNi, PtxCo or PtxCu.</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations show that Pt5La has an alloying energy of 0.66 eV atom1, or 3.96 eV (La atom)1. Moroever, it is only one out of several alloys that Pt forms with lanthanides, forming stable compounds. This suggests that these compounds could be worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>For the depth profiles, the electrons emitted at angles between 20 and 80 to the surface normal were analysed in parallel and detected in 16 channels corresponding to 3.75 wide angle intervals. After XPS identification of the elements present at the surface, their main features were measured in detail with angle resolved XPS. The depth concentration profiles were obtained using the simulation tool, ARProcess of the Thermo Avantage software, which uses a maximum entropy method combined with a genetic algorithm. In all cases, the simulations were based on the relative intensities between Pt 4f, O 1s and C 1s, and La 3d5/2.</p>
<p>In the DFT calculations, the Pt (111) surface is modelled by a slab with 6 close-packed layers, where the three topmost layers and the adsorbates are allowed to relax. The ionic cores are described by PAW setups,202 and the KohnSham valence states are described on a real-space grid with a spacing of 0.18 Å. Exchange and correlation effects are described by the RPBE functional.203 The KohnSham Hamiltonian is diagonalized iteratively using Pulay mixing of the density and FermiDirac occupation of one-electron states with kBT = 0.1 eV. Total energies are extrapolated to kBT = 0 eV. The periodic images of the slab are separated by 20 Å of vacuum. All calculations have been carried out with the ASE and GPAW software packages.204,205 The adsorption energies are calculated in a (3 × 2) surface unit cell, and the Brillouin zone is sampled by an 8 × 8 × 1 k-point grid. The slab is relaxed using the quasi-Newton scheme until the maximum force component is less than 0.05 eV Å1.</p>
<p>The effect of solvation is included for HO* by incorporating the adsorbate in an H2O*/H2O* superstructure with 2/3 ML total coverage. The energy of HO* is calculated from the H2O*/HO* configuration which minimizes the average OH energy. The adsorption energy of H2O* is calculated in a similar superstructure with 2/3 ML total coverage. In the H2O*/HO* superstructure, half of the water molecules lie in a plane approximately parallel to the surface, and the other water molecules lie in a plane perpendicular to the surface with one hydrogen atom pointing away from the surface.61,206210</p>
