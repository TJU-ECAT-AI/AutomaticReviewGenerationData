<quotes>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes provided in the literature that address the questions about how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights future UHV studies could provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts.</p>
