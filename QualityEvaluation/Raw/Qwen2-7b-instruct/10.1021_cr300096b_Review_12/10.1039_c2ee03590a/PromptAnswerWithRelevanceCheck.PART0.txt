<p>It is worth considering what the ideal configuration would be for a Pt-based ORR catalyst. The Pt overlayer would only be a single layer thick, would be at least as active as pure Pt, and the core would consist of a material that is abundant and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Chen and coworkers recently reported that such a catalyst exists for the hydrogen evolution reaction. They found that a monolayer of Pt on WC exhibited the same hydrogen evolution activity as bulk Pt.</p>
<p>Very recently, two groups have reported an unexpected result by dealloying Pt-alloy or Pt coreshell catalysts: the formation of hollow Pt nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 12. Dubau et al. subjected Pt3Co nanoparticles to 654 hours of start up and shut down cycles at a PEMFC cathode, each cycle lasting two hours. The outcome of this was that that the Pt3Co/C precursors transformed into hollow Pt nanoparticles, with no measurable Co content.</p>
<p>In RDE experiments, the initial mass activity of their hollow catalysts was 1.1 A mgPt1, 4.4 times higher than that of their conventional Pt/C catalyst. After cycling the hollow catalysts 6000 times, only 33% of the initial mass activity was lost, in comparison to a 60% loss for solid Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The high stability of these hollow structures is characteristic of alloys of late and early transition metals. It can be understood on the basis that the half-filled metalmetal d-band in these alloys results in filled bonding states and empty anti-bonding states.</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations indicate that when a Pt overlayer covers the bulk alloy, the overlayer resembles closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at the equivalent positions where vacancies exist in the bulk.</p>
<p>According to our simulations, when the thickness of the Pt overlayer on Pt5La, is 3 monolayers thick, the adsorption energies of O* are converged (to within 0.04 eV) to those of strained pure Pt(111).</p>
<p>The overall ranking of catalyst activity is, in ascending order: Pt2Y &lt; Pt3Zr &lt; Pt &lt; Pt3Hf &lt; Pt3Sc &lt; Pt5La &lt; Pt3Y.</p>
<p>Our XPS results suggested that HfOx and ZrOx formed on the surface of Pt3Hf and Pt3Zr, respectively, explaining their lower activity.</p>
<p>When a Pt overlayer covers the bulk alloy, the overlayer resembles closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at the equivalent positions where vacancies exist in the bulk.</p>
<p>The high ORR activity of Pt5La, as demonstrated by its position on the volcano in Fig. 5.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an alloy of Pt and La has been tested for the ORR.</p>
<p>Ultra high vacuum measurements In-depth surface composition information of Pt5La was extracted from angle resolved XPS spectra recorded using a Theta Probe instrument from Thermo Scientific.</p>

The ideal configuration for a Pt-based ORR catalyst would feature a single-layer Pt overlayer that matches the activity of pure Pt and a core made of an abundant, inexpensive material. Chen and coworkers found that a monolayer of Pt on WC exhibited the same hydrogen evolution activity as bulk Pt. Hollow Pt nanoparticles, formed by dealloying Pt-alloy catalysts, showed higher mass activity than conventional Pt/C catalysts and maintained a high level of stability upon cycling. These hollow structures are characterized by a half-filled metal-metal d-band, resulting in filled bonding states and empty anti-bonding states. DFT calculations revealed that the Pt overlayer on Pt5La resembled closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at equivalent positions of bulk vacancies. The adsorption energies of O* on the Pt5La surface were converged to those of strained pure Pt(111) when the Pt overlayer was 3 monolayers thick. The ranking of catalyst activity placed Pt5La as the most active among tested Pt alloys. The lower activity of Pt3Hf and Pt3Zr was attributed to the formation of HfOx and ZrOx on their surfaces. When a Pt overlayer covered the bulk alloy, it resembled closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at the positions of bulk vacancies. The high ORR activity of Pt5La was demonstrated, and it was the first time an alloy of Pt and La was tested for this reaction. Angle resolved XPS measurements provided in-depth surface composition information of Pt5La using a Theta Probe instrument from Thermo Scientific.

理想的Pt基ORR催化剂配置应包括单层Pt覆盖层，其活性与纯Pt相当，并且核心材料应为丰富且价格低廉。Chen和同事发现，WC上的单层Pt在氢演化反应中的活性与纯Pt相同。通过分解合金催化剂形成的空心Pt纳米颗粒显示出了比传统Pt/C催化剂更高的质量活性，并在循环6000次后仅损失了33%的初始质量活性，而纯Pt颗粒的损耗为60%。这些空心结构的特点是金属-金属d带半满，导致形成填充的键合状态和空的反键状态。DFT计算表明，当Pt覆盖层覆盖在合金基体上时，覆盖层类似于紧密排列的Pt，额外的Pt原子位于基体中空位的等效位置。当Pt覆盖层在Pt5La上为3个单层厚时，O*的吸附能收敛到拉伸纯Pt(111)的吸附能（误差在0.04 eV以内）。催化剂活性排名中，Pt5La的活性最高。Pt3Hf和Pt3Zr活性较低的原因是它们的表面形成了HfOx和ZrOx。当Pt覆盖层覆盖在合金基体上时，它类似于紧密排列的Pt，额外的Pt原子位于基体空位的等效位置。Pt5La表现出高ORR活性，这是首次测试Pt和La合金进行ORR。使用Thermo Scientific公司的Theta探针仪器记录的角度解析XPS光谱提供了关于Pt5La的深入表面组成信息。

[1] "In the case of Wang et al., they optimised their annealing procedure to the extent that they were able to maintain the Pt dispersion and stabilise the catalyst upon extended cycling in RDE experiments."
[2] "Inspired by work on single crystals, some research groups have aimed to improve the ORR activity of Pt and Pt-alloy nanoparticles by controlling the catalyst shape."
[3] "Although the ORR activity of Pt can be substantially enhanced by alloying, further improvements are required that will allow for (a) the high activity achieved on extended surfaces to be realised on the nanoparticulate catalysts used in a fuel cell and (b) the activity of these catalysts being stabilised for long periods of time and with extensive cycling."
[4] "The improved retainment of the surface area of Pt-alloys/C over Pt/C in a PEMFC may suggest that the presence of the less noble solute metal actually stabilises the catalyst."

<p>However, it turns out that the constant difference of 3.2 eV between the binding energy of the HO* and HOO* intermediates not only holds for metal surfaces, but also for oxides and N-functionalised graphitic materials.21,87 Although these relations are useful in describing known trends and can predict new metallic catalysts, they impose a limit on the extent to which the ORR can be catalysed at low overpotentials.</p>
<p>Even so, the scaling relations might not be universal if the two-dimensional limitations considered here could be broken. Enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase exhibit flatter free energy landscapes at the reversible potential than even the most active of man made catalysts, such as Pt3Ni.200 Emulating these enzymes would lead to new, more efficient classes of man-made catalysts for the ORR where the stabilities of O*, HO* and HOO* are uncorrelated.</p>
<p>The main outcome of the theoretical screening study is summarised in Fig. 13a, where the descriptor for activity, ΔGO*, is plotted as a function of the descriptor for stability, ΔEalloy, the alloying energy. All the previously known alloys such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ni have close to the ideal value of ΔGO* for optimal activity but have a negligible alloying energy. This could explain their propensity towards dealloying. On the other hand, two candidates in particular, Pt3Y and Pt3Sc, stand out as having both the optimal ΔGO* and exceptionally negative alloying energies.</p>
<p>Despite the alloy stability, under the operating conditions of a PEMFC, there would be a strong thermodynamic driving force towards the dissolution of Y or Sc from Pt3Y or Pt3Sc. For instance, the standard dissolution potential, U0, for Y to Y3+ is 2.372 V with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)13 and the alloying energy of Pt3Y stabilises each Y atom by 4 eV; this means that at a potential of 1 V, there is a driving force of (2.372  1) × 3  (4) = 6.1 eV for the dissolution of each Y atom. Nonetheless, the negative alloying energy would set a significantly higher barrier for solute metal diffusion in these compounds than in alloys of Pt with late transition metals, such as PtxNi, PtxCo or PtxCu.</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations show that Pt5La has an alloying energy of 0.66 eV atom1, or 3.96 eV (La atom)1. Moroever, it is only one out of several alloys that Pt forms with lanthanides, forming stable compounds. This suggests that these compounds could be worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>For the depth profiles, the electrons emitted at angles between 20 and 80 to the surface normal were analysed in parallel and detected in 16 channels corresponding to 3.75 wide angle intervals. After XPS identification of the elements present at the surface, their main features were measured in detail with angle resolved XPS. The depth concentration profiles were obtained using the simulation tool, ARProcess of the Thermo Avantage software, which uses a maximum entropy method combined with a genetic algorithm. In all cases, the simulations were based on the relative intensities between Pt 4f, O 1s and C 1s, and La 3d5/2.</p>
<p>In the DFT calculations, the Pt (111) surface is modelled by a slab with 6 close-packed layers, where the three topmost layers and the adsorbates are allowed to relax. The ionic cores are described by PAW setups,202 and the KohnSham valence states are described on a real-space grid with a spacing of 0.18 Å. Exchange and correlation effects are described by the RPBE functional.203 The KohnSham Hamiltonian is diagonalized iteratively using Pulay mixing of the density and FermiDirac occupation of one-electron states with kBT = 0.1 eV. Total energies are extrapolated to kBT = 0 eV. The periodic images of the slab are separated by 20 Å of vacuum. All calculations have been carried out with the ASE and GPAW software packages.204,205 The adsorption energies are calculated in a (3 × 2) surface unit cell, and the Brillouin zone is sampled by an 8 × 8 × 1 k-point grid. The slab is relaxed using the quasi-Newton scheme until the maximum force component is less than 0.05 eV Å1.</p>
<p>The effect of solvation is included for HO* by incorporating the adsorbate in an H2O*/H2O* superstructure with 2/3 ML total coverage. The energy of HO* is calculated from the H2O*/HO* configuration which minimizes the average OH energy. The adsorption energy of H2O* is calculated in a similar superstructure with 2/3 ML total coverage. In the H2O*/HO* superstructure, half of the water molecules lie in a plane approximately parallel to the surface, and the other water molecules lie in a plane perpendicular to the surface with one hydrogen atom pointing away from the surface.61,206210</p>
