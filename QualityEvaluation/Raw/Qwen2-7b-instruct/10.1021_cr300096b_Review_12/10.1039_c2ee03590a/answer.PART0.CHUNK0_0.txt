<p>It is worth considering what the ideal configuration would be for a Pt-based ORR catalyst. The Pt overlayer would only be a single layer thick, would be at least as active as pure Pt, and the core would consist of a material that is abundant and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Chen and coworkers recently reported that such a catalyst exists for the hydrogen evolution reaction. They found that a monolayer of Pt on WC exhibited the same hydrogen evolution activity as bulk Pt.</p>
<p>Very recently, two groups have reported an unexpected result by dealloying Pt-alloy or Pt coreshell catalysts: the formation of hollow Pt nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 12. Dubau et al. subjected Pt3Co nanoparticles to 654 hours of start up and shut down cycles at a PEMFC cathode, each cycle lasting two hours. The outcome of this was that that the Pt3Co/C precursors transformed into hollow Pt nanoparticles, with no measurable Co content.</p>
<p>In RDE experiments, the initial mass activity of their hollow catalysts was 1.1 A mgPt1, 4.4 times higher than that of their conventional Pt/C catalyst. After cycling the hollow catalysts 6000 times, only 33% of the initial mass activity was lost, in comparison to a 60% loss for solid Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The high stability of these hollow structures is characteristic of alloys of late and early transition metals. It can be understood on the basis that the half-filled metalmetal d-band in these alloys results in filled bonding states and empty anti-bonding states.</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations indicate that when a Pt overlayer covers the bulk alloy, the overlayer resembles closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at the equivalent positions where vacancies exist in the bulk.</p>
<p>According to our simulations, when the thickness of the Pt overlayer on Pt5La, is 3 monolayers thick, the adsorption energies of O* are converged (to within 0.04 eV) to those of strained pure Pt(111).</p>

<p>Our XPS results suggested that HfOx and ZrOx formed on the surface of Pt3Hf and Pt3Zr, respectively, explaining their lower activity.</p>

The ideal configuration for a Pt-based ORR catalyst would feature a single-layer Pt overlayer that matches the activity of pure Pt and a core made of an abundant, inexpensive material. Chen and coworkers found that a monolayer of Pt on WC exhibited the same hydrogen evolution activity as bulk Pt. Hollow Pt nanoparticles, formed by dealloying Pt-alloy catalysts, showed higher mass activity than conventional Pt/C catalysts and maintained a high level of stability upon cycling. These hollow structures are characterized by a half-filled metal-metal d-band, resulting in filled bonding states and empty anti-bonding states. DFT calculations revealed that the Pt overlayer on Pt5La resembled closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at equivalent positions of bulk vacancies. The adsorption energies of O* on the Pt5La surface were converged to those of strained pure Pt(111) when the Pt overlayer was 3 monolayers thick. The ranking of catalyst activity placed Pt5La as the most active among tested Pt alloys. The lower activity of Pt3Hf and Pt3Zr was attributed to the formation of HfOx and ZrOx on their surfaces. When a Pt overlayer covered the bulk alloy, it resembled closely packed Pt, with extra Pt atoms at the positions of bulk vacancies. The high ORR activity of Pt5La was demonstrated, and it was the first time an alloy of Pt and La was tested for this reaction. Angle resolved XPS measurements provided in-depth surface composition information of Pt5La using a Theta Probe instrument from Thermo Scientific.

理想的Pt基ORR催化剂配置应包括单层Pt覆盖层，其活性与纯Pt相当，并且核心材料应为丰富且价格低廉。Chen和同事发现，WC上的单层Pt在氢演化反应中的活性与纯Pt相同。通过分解合金催化剂形成的空心Pt纳米颗粒显示出了比传统Pt/C催化剂更高的质量活性，并在循环6000次后仅损失了33%的初始质量活性，而纯Pt颗粒的损耗为60%。这些空心结构的特点是金属-金属d带半满，导致形成填充的键合状态和空的反键状态。DFT计算表明，当Pt覆盖层覆盖在合金基体上时，覆盖层类似于紧密排列的Pt，额外的Pt原子位于基体中空位的等效位置。当Pt覆盖层在Pt5La上为3个单层厚时，O*的吸附能收敛到拉伸纯Pt(111)的吸附能（误差在0.04 eV以内）。催化剂活性排名中，Pt5La的活性最高。Pt3Hf和Pt3Zr活性较低的原因是它们的表面形成了HfOx和ZrOx。当Pt覆盖层覆盖在合金基体上时，它类似于紧密排列的Pt，额外的Pt原子位于基体空位的等效位置。Pt5La表现出高ORR活性，这是首次测试Pt和La合金进行ORR。使用Thermo Scientific公司的Theta探针仪器记录的角度解析XPS光谱提供了关于Pt5La的深入表面组成信息。
