Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum (Pt), have been shown to influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The introduction of transition metals such as nickel (Ni) enhances the catalytic activity of Pt catalysts, particularly at low temperatures. This improvement is associated with the shift of the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) peak to lower temperatures, indicating a change in the redox properties of the catalyst. The optimal molar ratio of Ni to Pt was found to be 5, which maximizes both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity. In the presence of 2 vol% water vapor and 20 vol% carbon dioxide, the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst maintained high CO conversion and CO2 selectivity, demonstrating the stability of the bimetallic phase under these conditions. These findings suggest that the interaction between Pt and Ni on the surface can lead to enhanced performance in CO oxidation reactions, particularly in H2-rich streams, offering potential insights for the development of efficient catalysts for industrial processes.

铂基双金属催化剂在过量氢气存在下对一氧化碳氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响已经在反应器研究中得到了证明。引入过渡金属如镍可以增强铂催化剂的催化活性，特别是在低温条件下。这种改进与温度程序化还原（TPR）峰向较低温度的移动相关，这表明催化剂的还原性质发生了变化。发现Ni与Pt的最佳摩尔比为5，这能最大化CO转化率和CO2选择性。在2体积%水分蒸气和20体积%二氧化碳的存在下，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂保持了高CO转化率和高CO2选择性，显示了该双金属相在这些条件下的稳定性。这些发现表明，铂与镍在表面的相互作用可能导致CO氧化反应性能的增强，尤其是在富含H2的流体中，为工业过程的发展提供了潜在的见解。
