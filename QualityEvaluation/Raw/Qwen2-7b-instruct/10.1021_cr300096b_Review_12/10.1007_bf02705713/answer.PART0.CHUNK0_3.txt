Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures. For supported Pt-Ni catalysts, Alumina was superior to TiO2 and ZrO2 as a support. The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures. The optimum molar ratio between Ni and Pt was determined to be 5. This Pt-Ni/γ A12O3 showed no decrease in CO conversion and CO2 selectivity for the selective CO oxidation in the presence of 2 vol% H2O and 20 vol% CO2. The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, enhance the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The study demonstrates that the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits high CO conversion rates across a broad range of temperatures. Additionally, alumina supports the Pt-Ni catalyst more effectively than titanium oxide (TiO2) or zirconia (ZrO2). Increasing the molar ratio of Ni to Pt leads to improved catalytic activity at lower temperatures, as evidenced by a shift in the TPR peak to lower temperatures. The optimal molar ratio between Ni and Pt is found to be 5. This catalyst maintains consistent CO conversion and high CO2 selectivity even in the presence of 2 vol% water vapor and 20 vol% carbon dioxide. The Pt-Ni bimetallic phase contributes to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO within hydrogen-rich streams. Future studies employing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques could offer insights into the correlation between these findings and model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

在反应器研究中，特别是包含Pt的双金属催化剂，增强了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应以及甲烷转化的机制和效率。研究表明，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在广泛的温度范围内表现出高的CO转化率。此外，与二氧化钛（TiO2）或氧化锆（ZrO2）相比，铝酸盐更适合作为Pt-Ni催化剂的载体。增加Ni与Pt的摩尔比导致较低温度下催化活性提高，这体现在TPR峰向更低温度移动。Ni与Pt的最佳摩尔比确定为5。即使在存在2体积%水分蒸气和20体积%二氧化碳的情况下，这种催化剂也能保持一致的CO转化率和高CO2选择性。Pt-Ni双金属相有助于稳定活性，并在富氢流中实现高CO2选择性。CO的选择性氧化。未来采用超高真空(UHV)技术的研究可以提供有关这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂之间的关联的见解，尽管目前在Pt基双金属表面上的UHV研究存在局限性。
