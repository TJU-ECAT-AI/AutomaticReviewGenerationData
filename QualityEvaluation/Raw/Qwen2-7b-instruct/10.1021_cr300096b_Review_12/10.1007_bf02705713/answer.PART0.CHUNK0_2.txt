Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The addition of transition metals like nickel (Ni) to the Pt base enhances the catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures. The study highlights that the Pt-Ni system on γ-Al2O3 support is effective under conditions involving excess hydrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The optimal molar ratio of Ni to Pt is found to be 5, which contributes to the stability and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have the potential to correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms and optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications. However, current limitations in UHV studies may hinder a comprehensive understanding of the interactions at the atomic level, thus requiring additional research to bridge the gap between experimental observations and theoretical predictions.

在反应器研究中，特别是含有铂的双金属催化剂，可以显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。添加过渡金属如镍（Ni）到铂基体中可以在较低温度下增强催化活性。研究表明，含Pt-Ni系统的γ-Al2O3支持在存在过量氢、水蒸气和二氧化碳的情况下是有效的。发现Ni与Pt的最佳摩尔比为5，这有助于保持稳定性和高CO2选择性，在富氢流中的CO选择性氧化过程中。未来在超高真空（UHV）条件下对Pt基双金属表面的研究有可能将这些发现与模型表面和负载催化剂联系起来，提供更深入的机制理解，并优化催化剂设计以应用于工业应用。然而，当前UHV研究的局限性可能阻碍了原子水平上相互作用的全面理解，因此需要进一步研究来弥合实验观察和理论预测之间的差距。
