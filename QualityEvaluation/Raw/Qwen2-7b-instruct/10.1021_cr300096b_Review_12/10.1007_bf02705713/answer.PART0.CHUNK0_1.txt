[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."
[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."
[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt."
[4] "This Pt-Ni/γ A12O3 showed no decrease in CO conversion and CO2 selectivity for the selective CO oxidation in the presence of 2 vol% H2O and 20 vol% CO2."
[5] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, enhance the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through their unique interactions. The addition of transition metals like nickel (Ni) to platinum (Pt) results in improved catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures, due to an optimized molar ratio between Ni and Pt. This leads to increased CO conversion rates and high CO2 selectivity in CO oxidation processes under conditions rich in hydrogen. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies may hinder such correlations.

在反应器研究中，特别是铂基双金属催化剂中，通过它们独特的相互作用，双金属催化剂增强了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。向铂添加过渡金属如镍（Ni）可以优化Ni和Pt之间的摩尔比，特别是在低温条件下，从而提高CO转化率并保持高CO2选择性。在富含氢气的流体中进行CO氧化过程。未来对Pt基双金属表面的超高压真空（UHV）研究可能为与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性提供宝贵见解，尽管当前UHV研究的限制可能阻碍此类相关性的建立。
