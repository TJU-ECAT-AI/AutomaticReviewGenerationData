[3] "For supported Pt-Ni catalysts, Alumina was superior to TiO2 and ZrO2 as a support."
[4] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt."
[5] "This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."
[6] "The optimum molar ratio between Ni and Pt was determined to be 5."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The incorporation of transition metals like Ni into Pt-based catalysts enhances CO oxidation efficiency over a wide range of temperatures. The use of alumina as a support material outperforms titania and zirconia in supporting Pt-Ni catalysts. The molar ratio of Ni to Pt plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity; an optimal ratio of 5 between Ni and Pt leads to improved performance. The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni catalysts demonstrates stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams, even under conditions of 2 volume percent water vapor and 20 volume percent carbon dioxide.

Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have the potential to correlate findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder a comprehensive understanding of their behavior under realistic conditions. Therefore, while UHV studies provide valuable information, they might not fully capture the complexities of real-world catalyst performance.

铂基双金属催化剂显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率。将过渡金属如Ni引入Pt基催化剂中，可以提高CO氧化效率，并在较宽的温度范围内工作。使用氧化铝作为支持材料在支持Pt-Ni催化剂方面优于二氧化钛和氧化锆。Ni与Pt的摩尔比在确定催化活性中起着关键作用；Ni与Pt的最佳比例为5，可带来更好的性能。Pt-Ni双金属相催化剂在氢气富集流中进行选择性CO氧化时，显示出稳定的活性和高CO2选择性，即使在含有2体积百分比水分蒸气和20体积百分比二氧化碳的条件下也是如此。

未来在超高压真空(UHV)下的研究有可能将发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，提供更深入的理解。然而，目前在UHV下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究限制，阻碍了全面理解其在实际条件下的行为。因此，尽管UHV研究提供了有价值的信息，但它们可能无法完全捕捉到真实催化剂性能的复杂性。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, enhance the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies through their unique interactions. The addition of transition metals like nickel (Ni) to platinum (Pt) results in improved catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures, due to an optimized molar ratio between Ni and Pt. This leads to increased CO conversion rates and high CO2 selectivity in CO oxidation processes under conditions rich in hydrogen. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, although current limitations in UHV studies may hinder such correlations.

The addition of transition metals like nickel (Ni) to the Pt base enhances the catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures. The study highlights that the Pt-Ni system on γ-Al2O3 support is effective under conditions involving excess hydrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The optimal molar ratio of Ni to Pt is found to be 5, which contributes to the stability and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have the potential to correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms and optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, enhance the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The study demonstrates that the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits high CO conversion rates across a broad range of temperatures. Additionally, alumina supports the Pt-Ni catalyst more effectively than titanium oxide (TiO2) or zirconia (ZrO2). Increasing the molar ratio of Ni to Pt leads to improved catalytic activity at lower temperatures, as evidenced by a shift in the TPR peak to lower temperatures. The optimal molar ratio between Ni and Pt is found to be 5. This catalyst maintains consistent CO conversion and high CO2 selectivity even in the presence of 2 vol% water vapor and 20 vol% carbon dioxide. The Pt-Ni bimetallic phase contributes to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO within hydrogen-rich streams. Future studies employing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques could offer insights into the correlation between these findings and model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum (Pt), have been shown to influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The introduction of transition metals such as nickel (Ni) enhances the catalytic activity of Pt catalysts, particularly at low temperatures. This improvement is associated with the shift of the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) peak to lower temperatures, indicating a change in the redox properties of the catalyst. The optimal molar ratio of Ni to Pt was found to be 5, which maximizes both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity. In the presence of 2 vol% water vapor and 20 vol% carbon dioxide, the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst maintained high CO conversion and CO2 selectivity, demonstrating the stability of the bimetallic phase under these conditions. These findings suggest that the interaction between Pt and Ni on the surface can lead to enhanced performance in CO oxidation reactions, particularly in H2-rich streams, offering potential insights for the development of efficient catalysts for industrial processes.
