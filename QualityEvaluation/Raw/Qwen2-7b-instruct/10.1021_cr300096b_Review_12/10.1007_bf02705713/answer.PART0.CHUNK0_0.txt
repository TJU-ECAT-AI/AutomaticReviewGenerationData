Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The incorporation of transition metals like Ni into Pt-based catalysts enhances CO oxidation efficiency over a wide range of temperatures. The use of alumina as a support material outperforms titania and zirconia in supporting Pt-Ni catalysts. The molar ratio of Ni to Pt plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity; an optimal ratio of 5 between Ni and Pt leads to improved performance. The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni catalysts demonstrates stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams, even under conditions of 2 volume percent water vapor and 20 volume percent carbon dioxide.

Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have the potential to correlate findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces hinder a comprehensive understanding of their behavior under realistic conditions. Therefore, while UHV studies provide valuable information, they might not fully capture the complexities of real-world catalyst performance.

铂基双金属催化剂显著影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率。将过渡金属如Ni引入Pt基催化剂中，可以提高CO氧化效率，并在较宽的温度范围内工作。使用氧化铝作为支持材料在支持Pt-Ni催化剂方面优于二氧化钛和氧化锆。Ni与Pt的摩尔比在确定催化活性中起着关键作用；Ni与Pt的最佳比例为5，可带来更好的性能。Pt-Ni双金属相催化剂在氢气富集流中进行选择性CO氧化时，显示出稳定的活性和高CO2选择性，即使在含有2体积百分比水分蒸气和20体积百分比二氧化碳的条件下也是如此。

未来在超高压真空(UHV)下的研究有可能将发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，提供更深入的理解。然而，目前在UHV下对基于铂的双金属表面的研究限制，阻碍了全面理解其在实际条件下的行为。因此，尽管UHV研究提供了有价值的信息，但它们可能无法完全捕捉到真实催化剂性能的复杂性。
