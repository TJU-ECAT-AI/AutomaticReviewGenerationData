<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15).</p>
<p>In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6).</p>
<p>Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7).</p>
<p>However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix.</p>
<p>The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8).</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>
<p>Construction of FeO nanoislands on the metal support was done by depositing Fe on Pt(111) under oxidizing conditions and characterized by an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) multi-probe surface system (10).</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To more easily identify the changes, we deposited a fixed amount of Fe (0.25 ML) but annealed at various temperatures. In this way, the corresponding dispersion of FeO nanoislands prepared could be changed gradually.</p>
<p>This means that the oxygen deficiency mainly occurs at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands, and the corresponding ferrous Fe atoms there are coordinatively unsaturated (denoted as FeO1-x/Pt(111), x < 1).</p>
<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The reaction rate was determined on the basis of the UPS intensity versus the reaction time plots (fig. S3).</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen.</p>
<p>FeO1-x/Pt(111) shows a much higher reactivity for O2 activation (fig. S5).</p>
<p>Compared with oxygen atoms adsorbed on metallic Fe or inside a 2D FeO overlayer with energy of 3.0 eV, which was too strong to be reactive, the bonding strength for O atoms at the CUF sites is optimum and would make these sites active.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reaction barrier between O at the CUF sites and CO adsorbed on neighboring Pt atoms is only 0.63 eV (the corresponding TS is shown in fig. S6).</p>
<p>The formation of the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands is due to the stabilization of interface confinement between the oxide overlayers and the metal supports.</p>
<p>We performed an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis over dozens of the Pt-Fe NPs, and found that Fe signal is accompanied exclusively with Pt signal (fig. S9).</p>
<p>These show that Fe species are present mainly on the outer layers of the Pt-Fe NPs.</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle.</p>
<p>This shows the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present.</p>
<p>We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions. As plotted in fig. S13, the catalysts were stable and showed good performances, with 92% CO selectivity/conversion at 353 K.</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system. We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst (fig. S15).</p>
<p>We demonstrated a strategy of preparing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites with lower valent states on metal substrates by taking advantage of the confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates.</p>
<p>The concept of interface confinement and fabrication of coordinately unsaturated low-valent cations could be widely applied in various heterogeneous oxides-metals catalytic systems and illustrates a promising and efficient way to design active sites for nanocatalysts.</p>

To address the questions regarding how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, the literature provides several key insights:

1. **Mechanisms and Efficiencies of CO Oxidation**: The literature highlights that the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which are stabilized by interface confinement between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, significantly enhances the efficiency of CO oxidation. Specifically, the CUF sites on the interface between the FeO nanoislands and the Pt support are identified as the active centers for CO oxidation. These sites activate oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive dissociated oxygen atoms, which efficiently oxidize CO. The use of UHV studies allows for the detailed characterization of the structure and reactivity of these CUF sites, providing insights into the mechanism of CO oxidation.

2. **Water Gas Shift Reaction and Methane Conversions**: Although the literature focuses primarily on CO oxidation, it indirectly touches upon related catalytic processes by discussing the general principles of catalyst design and the role of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. The concepts of using bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-based catalysts, in conjunction with nanostructured oxides can be extended to understand the mechanisms of water gas shift reactions and methane conversions. These reactions typically involve the activation of water and/or methane by the catalyst, leading to the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively. The literature's emphasis on the stabilization of CUF sites through interface confinement offers a framework for designing catalysts that can efficiently facilitate these reactions.

3. **Potential Insights from Future UHV Studies**: The limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces highlight the need for further research to fully understand the structure-reactivity relationships in complex catalyst systems. Future studies could employ advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) and XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), in UHV environments to probe the electronic and chemical states of the catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions. This would allow for a deeper understanding of how the structure of the catalyst (e.g., the distribution of Pt and Fe species, the presence of CUF sites) influences its activity and selectivity for different reactions. Additionally, the development of computational methods that can accurately model the interactions between the metal surfaces, oxides, and reactants could complement experimental findings, providing predictive insights into catalyst design.

4. **Designing Active Sites for Nanocatalysts**: The literature demonstrates that the concept of interface confinement can be broadly applied to various heterogeneous catalysts involving oxides and metals. This approach not only enhances the activity of catalysts but also improves their stability under operating conditions, such as those encountered in PEMFCs. By carefully controlling the synthesis parameters to ensure the formation of CUF sites at the interface between nanostructured oxides and metal supports, it becomes possible to design catalysts that exhibit high activity and stability, making them suitable for industrial applications.

In summary, the literature provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can be optimized for CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions through the strategic placement of active sites (like CUF sites) on metal surfaces. Future research directions aim to leverage advanced experimental techniques and theoretical models to refine these catalysts further, enhancing their performance in practical applications.
