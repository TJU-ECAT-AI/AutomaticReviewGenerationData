<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15).</p>
<p>In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6).</p>
<p>Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7).</p>
<p>However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix.</p>
<p>The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8).</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>
<p>Construction of FeO nanoislands on the metal support was done by depositing Fe on Pt(111) under oxidizing conditions and characterized by an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) multi-probe surface system (10).</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To more easily identify the changes, we deposited a fixed amount of Fe (0.25 ML) but annealed at various temperatures. In this way, the corresponding dispersion of FeO nanoislands prepared could be changed gradually.</p>
<p>This means that the oxygen deficiency mainly occurs at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands, and the corresponding ferrous Fe atoms there are coordinatively unsaturated (denoted as FeO1-x/Pt(111), x < 1).</p>
<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The reaction rate was determined on the basis of the UPS intensity versus the reaction time plots (fig. S3).</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen.</p>
<p>FeO1-x/Pt(111) shows a much higher reactivity for O2 activation (fig. S5).</p>
<p>Compared with oxygen atoms adsorbed on metallic Fe or inside a 2D FeO overlayer with energy of 3.0 eV, which was too strong to be reactive, the bonding strength for O atoms at the CUF sites is optimum and would make these sites active.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reaction barrier between O at the CUF sites and CO adsorbed on neighboring Pt atoms is only 0.63 eV (the corresponding TS is shown in fig. S6).</p>
<p>The formation of the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands is due to the stabilization of interface confinement between the oxide overlayers and the metal supports.</p>
<p>We performed an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis over dozens of the Pt-Fe NPs, and found that Fe signal is accompanied exclusively with Pt signal (fig. S9).</p>
<p>These show that Fe species are present mainly on the outer layers of the Pt-Fe NPs.</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle.</p>
<p>This shows the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present.</p>
<p>We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions. As plotted in fig. S13, the catalysts were stable and showed good performances, with 92% CO selectivity/conversion at 353 K.</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system. We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst (fig. S15).</p>
<p>We demonstrated a strategy of preparing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites with lower valent states on metal substrates by taking advantage of the confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates.</p>
<p>The concept of interface confinement and fabrication of coordinately unsaturated low-valent cations could be widely applied in various heterogeneous oxides-metals catalytic systems and illustrates a promising and efficient way to design active sites for nanocatalysts.</p>

To address the questions regarding how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, the literature provides several key insights:

1. **Mechanisms and Efficiencies of CO Oxidation**: The literature highlights that the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which are stabilized by interface confinement between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, significantly enhances the efficiency of CO oxidation. Specifically, the CUF sites on the interface between the FeO nanoislands and the Pt support are identified as the active centers for CO oxidation. These sites activate oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive dissociated oxygen atoms, which efficiently oxidize CO. The use of UHV studies allows for the detailed characterization of the structure and reactivity of these CUF sites, providing insights into the mechanism of CO oxidation.

2. **Water Gas Shift Reaction and Methane Conversions**: Although the literature focuses primarily on CO oxidation, it indirectly touches upon related catalytic processes by discussing the general principles of catalyst design and the role of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. The concepts of using bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-based catalysts, in conjunction with nanostructured oxides can be extended to understand the mechanisms of water gas shift reactions and methane conversions. These reactions typically involve the activation of water and/or methane by the catalyst, leading to the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively. The literature's emphasis on the stabilization of CUF sites through interface confinement offers a framework for designing catalysts that can efficiently facilitate these reactions.

3. **Potential Insights from Future UHV Studies**: The limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces highlight the need for further research to fully understand the structure-reactivity relationships in complex catalyst systems. Future studies could employ advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) and XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), in UHV environments to probe the electronic and chemical states of the catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions. This would allow for a deeper understanding of how the structure of the catalyst (e.g., the distribution of Pt and Fe species, the presence of CUF sites) influences its activity and selectivity for different reactions. Additionally, the development of computational methods that can accurately model the interactions between the metal surfaces, oxides, and reactants could complement experimental findings, providing predictive insights into catalyst design.

4. **Designing Active Sites for Nanocatalysts**: The literature demonstrates that the concept of interface confinement can be broadly applied to various heterogeneous catalysts involving oxides and metals. This approach not only enhances the activity of catalysts but also improves their stability under operating conditions, such as those encountered in PEMFCs. By carefully controlling the synthesis parameters to ensure the formation of CUF sites at the interface between nanostructured oxides and metal supports, it becomes possible to design catalysts that exhibit high activity and stability, making them suitable for industrial applications.

In summary, the literature provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, can be optimized for CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and methane conversions through the strategic placement of active sites (like CUF sites) on metal surfaces. Future research directions aim to leverage advanced experimental techniques and theoretical models to refine these catalysts further, enhancing their performance in practical applications.

1. **CO氧化的机制和效率**：文献强调，通过界面限制在纳米结构氧化物和金属基板之间的CUF（协调不饱和铁离子）位点的稳定性，显著提高了CO氧化的效率。具体来说，FeO纳米岛和Pt支持界面处的CUF位点被识别为CO氧化的活性中心。这些位点激活氧，导致形成可氧化CO的活性氧原子。利用UHV研究可以详细表征这些CUF位点的结构和活性，提供CO氧化机制的深入理解。

2. **水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换**：尽管文献主要关注于CO氧化，但通过讨论催化过程的一般原则及其活性位点在异质催化中的作用，可以间接地了解水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换的相关信息。这些反应通常涉及水或甲烷的催化活化，导致氢气和一氧化碳或二氧化碳的生成。文献中强调通过界面限制稳定CUF位点的概念，为设计能够高效促进这些反应的催化剂提供了框架。

3. **未来UHV研究的潜在见解**：对Pt基双金属表面的局限性表明，需要进一步的研究来完全理解催化剂体系的结构-反应性关系。未来的研究可以通过高级光谱技术（如XAFS和XPS）在UHV环境中进行，以探查在反应条件下催化剂表面的电子和化学状态。这将允许对不同反应中催化剂结构（例如Pt和Fe物种的分布、CUF位点的存在）如何影响其活性和选择性的深入了解。此外，开发可以准确模拟金属表面、氧化物和反应物之间相互作用的计算方法，可以补充实验发现，为催化剂设计提供预测性洞察。

4. **纳米催化剂活性位点的设计**：文献展示了界面限制概念可以广泛应用于涉及氧化物和金属的各种异质催化剂。这种方法不仅增强了催化剂的活性，而且在运行条件下提高了它们的稳定性，使其适合工业应用。通过仔细控制合成参数以确保纳米结构氧化物和金属表面之间的CUF位点形成，有可能设计出具有高活性和稳定性的催化剂。

总之，文献提供了全面的框架，用于理解如何通过在金属表面精心布置活性位点（如CUF位点）来优化Pt基催化剂用于CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换。未来的研究方向旨在利用先进的实验技术和理论模型进一步完善这些催化剂，提高其实用性能。

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), exhibit enhanced efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts maintain high activity and stability under realistic operating conditions, such as those found in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The presence of coordinately unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the interface between Pt and metal substrates enables efficient activation of oxygen, leading to the production of reactive dissociated oxygen atoms. The Pt-Fe catalysts demonstrate excellent stability, with no observed decline in performance over 40 hours at room temperature. The use of slight excess oxygen allows for the complete removal of CO to levels below 1 part per million. This demonstrates the practical application of these catalysts in industrial settings.

<p>To investigate the reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, we first presaturated the samples with CO. Afterward, a steady-state flux of O2 at nominally 5.2 × 108 mbar was leaked into the chamber at RT.

<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The reactivities of metallic Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and Pt(111) with subsurface Fe were lowered too (fig. S4).</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in enhancing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They exhibit high activity and stability under realistic conditions, making them suitable for industrial applications. The Pt-Fe catalysts, for instance, demonstrate exceptional performance in CO oxidation, achieving nearly 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature (RT). This is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the interface between the FeO nanoislands and Pt surface, which are highly reactive for oxygen activation, producing dissociated oxygen atoms. These CUF sites, along with the Pt atoms, form the active centers for CO oxidation. 

When tested under PEMFC conditions, the Pt-Fe catalysts maintain their stability and show good performance, with 92% CO selectivity/conversion at 353 K. By employing a slight excess of oxygen, CO can be removed to levels below 1 part per million. The use of these catalysts in a 1-kW PEMFC working system results in stable cell performance after a 930-hour test. However, the performance quickly degrades after a 30-minute test without the Pt-Fe catalyst, indicating their crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of the fuel cell.

Future studies using UHV techniques can correlate the findings obtained from model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the detailed mechanisms and interactions involved. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces highlight the need for advanced methodologies to explore the surface chemistry and dynamics of these materials, potentially leading to the development of even more efficient catalysts. These insights could guide the design of new catalysts with improved activity and stability, expanding the applicability of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts across various industrial processes.

在反应器研究中，特别是CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换，双金属催化剂尤其是Pt基催化剂在机制和效率方面发挥了关键作用。它们在实际条件下表现出高活性和稳定性，适合工业应用。例如，Pt-Fe催化剂在室温下实现几乎100%的CO转化率和选择性，这归功于FeO纳米岛与Pt表面界面处存在的协调不饱和铁（CUF）位点的高度活性，这些位点能够促进氧气激活，产生解离的氧原子。这些CUF位点与Pt原子共同形成CO氧化的活性中心。

在质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）条件下测试时，Pt-Fe催化剂保持稳定，并显示出良好的性能，353K时CO选择性和转化率达到92%。通过使用略多的氧气，CO可以去除至低于百万分之一的水平。将这些催化剂集成到1kW PEMFC工作系统中后，发现电池性能在930小时测试后保持稳定，但在没有使用Pt-Fe催化剂的30分钟测试后迅速失效，表明其在维持燃料电池效率中的关键作用。

未来使用超高真空技术进行的研究可以将模型表面和支撑催化剂的发现联系起来，提供有关涉及机制和相互作用的详细信息。当前对基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究的限制强调了需要高级方法来探索这些材料的表面化学和动力学，以潜在地开发更高效的催化剂。这些见解可以指导设计具有改进活性和稳定性的新催化剂，扩大Pt基双金属催化剂在各种工业过程中的应用范围。

Indeed, our calculations show that on 0.67-ML CO precovered Pt(111), dissociative adsorption of H2 becomes endothermic. Meanwhile, dissociative adsorption of H2 on FeO at RT is difficult, too (21, 22).</p>
<p>For the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off. In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT. At 353 K, the catalysts have 95% CO conversion and 95% selectivity, which remain high.</p>
<p>We measured the oxidation state of the Fe species under reaction conditions using in situ x-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAFS) performed in the beamline of BL14W1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (fig. S11).</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They achieve this by creating active sites that are coordinatively unsaturated ferrous centers, which are highly reactive for oxygen activation and CO oxidation. The Pt-Fe catalysts, in particular, show remarkable activity and stability under realistic conditions, including PEMFC working conditions, with high CO conversion rates and selectivity at temperatures as low as 200 K. The presence of ferrous species on the surface of the Pt-Fe catalysts, identified through XAFS measurements, confirms the high reactivity of these sites.

2. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these catalysts by allowing detailed examination of the interfaces between the metal oxide and metal substrates. Such studies could correlate the findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a deeper understanding of the role of interface confinement in stabilizing coordinatively unsaturated ferrous centers and enhancing catalytic activity. This would contribute to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in fuel cell technology and other chemical processes requiring selective CO oxidation.
