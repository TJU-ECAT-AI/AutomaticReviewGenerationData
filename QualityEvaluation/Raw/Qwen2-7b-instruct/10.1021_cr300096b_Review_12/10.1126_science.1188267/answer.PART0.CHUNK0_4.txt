<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15).</p>
<p>In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6).</p>
<p>Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7).</p>
<p>However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix.</p>
<p>The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8).</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>
<p>Construction of FeO nanoislands on the metal support was done by depositing Fe on Pt(111) under oxidizing conditions and characterized by an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) multi-probe surface system (10).</p>
<p>On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ratio of O/Fe XPS signals decreases monotonically as the SPD increases. This means that the oxygen deficiency mainly occurs at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands, and the corresponding ferrous Fe atoms there are coordinatively unsaturated (denoted as FeO1-x/Pt(111), x < 1).</p>
<p>The adsorption energy for the dissociated O atoms at the CUF sites is 1.10 eV/O. Compared with oxygen atoms adsorbed on metallic Fe or inside a 2D FeO overlayer with energy of 3.0 eV, which was too strong to be reactive, the bonding strength for O atoms at the CUF sites is optimum and would make these sites active.</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning. Indeed, our calculations show that on 0.67-ML CO precovered Pt(111), dissociative adsorption of H2 becomes endothermic. Meanwhile, dissociative adsorption of H2 on FeO at RT is difficult, too (21, 22).</p>
<p>For the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off. In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT. At 353 K, the catalysts have 95% CO conversion and 95% selectivity, which remain high.</p>
<p>We measured the oxidation state of the Fe species under reaction conditions using in situ x-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAFS) performed in the beamline of BL14W1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (fig. S11).</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They achieve this by creating active sites that are coordinatively unsaturated ferrous centers, which are highly reactive for oxygen activation and CO oxidation. The Pt-Fe catalysts, in particular, show remarkable activity and stability under realistic conditions, including PEMFC working conditions, with high CO conversion rates and selectivity at temperatures as low as 200 K. The presence of ferrous species on the surface of the Pt-Fe catalysts, identified through XAFS measurements, confirms the high reactivity of these sites.

2. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these catalysts by allowing detailed examination of the interfaces between the metal oxide and metal substrates. Such studies could correlate the findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a deeper understanding of the role of interface confinement in stabilizing coordinatively unsaturated ferrous centers and enhancing catalytic activity. This would contribute to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in fuel cell technology and other chemical processes requiring selective CO oxidation.
