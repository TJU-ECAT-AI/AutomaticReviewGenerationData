The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum (Pt), exhibit enhanced efficiency in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts maintain high activity and stability under realistic operating conditions, such as those found in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The presence of coordinately unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the interface between Pt and metal substrates enables efficient activation of oxygen, leading to the production of reactive dissociated oxygen atoms. The Pt-Fe catalysts demonstrate excellent stability, with no observed decline in performance over 40 hours at room temperature. The use of slight excess oxygen allows for the complete removal of CO to levels below 1 part per million. This demonstrates the practical application of these catalysts in industrial settings. The concept of interface confinement offers a promising and efficient approach to designing active sites for nanocatalysts across various heterogeneous systems.
