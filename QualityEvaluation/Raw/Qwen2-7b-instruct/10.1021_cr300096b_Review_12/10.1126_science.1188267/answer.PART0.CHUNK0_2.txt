<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15).</p>
<p>In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6).</p>
<p>Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7).</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>
<p>Construction of FeO nanoislands on the metal support was done by depositing Fe on Pt(111) under oxidizing conditions and characterized by an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) multi-probe surface system (10).</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To investigate the reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, we first presaturated the samples with CO. Afterward, a steady-state flux of O2 at nominally 5.2 × 108 mbar was leaked into the chamber at RT. The removal of CO was studied by monitoring the variation of the characteristic in situ UPS peaks at a BE of 9.4 eV from 5σ and 1π states of adsorbed CO (14).</p>
<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The reactivities of metallic Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and Pt(111) with subsurface Fe were lowered too (fig. S4).</p>
<p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in order to reveal the origin of the high reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces (10).</p>
<p>Adsorption energy for the dissociated O atoms at the CUF sites is 1.10 eV/O. Compared with oxygen atoms adsorbed on metallic Fe or inside a 2D FeO overlayer with energy of 3.0 eV, which was too strong to be reactive, the bonding strength for O atoms at the CUF sites is optimum and would make these sites active.</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning.</p>
<p>CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The corresponding activity and selectivity were measured from the temperature-dependent reaction profiles (Fig. 3, C and D).</p>
<p>For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system. We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst (fig. S15).</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in enhancing the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They exhibit high activity and stability under realistic conditions, making them suitable for industrial applications. The Pt-Fe catalysts, for instance, demonstrate exceptional performance in CO oxidation, achieving nearly 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature (RT). This is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the interface between the FeO nanoislands and Pt surface, which are highly reactive for oxygen activation, producing dissociated oxygen atoms. These CUF sites, along with the Pt atoms, form the active centers for CO oxidation. 

When tested under PEMFC conditions, the Pt-Fe catalysts maintain their stability and show good performance, with 92% CO selectivity/conversion at 353 K. By employing a slight excess of oxygen, CO can be removed to levels below 1 part per million. The use of these catalysts in a 1-kW PEMFC working system results in stable cell performance after a 930-hour test. However, the performance quickly degrades after a 30-minute test without the Pt-Fe catalyst, indicating their crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of the fuel cell.

Future studies using UHV techniques can correlate the findings obtained from model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the detailed mechanisms and interactions involved. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces highlight the need for advanced methodologies to explore the surface chemistry and dynamics of these materials, potentially leading to the development of even more efficient catalysts. These insights could guide the design of new catalysts with improved activity and stability, expanding the applicability of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts across various industrial processes.

在反应器研究中，特别是CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转换，双金属催化剂尤其是Pt基催化剂在机制和效率方面发挥了关键作用。它们在实际条件下表现出高活性和稳定性，适合工业应用。例如，Pt-Fe催化剂在室温下实现几乎100%的CO转化率和选择性，这归功于FeO纳米岛与Pt表面界面处存在的协调不饱和铁（CUF）位点的高度活性，这些位点能够促进氧气激活，产生解离的氧原子。这些CUF位点与Pt原子共同形成CO氧化的活性中心。

在质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）条件下测试时，Pt-Fe催化剂保持稳定，并显示出良好的性能，353K时CO选择性和转化率达到92%。通过使用略多的氧气，CO可以去除至低于百万分之一的水平。将这些催化剂集成到1kW PEMFC工作系统中后，发现电池性能在930小时测试后保持稳定，但在没有使用Pt-Fe催化剂的30分钟测试后迅速失效，表明其在维持燃料电池效率中的关键作用。

未来使用超高真空技术进行的研究可以将模型表面和支撑催化剂的发现联系起来，提供有关涉及机制和相互作用的详细信息。当前对基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究的限制强调了需要高级方法来探索这些材料的表面化学和动力学，以潜在地开发更高效的催化剂。这些见解可以指导设计具有改进活性和稳定性的新催化剂，扩大Pt基双金属催化剂在各种工业过程中的应用范围。
