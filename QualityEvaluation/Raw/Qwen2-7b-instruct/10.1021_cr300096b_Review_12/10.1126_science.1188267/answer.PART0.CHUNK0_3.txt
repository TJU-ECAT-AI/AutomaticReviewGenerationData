<p>Many catalysts in solution, such as metalloenzymes and homogeneous metal complexes, create active sites where the metal ion is available to bind and activate reactants. Such coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites, or CUFs, have been created in a supported heterogeneous catalyst by Fu et al. (p. 1141).</p>
<p>Ferrous oxide islands grown on platinum single-crystal surfaces were much more reactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures than more oxidized ferric islands.</p>
<p>Coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites confined in nanosized matrices are active centers in a wide range of enzyme and homogeneous catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above.</p>
<p>Preparation of an analogous ensemble at supported heterogeneous catalysts, which account for 80% of the catalytic processes in industrial chemistry, is of great importance.</p>
<p>The interface-confined CUF sites and neighboring Pt atoms are identified conclusively as the active centers to activate O2.</p>
<p>Catalytic reaction experiments on the supported Pt-Fe catalysts prepared by a dedicated and reproducible synthesis method show that the identified ensemble is highly active, selective, and robust for CO oxidation, even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning.</p>
<p>CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT.</p>
<p>Even at 200 K, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts maintain 20% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity.</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle.</p>
<p>This shows the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, the highly active Pt-Fe NPs in the CO PROX reaction should comprise Pt-rich core and ferrous species on the surfaces, restoring the characteristics of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) model system.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT.</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation by creating active sites where ferrous (CUF) sites are confined within a matrix. These sites are reactive at low temperatures and enable the activation of oxygen, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms. The Pt-Fe catalysts demonstrate high activity, selectivity, and robustness in CO oxidation under typical PEMFC conditions.

2. The Pt-Fe catalysts show superior CO oxidation performance compared to Pt catalysts alone, achieving almost 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature. They maintain significant CO conversion rates even at lower temperatures, indicating enhanced stability and activity.

3. The presence of ferrous species on the surfaces of the Pt-Fe catalysts, as confirmed by XAFS analysis, restores the characteristics of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) model system, contributing to the catalyst's high reactivity and stability.

4. The Pt-Fe catalysts exhibit remarkable stability, retaining their performance over prolonged periods under PEMFC conditions. They can remove CO to levels below 1 ppm, demonstrating their effectiveness in practical applications.

5. The concept of interface confinement and fabrication of coordinately unsaturated low-valent cations, as exemplified by the Pt-Fe catalysts, holds promise for designing active sites for nanocatalysts in various heterogeneous oxides-metal catalytic systems.

1. Pt基双金属催化剂通过在矩阵中创建含铁（CUF）位点，增强了CO氧化效率。这些位点在低温下活性高，能够激活氧，产生活泼的氧原子。Pt-Fe催化剂在典型PEMFC条件下表现出高度的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2.Pt-Fe催化剂与仅含Pt催化剂相比，在室温下展现出显著的CO氧化性能优势，实现几乎100%的CO转化率和选择性。即使在较低温度下，它们也能保持较高的CO转化率，表明了增强的稳定性和活性。

3.XAFS分析证实了Pt-Fe催化剂表面存在的铁物种，恢复了FeO1-x/Pt(111)模型系统的特性，这为催化剂的高反应性和稳定性作出了贡献。

4.Pt-Fe催化剂展现出卓越的稳定性，长期在PEMFC条件下运行时，其性能未见衰减。它们能够将CO去除至低于1 ppm的水平，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

5.界面限制和构建低价态配合物的概念，如在Pt-Fe催化剂中体现的那样，为设计各种异质氧化物-金属催化系统中的活性位点提供了有前景的方法。
