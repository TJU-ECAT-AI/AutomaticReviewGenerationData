<p>The results of the chemical analyses of the catalysts show that the experimental and theoretical values of Ni and Pt agree and are close to those of the 1 wt% monometallic and bimetallic series.</p>
<p>The textural values appear are much higher than those found for the protonic non-dealuminated FAU type Y and BEA supports, respectively 610 and 587 m2 g1. Additionally, it can be noted that mesopores are formed on both HY and Hβ dealuminated supports, which is presumably related to a secondary system formed upon dealumination. This can explain the higher values of the textural parameters of the dealuminated zeolites, as compared to the non-dealuminated solids.</p>
<p>It is noted that PtC displayed behaviour similar to Ptβ; however, after 500 min of reaction, the conversion of the Pt/active carbon dropped because of the consumption of the support by CO2 [8] ,[17] . In case of NiPtβ, the activity was stabilized in 2.5 mol h1 gmetal1, after 2 h of reaction. Thus, among the solids studied, Ptβ is the most active catalyst for the dry reforming of methane.</p>
<p>The extension of dealumination, i.e., the impregnation of metals on the dealuminated zeolites followed by calcination, results in an increase of the Si/Al ratio mainly on bimetallic NiPtβ and NiPtY; it in turn influences the strength of the acid sites of these solids. The influence of the high acidity of FAU type Y zeolite is also clearly noted on the NiY and PtY samples.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the case of bimetallic catalysts, the particles are larger in size compared to the pores of zeolite BEA (5.2 Å × 7.2 Å and 6.5 Å × 5.6 Å) and FAU type Y (7.5 Å) supports. From these results, it can be concluded that platinum and nickel are partially located outside the zeolite particles and form relatively large clusters. This may indicate a thermal mobility during the reforming of methane with CO2, and thus these particles may be located mainly outside the pores.</p>
<p>No peaks corresponding to PtOx or NiO oxides were found in the fresh or spent catalysts used in the CO2 reforming of methane, suggesting that there is no migration/sintering of the particles to the solid surface after the catalyst test.</p>

[1] "The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids. Activity results on the bimetallic NiPt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits."
[2] "In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers. Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, showed improved performance in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The key mechanism involves the favorable adsorption of CO2 on the Ni site in the presence of Pt, which facilitates the reaction with the surface filamentous carbon deposits. This leads to more efficient utilization of CO2 and higher conversion rates of methane. The high acidity of the FAU type Y support resulted in the formation of difficult-to-eliminate carbon whiskers, which hindered the catalytic activity. On the other hand, Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers demonstrated superior activity and stability due to their high resistance to coking. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the catalytic processes.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

在反应器研究中，特别是基于Pt的双金属催化剂，在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面表现出改进的性能。关键机制涉及在Pt存在的条件下，Ni位点对CO2的有利吸附，这促进了与表面纤维状碳沉积物的反应。这导致更有效的CO2利用和更高的甲烷转化率。FAU型Y支持的高酸性导致难以去除的碳针状物的形成，这阻碍了催化活性。另一方面，含Pt的BEA沸石载体由于其对结焦的高抵抗力而显示出优越的活性和稳定性。未来的UHV研究可能能够将这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂相关联，提供更深入的机制洞察，揭示催化过程的本质。

1. Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts, with NiPtY and NiPtβ activities being 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively, compared to PtY and Ptβ activities near 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively. 

2. The catalytic performance in CO2 reforming of methane was better for bimetallic NiPt systems than for PtY monometallic catalysts. This was due to the favorable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacted with the surface filamentous carbon deposits.

3. BEA support provided better catalytic activity with higher accessibility and stability, resulting in superior activity in the dry reforming of methane compared to FAU type Y support. This was attributed to the high resistance of BEA to coking and the high stability of Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers against carbon deposition.

1. NiPt/沸石双金属催化剂的活性低于仅含铂的沸石催化剂，NiPtY和NiPtβ的活性分别为1.70和1.90 g金属1小时，而PtY和Ptβ的活性接近2.0和3.20 g金属1小时。

2. 在二氧化碳重整甲烷反应中，双金属NiPt系统的催化性能优于仅含铂的PtY催化剂。这是由于相邻的Ni位点（与Pt一起）对CO2的良好吸附，它与表面的纤维状无定形碳沉积物反应。

3. BEA载体提供了更好的催化活性，具有更高的可接近性和稳定性，导致在甲烷重整反应中比FAU型Y载体有更优的活性。这归因于BEA对积碳的高抵抗力和Pt含BEA载体对碳沉积的高稳定性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, improve the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Platinum exposure facilitates nickel redispersion, enhancing its reactivity and activity. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into how these findings correlate with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces face limitations, primarily due to the inability to accurately replicate industrial-scale conditions and the complexity of studying surface interactions at the atomic level. The high acidity of FAU type Y zeolites leads to the formation of difficult-to-eliminate carbon whiskers, affecting catalyst stability and efficiency. In contrast, BEA zeolites offer better catalytic activity due to their improved accessibility and stability, especially when used with platinum. These insights suggest that the choice of zeolite type and metal combination significantly impacts catalyst performance in CO2 reforming reactions. Future research could focus on optimizing these conditions to enhance efficiency and stability in industrial applications.

<i>Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane</i>...The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively). NiY and Niβ were practically inactive, which could be attributed to the formation of deactivating whisker-like carbon deposits (approximately 60 wt%) on the metal particles, combined with the high acidity of the support, which was measured by FT-IR analysis. In the case of Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite, it produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2. Dealuminated BEA zeolite appeared to be a promising candidate for dry reforming of methane application due to its high stability and selectivity during 24 h of time on stream, in comparison with alumina (activity = 0.90 mol gmetal1 h1), active carbon (activity = 2.30 gmetal1 h1), and other zeolites.</quotes>

Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity compared to monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts in the dry reforming of methane. The inactivity of NiY and Niβ catalysts can be attributed to the formation of deactivating carbon deposits, while Pt on BEA zeolite had lower carbon deposition and was easily removed by CO2. Dealuminated BEA zeolite was found to be a promising candidate for this application due to its high stability and selectivity.

双金属NiPt/沸石催化剂在甲烷干重整中的活性低于单金属Pt/沸石催化剂。NiY和Niβ催化剂的无活性可以归因于形成失活碳沉积物，而Pt在BEA沸石上的碳沉积量较低，并且可以通过CO2轻松去除。去铝化BEA沸石被证明是这一应用的有希望的候选者，因为它具有高稳定性和选择性。

<i>Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane</i>...Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Although the methane conversion process has been studied for over 100 years, beginning with Fischer and Tropsch, the biggest obstacle preventing commercialization of these processes is their endothermic nature, which requires high temperatures to obtain high conversion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] .
