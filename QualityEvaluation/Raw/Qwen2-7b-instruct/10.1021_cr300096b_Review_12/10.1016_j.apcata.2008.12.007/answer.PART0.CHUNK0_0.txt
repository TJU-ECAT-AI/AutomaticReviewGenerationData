<p>The results of the chemical analyses of the catalysts show that the experimental and theoretical values of Ni and Pt agree and are close to those of the 1 wt% monometallic and bimetallic series.</p>
<p>The textural values appear are much higher than those found for the protonic non-dealuminated FAU type Y and BEA supports, respectively 610 and 587 m2 g1. Additionally, it can be noted that mesopores are formed on both HY and Hβ dealuminated supports, which is presumably related to a secondary system formed upon dealumination. This can explain the higher values of the textural parameters of the dealuminated zeolites, as compared to the non-dealuminated solids.</p>
<p>It is noted that PtC displayed behaviour similar to Ptβ; however, after 500 min of reaction, the conversion of the Pt/active carbon dropped because of the consumption of the support by CO2 [8] ,[17] . In case of NiPtβ, the activity was stabilized in 2.5 mol h1 gmetal1, after 2 h of reaction. Thus, among the solids studied, Ptβ is the most active catalyst for the dry reforming of methane.</p>
<p>The extension of dealumination, i.e., the impregnation of metals on the dealuminated zeolites followed by calcination, results in an increase of the Si/Al ratio mainly on bimetallic NiPtβ and NiPtY; it in turn influences the strength of the acid sites of these solids. The influence of the high acidity of FAU type Y zeolite is also clearly noted on the NiY and PtY samples.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the case of bimetallic catalysts, the particles are larger in size compared to the pores of zeolite BEA (5.2 Å × 7.2 Å and 6.5 Å × 5.6 Å) and FAU type Y (7.5 Å) supports. From these results, it can be concluded that platinum and nickel are partially located outside the zeolite particles and form relatively large clusters. This may indicate a thermal mobility during the reforming of methane with CO2, and thus these particles may be located mainly outside the pores.</p>
<p>No peaks corresponding to PtOx or NiO oxides were found in the fresh or spent catalysts used in the CO2 reforming of methane, suggesting that there is no migration/sintering of the particles to the solid surface after the catalyst test.</p>
