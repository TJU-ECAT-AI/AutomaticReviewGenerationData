[1] "The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids. Activity results on the bimetallic NiPt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits."
[2] "In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers. Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking."

The bimetallic catalysts, particularly those based on Pt, showed improved performance in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The key mechanism involves the favorable adsorption of CO2 on the Ni site in the presence of Pt, which facilitates the reaction with the surface filamentous carbon deposits. This leads to more efficient utilization of CO2 and higher conversion rates of methane. The high acidity of the FAU type Y support resulted in the formation of difficult-to-eliminate carbon whiskers, which hindered the catalytic activity. On the other hand, Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers demonstrated superior activity and stability due to their high resistance to coking. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the catalytic processes.

在反应器研究中，特别是基于Pt的双金属催化剂，在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面表现出改进的性能。关键机制涉及在Pt存在的条件下，Ni位点对CO2的有利吸附，这促进了与表面纤维状碳沉积物的反应。这导致更有效的CO2利用和更高的甲烷转化率。FAU型Y支持的高酸性导致难以去除的碳针状物的形成，这阻碍了催化活性。另一方面，含Pt的BEA沸石载体由于其对结焦的高抵抗力而显示出优越的活性和稳定性。未来的UHV研究可能能够将这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂相关联，提供更深入的机制洞察，揭示催化过程的本质。
