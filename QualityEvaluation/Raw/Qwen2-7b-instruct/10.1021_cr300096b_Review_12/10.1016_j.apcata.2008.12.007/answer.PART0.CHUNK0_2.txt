[1] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[2] "The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids. Activity results on the bimetallic NiPt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits."

[3] "The improvement of the accessibility as well as the high stability of the BEA support gave better catalytic activity when using this solid. In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers. Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking."

1. Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts, with NiPtY and NiPtβ activities being 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively, compared to PtY and Ptβ activities near 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively. 

2. The catalytic performance in CO2 reforming of methane was better for bimetallic NiPt systems than for PtY monometallic catalysts. This was due to the favorable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacted with the surface filamentous carbon deposits.

3. BEA support provided better catalytic activity with higher accessibility and stability, resulting in superior activity in the dry reforming of methane compared to FAU type Y support. This was attributed to the high resistance of BEA to coking and the high stability of Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers against carbon deposition.

1. NiPt/沸石双金属催化剂的活性低于仅含铂的沸石催化剂，NiPtY和NiPtβ的活性分别为1.70和1.90 g金属1小时，而PtY和Ptβ的活性接近2.0和3.20 g金属1小时。

2. 在二氧化碳重整甲烷反应中，双金属NiPt系统的催化性能优于仅含铂的PtY催化剂。这是由于相邻的Ni位点（与Pt一起）对CO2的良好吸附，它与表面的纤维状无定形碳沉积物反应。

3. BEA载体提供了更好的催化活性，具有更高的可接近性和稳定性，导致在甲烷重整反应中比FAU型Y载体有更优的活性。这归因于BEA对积碳的高抵抗力和Pt含BEA载体对碳沉积的高稳定性。
