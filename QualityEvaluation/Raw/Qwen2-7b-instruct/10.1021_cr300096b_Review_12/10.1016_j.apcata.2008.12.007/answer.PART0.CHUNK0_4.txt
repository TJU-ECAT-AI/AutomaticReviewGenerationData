<i>Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane</i>...The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively). NiY and Niβ were practically inactive, which could be attributed to the formation of deactivating whisker-like carbon deposits (approximately 60 wt%) on the metal particles, combined with the high acidity of the support, which was measured by FT-IR analysis. In the case of Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite, it produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2. Dealuminated BEA zeolite appeared to be a promising candidate for dry reforming of methane application due to its high stability and selectivity during 24 h of time on stream, in comparison with alumina (activity = 0.90 mol gmetal1 h1), active carbon (activity = 2.30 gmetal1 h1), and other zeolites.</quotes>

Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity compared to monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts in the dry reforming of methane. The inactivity of NiY and Niβ catalysts can be attributed to the formation of deactivating carbon deposits, while Pt on BEA zeolite had lower carbon deposition and was easily removed by CO2. Dealuminated BEA zeolite was found to be a promising candidate for this application due to its high stability and selectivity.

双金属NiPt/沸石催化剂在甲烷干重整中的活性低于单金属Pt/沸石催化剂。NiY和Niβ催化剂的无活性可以归因于形成失活碳沉积物，而Pt在BEA沸石上的碳沉积量较低，并且可以通过CO2轻松去除。去铝化BEA沸石被证明是这一应用的有希望的候选者，因为它具有高稳定性和选择性。

<i>Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane</i>...Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Although the methane conversion process has been studied for over 100 years, beginning with Fischer and Tropsch, the biggest obstacle preventing commercialization of these processes is their endothermic nature, which requires high temperatures to obtain high conversion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] .

Dry reforming of methane is a significant pathway for enhancing hydrogen production and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from CO2 and CH4. Despite a century of research, particularly since the work of Fischer and Tropsch, the main challenge to commercializing these processes is their endothermic nature, necessitating high temperatures for effective conversion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] .

<i>Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane</i>...The acidity of the fresh solids was also evaluated by TPD of ammonia and FT-IR measurements. The improvement of the accessibility with dealumination of the supports, as well as the high stability of the BEA zeolite support, generated high dispersion of the metals and improved catalytic activity of this solid. The FAU type Y supports show much more total acidity compared to that of BEA, which possess acid sites of medium strength. The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively).
