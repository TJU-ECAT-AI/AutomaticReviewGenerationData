[1] "In the case of PtY, the open type structure of the FAU type Y zeolite was expected to perform well; however, Pt can be located inside small cavities that are inaccessible by reactants, thus explaining the low conversion of methane on the PtY catalyst."
[2] "The extension of dealumination, i.e., the impregnation of metals on the dealuminated zeolites followed by calcination, results in an increase of the Si/Al ratio mainly on bimetallic NiPtβ and NiPtY; it in turn influences the strength of the acid sites of these solids."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum [5]."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, improve the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. Platinum exposure facilitates nickel redispersion, enhancing its reactivity and activity. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could provide insights into how these findings correlate with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces face limitations, primarily due to the inability to accurately replicate industrial-scale conditions and the complexity of studying surface interactions at the atomic level. The high acidity of FAU type Y zeolites leads to the formation of difficult-to-eliminate carbon whiskers, affecting catalyst stability and efficiency. In contrast, BEA zeolites offer better catalytic activity due to their improved accessibility and stability, especially when used with platinum. These insights suggest that the choice of zeolite type and metal combination significantly impacts catalyst performance in CO2 reforming reactions. Future research could focus on optimizing these conditions to enhance efficiency and stability in industrial applications.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中改善了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。铂的暴露促进了镍的再分散，提高了其活性和活动性。未来超高真空(UHV)研究可以提供关于模型表面和支持催化剂之间如何关联这些发现的信息。然而，目前对基于铂的双金属表面的研究存在局限性，主要是由于无法准确复制工业规模条件以及在原子水平上研究表面相互作用的复杂性。FAU型沸石的高酸性导致难以消除的碳须形成，影响了催化剂的稳定性和效率。相比之下，BEA沸石因其改进的可接近性和稳定性提供了更好的催化活性，尤其是在与铂一起使用时。这些见解表明，选择沸石类型和金属组合对CO2重整反应中的催化剂性能有重大影响。未来研究可以集中在优化这些条件以提高工业应用的效率和稳定性。
