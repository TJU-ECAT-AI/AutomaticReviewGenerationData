<p>It is well known that noble metals inhibit coke formation and the carbon obtained differs in nature from that formed over Ni catalysts. Moreover, it has been reported that a small amount of noble metals can promote the reducibility of the base metal, such as Ni, and stabilize its degree of reduction during the catalytic process.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by ME allowed reductions in the net carbon formation of 90 and 70% for the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the preparation of the catalysts by ME inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative content of active species and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve considerably the stability of the catalysts.</p>
<p>In the bimetallic PtNi catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO.</p>
<p>From activity tests it can be concluded that catalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method are less sensitive to coke deposition and more stable under CO2-reforming conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the metal dispersion and metals-support interaction are related to different aspects as the preparation procedure of the catalysts, the support employed and the catalytic pre-treatment.</p>

The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the use of the reverse microemulsion method enhance the catalyst's stability and selectivity toward H2 and CO production. The Pt-Ni interaction in bimetallic catalysts contributes to their stability. The reverse microemulsion method reduces carbon formation, promotes the presence of active species, and prevents metal sintering, thereby improving catalyst stability. Noble metals like Pt inhibit coke formation and stabilize the catalyst's performance during the catalytic process. The preparation method and choice of support affect the metal dispersion and interaction, impacting the catalyst's overall performance.
