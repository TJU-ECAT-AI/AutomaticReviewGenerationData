[1] "Catalytic reforming of methane with CO2 seems to be a promising technology to produce syngas, using two greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2)."
[2] "Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon which blocks catalyst pores and active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation."
[3] "It has been reported that carbon deposition depends on the catalyst surface structure. Thus, by controlling the size of the metal ensembles it is possible to control the carbon formation."
[4] "Preparing the catalysts by ME allows reductions in the net carbon formation of 90 and 70% for the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, respectively."
[5] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided."
[6] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

The addition of Pt and/or the preparation of catalysts using the reverse microemulsion method (ME) can significantly enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. By controlling the size and dispersion of the active species, the ME method facilitates a reduction in the net carbon formation, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity. This approach also prevents metal sintering and reduces the risk of carbon encapsulating the metal particles. As a result, the catalysts demonstrate superior stability, high selectivity towards hydrogen and carbon monoxide production, and low coke formation. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies can provide valuable insights into the correlation between these findings and model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

添加铂或使用逆微乳液方法（ME）制备催化剂可以显著提高CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的效率。通过控制活性物种的大小和分散性，ME方法可以有效减少净碳沉积，这对于保持催化剂活性至关重要。这种方法还可以防止金属团聚并降低碳包覆金属颗粒的风险。因此，这些催化剂表现出良好的稳定性、高选择性向氢气和一氧化碳生产，并且低焦炭形成。未来超高压真空（UHV）研究可以提供有关这些发现与模型表面和支持催化剂之间的相关性的有价值见解，尽管当前在UHV研究中对基于铂的双金属表面存在局限性。
