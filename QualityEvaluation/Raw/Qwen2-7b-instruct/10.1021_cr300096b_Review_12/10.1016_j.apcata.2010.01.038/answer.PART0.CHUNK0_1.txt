[1] "The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the preparation of the catalysts by ME inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative content of active species and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve considerably the stability of the catalysts."
[2] "The stability of the catalysts was improved when the catalysts were prepared by ME. The CO2 conversion loss was enhanced from 1.3% h1 to 0.4% h1 in the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, from 0.4% h1 to 0.08% h1 in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and from 0.08% h1 to zero loss in the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, the conversion values were lower than those of equilibrium. Additionally, the catalysts prepared by ME presented at 600 C lower conversion values than those obtained with the catalysts prepared by IM."
[4] "In spite of the fact that the carbon deposition observed in the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalyst was lower than in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalyst, its stability under DRM conditions was better."

The bimetallic catalysts, especially those based on Pt, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They inhibit global carbon formation, enhance the content of active species, prevent metal sintering, and significantly improve catalyst stability. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies could offer insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, current UHV limitations prevent a direct correlation. The addition of Pt and the use of the reverse microemulsion method result in systems with homogeneous and well-dispersed particles, leading to better performance under dynamic conditions. The stability improvement is evident, with the CO2 conversion loss reduced from 1.3% h−1 to 0.4% h−1 for 4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, from 0.4% h−1 to 0.08% h−1 for 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, and from 0.08% h−1 to no loss for 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Despite lower carbon deposition in 4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts compared to 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, the former exhibits better stability under dry reforming of methane (DRM) conditions. This suggests that catalyst deactivation is influenced not just by net carbon formation, but also by the interactions between metals, which affect metal distribution, particle size homogeneity, and the nature of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface.

铂基双金属催化剂在重整反应器研究中对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机制及效率产生了显著影响。它们抑制了全局碳沉积，提升了活性物种的相对含量，避免了金属熔融，并极大地提高了催化剂稳定性。未来超高真空（UHV）研究可能为模型表面和负载催化剂之间的联系提供见解。然而，当前的UHV限制阻止了直接联系。铂的添加和反微乳液方法的应用导致了均匀分散粒子系统的形成，这在动态条件下表现更好。稳定性得到了提高，CO2转化损失从1.3% h−1降低到0.4% h−1的4Ni/Al2O3催化剂，从0.4% h−1降低到0.08% h−1的0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3催化剂，以及从0.08% h−1降低到无损失的0.4Pt/Al2O3催化剂。尽管4Ni/Al2O3 ME催化剂的碳沉积量比0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME催化剂低，但前者在干重整（DRM）条件下的稳定性更好。这表明催化剂失活不仅取决于净碳沉积，还取决于金属间的相互作用，这些作用影响了金属分布、颗粒尺寸的均一性和催化表面碳沉积的性质。
