<p>It is well known that noble metals inhibit coke formation and the carbon obtained differs in nature from that formed over Ni catalysts. Moreover, it has been reported that a small amount of noble metals can promote the reducibility of the base metal, such as Ni, and stabilize its degree of reduction during the catalytic process.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by ME allowed reductions in the net carbon formation of 90 and 70% for the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the preparation of the catalysts by ME inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative content of active species and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve considerably the stability of the catalysts.</p>
<p>Increasing the Pt addition and the use of the reverse microemulsion method in the preparation of the catalysts allowed to obtain systems with homogeneous and well dispersed particles of Ni and/or Pt.</p>
<p>The selectivity values expressed as H2/CO ratios are shown in Fig. 9. It can be observed that all of the H2/CO ratios are lower than the equilibrium ones throughout the whole temperature range, being more notable at high temperature.</p>
<p>The stability of the catalysts was improved when the catalysts were prepared by ME. The CO2 conversion loss was enhanced from 1.3% h−1 to 0.4% h−1 in the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, from 0.4% h−1 to 0.08% h−1 in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and from 0.08% h−1 to zero loss in the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.</p>

1. The addition of noble metals, particularly platinum, inhibits coke formation and stabilizes the reduction of the base metal, nickel, during the catalytic process. This leads to a difference in the nature of the carbon produced compared to that from nickel-only catalysts.
2. Using the reverse microemulsion method (ME) significantly reduces the net carbon formation in catalysts, by 90% for the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME and 70% for the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME.
3. Platinum addition to nickel-based catalysts and the use of the ME method enhance the stability, reduce carbon formation, and promote the dispersion of active species.
4. The ME method allows for the creation of homogeneous and well-dispersed particles of nickel and/or platinum, improving catalyst performance.
5. The H2/CO selectivity ratios in the catalysts are consistently below equilibrium levels across all temperatures, showing notable differences at higher temperatures.
6. Catalyst stability is notably improved by using the ME method. The CO2 conversion loss decreases from 1.3% per hour to 0.4% per hour for 4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, to 0.08% per hour for 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, and to zero loss for 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.

1. 添加贵金属，特别是铂金，可以抑制焦炭形成，并稳定基质金属镍的还原过程。这导致产生的碳与仅使用镍催化剂时产生的碳性质不同。
2. 使用微乳液反转方法（ME）显著减少了催化剂中的净碳形成，对于4Ni/Al2O3 ME为90%，对于0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME为70%。
3. 在镍基催化剂中添加铂金以及使用ME方法可以增强稳定性，减少碳形成并促进活性物种的分布。
4. 使用ME方法可以创造出均匀分散的镍和/或铂颗粒，改善催化剂性能。
5. 催化剂的H2/CO选择性比率始终低于平衡水平，在所有温度下均表现出明显差异，特别是在较高温度下更为显著。
6. 使用ME方法可以显着提高催化剂稳定性。对于4Ni/Al2O3催化剂，CO2转化损失从每小时1.3%降低到每小时0.4%，对于0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3催化剂从每小时0.4%降低到每小时0.08%，对于0.4Pt/Al2O3催化剂则完全无损失。
