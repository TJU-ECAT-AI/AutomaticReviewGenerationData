<p>The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the preparation of the catalysts by ME inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative content of active species and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve considerably the stability of the catalysts.</p>
<p>Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure.</p>

The bimetallic Pt-based catalysts enhance the stability and efficiency of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. They control the particle size and dispersion of active species, reduce metal sintering, and prevent carbon encapsulation, leading to improved selectivity towards H2/CO and reduced coke formation. Future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, despite current limitations in UHV studies. The Pt addition and the use of the reverse microemulsion method (ME) contribute to better control of the particle size, promoting active species and enhancing the stability of the catalysts.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中提高了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的稳定性和效率。它们控制活性物种的颗粒大小和分散性，减少金属团聚，并防止碳封装，导致H2/CO选择性提高和焦炭生成减少。未来在超高真空(UHV)下对铂基双金属表面的研究可以为与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性提供见解，尽管当前UHV研究存在局限性。铂添加和使用逆微乳液法(ME)有助于更好地控制颗粒尺寸，促进活性物种并增强催化剂稳定性。
