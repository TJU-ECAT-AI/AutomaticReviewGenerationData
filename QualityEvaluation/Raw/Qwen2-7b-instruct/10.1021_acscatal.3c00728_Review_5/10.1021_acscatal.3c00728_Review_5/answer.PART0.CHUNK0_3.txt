4. Conclusion and Future Direction

It was recognized that the catalytic mechanisms on the potential active sites of tricoordination B species with different dimensional geometric configurations deepened the understanding of B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provided effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.

Currently, although methods to construct different configurations of active sites have been well developed, some technical problems still exist that restrict the further development of B-based catalysts: (1) Like most alkane-selective oxygenation reactions, the conversionselectivity trade-off relationship significantly limits the yield of propene and olefin products in the ODHP reaction. Innovations in the catalytic systems and theories are highly desirable to address the limitation. (2) The enhancement of radical initiation ability on tricoordinated B active sites is still limited, especially the initiation at low temperatures. (3) The role of B-based catalysts in the termination of active radicals may also have a strong influence on the reaction kinetics, which should be studied in detail using experimental and theoretical methods. (4) A lack of systematic understanding of the initiation and mechanism of gas radical reaction processes exists. (5) The stability of B-based catalyst and its ability to inhibit boric acid leaching need to be further improved. (6) Modifying the catalyst and enhancing the hydrophobicity of B-based catalyst may also be a potential solution to this issue.

The systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances our understanding of catalytic processes by focusing on the multi-dimensional design of active sites and analysis of surface and gas-phase reaction mechanisms. This understanding provides effective guidance for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future. However, several technical challenges remain, including the conversion-selectivity trade-off, limitations in radical initiation ability, influence of catalysts on radical termination, lack of systematic understanding of gas radical reaction processes, and the stability and inhibition of boric acid leaching. Addressing these issues through innovations in catalytic systems, theories, and catalyst modifications holds promise for advancing the performance of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.
