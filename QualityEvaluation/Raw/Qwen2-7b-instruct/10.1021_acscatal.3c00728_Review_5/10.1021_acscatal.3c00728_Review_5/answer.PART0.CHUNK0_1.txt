4. Conclusion and Future Direction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In this paper, the design and construction of B active sites in different dimensions were systematically summarized. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of the surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the process of ODHP over B-based catalysts were discussed.
Currently, although methods to construct different configurations of active sites have been well developed, some technical problems still exist that restrict the further development of B-based catalysts: (1) ... (4) The mechanism of the surface reaction is relatively clear, but the understanding of the reaction mechanism of gas-phase radicals and the influence of the size and geometry of the confinement space on the catalytic performances is still insufficient. On one hand, the gas-phase radical process is beneficial for controlling the distribution of carbon products leading to the byproducts enriched to the olefin. On the other hand, the radical reactions may also contribute to CC cleavage and the formation of COx.
Finally, with the achievements obtained in both catalytic performances and mechanistic understandings, the B-based catalysts have demonstrated significant potential in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane. As a reaction dominated by the radical pathway, the spatial configuration and dispersion of the active sites and synergism of the surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions are highly important for catalyst design and performance optimization. Studies on these important problems in the future will promote the catalytic performances of B-based materials and open up new opportunities for the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques for the production of low olefins.

The systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), including the multi-dimensional design of active sites and analysis of surface and gas-phase reaction mechanisms, enhances our understanding of catalytic processes by elucidating the role of active sites' configuration, dispersion, and the synergism between surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions. This understanding provides effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future. Key challenges include improving the trade-off between conversion and selectivity, enhancing the radical initiation ability, studying the role of B-based catalysts in radical termination, understanding the gas-phase radical reactions, and improving catalyst stability and hydrophobicity to prevent boric acid leaching.

The implications for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts involve addressing limitations in catalyst systems and theories to optimize performance, exploring strategies for reducing working temperatures, studying the influence of confinement space on radical reactions, enhancing the stability of B-based catalysts, and preventing boric acid leaching. Future studies focusing on these aspects will improve the catalytic performance of B-based materials and facilitate the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques for producing low olefins.
