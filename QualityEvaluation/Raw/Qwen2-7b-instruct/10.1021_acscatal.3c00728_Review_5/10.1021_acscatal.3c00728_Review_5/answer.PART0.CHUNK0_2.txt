This paper provides insights into the systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It discusses the design and construction of various dimensional active sites, as well as the reaction mechanisms of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding enhances our knowledge of catalytic processes and guides the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future. Key challenges include improving the trade-off between conversion and selectivity, enhancing radical initiation at low temperatures, studying the role of B-based catalysts in radical termination, and exploring the size and geometry effects on radical reactions. Improving catalyst stability and hydrophobicity are also crucial. Future research on these areas will likely boost the performance of B-based catalysts and facilitate their practical use in producing low olefins through oxidative dehydrogenation techniques.
