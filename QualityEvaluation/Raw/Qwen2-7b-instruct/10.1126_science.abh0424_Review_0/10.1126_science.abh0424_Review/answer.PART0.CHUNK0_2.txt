The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions within one condition. This approach minimizes energy consumption and economic costs by combining multiple steps of reactions and separations. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 tandem catalyst presented by Yan et al. couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst are carefully designed to regulate the transport of key intermediates, ensuring efficient reaction sequences. This method has significant implications for energy efficiency and process optimization, particularly in emerging chemical industries. It facilitates the on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane, addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market. By overcoming thermodynamic limitations and avoiding the combustion of carbon species, tandem catalysis enables the catalytic dehydrogenation to proceed more efficiently, breaking thermodynamic barriers in non-oxidative catalytic reactions.
