The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions within one condition, which can lead to more efficient use of resources and reduced energy consumption. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. By doing so, it bridges the gap between fundamental research and industrial application, aiming to produce propylene directly from propane, thus addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market. This tandem catalyst operates under thermodynamic limitations by instantaneously removing H2, forcing the catalytic dehydrogenation process to progress, overcoming the restrictions posed by equilibrium and temperature-induced sintering and coking.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions within one condition. This approach minimizes energy consumption and economic costs by combining multiple steps of reactions and separations. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 tandem catalyst presented by Yan et al. couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst are carefully designed to regulate the transport of key intermediates, ensuring efficient reaction sequences. This method has significant implications for energy efficiency and process optimization, particularly in emerging chemical industries. It facilitates the on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane, addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market. By overcoming thermodynamic limitations and avoiding the combustion of carbon species, tandem catalysis enables the catalytic dehydrogenation to proceed more efficiently, breaking thermodynamic barriers in non-oxidative catalytic reactions.

Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions within one condition, which minimizes energy consumption and economic costs. This approach presents an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries. By designing tandem catalysts with different types of catalytic sites, researchers can control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products. This is crucial for mediating multiple reactions under the same condition. The proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst must be carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates, thus facilitating efficient and optimized processes.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, for example, couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, producing propylene as an important feedstock for polymers. This tandem catalysis with a porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, driving the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The relative location of the alumina-supported platinum and the indium oxide ceramic is essential for the tandem catalytic process, aiming to bridge the fundamental philosophy to industrial applications and fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market. By avoiding the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions, such as sintering and coking under high temperatures, this tandem catalysis enables the on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane, optimizing energy efficiency and process performance.
