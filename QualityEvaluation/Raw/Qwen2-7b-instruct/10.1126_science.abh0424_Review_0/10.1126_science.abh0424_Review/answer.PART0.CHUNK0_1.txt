1. Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions within one condition, which minimizes energy consumption and economic cost. This approach is particularly useful for emerging chemical industries. An example of this is the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, thereby controlling the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products.
2. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant, as tandem catalysis enables the direct production of propylene from propane, filling the supply-demand gap in the alkene market. This is achieved by overcoming thermodynamic limitations and sintering issues associated with high-temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes.

1. 纳米尺度下的串联催化通过允许在单一条件下进行一系列反应，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，从而降低了能耗和经济成本。这种方法特别适用于新兴化工行业。例如，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，控制反应序列和在反应物、中间体和产物共存条件下的选择性。
2. 对于能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是重大的，因为串联催化允许直接从丙烷生产丙烯，填补了烯烃市场的需求缺口。这通过克服高温催化脱氢过程中相关的热力学限制和结焦问题来实现。
