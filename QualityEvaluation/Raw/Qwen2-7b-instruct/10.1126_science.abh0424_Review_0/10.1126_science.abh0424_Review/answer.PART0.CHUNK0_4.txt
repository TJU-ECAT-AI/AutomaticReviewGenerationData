The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by sequentially controlling the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products. This is achieved by designing tandem catalysts with different types of catalytic sites where predetermined sequences of reactions occur. The proximity and hierarchy of these catalytic sites are carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. By promoting selective H2 combustion, it helps drive the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process forward, overcoming thermodynamic limitations and enhancing energy efficiency and process optimization.

The potential implications of tandem catalysis include efficient conversion of propane to propylene, filling the supply-demand gap in the alkene market, and breaking thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions through instant removal of H2.
