The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions within one condition, which can lead to more efficient use of resources and reduced energy consumption. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. By doing so, it bridges the gap between fundamental research and industrial application, aiming to produce propylene directly from propane, thus addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market. This tandem catalyst operates under thermodynamic limitations by instantaneously removing H2, forcing the catalytic dehydrogenation process to progress, overcoming the restrictions posed by equilibrium and temperature-induced sintering and coking.

纳米尺度上的串联催化方法通过在一个条件下实现多个反应步骤的串联，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，从而更高效地利用资源并减少能耗。以In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂为例，它将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合在一起。这一方法通过连接基础研究与工业应用，旨在直接从丙烷生产丙烯，解决烯烃市场供需缺口。该串联催化剂在热力学限制下运行，通过立即去除H2，迫使催化脱氢过程向前推进，克服了非氧化催化反应面临的限制，如平衡和高温导致的结焦和烧结。
