Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions within one condition, which minimizes energy consumption and economic costs. This approach presents an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries. By designing tandem catalysts with different types of catalytic sites, researchers can control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products. This is crucial for mediating multiple reactions under the same condition. The proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst must be carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates, thus facilitating efficient and optimized processes.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, for example, couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, producing propylene as an important feedstock for polymers. This tandem catalysis with a porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, driving the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The relative location of the alumina-supported platinum and the indium oxide ceramic is essential for the tandem catalytic process, aiming to bridge the fundamental philosophy to industrial applications and fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market. By avoiding the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions, such as sintering and coking under high temperatures, this tandem catalysis enables the on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane, optimizing energy efficiency and process performance.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过允许一个条件下的多个反应步骤的串联，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，从而在减少能耗和经济成本方面表现出优势。这一方法为新兴化工行业提供了一种有效方案。通过设计包含不同类型的催化位点的串联催化剂，研究人员可以控制反应序列和选择性，在反应物、中间体和产物共存的情况下。这对于在同一条件下调节多种反应至关重要。串联催化剂中催化位点的邻近性和层次结构必须精心构建，以调节关键中间体的运输，从而促进高效和优化的过程。

例如，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，产生作为聚合物原料的重要丙烯。这种具有多孔涂层结构的串联催化通过调节氢物种的运输并促进选择性H2燃烧，推动催化丙烷脱氢向前发展。铝氧化物支持的铂和铟氧化陶瓷的相对位置对于串联催化过程至关重要，旨在将基本哲学与工业应用相结合，并填补烯烃市场的需求缺口。通过避免非氧化性催化反应在高温下发生的热力学限制，如结块和烧结，这种串联催化使丙烷直接转化为丙烯的有目的生产成为可能，优化了能效和过程性能。
