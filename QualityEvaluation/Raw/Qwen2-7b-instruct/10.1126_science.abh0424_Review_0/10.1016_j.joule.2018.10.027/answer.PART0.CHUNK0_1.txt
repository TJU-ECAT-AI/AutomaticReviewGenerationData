[1] "In view of the thermodynamic stability and chemical inertness of CO2, the conversion of CO2 to fuel and value-added chemicals requires the input of considerable Gibbs free energy (the Gibbs formation energy)."
[2] "Recently, synthesis of methanol 11 ,12 ,13 ,14 ,15 ,16 ,17 ,18 ,19 and hydrocarbon 20 ,21 ,22 ,23 ,24 ,25 ,26 ,27 through hydrogenation of CO2 utilizing the renewable hydrogen has become feasible."
[3] "However, considering the sluggish reaction kinetics of the CO2 hydrogenation and deactivation by carbon deposition, efficient and robust catalysts are highly desired for this reaction."
[4] "A ZnZrO/ZSM-5 tandem catalyst composed of ZnZrO solid solution nanoparticles dispersed highly on the surface of H-ZSM-5 micrometer crystals, taking advantage of methanol synthesis on ZnZrO 43 and aromatization of methanol on H-ZSM-5."
[5] "The tandem catalysts show no obvious deactivation under reaction conditions for 100 hr ( Figure 7 A), and the stability is much higher than that of traditional MTA catalysts, most of which suffer from the fast deactivation."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale integrates multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst, addressing the challenges of energy efficiency and process optimization. By combining the functions of separate catalysts within a single system, tandem catalysis reduces the need for multiple reactors, streamlining the process and decreasing energy consumption. This integration also facilitates the sequential or simultaneous execution of reactions, allowing for better control over the conversion of reactants to products. In the case of the ZnZrO/ZSM-5 tandem catalyst, the system utilizes the synergistic properties of ZnZrO and H-ZSM-5 to efficiently convert CO2 to aromatics, demonstrating the potential for enhanced selectivity and stability in industrial applications. This approach could lead to more efficient and sustainable chemical manufacturing processes, particularly in the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2.
