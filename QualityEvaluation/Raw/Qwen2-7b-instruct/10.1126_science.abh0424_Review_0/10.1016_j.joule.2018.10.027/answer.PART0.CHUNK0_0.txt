[1] "Tandem catalyst ZnZrO/ZSM-5 favors the thermodynamic coupling between CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO and formation of aromatics over H-ZSM-5 through the transfer of CHxO intermediates from the surface of ZnZrO to the pore structure of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "We found that the H2O produced over ZnZrO through CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 in the reaction system can promote the formation of aromatics."
[3] "The presence of CO2 and H2O in H-ZSM-5 suppressed the production of polycyclic aromatics, resulting in excellent stability of the tandem catalyst, thus making this catalyst potentially feasible for application in industry."

1. Tandem catalysis facilitates the thermodynamic coupling between CO2 hydrogenation and aromatics formation through the transfer of CHxO intermediates. This process involves the generation of CHxO species on the surface of ZnZrO, their migration to the pore structure of H-ZSM-5, and their conversion into lower olefins and subsequently into aromatics. The presence of H2O produced through CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 in the reaction system further enhances the formation of aromatics by suppressing the production of polycyclic aromatics, which can cause deactivation of the catalyst.

2. The H2O produced over ZnZrO during CO2 hydrogenation and the CO2 present in the reaction system promote the formation of aromatics by facilitating the aromatization of lower olefins.

3. The tandem catalyst shows excellent stability due to the suppression of polycyclic aromatics' production. This stability makes the tandem catalyst suitable for industrial applications.

1. 前端催化剂ZnZrO/ZSM-5通过表面生成CHxO中间体并将其转移到H-ZSM-5的孔结构中，促进CO2氢化和芳烃形成之间的热力学耦合。这一过程涉及在ZnZrO表面上生成CHxO物种，它们迁移到H-ZSM-5的孔结构中，并转化为低烯烃，进而转化为芳烃。通过CO2氢化过程中在ZnZrO上产生的H2O和反应系统中的CO2，进一步促进了芳烃的形成，抑制了可能引起催化剂失活的多环芳烃的产生。

2. 在CO2氢化过程中在ZnZrO上产生的H2O和反应系统中的CO2促进芳烃的形成，通过促进低烯烃转化为芳烃。

3. 由于抑制了多环芳烃的产生，这种催化剂表现出优异的稳定性，这使得该串联催化剂适用于工业应用。
