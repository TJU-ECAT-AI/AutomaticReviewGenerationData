[1] "Tandem catalyst ZnZrO/ZSM-5 favors the thermodynamic coupling between CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO and formation of aromatics over H-ZSM-5 through the transfer of CHxO intermediates from the surface of ZnZrO to the pore structure of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "We found that the H2O produced over ZnZrO through CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 in the reaction system can promote the formation of aromatics."
[3] "The presence of CO2 and H2O in H-ZSM-5 suppressed the production of polycyclic aromatics, resulting in excellent stability of the tandem catalyst, thus making this catalyst potentially feasible for application in industry."

1. Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by facilitating the efficient transfer of intermediates between different catalyst components. In this case, the CHxO intermediates are transferred from the surface of ZnZrO to the pore structure of H-ZSM-5, enabling the thermodynamic coupling between CO2 hydrogenation and aromatics formation. This approach optimizes the energy efficiency and process flow, allowing for a more streamlined and productive synthesis.

2. The presence of H2O produced over ZnZrO and CO2 in the reaction system promotes the formation of aromatics by enhancing the conversion of lower olefins to aromatics. This is crucial for increasing the selectivity and efficiency of the tandem catalytic process.

3. The tandem catalyst shows excellent stability due to the suppression of polycyclic aromatic formation, which is a common cause of deactivation in zeolite catalysts. This stability ensures that the catalyst remains active over prolonged periods, making it suitable for industrial applications where continuous operation is required.

1. 纳米尺度上的串联催化通过促进不同催化剂组件之间的中间体高效转移，解决了整合多个反应步骤的挑战。在这种情况下，CHxO中间体从ZnZrO表面转移到H-ZSM-5的孔结构中，实现了CO2氢化和芳烃形成的热力学耦合。这种方法优化了能效和工艺流程，使合成过程更加流畅和高效。

2. 在反应系统中产生的ZnZrO上的水和CO2促进了芳烃的形成，通过增强低烯烃向芳烃的转化来提高芳烃的选择性和效率。这是增加串联催化过程选择性和效率的关键。

3. 由于抑制了多环芳烃的生成，串联催化剂表现出出色的稳定性，这是一类常见催化剂活性丧失的原因。这种稳定性确保催化剂在长时间连续运行时保持活性，使其适用于需要持续操作的工业应用。
