[1] "Tandem catalyst ZnZrO/ZSM-5 favors the thermodynamic coupling between CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO and formation of aromatics over H-ZSM-5 through the transfer of CHxO intermediates from the surface of ZnZrO to the pore structure of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "We found that the H2O produced over ZnZrO through CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 in the reaction system can promote the formation of aromatics."
[3] "The presence of CO2 and H2O in H-ZSM-5 suppressed the production of polycyclic aromatics, resulting in excellent stability of the tandem catalyst."

1. The tandem catalysis concept at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by facilitating the thermodynamic coupling between sequential reactions. This allows for the efficient transfer of intermediates from one catalyst to another, enhancing the overall process flow and energy efficiency. As an example, the CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO and subsequent aromatics formation over H-ZSM-5 occur through the transfer of CHxO intermediates, which improves the conversion of CO2 to aromatics.

2. The presence of water (H2O) produced during the CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO catalyst promotes the formation of aromatics. This is because water facilitates the conversion of lower olefins to aromatics, contributing to the selectivity of aromatics in the tandem catalytic process.

3. The combination of CO2 and H2O in the H-ZSM-5 catalyst effectively suppresses the production of polycyclic aromatics, which are known to cause deactivation in zeolite catalysts. This suppression leads to enhanced stability of the tandem catalyst, making it a potentially viable option for industrial applications.

1. 在纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过促进CO2氢化和H-ZSM-5上芳烃形成之间的热力学耦合，有效地整合了多个化学工程过程中的反应步骤。这一方法通过促进从一个催化剂到另一个催化剂的中间体转移，提高了整个过程的流畅性和能量效率。例如，在ZnZrO上进行CO2氢化，随后在H-ZSM-5上形成芳烃，通过表面ZnZrO向H-ZSM-5孔结构转移CHxO中间体，从而提高CO2转化为芳烃的转化率。

2. 水（H2O）在ZnZrO催化剂上产生的存在促进了芳烃的形成。这是因为水促进了较低烯烃向芳烃的转换，增加了串联催化过程中芳烃的选择性。

3. CO2和H2O在H-ZSM-5催化剂中的组合有效地抑制了多环芳烃的产生，这是已知导致沸石催化剂失活的主要原因。这种抑制导致串联催化剂的稳定性增强，使其在工业应用中具有潜在可行性。
