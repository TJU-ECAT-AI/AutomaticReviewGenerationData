The tandem catalysts demonstrate exceptional stability, showing no noticeable deactivation over a period of 100 hours under specified reaction conditions. The hydrogen species formed during the dehydrogenation process on the H-ZSM-5 catalyst can migrate to the interface and participate in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction on the surface of ZnZrO. Additionally, the presence of water, produced during the CO2 hydrogenation process on ZnZrO and CO2 in the reaction mixture, facilitates the formation of aromatics. This indicates that the tandem catalysts effectively couple CO2 hydrogenation with the formation of aromatics through the transfer of intermediate species between the two catalyst components.

串联催化剂在指定的反应条件下表现出极佳的稳定性，至少在100小时内没有明显的失活。在H-ZSM-5催化剂上进行脱氢生成的氢物种可以迁移到界面，并参与在ZnZrO表面的CO2氢化反应。此外，通过ZnZrO上的CO2氢化过程产生的水和反应混合物中的CO2促进了芳烃的形成。这表明串联催化剂通过在两个催化剂组件之间转移中间体有效地耦合了CO2氢化与芳烃的形成。
