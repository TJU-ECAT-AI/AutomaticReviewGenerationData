Tandem catalysis enables the coupling of multiple reactions in chemical processing, aiming to enhance efficiency and optimize the process. This involves precise control over reactive intermediates, as demonstrated by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which translates macroscopic engineering principles into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The overcoat exposes the platinum nanoparticles, facilitating the rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with high per-pass yields that surpass the PDH equilibrium, indicating the potential for improved chemical processing.

The use of Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5 allows for high rates of dehydrogenation of C3H8 with high selectivity for alkene products, and unprecedented stability of the catalyst. Staged introduction of O2 leads to selective combustion of H2, achieving 90% selectivity even when hydrocarbons dominate the reactant mixture. For C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at temperatures of 773 and 723 K, respectively, yields exceeding equilibrium by a factor of 1.6 were accomplished. These results surpass those obtained with a complex three-stage selective H2 combustion process, demonstrating the effectiveness of the staged O2 introduction method.
