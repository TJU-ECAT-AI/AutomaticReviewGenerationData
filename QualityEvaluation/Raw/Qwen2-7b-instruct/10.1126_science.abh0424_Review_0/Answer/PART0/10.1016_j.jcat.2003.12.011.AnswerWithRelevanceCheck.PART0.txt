         "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and staged O2 introduction for selective H2 removal"
         "These features markedly decrease process complexity and costs."
         "Staged O2 introduction led to the combustion of H2 with 90% selectivity on these catalysts, even when hydrocarbons were predominant components in reacting mixtures."
         "High C3H8 dehydrogenation rates with high alkene selectivities and yields and unprecedented catalyst stability were achieved using Pt clusters residing within shape-selective channels in Na-[Fe]ZSM5."

         The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing the unique properties of small metal clusters within protected channels of shape-selective zeolites. This allows for high turnover rates and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for alkanes like C3H8 and C2H6. By staging the introduction of O2, selective H2 removal can be achieved, enhancing alkene yields beyond equilibrium. This method reduces process complexity and costs compared to traditional multi-stage systems, optimizing energy efficiency and process integration.

         纳米尺度上的串联催化解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，通过利用形状选择性沸石中中小型金属簇的独特性质。这使得烷烃如C3H8和C2H6的脱氢反应具有极高的转化率和稳定性。通过分阶段引入氧气，可以选择性地去除氢气，从而超出平衡条件提高烯烃产率。与传统的多级系统相比，此方法降低了过程复杂性和成本，优化了能效和过程集成。

         "Staged O2 introduction led to the combustion of H2 with 90% selectivity on these catalysts, even when hydrocarbons were predominant components in reacting mixtures."
         "Alkene yields higher than equilibrium by a factor of 1.6 were achieved for C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at 773 and 723 K, respectively."
         "These enhancements are significantly higher than previously reported with a more complex three-stage selective H2 combustion scheme."

         The use of Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5 allows for high rates of dehydrogenation of C3H8 with high selectivity for alkene products, and unprecedented stability of the catalyst. Staged introduction of O2 leads to selective combustion of H2, achieving 90% selectivity even when hydrocarbons dominate the reactant mixture. For C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at temperatures of 773 and 723 K, respectively, yields exceeding equilibrium by a factor of 1.6 were accomplished. These results surpass those obtained with a complex three-stage selective H2 combustion process, demonstrating the effectiveness of the staged O2 introduction method.

         使用位于Na-[Fe]ZSM5中的Pt簇允许以高速率脱氢C3H8并获得高烯烃选择性和产率，以及催化剂的非凡稳定性。分阶段引入O2导致选择性燃烧H2，即使在反应混合物中碳氢化合物占主导地位时也能实现90%的选择性。对于在773和723 K温度下进行的C2H6和C3H8脱氢，分别实现了超过平衡状态的1.6倍产率。这些结果超越了使用复杂三段式选择性H2燃烧过程的结果，证明了分阶段引入O2方法的有效性。
