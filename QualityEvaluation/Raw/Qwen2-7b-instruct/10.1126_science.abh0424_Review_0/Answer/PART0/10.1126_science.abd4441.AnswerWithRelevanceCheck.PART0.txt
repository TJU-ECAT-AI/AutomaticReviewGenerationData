          [1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."
          [2] "This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation."
          [3] "The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium."
          [4] "Beyond the results shown here, we expect that further improvements and examples are possible from optimization of process conditions and independent tuning of the identity and amount of dehydrogenation and SHC sites."

          Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale integrates multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes, aiming to enhance energy efficiency and process optimization. This method enables precise control over reactive intermediates, allowing for the sequential execution of reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and selective hydrogen combustion. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates this by achieving high per-pass yields that surpass the equilibrium conversion of non-oxidative PDH, showcasing the potential for improved chemical processing. Further advancements are expected through optimizing process conditions and independently adjusting the functionality and location of dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion sites.
