The Star (UHDE) process is unique in that it will be implemented for the first time in two installations in the Middle East. The Oleflex process by UOP employs a distinct reactor design that includes fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. The Steam Active Reforming (STAR) process, developed by Uhde, features a reactor setup that is quite different from others. The Linde-BASF PDH process utilizes a PtSn catalyst supported on ZrO2 for the isothermal dehydrogenation of light paraffins at a temperature of 590 C.

Star（UHDE）过程将在中东两个安装中首次应用。UOP的Oleflex过程采用了一种不同的反应器设计，包括流化床反应器、催化剂再生单元和产品回收部分。Uhde开发的蒸汽活性重整（STAR）过程具有与其它不同的反应器设置。Linde-BASF PDH过程利用了ZrO2支持的PtSn催化剂进行590°C的等温烷烃脱氢。
