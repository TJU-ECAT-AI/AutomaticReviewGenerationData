Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining several reactions into a single catalyst particle. This approach minimizes the need for separate reactors and stream separations, thereby reducing energy losses associated with transporting reactants and products. As an example, the integration of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion on an In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst could enhance energy efficiency and process optimization. By coupling these two reactions, the catalyst could simultaneously produce olefins and utilize the generated H2 for further reactions, creating a more streamlined and efficient process.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过将多个反应步骤整合到一个催化剂粒子中，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个步骤的挑战。这种方法减少了单独反应器和流体分离的需求，从而降低了运输反应物和产物时的能量损失。例如，在In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂上耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，可以提高能量效率和过程优化。通过结合这两个反应，该催化剂可以同时产生烯烃并利用生成的H2进行进一步反应，形成更流畅和高效的过程。
