[1] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[2] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[5] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
[6] "As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe."
[7] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[8] "A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromiaalumina catalyst."
[9] "Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (1530 min being needed for one full cycle)."
[10] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[11] "Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity."
[12] "The fact that activity and Cr loading hold an almost linear relationship below monolayer coverage suggests that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active."
[13] "It is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."
[14] "Indeed, experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (1040 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[15] "It is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[16] "Interestingly, increasing the pretreatment temperature of the alumina support has a positive effect on the TOF shown by the resulting catalyst, which has been attributed to an increase in the number of multinuclear Cr3+ sites."
[17] "However, Al2O3 can catalyze cracking and coking due to its surface acidity, which leads to a drop in both activity and selectivity."
[18] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[19] "Indeed, the use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[20] "Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time."
[21] "In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."
[22] "For these materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. According to some authors, this indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen."
