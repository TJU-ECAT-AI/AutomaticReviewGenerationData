[1] "Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Light Alkanes on Metals and Metal Oxides"
[2] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[3] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[4] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents."
[5] "Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1)."

Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale integrates multiple reaction steps, addressing challenges in chemical engineering processes by enhancing energy efficiency and optimizing processes. This approach allows for the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion on an In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The high reactivity of step sites on the catalyst surface enables the efficient conversion of propane to propylene, while the selective H2 combustion enhances the overall energy efficiency and process optimization. This demonstrates the potential implications of tandem catalysis for improving the economics and sustainability of chemical production processes.
