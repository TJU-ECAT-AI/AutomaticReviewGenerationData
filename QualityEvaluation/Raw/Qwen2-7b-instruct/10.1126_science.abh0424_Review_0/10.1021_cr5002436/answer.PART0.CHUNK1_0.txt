[1] "The use of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale can address the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes. This is exemplified by the integration of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion in the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale allows for the efficient coupling of catalytic processes, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing overall process efficiency."
[3] "By combining the catalytic activities of In2O3 and Pt on the same support, this catalyst enables the direct conversion of propane to propylene and the simultaneous combustion of H2 produced during dehydrogenation. This leads to improved energy efficiency and process optimization."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by allowing for the efficient coupling of catalytic processes on the same catalyst. This is demonstrated in the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which combines the catalytic activities of In2O3 and Pt to enable the direct conversion of propane to propylene and the simultaneous combustion of H2. This leads to improved energy efficiency and process optimization.
