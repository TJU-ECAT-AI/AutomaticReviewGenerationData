The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing concurrent catalytic propane dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion. This approach significantly enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by recovering hydrogen as a byproduct, thereby reducing the overall energy consumption and waste generation associated with the chemical conversion processes.
