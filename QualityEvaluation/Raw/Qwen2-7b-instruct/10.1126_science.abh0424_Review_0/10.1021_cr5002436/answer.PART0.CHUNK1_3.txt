[1] "In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst."
[2] "Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%."

Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions to occur efficiently on the same catalyst. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The addition of Pt and K promoters enhances the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability, allowing for efficient coupling of these two reactions. The synergy between the In2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 components facilitates the desired sequential reactions, thereby improving energy efficiency and process optimization.
