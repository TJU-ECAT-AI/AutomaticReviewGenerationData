[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[5] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[6] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[7] "In fact, the use of large amounts of shale gas has transformed the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East."
[8] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[9] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[10] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[11] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[12] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

1. The demand for light olefins has grown steadily in recent years, except for the Eurozone, which experienced a negative impact due to the economic downturn.

2. The United States now gets 25% of its natural gas production from shale gas, and this proportion is expected to grow further, driven by efforts to achieve energy independence.

3. The abundance of shale gas has led to a significant decrease in gas costs, making it an attractive resource for both energy production and chemical manufacturing.

4. Propane dehydrogenation's profitability is heavily influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, indicating favorable market conditions.

5. Dehydrogenation technologies are advantageous because they produce a pure olefin rather than a mixture of products.

6. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was manufactured through targeted methods, while steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking dominated the production of propylene.

7. The use of large quantities of shale gas has made the United States the lowest-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East.

8. The easy separation of ethane from shale gas has encouraged a shift from traditional naphtha-based cracking to ethane-based steam cracking in the United States.

9. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids, including ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas.

10. The surge in shale gas production has transformed the US into the world's lowest-cost chemical producer, with 126 investment projects worth $84 billion recorded by the American Chemistry Council up to September 2013.

11. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely determined by the price disparity between propane and propylene, reflecting favorable market conditions.

12. Dehydrogenation technologies are characterized by their ability to produce a specific olefin, offering a cleaner and more efficient process compared to conventional methods.

1. 近年来，除欧元区外的主要市场对这些化学基础材料的需求持续增长，生产也呈现正向增长，主要是由于经济衰退的影响。

2. 实际上，美国从页岩气中获取了四分之一的天然气产量，并且这一比例预计将在未来几年进一步增加，这得益于追求能源独立的努力。

3. 页岩气的丰富供应导致天然气成本大幅下降，约为2005年价格的75%，使之成为既作为能源来源又作为运输燃料或化学品生产原料的极具吸引力的选择。

4. 确实，丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，表明当前的市场条件非常有利。

5. 脱氢化技术的优势在于它们能产生特定的烯烃而不是混合物产品。

6. 2007年，通过目标方法生产的丙烯不到总产量的3%，而蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解则主导了丙烯的生产。

7. 大量使用页岩气使美国成为了中东以外的最低成本化工生产商，根据美国化学理事会的数据，截至2013年9月，记录了价值840亿美元的126个投资项目。

8. 从页岩气中容易分离的乙烷促使美国从传统的石脑油基裂解转向基于乙烷的蒸汽裂解，乙烷裂解装置正在建设中，而石脑油裂解装置要么被拆卸要么被改造。

9. 页岩气田含有大量的天然气液体，包括乙烷和丙烷，这些液体很容易从天然气中分离出来。

10. 页岩气产量的激增使美国成为了全球最低成本的化工生产商，截至2013年9月，美国化学理事会记录了价值840亿美元的126个总投资项目。

11. 丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间价格差距，反映出了有利的市场条件。

12. 脱氢化技术的特点是能够产生特定的烯烃，相比传统方法，这种过程更为清洁且效率更高。
