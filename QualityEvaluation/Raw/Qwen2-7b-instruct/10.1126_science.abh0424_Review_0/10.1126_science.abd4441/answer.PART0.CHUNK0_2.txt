1. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of reactive intermediates, thus enabling the sequential execution of different reactions within a single catalyst particle. This approach promises enhanced energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing separations and coupling reactions to drive transformations forward, or controlling selectivity in reaction networks. It allows for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene followed by selective hydrogen combustion without excessive hydrocarbon combustion, offering a high per-pass yield exceeding the PDH equilibrium.

2. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst utilizes a tandem catalytic system where the indium oxide shell (In2O3) selectively combusts hydrogen, while the platinum nanoparticles (Pt) catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The overcoat of indium oxide exposes the platinum nanoparticles to propane, allowing for the efficient conversion of propane to propylene through dehydrogenation. Simultaneously, surface hydrogen atoms are oxidized at the interface between indium oxide and platinum, driving the selective hydrogen combustion. This design ensures that the propane dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion reactions are tightly coupled, leading to a high yield of propylene with minimal unwanted combustion of hydrocarbons.

3. The term "Ftandem" refers to the fraction of oxygen utilized for hydrogen combustion separate from the propane dehydrogenation process. It is calculated as (1 - H2/C3H6) × 100%, where H2/C3H6 represents the ratio of hydrogen to propane. Values closer to 0 indicate that the hydrogen combustion consumes available oxygen separately from the dehydrogenation of propane, suggesting a lack of kinetic coupling between the two reactions. Conversely, values closer to 100% suggest a high degree of kinetic coupling, meaning that the hydrogen combustion function is tightly integrated with the dehydrogenation function, effectively driving the dehydrogenation process forward by consuming the hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation of propane.

4. The tandem catalyst design is optimized for high propylene selectivity, tight coupling between propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC), and high stability. Achieving these benefits requires the extensive and intimate connectivity provided by the specific geometry of the overcoated nanostructure. This design ensures that the catalytic domains for PDH and SHC are in close proximity, facilitating the direct transfer of reactive intermediates between the two functions. The intimate contact between the indium oxide shell and the platinum nanoparticles enables the sequential execution of the dehydrogenation and combustion processes, leading to enhanced performance compared to traditional catalysts.

5. Supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt) were synthesized using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or indium oxide-coated aluminum oxide (In2O3-coated Al2O3). This synthesis method allows for the precise control of the Pt loading and distribution on the support, ensuring that the nanoparticles are appropriately sized and dispersed for optimal catalytic activity. The use of ALD ensures that the Pt nanoparticles are well-supported on the Al2O3 or In2O3 surface, enhancing their stability and reactivity during the catalytic process.
