1. Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates, which is otherwise elusive in heterogeneous catalysts. This is achieved through the development of a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle, specifically designed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, which balances the activity on platinum (Pt) for dehydrogenation and the selectivity on indium oxide (In2O3) for selective hydrogen combustion.

2. The tandem catalysis concept allows for the sequential coupling of reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene followed by selective hydrogen combustion, in a single catalyst particle. This integration of multiple reaction steps within one particle reduces the need for physical or temporal separation of reactions, which can lead to enhanced energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical production.

3. The tandem catalyst, specifically the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts, providing higher yields and selectivities compared to traditional methods. This demonstrates the potential for tandem catalysis to significantly improve the efficiency of chemical processes, particularly in cases where achieving high per-pass yields while maintaining selectivity is challenging.

4. By employing a conformal indium oxide overcoat on the platinum nanoparticles, the tandem catalyst design ensures stabilization of the metal nanoparticles and tight coupling between the dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion reactions. This enables the direct transfer of reactive intermediates between the two catalyst functions, mimicking biological systems and potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic processes.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the spatial and temporal interactions between different catalyst functions. It allows for the sequential execution of reactions, such as the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, while maintaining high yields and selectivity. This method optimizes energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for separation steps, reducing waste, and potentially allowing for higher throughput compared to traditional cascade or staged reactor systems. By tailoring the nanoscale geometry and composition of the catalysts, researchers can balance the activity of the dehydrogenation catalysts with the selectivity of the combustion catalysts, leading to improved performance and the potential for significant advancements in the field of catalysis.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the potential implications of tandem catalysis by enabling a high per-pass yield of propylene through oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which exceeds the equilibrium limit of non-oxidative PDH. This high yield and selectivity, combined with the ability to maintain stability over time, suggest that tandem catalysis could lead to more efficient and sustainable chemical production processes. Furthermore, the optimization of process conditions and catalyst identities could lead to even greater improvements in the performance of tandem catalysts, potentially revolutionizing the chemical industry.

1. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of reactive intermediates, thus enabling the sequential execution of different reactions within a single catalyst particle. This approach promises enhanced energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing separations and coupling reactions to drive transformations forward, or controlling selectivity in reaction networks. It allows for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene followed by selective hydrogen combustion without excessive hydrocarbon combustion, offering a high per-pass yield exceeding the PDH equilibrium.

2. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst utilizes a tandem catalytic system where the indium oxide shell (In2O3) selectively combusts hydrogen, while the platinum nanoparticles (Pt) catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The overcoat of indium oxide exposes the platinum nanoparticles to propane, allowing for the efficient conversion of propane to propylene through dehydrogenation. Simultaneously, surface hydrogen atoms are oxidized at the interface between indium oxide and platinum, driving the selective hydrogen combustion. This design ensures that the propane dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion reactions are tightly coupled, leading to a high yield of propylene with minimal unwanted combustion of hydrocarbons.

3. The term "Ftandem" refers to the fraction of oxygen utilized for hydrogen combustion separate from the propane dehydrogenation process. It is calculated as (1 - H2/C3H6) × 100%, where H2/C3H6 represents the ratio of hydrogen to propane. Values closer to 0 indicate that the hydrogen combustion consumes available oxygen separately from the dehydrogenation of propane, suggesting a lack of kinetic coupling between the two reactions. Conversely, values closer to 100% suggest a high degree of kinetic coupling, meaning that the hydrogen combustion function is tightly integrated with the dehydrogenation function, effectively driving the dehydrogenation process forward by consuming the hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation of propane.

4. The tandem catalyst design is optimized for high propylene selectivity, tight coupling between propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC), and high stability. Achieving these benefits requires the extensive and intimate connectivity provided by the specific geometry of the overcoated nanostructure. This design ensures that the catalytic domains for PDH and SHC are in close proximity, facilitating the direct transfer of reactive intermediates between the two functions. The intimate contact between the indium oxide shell and the platinum nanoparticles enables the sequential execution of the dehydrogenation and combustion processes, leading to enhanced performance compared to traditional catalysts.

5. Supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt) were synthesized using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or indium oxide-coated aluminum oxide (In2O3-coated Al2O3). This synthesis method allows for the precise control of the Pt loading and distribution on the support, ensuring that the nanoparticles are appropriately sized and dispersed for optimal catalytic activity. The use of ALD ensures that the Pt nanoparticles are well-supported on the Al2O3 or In2O3 surface, enhancing their stability and reactivity during the catalytic process.

1. 倍道催化通过精确控制反应中间体的空间和时间分布，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。它允许多个反应在单一催化剂粒子内顺序执行，从而实现增强的能量效率和过程优化。这种方法通过最小化分离并耦合反应以驱动转化向前发展或控制反应网络中的选择性，提供了超过非氧化性丙烷脱氢平衡的高单次通过产率。

2. In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 催化剂采用倍道催化系统，其中氧化铟层（In2O3）选择性燃烧氢气，而铂纳米颗粒（Pt）催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯。覆盖的氧化铟暴露了铂纳米颗粒于丙烷，使其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯通过脱氢。同时，表面氢原子在氧化铟与铂界面处被氧化，推动选择性氢燃烧。这种设计确保了脱氢和燃烧反应之间紧密耦合，导致丙烯产率高且无多余烃类燃烧。

3. “Ftandem”一词指的是氧气用于氢燃烧与丙烷脱氢过程分开的比例。计算公式为（1 - H2/C3H6）× 100%，其中H2/C3H6表示氢与丙烷的比率。值接近于0表明氢燃烧消耗了可利用的氧气，独立于丙烷脱氢。相反，接近于100%的值表明高度的耦合，意味着氢燃烧功能与脱氢功能紧密集成，有效地推动脱氢过程向前发展，消耗在脱氢丙烷期间产生的氢气。

4. 倍道催化剂设计优化了高丙烯选择性、脱氢（PDH）与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）之间的紧密耦合以及稳定性。实现这些优势需要由特定几何结构提供的广泛而紧密连接。这种设计确保催化域PDH和SHC处于接近，促进两种功能之间反应中间体的直接转移。氧化铟壳与铂纳米颗粒之间的亲密接触允许脱氢和燃烧过程的顺序执行，导致性能优于传统催化剂。

5. 使用原子层沉积（ALD）在氧化铝（Al2O3）或氧化铟涂层氧化铝（In2O3涂层Al2O3）上合成支持的铂纳米颗粒（Pt）。这种合成方法允许精确控制Pt负载和分布，确保纳米颗粒在支持物上的适当大小和分散，以获得最佳催化活性。ALD确保铂纳米颗粒在氧化铝或氧化铟表面上得到良好支撑，增强其在催化过程中的稳定性和活性。

Tandem catalysis addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates at the nanoscale. This is achieved through the development of a single catalyst particle that combines distinct functions, such as dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion. By doing so, it enhances energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene yield to up to 30% by coupling propane dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen combustion. This tandem catalyst outperforms state-of-the-art catalysts and yields beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion for non-oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating its potential for improving chemical processing.
