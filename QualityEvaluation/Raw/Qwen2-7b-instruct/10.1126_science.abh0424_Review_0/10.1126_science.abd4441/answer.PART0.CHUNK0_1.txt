The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the spatial and temporal interactions between different catalyst functions. It allows for the sequential execution of reactions, such as the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, while maintaining high yields and selectivity. This method optimizes energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for separation steps, reducing waste, and potentially allowing for higher throughput compared to traditional cascade or staged reactor systems. By tailoring the nanoscale geometry and composition of the catalysts, researchers can balance the activity of the dehydrogenation catalysts with the selectivity of the combustion catalysts, leading to improved performance and the potential for significant advancements in the field of catalysis.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the potential implications of tandem catalysis by enabling a high per-pass yield of propylene through oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which exceeds the equilibrium limit of non-oxidative PDH. This high yield and selectivity, combined with the ability to maintain stability over time, suggest that tandem catalysis could lead to more efficient and sustainable chemical production processes. Furthermore, the optimization of process conditions and catalyst identities could lead to even greater improvements in the performance of tandem catalysts, potentially revolutionizing the chemical industry.
