Tandem catalysis addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates at the nanoscale. This is achieved through the development of a single catalyst particle that combines distinct functions, such as dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion. By doing so, it enhances energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene yield to up to 30% by coupling propane dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen combustion. This tandem catalyst outperforms state-of-the-art catalysts and yields beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion for non-oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating its potential for improving chemical processing.

The implications of this approach extend beyond the current findings, suggesting that further advancements can be made through optimization of process conditions and independent tuning of catalyst functionalities. This could lead to more efficient and selective chemical transformations, potentially revolutionizing various industries that rely on complex multi-step reactions for production.

在化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战通过纳米尺度下实现精确的空间和时间控制，这得益于多反应串联催化剂的开发。串联催化剂将不同的功能结合在一个粒子中，如脱氢和选择性氢燃烧，从而实现能量效率和过程优化。例如，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合丙烷脱氢与选择性氢燃烧，使丙烯产率提高至30%。这种串联催化剂优于现有技术催化剂，并且产量超过了非氧化脱氢的热力学平衡转化率，表明它有可能改善化学加工。

这一方法的潜在影响远远超出了当前的研究成果，暗示着可以通过优化工艺条件和独立调整催化剂功能进一步改进。这可能导致更高效和选择性的化学转换，可能彻底改变依赖复杂多步反应进行生产的各个行业。
