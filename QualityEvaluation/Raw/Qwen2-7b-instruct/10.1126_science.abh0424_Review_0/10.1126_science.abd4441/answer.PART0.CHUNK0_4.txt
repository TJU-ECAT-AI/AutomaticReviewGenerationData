Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive.
Tandem and cooperative catalysis could revolutionize chemical production by minimizing separations, coupling reactions to drive transformations forward, or controlling selectivity in reaction networks.
This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation.
The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium.
Ftandem is also reported, which we define as (1-H2/C3H6) ×100%.
In this last catalyst design, the In2O3 overcoat is intended to be neither an inert shell nor strong metal-support interaction, totally encapsulating the Pt.
The overcoated catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH.
Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates. This method minimizes separations, couples reactions to drive transformations forward, and controls selectivity in reaction networks. By creating a nanoscale overcoating geometry, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst successfully couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating high per-pass yields and stability that exceed the equilibrium conversion for nonoxidative PDH. This tandem catalyst design optimally balances the activity on Pt and selectivity on In2O3, allowing for the biomimetic direct transfer of reactive intermediates between different catalyst functions. These advancements hold significant implications for enhancing energy efficiency and optimizing chemical processes.
