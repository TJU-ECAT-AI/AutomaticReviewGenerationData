AbstractClick to copy section link

Oxygen chemistry plays a pivotal role in numerous chemical reactions. In particular, selective cleavage of C–H bonds by metal oxo species is highly desirable in dehydrogenation of light alkanes. However, high selectivity of alkene is usually hampered through consecutive oxygenation reactions in a conventional oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) scheme. Herein, we show that dual-functional Mo–V–O mixed oxides selectively convert propane to propylene via an alternative chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) approach. At 500 °C, we obtain 89% propylene selectivity at 36% propane conversion over 100 dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles. We attribute such high propylene yield—which exceeds that of previously reported ODH catalysts—to the involvement and precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo and show that increasing the binding energy of V–O bonds is critical to enhance the selectivity of propylene. This work provides the fundamental understanding of metal–oxygen chemistry and a promising strategy for alkane dehydrogenation.

Activating the anionic redox reactions of oxygen in metal oxides provides exciting opportunities in chemical applications. (1−3) The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a contemporary example of such a promising yet challenging chemistry. (4,5) Despite nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) showing high propylene selectivity, it is strongly endothermic and deactivated by coking. (6,7) In contrast, ODH occurs in the presence of oxygen and has the potential to improve the process efficiency for favorable thermodynamics and coking resistance. (8,9) However, the propylene selectivity is hampered through the consecutive oxygenation reactions. Therefore, it is desirable to design the multifunctional materials to achieve high propylene selectivity and productivity.

Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH. In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. (10) Previous study using V–Si–O catalysts achieved 48% propane conversion at 550 °C. However, only 45% propylene selectivity was obtained over this highly active V5+ species due to overoxidation and coking. (8) Comparatively, the V3+ species was  more active for PDH than V5+ species. However, this highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking. (11,12) Until now, high propylene selectivity and productivity over vanadium oxides have not been achieved concurrently due to the unmanageable oxygen reactivity.

We controllably synthesized dual-functional Mo–V–O mixed oxides via a simple coimpregnation process. Lattice oxygen in Mo–V–O mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Combining in situ Raman, pulse injection and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that nondoped V2O5 is highly unselective to C3H6, while increasing the binding energy of V–O bonds by Mo doping inhibits such lattice oxygen evolution for overoxidation. On this basis, we explained the lattice oxygen evolution mechanism and reaction pathways over Mo–V–O mixed oxides.

Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 1a) and line profiles indicate the replacement of V by atomically doped Mo atoms (Figure 1b). Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mappings show Mo is well distributed with V element (Figure S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the diffraction peaks of V2O5 (PDF 41-1426) shift to lower diffraction angles (Figure 1c and Table S2) when the molar ratio of V/Mo is higher than 6. With a further increase of Mo addition (V/Mo = 4), crystalline MoO3 (PDF 47-1081) emerges. In Raman spectra, crystalline V2O5 without the segregated MoO3 was observed over Mo–V–O (V/Mo = 6) (Figure 1d and Table S3). The band around 920 cm–1 is assigned to V–O–Al stretching, which is gradually immerged with Mo doping and vanished over Mo1 V6. Meanwhile, a new band around 860 cm–1 assigned to Mo–O–V stretching emerges, further revealing the formation of Mo–V–O mixed oxides. In addition, red shifts of V = O (994 cm–1 to 987 cm–1) and V–O–V (701 cm–1 to 692 cm–1) were observed in the Mo–V–O mixed oxides (Figure S3), indicating the lattice distortion of V–O bonds caused by Mo doping. Taken together, the local structural of Mo–V–O mixed oxides was determined as Figure 1e.

Before the reaction test, thermodynamic analysis was performed (Figure S4). The ΔG of CL-ODH over V2O5 is lower than 0 during 200–500 °C compared with PDH (ΔG > 0, 200–500 °C), suggesting lattice oxygen from V2O5 converts hydrogen intermediate or H2 to H2O and shifts the equilibrium toward C3H6. (13,14) A temperature-programmed reaction (C3H8-TPR) shows that the C–H cleavage over Mo–V–O (V/Mo = 6) starts at 300 °C. However, a higher temperature at 450 °C and a weaker C3H6 signal are observed when the prereduced V/Al2O3 is considered, according with the thermodynamic calculation that lattice oxygen enables propane dehydrogenation easier.

The reaction was performed via dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles without cofeeding O2. See the Supporting Information for details. Figure 2a shows the evolution of gas product compositions over Mo–V–O (V/Mo = 6) under 500 °C and 2500 h–1 GHSV. Three characteristic regions are distinguished: (I) overoxidation, (II) oxidative dehydrogenation, and (III) nonoxidative dehydrogenation. (9,15) In the oxidative dehydrogenation region, Mo–V–O (V/Mo = 6) reaches 36% C3H8 conversion and 89% C3H6 selectivity with a instantaneous productivity of 6.9 mol C3H6/kg-cat/h at the 5th minute, breaking through the equilibrium yield (28%) via PDH at equivalent conditions (Figure 2b). Comparatively, nondoped VOx shows only 70% C3H6 selectivity due to 20% COx. During the overall dehydrogenation step, about 80% selectivity of C3H6 was achieved over Mo–V–O (V/Mo = 6) (Figure 2c). (16,17) Compared with conventional ODH (4,18,19) and PDH (11) catalysts (Figure 2d), the Mo–V–O mixed oxide remains superior.

A long-term stability test was conducted over Mo1 V6 for 100 dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles. The optimal regeneration time was 10 minute to recover the structures and combust the coking (Figures S13–15). Few changes of product compositions at  5th minute (Figure S16) and 10th minute (Figure S17) in the dehydrogenation step were observed during the 100 redox cycles, indicating that a stable CL-ODH performance was achieved over Mo–V–O mixed oxides.

Surface oxidation states of V are crucial for propylene selectivity. (11,20) We introduced consecutive and interrupted propane pulses to investigate the surface reactions. Nondoped VOx is highly nonselective, producing a large amount of CO2 (Figure 3a). When an interruption of the inert purge is allowed, lower propylene selectivity is observed, indicating the evolution of bulk lattice oxygen to surface and forming nonselective oxygen. (21,22) Comparatively, no matter consecutive or interrupted pules of propane, there are no noticeable CO2 signals over Mo1 V6 (Figure 3b), revealing the promotion of Mo doping on propylene selectivity. (9,22)

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively (Figure 3c). For Mo1 V6, increasing ratios of V4+ and V3+ were observed, which are more selective for propylene than V5+ (Table S4). Note that binding energies of Mo 3d for Mo–V–O with increasing Mo doping showed a noticeable shift toward higher values. These may be due to the existence of strong interface interaction between Mo and V, wherein the electrons transferring from Mo to V decrease the ratios of V5+ (Figure S18). (23)

H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was further performed to detect the effect of such interaction on lattice oxygen reactivity (Figure 3d). The low-temperature peak α corresponds to changes in V valence state from V5+ to V4+, whereas the high-temperature peak β corresponds to the formation of V3+ from V4+. (24,25) With Mo doping, temperatures of the two peaks increase. However, total areas for the two reduction peaks do not change (Table S6). This indicates Mo doping increases the binding energy of V–O bonds but not decreases the oxygen carrying capacity (∼4.6 mol O/kg-cat). Thermal gravity (TG) also showed the comparable oxygen release (∼4.7 wt %) between Mo1 V6 and nondoped VOx (Figure S20). However, the former showed a lower consumption rate (0.12 mg O/min). Because overoxidation of 1 mol propane to 3 mol CO2 consumes 10 mol oxygen atoms, higher than that in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction where 1 mol propane to 1 mol C3H6 and H2O only consumes 1 mol oxygen atom. This again confirms that nonselective oxygen to produce CO2 is significantly decreased by Mo–V interaction.

DFT calculations on optimized V2O5- and Mo-doped V2O5 indicated the Mo doping in V2O5 increased the binding energy of V–O bonds (Figure 3e), inducing higher oxygen vacancy formation energy (2.85 eV for V = O, 4.20 eV for V–O–V and 4.49 eV for V3O) than that in nondoped VOx (2.19 eV for V = O, 3.01 eV for V–O–V and 3.03 eV for V3O) (Table S5). This revealed the suppressed oxygen reactivity as TPR results showed. (26,27)

To identify the evolution of lattice oxygen in CL-ODH, in situ Raman was further performed. With the temperature increasing, V = O stretching quickly vanished at 200 °C. Meanwhile V–O–V stretching appeared and weakened at 100–450 °C (Figure 4a). At above 450 °C, both of V═O and V–O–V species vanished, suggesting V═O and V–O–V species function as oxygen source in oxidative dehydrogenation period. Comparatively, V3O and V–O–Mo species can be barely reduced even at 500 °C. Meanwhile, the mode of coking (1600 cm–1) occurred, indicating V3O and V–O–Mo function as active sites catalyzing nonoxidative dehydrogenation.

In situ XRD patterns showed that with lattice oxygen consuming, continuous phase transformation occurred over Mo1 V6 from 100 to 500 °C, along with the disappearing reflections at 26.1° and 31.0° from V2O5, the intermediate reflections of 27.2° from VO2, and the intensified reflections at 33.1°, 36.1°, and 54.0° from V2O3 (Figure 4c). Comparatively, nondoped VOx showed a quicker transformation from V2O5 to V2O3 due to a quicker oxygen consumption rate (Figure S22). Additionally, ex situ XPS showed the fraction of V5+ decreased quickly than the crescendo–decrescendo fraction of V4+ and increased fraction of V3+ (Figure S21 and Table S7), corresponding to the quickly decreased V═O, crescendo–decrescendo V–O–V, and increased V3O bands shown in Raman spectra.

Influenced by lattice oxygen evolution, different reaction regions are observed: an initial region influenced by CO2 from overoxidation (eq 1) and an oxidative dehydrogenation region dominated by C3H6 and H2O (eq 2) (Figure 4b). The Mo doping prevents propane from overoxidation and induces a selective pathway to C3H6 (Figure S23). With the depletion of lattice oxygen, V3+ and V–O–Mo species serve as the catalytic sites in nonoxidative dehydrogenation (eq 3). The reaction periods of CL-ODH over Mo–V–O mixed oxides are determined as follows (Figure 4d):

In summary, the dual-functional Mo–V–O mixed oxides afford high propylene selectivity of 89% and a very stable performance for 100 redox cycles. Combining in situ Raman, pulse injection and DFT calculation, we revealed the nonselective nature of V2O5 and the increased binding energy of V–O bonds by Mo doping inhibited the lattice oxygen evolution for overoxidation. These new insights in metal oxide redox chemistry exemplified new approaches to develop functional mixed oxides via CL-ODH process toward alkane dehydrogenation and selective oxidation reactions.
