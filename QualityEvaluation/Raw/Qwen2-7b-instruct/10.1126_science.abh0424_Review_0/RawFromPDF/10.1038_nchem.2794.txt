Direct conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels with high selectivity over a bifunctional catalyst
Abstract
Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline, directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high C–C coupling barrier. Here we present a bifunctional catalyst composed of reducible indium oxides (In2O3) and zeolites that yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (78.6%) with a very low methane selectivity (1%). The oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and C−C coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons with a high octane number. The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Moreover, the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial applications.

Owing to the growing energy demand, dwindling fossil fuel reserves and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and biomass, foresee increasing usage. However, the widespread utilization of renewable energy sources is currently limited by their intermittent and fluctuating nature. In this context, the chemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added products with the assistance of hydrogen (H2) would represent a promising solution to the storage of renewable energy1,2,3.

Thus, much attention has been paid to CO2 hydrogenation to various C1 feedstocks (for example, methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid) and considerable progress has been achieved4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, the extreme inertness of CO2 and the high kinetic barriers for the formation of C–C bonds12,13 mean it is still a great challenge to synthesize C2+ (hydrocarbons with two or more carbons) products directly from CO2, such as gasoline (C5–C11 hydrocarbons), which is a very important transportation fuel widely used around the world. CO2 is well-known to be a very stable molecule (ΔfGo= –396 kJ mol–1), the end product of any combustion process, either biological or chemical, along with water14,15. Another key bottleneck problem is the assembly of the atoms and formation of chemical bonds to convert the relatively simple CO2 molecules into the much more complex and energetic C5–C11 hydrocarbons. Obviously, significant catalytic advances are required for the large-scale production of liquid fuels directly from CO2 hydrogenation. Currently, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) route using modified Fe-based catalysts can be utilized to produce hydrocarbons directly from CO2. However, the maximum C5–C11 hydrocarbon fraction was limited by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution to ∼48% with an undesirable CH4 fraction of ∼6% (refs 16,17). Furthermore, the heat of adsorption of CO2 is lower than that of CO because of the thermodynamic stability of CO2, which leads to a much lower coverage of CO2 over the catalyst, and thus a low CO2 reactivity and high CH4 selectivity.

In the present work, a bifunctional catalyst that contains partially reducible metal oxides (In2O3) and H-form Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5) zeolites exhibits an excellent performance for the direct production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation with a high selectivity. The C5+ selectivity in hydrocarbon distribution reached up to 78.6% with only 1% for CH4 selectivity at a CO2 conversion of 13.1% (Fig. 1a). There was no obvious catalyst deactivation over 150 hours, and a much better performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons was observed using a pellet catalyst with internal gas recycling. Such results thus suggest a promising potential for its industrial application.

Results and discussions
The bifunctional catalyst consists of a metal oxide (In2O3) with a small particle size of about 10 nm (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) and a high specific surface area of 120 m2 g–1 (Supplementary Table 1), and a HZSM-5 zeolite with a hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure with a mesopore diameter of 4 nm (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3a). The catalytic performance and structure information of the sole In2O3 component were investigated first. With In2O3 as the sole catalyst under the same reaction conditions, CO and CH3OH were the major products. The hydrocarbon selectivity was rather low (2.4%) and no C5+ hydrocarbons were detected (Fig. 1a). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 4) revealed that In2O3 is reducible, which results in a surface rich in oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancy on the In2O3 surface benefits CO2 activation and hydrogenation, and can also be generated through thermal desorption18,19. After pre-treatment of In2O3 in argon (Ar) at 400 °C for one hour, the amount of surface oxygen defects detected from oxygen atoms adjacent to the defects by in situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP–XPS, O 1s at 531.7 eV (Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 2)) increased to 24.8%. However, the changes in the particle sizes calculated from in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig. 1) and specific surface areas (Supplementary Table 1) were negligible during the pre-treatment process. The CO2 and H2 adsorption properties of the In2O3 surface were investigated further by CO2 and H2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), respectively. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6a, the observed peak at approximately 417 °C originated from the desorption of CO2 that interacted strongly with the surface. The dissociative adsorption of H2 was detected at 114 °C, which formed atomic hydrogen on the In2O3 surface capable of participating in hydrogenation reactions (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

The sole HZSM-5 zeolite used in the bifunctional catalyst was also tested for CH3OH conversion and exhibited a typical catalytic performance of CH3OH to gasoline with a complete CH3OH conversion (100%) and a high C5+ selectivity of 71.4% (Fig. 1a)20,21. We therefore conclude that CO2 was first hydrogenated to CH3OH on the In2O3 surface, and CH3OH was then transformed into hydrocarbons inside the HZSM-5. DFT calculations were carried out to predict the catalytic cycle of CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH at the oxygen-vacancy site of In2O3, and the potential energy surface is shown in Fig. 2a,c. CO2 first chemisorbed at the oxygen-vacancy site, and the chemisorbed CO2* species (* represents the surface-adsorbed species) then underwent stepwise hydrogenation to give formate (bi-HCO2*), dioxymethylene (bi-H2CO2*), methoxy (mono-H3CO*) and finally CH3OH. The oxygen vacancy was filled during the above process, and was regenerated by subsequent hydrogenation. CH3OH formed over the surface of In2O3 passed further through the HZSM-5 zeolite, where it was transformed into various hydrocarbons at the acidic site of the zeolite via the hydrocarbon-pool mechanism, as shown in Fig. 2b,d22,23,24. Moreover, it was also found that the C5–C11 isoparaffins were mainly obtained from CO2 hydrogenation over the In2O3/HZSM-5 composite catalyst, and the ratio of isoparaffins to n-paraffins was 16.8 (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7). This was very different from that of CO2-based FTS, in which normal paraffins and olefins were the main products, and nearly no isoparaffins with a high octane number were formed25,26,27.

CH3OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is usually accompanied by undesirable CO formation via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is further enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature because of the endothermicity of the RWGS reaction. According to the equilibrium calculations (Supplementary Fig. 8), the equilibrium selectivity of CO increases significantly with increasing temperature, and reaches 97.1% at 340 °C. When the typical Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 industrial catalyst28 for the synthesis of CH3OH from syngas and the highly efficient Cu–ZnO–Al2O3–ZrO2 catalyst29 for CO2 hydrogenation to give CH3OH were employed for this reaction instead of In2O3, the main product was CO with a much higher CH4 selectivity in the hydrocarbon distribution under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 1a). Similar results were found for other conventional CH3OH synthesis catalysts, such as Cu–ZnO, Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 and Cu–ZnO–Cr2O3 combined with various zeolites30,31,32,33. Recent DFT calculations demonstrated that the key intermediates involved in CH3OH synthesis were more stable on the defective In2O3 surface than those on the Cu surface, which strongly suppressed the formation of CO (ref. 18). The CH3OH selectivity over In2O3 can be tuned up to 100% when the space velocity is above 16,000 h−1, even at the high reaction temperature of 300 °C, whereas much higher space velocities are required for Cu-based catalysts19,34. Consequently, CO selectivity over In2O3 integrated with the zeolite (<45%) was much lower than that over traditional Cu-based catalysts (>90%) at 340 °C. Furthermore, compared with other reducible metal oxides, such as Ga2O3, Fe2O3, ZnO–Cr2O3 and ZnO–ZrO2 combined with HZSM-5, the In2O3/HZSM-5 composite catalyst exhibited a much better performance for CO2 hydrogenation with a higher activity and a higher selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons (Supplementary Table 4).

The hydrocarbon selectivity and distribution were also affected markedly by the integration manner of the active components35,36. Using a dual-bed configuration with the HZSM-5 packed above the In2O3 and separated by a layer of inert quartz sand (Fig. 3a), the CH4 selectivity was very high (66.3%), whereas the selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons was only 26.7% and a large amount of CH3OH (31.8%) was detected. When HZSM-5 particles were loaded below the oxides (Fig. 3b), the formed CH3OH can be completely converted into hydrocarbons, and the C5+ selectivity increased to 70.4%, whereas the CH4 selectivity dropped to 4.5%. Furthermore, by moving the two components into a closer proximity (from Fig. 3b to Fig. 3d), the CO selectivity decreased significantly, because of the suppression of the undesired RWGS reaction, the C5+ selectivity enhanced and the CH4 selectivity reduced, although the CO2 conversion only changed slightly. We observed an even higher C5+ selectivity of 78.6% and a very low CH4 selectivity of 1% over the composite catalyst without quartz sand (Fig. 3d). The effect of the relative amounts of each component of In2O3/HZSM-5 on the catalytic performance was also investigated. With a decreasing relative amount of In2O3, both CO2 conversion and CO selectivity decreased. The hydrocarbon distribution changed slightly when the oxide/zeolite mass ratio decreased from 2:1 to 1:2, whereas the C5+ selectivity dropped and CH3OH was detected with a selectivity of 2.5% when the weight ratio increased from 2:1 to 4:1. In addition, an increase in the space velocity can also greatly decrease the CO selectivity and enhance the C5+ selectivity (Fig. 4a, 80.3% at 11,250 ml h–1 gcat–1). Therefore, any measure that improves the transport of the reaction intermediates in the gas phase should favour the shift of the reaction equilibrium for the selective formation of C5+ hydrocarbons.

The catalytic performance is improved significantly by moving the two components to a closer proximity, whereas the C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity decreases remarkably with a further increase in the proximity by grinding the powder mixture of the two active components in an agate mortar.

The sample illustrated in Fig. 3d was composed of well-mixed micrometre-sized In2O3 and HZSM-5 particles (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We tried to shorten the distance between the two components further by grinding a powder mixture of them both in an agate mortar to investigate the effect of their intimate contact (Fig. 3e). For the sample obtained from this integration manner, the much smaller In2O3 particles (around 10 nm) were in much closer contact with the HZSM-5 particles of 500–800 nm in size (Supplementary Fig. 2c–f). However, CO2 was converted mainly into CH4 (94.3% in hydrocarbon distribution) with a rather low CO2 conversion (8%). In addition, the C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity was only 4.2% and the CH3OH selectivity reached 51.9%, which suggests a significant deactivation of HZSM-5. The very close contact between In2O3 and the zeolite appeared to weaken the synergistic effect. A similar phenomenon was also observed by de Jong and co-workers, who reported that the closest proximity of bifunctional active sites was detrimental to the selective hydrocracking of hydrocarbons37. Similar textural and structural properties, as well as surface acidity, were observed for the spent samples presented in Fig. 3d,e, which indicates that the integration manner has no significant effect on these properties (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the number of strongly acidic sites of the spent catalyst presented in Fig. 3e decreased markedly (Supplementary Fig. 3d). As a result, the number of active sites for the C–C coupling in the zeolite pore was significantly reduced, which leads to a severe deactivation with very low C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity.

We also investigated the stability of the composite catalyst with granule stacking (Fig. 4b). The CO2 conversion and the CO selectivity decreased, whereas the C5+ selectivity increased significantly during the initial 40 hours. However, the CO2 conversion and C5+ selectivity remained stable at around 12 and 80%, respectively, after a time-on-stream of 150 hours at 340 °C, 3.0 MPa and 9,000 ml h–1 gcat–1, which suggests a promising potential for industrial applications. In situ XRD characterization revealed that the crystal size of In2O3 increased substantially after the exposure to the H2 and CO2 mixture at 340 °C during the initial stage (four hours), whereas it remained almost unchanged in the subsequent reaction period (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the effects of pressure and the H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic performance were also studied. A higher pressure and H2/CO2 ratio can enhance CO2 conversion and decrease CO selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, a higher reaction rate with a lower contact time suggested a negative effect of the generated water (H2O) on the catalyst performance (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The increasing trend of CO2 conversion with decreasing space velocity should lead to an increase in the H2O partial pressure across the catalyst bed, which would oxidize In2O3 vacancies (e.g. H2O + D → P + H2) (ref. 38) and lead to a lower catalytic activity. This was proved by the steady drop in the reaction rate when H2O was co-fed during CO2 hydrogenation (Supplementary Fig. 10b).

To investigate further the prospect of the In2O3/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst in industrial applications, the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons was evaluated using a pellet catalyst under industrially relevant conditions. The dry catalyst powders were compressed by a high-pressure agglomeration technique to obtain both In2O3 and HZSM-5 pellets in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 3.0 mm and a height of 3.5 mm (Φ3.0 × 3.5 mm). The catalytic performance of the well-mixed In2O3 and HZSM-5 pellets (In2O3/HZSM-5 mass ratio = 1:2) was examined with tail-gas recycling (Supplementary Fig. 11), commonly used in industry for a more efficient utilization of the feed39,40. As shown in Fig. 5a, the pellet catalyst exhibited a similar performance to that of the granule catalyst under the same reaction conditions. With an increasing recycle ratio, defined as the flow rate of the recycled tail gas over that of the original feed gas, both CO2 conversion (from 8.7 to 18.2%) and C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity (from 78.0 to 84.1%) increased, whereas CO selectivity decreased substantially from 44.5 to 30.0%. The CO concentration in the feed gas would obviously grow with an increasing recycle ratio as the recycled tail gas contained a large amount of CO. To study the effect of CO on the performance of CO2 hydrogenation, CO was added into the feed gas of the CO2/H2 mixture with the CO/(CO2 + CO) ratio increased from 0 to 100%. Increasing the CO concentration was found to boost the activity of CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons, as shown in Fig. 5b. According to our DFT calculations, the formation of oxygen vacancies on the In2O3(110) surface by CO reduction is energetically much more favourable than H2 reduction (Supplementary Fig. 4b), which is consistent with the experimental observations (Supplementary Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 2). In addition, the adsorption strength followed the order CO2 > H2 ≫ CO at a relatively low oxygen-vacancy coverage (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Consequently, CO can increase the number of active sites (oxygen vacancies), and then promote the CO2 hydrogenation activity and counterbalance the efficient annihilation of vacancies by CO2. However, we did not detect any C5+ hydrocarbon at CO/(CO2 + CO) = 100% (CO/H2) within eight hours, because In2O3 was reduced to the metallic phase in the absence of CO2 at 340 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6d), and this metallic phase was unable to catalyse CO2 hydrogenation19.

The recycle ratio represents the flow rate of the recycled tail gas over that of the original feed gas. With increasing recycle ratio, the catalytic performance becomes much better over the well-mixed In2O3 and HZSM-5 pellet catalyst under industrially relevant conditions. b, CO2 conversion and yield of C5+ hydrocarbons over a In2O3/HZSM-5 composite catalyst (particle size, 250–380 µm) as a function of CO concentration in the feed at H2/(CO2 + CO)/N2 = 73/24/3. The CO concentration in the feed gas will grow with increasing recycle ratio, and therefore CO was added into the feed gas to investigate the effect of CO on the performance without internal gas recycling. The C5+ yield increases substantially with an increasing CO/(CO2 + CO) ratio.

With the above oxide/zeolite bifunctional catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbon distribution can be easily tuned through the shape selectivity of the zeolite. When SAPO-34 was chosen as the active phase for C−C coupling, the selectivity to lower olefins (C2=−C4=, generally referring to ethylene, propylene and butylene) reached 76.9% in hydrocarbons with only 4.4% of CH4 at a CO2 conversion of 34.1% (Supplementary Fig. 12). In addition, the main hydrocarbon products became liquefied petroleum gas (C3o−C4o, referring to C3 and C4 paraffins) when the Beta zeolite was used in combination with In2O3. Additionally, the catalytic activity depended on the amount of the active vacancies, which could be increased substantially by the introduction of modifiers and/or the use of a suitable support (such as ZrO2).

Conclusions
In summary, we discovered a bifunctional catalyst composed of partially reduced In2O3 and HZSM-5 that could convert CO2 directly into liquid fuels with an excellent selectivity for value-added products. The C5+ selectivity reached 78.6% with only 1% CH4 at a CO2 conversion of 13.1%. We demonstrated that the CO2 conversion could be manipulated by controlling the surface structure of the oxide and the mass ratio of the oxides/zeolite. The proximity of the two components played a crucial role to suppress the undesired RWGS reaction and obtain a high C5+ selectivity. Industry-relevant tests using the pellet catalyst were carried out to show that tail-gas recycling could improve further the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons, which suggests a promising prospect for industrial applications.

Methods
Catalyst preparation
Various oxides were prepared by a co-precipitation method. HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by the hydrothermal route with ethylamine as the template. For the preparation of the composite catalyst presented in Fig. 2d, the In2O3 and HZSM-5 were pressed, crushed and sieved to granules in the range of 40–60 mesh (granule sizes of 250–400 µm). Then, the granules of the two samples were mixed together by shaking in a vessel. For the preparation of the composite catalyst presented in Fig. 2e, the In2O3 and HZSM-5 were mixed in an agate mortar for 20 min. Then, the mixed sample was pressed, crushed and sieved to particles in the range of 40–60 mesh.

Catalyst characterization
Catalysts were characterized by in situ XRD, nitrogen physisorption, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), H2, CO2 and ammonia TPD, as well as H2 and CO temperature-programmed reduction techniques. In situ NAP–XPS was performed on a SPECS Surface Nano Analysis. The facility is composed of two chambers, an analysis chamber and a quick ample load–lock chamber. The analysis chamber is equipped with a PHOIBOS NAP hemispherical electron energy analyser, a microfocus monochromatized Al-Kα X-ray source with a beam size of 300 µm, a SPECS IQE-11A ion gun and an infrared laser heater.

Catalytic evaluation
Activity measurements in the hydrogenation of CO2 were carried out in a continuous-flow, high-pressure, fixed-bed reactor (internal diameter of 12 mm). Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400 °C for 1 h in pure Ar (150 ml min−1). After the reactor was cooled down to 340 °C, the reactant gas mixture with a H2/CO2/N2 ratio of 73/24/3 and a pressure of 3.0 MPa was introduced into the reactor. The catalytic reaction for CH3OH conversion was performed in the same reactor. For the experiments with tail-gas recycling, the catalytic performance of the pellet catalyst (15 g) was investigated in our pilot-scale fixed-bed reactor (internal diameter 19 mm, length 1,180 mm (Supplementary Fig. 11)), which was equipped for operation at industrial working conditions with a recycled tail gas. The effluents were analysed quantitatively online with a Shimadzu GC-2010C gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity and flame-ionization detectors. The CO2 conversion was calculated by an internal normalization method. The hydrocarbon distribution presented in this work was calculated on a molar carbon basis.

DFT calculations
Periodic DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab initio simulation package using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional and projector augmented wave potentials.
