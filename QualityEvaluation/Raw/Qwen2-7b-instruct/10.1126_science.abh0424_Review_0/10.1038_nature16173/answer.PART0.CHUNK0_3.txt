[1] "Such bifunctional hydrocracking catalysts contain metal sites and acid sites, and for more than 50 years the so-called intimacy criterion8 has dictated the maximum distance between the two types of site, beyond which catalytic activity decreases."
[2] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[3] "Our strategy for controlling the distance between metal and acid sites starts with an intimate mixture of 50wt% mesoporous zeolite Y (designated Y; this provides the acid sites) and 50wt% γ-alumina binder (designated as A), obtained by extrusion and referred to as Y/A."
[4] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[5] "More generally, we anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts12,13,14,15."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of different active sites. This allows for optimized selectivity and activity, particularly in the conversion of complex hydrocarbon molecules into high-quality diesel fuels. By placing metal and acid sites at a nanoscale distance rather than the closest proximity, the catalyst can enhance the selectivity for desired products. This approach has implications for improving energy efficiency and process optimization in various industrial applications, including the conversion of alternative hydrocarbon sources. It enables the design of multifunctional catalysts that can efficiently handle the complexities of modern feedstocks, such as those derived from gas-to-liquid technologies, vegetable oils, or algal oils.
