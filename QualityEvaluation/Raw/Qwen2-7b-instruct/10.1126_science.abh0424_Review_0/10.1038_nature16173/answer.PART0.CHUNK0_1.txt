[1] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[2] "Our strategy for controlling the distance between metal and acid sites starts with an intimate mixture of 50wt% mesoporous zeolite Y (designated Y; this provides the acid sites) and 50wt% γ-alumina binder (designated as A), obtained by extrusion and referred to as Y/A."
[3] "We then exploit the difference between ion exchange and electrostatic adsorption20,21 to direct the subsequent deposition of platinum (Pt) metal precursor: ion exchange at pH5 with an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 results in Pt cations being located exclusively on the zeolite component."
[4] "In contrast to their conversion activities, the selectivities of the two catalysts differ remarkably with all three feeds (Fig. 4df): the Pt-A/Y catalyst always produces a much higher yield of skeletal isomers, thus illustrating the importance of nanoscale intimacy between (de)hydrogenation and acid functions for the selectivity of bifunctional catalysts."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by controlling the precise spatial organization of different active sites at the nanoscale level. This allows for the optimization of the proximity between metal and acid sites, enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. For instance, in the context of hydrocracking, the selectivity is significantly influenced by the intimacy of the metal and acid sites. The study demonstrates that for high-quality diesel production, a catalyst with platinum on the binder, achieving a nanoscale intimacy, optimizes the cracking of large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules. This approach improves the selectivity by reducing the likelihood of undesired side reactions, leading to a more efficient and targeted conversion process. The methodology developed for controlling the distance between metal and acid sites at the nanoscale offers a powerful tool for the design and optimization of multifunctional catalysts, which can be tailored to specific requirements, surpassing the limitations associated with simply placing the metal function as close as possible to the acid sites.
