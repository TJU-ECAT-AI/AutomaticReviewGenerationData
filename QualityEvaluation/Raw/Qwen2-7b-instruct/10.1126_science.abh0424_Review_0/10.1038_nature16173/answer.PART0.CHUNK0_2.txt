[1] "Our strategy for controlling the distance between metal and acid sites starts with an intimate mixture of 50wt% mesoporous zeolite Y (designated Y; this provides the acid sites) and 50wt% γ-alumina binder (designated as A), obtained by extrusion and referred to as Y/A."
[2] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[3] "The intimacy criterion put forward by Weisz8 in 1962 provides the maximum distance between both types of site, beyond which catalytic activity decreases."
[4] "This methodology for controlling and imaging the intimacy of metal and acid sites at the nanoscale, with large positive effects on selectivity."
[5] "The model feedstocks in our catalysis experiments are n-decane (n-C10), n-nonadecane (n-C19) and pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, i-C19), with the two catalysts showing very similar n-C10 and n-C19 conversion activity."
[6] "But Pt-Y/A, with its metal and zeolite acid sites in closest proximity, exhibits improved activity over Pt-A/Y in the conversion of multibranched i-C19 feed molecules."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale integrates multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes, addressing challenges such as optimizing energy efficiency and process optimization. By controlling the distance between metal and acid sites, the study demonstrates enhanced selectivity in the conversion of large hydrocarbon feedstocks into high-quality diesel. The intimate mixture of zeolite Y and alumina binder allows for precise control over the proximity of metal and acid sites, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The methodology developed in this study provides a powerful tool for tailoring catalyst properties to meet specific process requirements, moving beyond simplistic notions of 'closer is better' for intimacy criteria. This approach could significantly benefit the development and optimization of multifunctional catalysts for various applications, including the conversion of complex hydrocarbons derived from alternative sources like gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil, and algal oil.
