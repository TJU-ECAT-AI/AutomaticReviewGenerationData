[1] "Bifunctional catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons contain metal sites next to acid sites."
[2] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[3] "We note that in the earlier work n-hexadecane was often used as the feedstock, whereas we used a range of hydrocarbons (n-C10, n-C19, i-C19), allowing us to delineate the effects of intimacy on activity and selectivity."
[4] "This mechanism has been proposed for medium-pore zeolites exhibiting so-called pore mouth catalysis25, and is now extended to reactions of heavy alkanes on large-pore zeolite Y."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing precise control over the spatial arrangement of different active sites at the nanoscale level. This enables the optimization of reaction pathways, enhancing energy efficiency, and improving process selectivity. By spatially organizing metal and acid sites in bifunctional catalysts, the system can tailor the interactions between reaction intermediates, leading to more efficient and selective conversions of hydrocarbons. This approach can lead to significant improvements in the production of high-quality diesel fuels from alternative sources, such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil, or algal oil. The ability to control the intimacy between metal and acid sites at the nanoscale allows for the optimization of catalytic performance, potentially surpassing the limitations of traditional catalyst design based on the 'closer the better' principle. This innovation has broad implications for the development of multifunctional catalysts and could revolutionize the field of sustainable technologies by enabling more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical processes.
