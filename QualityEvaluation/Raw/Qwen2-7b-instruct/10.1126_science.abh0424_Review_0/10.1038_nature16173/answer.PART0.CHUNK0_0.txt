[1] "Our strategy for controlling the distance between metal and acid sites starts with an intimate mixture of 50wt% mesoporous zeolite Y (designated Y; this provides the acid sites) and 50wt% γ-alumina binder (designated as A), obtained by extrusion and referred to as Y/A."
[2] "Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites."
[3] "More generally, we anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts."
[4] "The critical properties of these catalysts are the ratio of metal sites relative to acid sites, and the proximity of both sites to each other8,17."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by precisely controlling the distance between metal and acid sites. This approach allows for the optimization of selectivity in the cracking of large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production. By placing the metal function on the alumina binder rather than inside the zeolite crystals, the catalysts demonstrate improved performance, particularly in the conversion of complex feedstocks like those derived from alternative sources such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil, or algal oil. This methodology holds potential implications for enhancing energy efficiency and process optimization, contributing to the development of more effective multifunctional catalysts that can efficiently convert various hydrocarbons into high-quality diesel fuels. The spatial organization of different active sites at the nanoscale represents a significant advancement in catalysis, offering opportunities to tailor catalyst properties according to specific process requirements beyond simplistic notions of intimacy.
