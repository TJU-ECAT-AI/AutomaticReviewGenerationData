[1] "We obtain 89% propylene selectivity at 36% propane conversion over 100 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[2] "We attribute such high propylene yield which exceeds that of previously reported ODH catalysts to the involvement and precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo."
[3] "We show that dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides selectively convert propane to propylene via an alternative chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) approach."
[4] "Compared with conventional ODH (4,18,19) and PDH (11) catalysts (Figure 2d), the MoVO mixed oxide remains superior."
[5] "Influenced by lattice oxygen evolution, different reaction regions are observed: an initial region influenced by CO2 from overoxidation (eq 1) and an oxidative dehydrogenation region dominated by C3H6 and H2O (eq 2) (Figure 4b)."
[6] "The Mo doping prevents propane from overoxidation and induces a selective pathway to C3H6."
[7] "These new insights in metal oxide redox chemistry exemplified new approaches to develop functional mixed oxides via CL-ODH process toward alkane dehydrogenation and selective oxidation reactions."

1. The dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides enable high propylene selectivity of 89% and a very stable performance for 100 redox cycles, surpassing previous ODH catalysts. The precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo is attributed to this high yield.
2. The tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, demonstrated through the use of MoVO mixed oxides, successfully integrates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, enhancing energy efficiency and process optimization.

1. 双功能MoVO混合氧化物能够实现89%的高丙烯选择性和长达100个还原循环的稳定性能，超越了先前报道的ODH催化剂。通过原子尺度掺杂Mo对基体晶格氧的精确调控是这一高产率的关键。
2. 在纳米尺度上的串联催化，通过使用MoVO混合氧化物成功地整合了催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧的过程，提高了能效和过程优化。
