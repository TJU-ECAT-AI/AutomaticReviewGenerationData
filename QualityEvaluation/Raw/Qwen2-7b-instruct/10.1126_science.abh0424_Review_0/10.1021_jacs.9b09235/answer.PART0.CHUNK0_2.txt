[1] "High propylene selectivity of 89% and a very stable performance for 100 redox cycles were achieved."
[2] "The dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides selectively convert propane to propylene via an alternative chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) approach."
[3] "We attribute such high propylene yield which exceeds that of previously reported ODH catalysts to the involvement and precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo."
[4] "Increasing the binding energy of VO bonds is critical to enhance the selectivity of propylene."
[5] "This work provides the fundamental understanding of metal-oxygen chemistry and a promising strategy for alkane dehydrogenation."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining two or more catalysts in a single system. This integration allows for the efficient coupling of separate chemical reactions, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion, within a single reactor. By doing so, it enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the need for additional equipment and minimizing heat loss. As exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, tandem catalysis enables the sequential execution of these reactions with high selectivity and yield, demonstrating the potential for more sustainable and cost-effective industrial processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化解决了将多个化学反应步骤集成到化工过程中的挑战，通过在单一系统中结合两种或更多种催化剂。这种整合允许在单个反应器中高效地连接单独的化学反应，如催化丙烷脱氢和选择性H2燃烧，从而提高能效和过程优化，减少了额外设备的需求并最大限度地减少了热量损失。以In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂为例，串联催化使得这些反应的顺序执行具有高选择性和产率，展示了更可持续和成本效益高的工业过程的潜力。
