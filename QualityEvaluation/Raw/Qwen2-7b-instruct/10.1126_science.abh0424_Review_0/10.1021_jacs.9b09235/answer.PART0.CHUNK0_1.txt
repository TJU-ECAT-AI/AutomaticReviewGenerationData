This research introduces a novel method for alkane dehydrogenation using dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides in a chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) process. The key innovation lies in the modulation of lattice oxygen within these mixed oxides, achieved through the strategic doping of Mo atoms. This approach allows for high propylene selectivity, reaching 89%, with a propane conversion rate of 36% across 100 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The enhanced selectivity is attributed to the precise control of bulk lattice oxygen, facilitated by the increased binding energy of VO bonds upon Mo doping. This development offers significant insights into metal-oxygen chemistry and presents a promising strategy for alkane dehydrogenation, surpassing previous catalysts in terms of propylene yield and stability.
