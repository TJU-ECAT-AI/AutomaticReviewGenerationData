<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This research introduces a novel method for alkane dehydrogenation using dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides in a chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) process. The key innovation lies in the modulation of lattice oxygen within these mixed oxides, achieved through the strategic doping of Mo atoms. This approach allows for high propylene selectivity, reaching 89%, with a propane conversion rate of 36% across 100 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The enhanced selectivity is attributed to the precise control of bulk lattice oxygen, facilitated by the increased binding energy of VO bonds upon Mo doping. This development offers significant insights into metal-oxygen chemistry and presents a promising strategy for alkane dehydrogenation, surpassing previous catalysts in terms of propylene yield and stability.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining two or more catalysts in a single system. This integration allows for the efficient coupling of separate chemical reactions, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion, within a single reactor. By doing so, it enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the need for additional equipment and minimizing heat loss. As exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, tandem catalysis enables the sequential execution of these reactions with high selectivity and yield, demonstrating the potential for more sustainable and cost-effective industrial processes.
