[1] "We show that dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides selectively convert propane to propylene via an alternative chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) approach."
[2] "At 500 C, we obtain 89% propylene selectivity at 36% propane conversion over 100 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[3] "We attribute such high propylene yield which exceeds that of previously reported ODH catalysts to the involvement and precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo."
[4] "We controllably synthesized dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides via a simple coimpregnation process."
[5] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer."
[6] "Increasing the binding energy of VO bonds is critical to enhance the selectivity of propylene."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing for sequential and efficient execution of different chemical transformations on the same catalyst support. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, thereby optimizing the use of resources and enhancing energy efficiency. The potential implications of this approach include the development of more sustainable industrial processes, reduced waste generation, and improved catalyst stability and activity over traditional single-step methods.
