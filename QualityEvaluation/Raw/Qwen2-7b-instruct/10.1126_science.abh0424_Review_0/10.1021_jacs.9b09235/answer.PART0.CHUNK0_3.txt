The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a single catalyst that can efficiently perform several reactions simultaneously. This integration optimizes energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the need for separate reactors, minimizing heat loss, and potentially lowering the overall energy consumption. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this approach by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating a high degree of synergy between the two reaction pathways. This system could lead to enhanced energy utilization, reduced waste generation, and improved process economics, making it a promising solution for energy-intensive industries seeking to streamline their operations and reduce environmental impact.
