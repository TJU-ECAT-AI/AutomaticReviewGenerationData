The Oleflex process, commercialized in 1990, converts propane into propylene through catalytic dehydrogenation using a moving bed reactor. It employs a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst, known for its low production costs, high returns on investment, and minimal environmental impact. The process is capable of converting propane-rich liquefied petroleum gas (C3 LPG) into chemical or polymer-grade propylene products. More recently, the series of DeH catalysts have been developed to enhance efficiency by reducing the platinum loading while simultaneously increasing propylene selectivity.

[1] "In the Catofin process, owing to their low price and high catalytic Lewis acid activity, CrOx-based catalysts have been utilized."
[2] "However, in addition to their high toxicity and environmental hostility, the severe side reactions induce their quick deactivation and frequent regeneration."
[3] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."

In the Catofin process, CrOx-based catalysts have been used due to their low cost and high catalytic Lewis acid activity. However, these catalysts have high toxicity and environmental impacts, leading to rapid deactivation and frequent regeneration. There is a strong desire for the development of alternative metal oxide catalysts with lower or no chromium content.
