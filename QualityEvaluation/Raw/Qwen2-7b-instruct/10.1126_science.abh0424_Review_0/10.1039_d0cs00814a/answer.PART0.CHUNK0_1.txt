<p>Compared with Pt, chromium oxide is more complex and it is difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation mechanism.</p>
<p>In the direct comparisons in Fig. 9, there are 4 regions (A, B, C and D), and we can find that although CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts, in region B, show higher propylene formation rates, they suffer higher deactivation rates.</p>
<p>Comparatively, some metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity.</p>
<p>Importantly, GaOx-based catalysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH catalysts.</p>

1. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling the sequential execution of reactions on a single catalyst platform. This approach aims to enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for separate reactors, thereby reducing energy consumption and cost. In the context of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, this means coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion in a single step, potentially streamlining the production process and improving overall efficiency.

2. CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts demonstrate higher propylene formation rates, but they suffer from higher deactivation rates. This indicates that while these catalysts are active, their stability is compromised, making them less desirable for practical applications requiring prolonged operation without significant loss of catalytic activity.

3. Metal oxides such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity compared to CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts. This suggests that alternative catalysts with improved activity and stability are needed to compete effectively with more established catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation process.

4. GaOx-based catalysts exhibit preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, indicating that they could serve as promising alternatives for PDH catalysts. Their ability to maintain high activity over prolonged periods without significant deactivation makes them attractive for potential industrial applications.

1. 纳米尺度上的串联催化技术通过在一个单一催化剂平台上实现多个反应步骤的顺序执行，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应挑战的问题。该方法旨在通过减少单独反应器的需求来提高能源效率和过程优化，从而降低能源消耗和成本。以In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂为例，其目标是将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧串联在一起，可能简化生产过程并提高总体效率。

2. CrOx-和VOx基催化剂显示出更高的丙烯形成率，但它们遭受更高的失活率。这表明尽管这些催化剂活性较高，但其稳定性较差，因此在需要长期运行且催化剂活性损失不大的工业应用中不太理想。

3. 诸如InOx基催化剂之类的金属氧化物表现出相对较低的活性，与CrOx-和VOx基催化剂相比。这意味着需要开发具有更高活性和稳定性的替代催化剂，以与更成熟的催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中竞争。

4. GaOx基催化剂表现出优选的形成率和较低的失活率，表明它们可能是PDH催化剂的有前景的替代品。它们保持高活性并长时间不会显著失活的能力使其对潜在的工业应用具有吸引力。
