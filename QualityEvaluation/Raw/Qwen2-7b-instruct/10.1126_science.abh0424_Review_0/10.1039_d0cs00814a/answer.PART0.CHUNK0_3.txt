1. The recent advancements in dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts necessitate a review of the current state of the art.

2. The Oleflex process utilizes a recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst, offering low costs, high returns on investment, and minimal environmental impact.

3. The Star catalyst, composed of PtSn on a ZnCa aluminate base, showcases exceptional dehydrogenation performance and maintains high selectivity at nearly equal conversion rates.

4. The ADHO technology simplifies the process by allowing raw materials to be directly fed into the reactor without preliminary treatments such as desulfurization or dearsenification.

5. The highest propylene formation rates among Pt-based catalysts are around 5 mol/g of Pt per hour at a deactivation rate of 0.05 hours^-1.

6. The lifetime of the catalyst and Pt loading in reference studies are 10 hours and 0.51 weight percent, respectively, falling short of industrial standards.

7. CrOx-based catalysts exhibit high reactivity and selectivity, albeit with poor stability, typically showing a formation rate of 1 mol/g of Cr per hour at a deactivation rate of 0.5 hours^-1.

8. Unlike Pt, CrOx catalysts' reaction and deactivation mechanisms are complex and challenging to elucidate due to their intricate nature.

9. Under a reducing atmosphere, the high-valence chromium ions are reduced during the dehydrogenation process.

10. Adjusting the particle size and crystalline structure of catalysts enables tuning the concentration of Zrcus cations.
