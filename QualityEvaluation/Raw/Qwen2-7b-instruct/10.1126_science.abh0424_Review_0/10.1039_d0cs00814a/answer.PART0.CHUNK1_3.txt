[1] "Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by allowing the simultaneous occurrence of different chemical processes on a single catalyst. This approach enables the efficient coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion."
[2] "This method has significant implications for energy efficiency and process optimization, as it minimizes the energy required for the integration of separate reactions and reduces the overall waste produced by the process."
