The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by enabling a sequential processing of reactants, where each step is optimized for the output of the previous step. This approach can potentially enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing waste and byproducts compared to traditional parallel processing. As exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, tandem catalysis demonstrates the potential for integrating catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, showcasing its potential for process integration.
