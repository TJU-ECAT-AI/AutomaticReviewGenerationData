<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Sequential transformations in organic chemistry involve combining multiple reactions into sequences such as domino, tandem, or cascade reactions, where intermediates do not need to be isolated. An example given in this review is the tandem Knoevenagel hetero-DielsAlder reaction of aldehyde 1 with Meldrum's acid 2, resulting in the formation of compound 4 through the intermediates 3.
