[1] "Sequential Transformations in Organic Chemistry: A Synthetic Strategy with a Future"
[2] "Simple, efficient, highly selective, and resource saving are syntheses of complex organic compounds in which several transformations are combained to sequences like domino, tandem, or cascade reactions, and for which intermediates need not be isolated."
[3] "The tandem Knoevenagel hetero-DielsAlder reaction of aldehyde 1 with Meldrum's acid 2 via 3 to 4 is an example of the sequential transformations which are systematically classified in this review."
[4] "Synthesis is also the basis of the chemical industry."
[5] "For the passionate synthetic chemist, however, synthesis is much more than just a method for obtaining compounds; it is the expression of his creativity, intelligence, ability, and also his perseverance."

Sequential transformations in organic chemistry involve combining several reactions into sequences like domino, tandem, or cascade reactions, allowing for simple, efficient, and resource-saving synthesis of complex organic compounds without the need to isolate intermediates. An example is the tandem Knoevenagel hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. These transformations are systematic and play a crucial role in the chemical industry and the expression of a synthetic chemist's creativity, intelligence, and perseverance.
