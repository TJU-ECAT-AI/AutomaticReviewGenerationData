The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining several transformations into sequences such as domino, tandem, or cascade reactions. This approach allows for simple, efficient, highly selective, and resource-saving syntheses of complex organic compounds without the need to isolate intermediates. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization include streamlined production methods and reduced waste. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, showcasing the effectiveness of sequential transformations in enhancing process efficiency.
