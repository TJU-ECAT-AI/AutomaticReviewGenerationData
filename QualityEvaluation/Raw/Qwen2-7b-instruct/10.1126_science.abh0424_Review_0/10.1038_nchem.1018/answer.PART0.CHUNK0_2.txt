The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing a single catalyst with multiple, distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces. Each interface corresponds to specific catalytic activities and selectivities, enabling the sequential execution of reactions that might otherwise require separate catalysts. This approach potentially enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the need for multiple reactors and catalysts, minimizing energy loss and waste production. It is particularly promising for applications such as artificial photosynthesis, where complex multi-step reactions are required. The first demonstration of using rationally designed and assembled nanocrystal bilayers with multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces represents a significant advancement in the field of catalysis.
