The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing a nanocrystal bilayer structure with multiple, distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces. This allows for the sequential catalysis of different reactions, leading to more efficient and selective production of desired products. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant, as this approach can lead to reduced energy consumption and improved yield in multi-step chemical reactions. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, showcasing the potential for enhanced energy utilization in the chemical industry.
