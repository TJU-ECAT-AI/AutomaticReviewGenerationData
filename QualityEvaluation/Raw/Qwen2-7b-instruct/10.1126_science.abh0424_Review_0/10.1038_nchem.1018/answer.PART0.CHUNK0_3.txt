The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating catalysts with multiple, distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces that can catalyze sequential reactions. This approach allows for the design of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts that can efficiently convert reactants into desired products through a series of catalytic steps. By rationally designing and assembling nanocrystal bilayers with these interfaces, researchers can optimize the catalysts for specific applications, such as artificial photosynthesis, leading to enhanced energy efficiency and process optimization.
