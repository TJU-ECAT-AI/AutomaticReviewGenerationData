The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale integrates multiple reaction steps within a single catalyst system, overcoming the challenge of controlling the composition of multiple interfaces on an atomic level. By utilizing nanocrystals with distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces, it enables sequential reactions, enhancing energy efficiency and process optimization. This approach leads to the development of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts capable of catalyzing complex multi-step reactions, such as those involved in artificial photosynthesis.
