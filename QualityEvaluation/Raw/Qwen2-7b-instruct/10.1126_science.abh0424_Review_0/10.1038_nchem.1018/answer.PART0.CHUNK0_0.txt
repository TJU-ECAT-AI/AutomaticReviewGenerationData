<p>High-performance catalysts are central to the development of new-generation energy conversion and storage technologies1,2.</p>
<p>Although industrial catalysts can be optimized empirically by tuning the elemental composition, changing the supports or altering preparation conditions to achieve greater activity and selectivity, these conventional catalysts are typically not uniform in composition and/or surface structure at the nano- to microscale.</p>
<p>To improve significantly our capability of designing better catalysts, new concepts for the rational design and assembly of metalmetal oxide interfaces are desirable.</p>
<p>The integration of many types of metalmetal oxide interfaces on the surface of a single active metal nanocrystal could, in principle, yield a novel tandem catalyst for multistep reactions.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity and selectivity of such a tandem catalyst can be optimized by establishing suitable metalmetal oxide interfaces for each reaction step.</p>
<p>However, it is almost impossible to control the composition of multiple interfaces on an atomic level using traditional catalyst synthesis.</p>
<p>Integrating binary nanocrystals to form highly ordered superlattices is a new way to form multiple interfaces with new functionalities12,13.</p>
<p>We utilized a nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling Pt and CeO2 nanocube monolayers of less than 10 nm on a silica substrate.</p>
<p>The two distinct metalmetal oxide interfaces in the catalyst, CeO2Pt and PtSiO2, were used to catalyse two separate and sequential reactions.</p>
<p>The CeO2Pt interface catalysed methanol decomposition to produce CO and H2, which were subsequently used for ethylene hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby PtSiO2 interface.</p>
<p>Consequently, propanal was produced selectively from methanol and ethylene on this nanocrystal bilayer tandem catalyst.</p>
<p>The cubic shape of nanocrystals is ideal for assembling metalmetal oxide interfaces with a large contact area.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows our tactic to achieve the tandem bilayer structure with nanocubes of metal and metal oxide.</p>
<p>First, a two-dimensional metal (Pt) nanocube array was assembled onto a flat metal oxide substrate (SiO2) by using the LangmuirBlodgett (LB) method to make the first metalmetal oxide interface.</p>
<p>The second metal oxide (CeO2) nanocube LB array was then assembled on top of the metal nanocube monolayer, which provided the second metalmetal oxide interface.</p>
<p>The capping agents of the nanocrystals were removed by ultraviolet/ozone treatment to form clean metalmetal oxide interfaces14.</p>
<p>After removal of the capping agent, the vertical clefts between the nanocrystals ensured access to both catalytic interfaces and provided a high surface area in the close-packed array.</p>
<p>Olefin hydroformylation is an important reaction for the production of aldehydes from olefins, CO and H2 (ref. 15).</p>
<p>Usually, the reaction is carried out with homogeneous catalysts, such as Rh complexes.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of this process include the use of toxic CO and explosive H2 gas, and typically it employs high-pressure conditions and purification processes.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be advantageous to carry out olefin hydroformylation through heterogeneous catalysis with CO and H2 produced in situ from the decomposition of a benign chemical, such as methanol.</p>
<p>It is known that Pt loaded on to CeO2 shows high activity towards methanol decomposition to provide CO and H2 (refs 16,17).</p>
<p>In addition, Naito and Tanimoto reported that Pt-loaded SiO2 catalysed propene hydroformylation and produced aldehydes with a high conversion rate.</p>
<p>However, the selectivity for this reaction was poor18.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that our nanocrystal bilayer, made of a CeO2 nanocube monolayer and a Pt nanocube monolayer on a SiO2 substrate, effectively catalyses ethylene hydroformylation with methanol to produce propanal selectively.</p>
<p>Preparation of tandem catalyst.</p>
<p>Pt and CeO2 nanocubes with edge lengths of 68 nm were prepared by literature methods with minor modifications19,20.</p>
<p>A monolayer of Pt nanocubes was prepared by the LB method, and then transferred onto a silicon wafer substrate with a native oxide layer on the surface.</p>
<p>The CeO2 nanocube monolayer film capped with oleic acid was prepared by either drop casting or the LB method.</p>
<p>Although the CeO2 nanocrystals above the Pt nanocrystals cannot be observed clearly over most of the area because of their lower contrast, the CeO2 nanocrystals are visible at some defect areas on the Pt film (Fig. 3a).</p>
<p>The presence of CeO2 nanocubes on the Pt nanocube film was confirmed by HRTEM and by performing an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy line-scan, as shown in Fig. 3b,c.</p>
<p>To facilitate interface formation between the SiO2, Pt and CeO2 layers, the various capping agents, oleylamine on Pt and oleic acid on CeO2, need to be removed.</p>
<p>Previously, it was found that ultraviolet/ozone treatment is effective in removing organic capping agents from Pt nanoparticles18.</p>
<p>Here, removal of the capping agent was monitored by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.</p>
<p>Before the ultraviolet/ozone treatment, three peaks were observed and assigned to symmetric CH2 (2,853 cm1), symmetric CH3 (2,879 cm1) and asymmetric CH2 (2,929 cm1) stretches.</p>
<p>After treatment, the intensity of the peaks decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Commonly, oxidation of CO is employed to examine the interaction between Pt and metal oxides because the activation energy of Pt loaded onto a metal oxide is highly dependent on the nature of the metal oxide support21,22,23.</p>
<p>The strong Ptmetal oxide interaction decreased electron donation from Pt to adsorbed CO, weakening the CO bond.</p>
<p>As a result, the interaction between Pt and the metal oxide increased the activation energy for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>Arrhenius plots for the CO oxidation over our CeO2Pt bilayers on SiO2 substrates before and after ultraviolet/ozone treatment are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.</p>
<p>The as-prepared bilayers showed an apparent activation energy of 19.7 kcal mol1, which is comparable to the reported value for Pt nanocubes22.</p>
<p>The ultraviolet/ozone-treated samples showed an apparent activation energy of 30.1 kcal mol1.</p>
<p>The increase in activation energy indicates the formation of two metalmetal oxide interfaces of CeO2Pt and PtSiO2 following capping-agent removal.</p>
<p>Control experiments were performed to monitor each step over each interface individually: MeOH decomposition over the PtCeO2 interface and, separately, ethylene hydroformylation with CO and H2 gas input over the PtSiO2 interface.</p>
<p>The decomposition of MeOH over the PtCeO2 interface was examined at 190 C over a PtCeO2SiO2 catalyst that contained only the PtCeO2 metaloxide interface.</p>
<p>The as-prepared catalyst showed no catalytic activity for the reaction because of the lack of clean metalmetal oxide interfaces (Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>
<p>After ultraviolet/ozone treatment, the PtCeO2SiO2 tandem catalyst showed MeOH-decomposition activity (Fig. 4a).</p>
<p>Separately, ethylene hydroformylation with CO and H2 gas was carried out over the PtSiO2 catalyst, also at 190 C.</p>
<p>On a bare Pt surface, the formation of MeOH by CO hydrogenation is much faster than that of propanal by hydroformylation.</p>
<p>The formation of by-products such as propanol or ethane was less than the detection limit (<0.01 vol%).</p>
<p>The maximum propanal concentration in the reaction effluent was 0.18%, at which the product selectivity towards propanal was more than 94%.</p>
<p>This is quite surprising because simple ethylene hydrogenation, a competitive reaction of hydroformylation, is much faster on conventional Pt catalysts.</p>
<p>The same reaction over the PtCeO2SiO2 catalyst, which does not contain suitable interfaces for the reaction, was also performed as a control experiment.</p>
<p>No formation of propanal was observed.</p>
<p>The hydroformylation with in situ decomposition of MeOH over the tandem CeO2PtSiO2 catalyst gave a TOF for propanal of 2.6 × 102 s1 per Pt atom, which was much faster than that obtained for ethylene hydroformylation with CO and H2 gas over the PtSiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>Two reasons for the better performance of the tandem catalyst are proposed here.</p>
<p>First, for the in situ tandem catalytic reaction, MeOH decomposition occurred preferentially at the PtCeO2 interface, but the rate of MeOH formation by CO hydrogenation decreased significantly because of the high MeOH concentration.</p>
<p>The high density of CO and H2 at the Pt surface is also beneficial for ethylene hydroformylation.</p>
<p>Second, it is also possible that the electronic effects of CeO2 contribute to change fundamentally the catalytic properties of the PtSiO2 interface for more efficient hydroformylation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the unique properties of our tandem catalysts, the same catalytic reactions were also examined over physical mixtures of PtCeO2 and PtSiO2 prepared by a conventional impregnation method.</p>
<p>For a mixture of 3% PtSiO2 and 3% PtCeO2, the TOF of propane formation was 5.7 × 104 s1 per Pt atom, which is much slower than the TOF of propanal formation, 2.6 × 102 s1 per Pt atom, over the tandem catalyst.</p>
<p>The different catalytic behaviours of the tandem catalyst and mixture catalysts clearly demonstrate the designed interfaces in our tandem catalyst can be used to programme sequential chemical reactions effectively.</p>
<p>The novel concept of a nanocrystal bilayer tandem catalyst involves multiple, distinct metalmetal oxide interfaces that correspond to specific catalytic activities and selectivities.</p>
<p>This concept was tested using a CeO2Pt nanocube bilayer structure with well-defined surface structures on a silica substrate.</p>
<p>Sequential chemical reactions at two different neighbouring metalmetal oxide interfaces acted to produce propanal selectively.</p>
<p>Although tandem catalysis was employed previously in homogenous catalytic systems24,25, this study is the first attempt to use rationally designed and assembled nanocrystal bilayers with multiple built-in metalmetal oxide interfaces.</p>
<p>This new concept of nanocrystal tandem catalysis represents a powerful approach towards designing high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts for multiple-step chemical reactions, such as those proposed for artificial photosynthesis.</p>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing a nanocrystal bilayer structure that contains distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces for sequential reactions. This approach allows for the optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity for each reaction step, leading to improved energy efficiency and process optimization. Specifically, the bilayer structure enables the efficient production of intermediate products, such as CO and H2, which can then be used as feedstocks for subsequent reactions, as demonstrated by the production of propanal from methanol and ethylene. This method represents a powerful approach to designing multifunctional nanostructured catalysts capable of handling complex, multi-step chemical reactions, potentially revolutionizing industries such as energy conversion and storage technologies. The ability to tailor the interfaces at the nanoscale provides a new avenue for enhancing catalyst performance, particularly in cases where traditional catalyst synthesis methods are insufficient.
