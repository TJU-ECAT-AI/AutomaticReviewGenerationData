Previous article in issue Next article in issue
1. Introduction
The selective conversion of light alkanes to alkenes provides an attractive route to useful chemicals [1] . Several alkane dehydrogenation processes [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] use supported Cr oxide catalysts. Recently developed dehydrogenation processes are based on supported Pt catalysts [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . Both Pt and Cr catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent oxidative regenerations, which increase process complexity and capital and operating costs. Alkene yields are often limited by thermodynamics and the resulting low conversions introduce significant recycle and separation costs.

1. The selective conversion of light alkanes into alkenes offers a promising method for producing valuable chemicals. Various alkane dehydrogenation techniques, including those utilizing supported chromium oxide catalysts, have been developed recently. However, both platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) catalysts experience rapid degradation, necessitating frequent oxidative rejuvenations. This leads to increased process complexity, higher capital and operational expenses, and often limits alkene yields due to thermodynamic constraints, resulting in inefficient recycling and separation processes.

1. 对轻烷烃进行选择性转化以生成烯烃提供了生产有价值化学品的诱人途径。各种烷烃脱氢技术，包括使用支持型铬氧化物催化剂的方法，最近得到了发展。然而，铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）催化剂都表现出快速的衰减，需要频繁的氧化再生。这导致了过程复杂性的增加、更高的资本和运营成本，并且往往由于热力学限制而限制了烯烃产率，从而导致回收和分离过程效率低下。

2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization
Na-[Fe]ZSM5 was prepared using methods previously described [27] . [Fe]ZSM5 was treated in flowing dry air ( ) at 723 K for 15 h to remove organic templates used in its synthesis. This sample was exchanged three times with a NaNO3 solution (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%, 0.5 liter/g-zeolite of a 2 g/liter NaNO3 solution) at 353 K for 15 h and then filtered and washed with deionized water (2 liter/g ZSM5) to obtain Na-[Fe]ZSM5.

2.2. Catalytic reaction rates and selectivities
Reaction rates and selectivities were measured using a packed-bed with plug-flow hydrodynamics and a gradientless recirculating reactor operated in either batch or semibatch mode [28] . In plug-flow mode, rate data were obtained at 793 K, 25 kPa C3H8/He (Praxair, certified mixture), and 4.178.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocities. Catalysts (0.03 g) were treated in 40% H2/He (Airgas, UHP,) at 773 K before rate measurements.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 in a packed-bed plug-flow reactor
C3H8 dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were measured on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst at 793 K, 25 kPa C3H8, and 4.178.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity in a plug-flow reactor ( Table 2 ). The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 under these conditions is 36%. This catalyst led to near-equilibrium C3H6 yields (35%) with 97% C3H6 selectivity, and a net C3H6 formation turnover rate of 1.4 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) at 4.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity. These net rates are similar to those reported (1.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) at 792 K and slightly lower space velocities (3.5 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) on 0.35 wt% PtSn/γ-Al2O3; these previously reported rates, however, decreased rapidly with time on stream [7] .

3.2. Comparison of Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 with previously reported alkane dehydrogenation catalysts
Pt and PtSn species on nonacidic supports, such as MgAl2O4, lead to lower cracking and oligomerization rates and to slower deactivation than similar active structures supported on γ-Al2O3 or SiO2 [11] ,[37] . C3H8 dehydrogenation on 0.5 wt% PtSn/MgAl2O4 at 823 K, 39 kPa, and a space velocity of 9 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) led to 9397% C3H6 selectivity and 1112% C3H8 conversion [11] . Deactivation rate constants obtained from forward reaction rates (0.05 h1) were lower than on PtSn/γ-Al2O3(0.11 h1) [7] , but much greater than reported here on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (0.008 h1).

3. 将Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5与之前报道的烷烃脱氢催化剂进行比较，Pt和PtSn物种在非酸性支撑材料（如MgAl2O4）上，导致较低的裂解和聚合化速率以及较慢的失活速率，与在γ-Al2O3或SiO2上支持的类似活性结构相比[11],[37]。在823 K、39 kPa和9 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)空间速度下，0.5 wt% PtSn/MgAl2O4上的C3H8脱氢产生了93%-97%的C3H6选择性和11%-12%的C3H8转化率[11]。从向前反应速率推导出的失活速率常数（0.05 h−1）低于在γ-Al2O3上支持的PtSn（0.11 h−1）[7]，但高于此处报道的Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5（0.008 h−1）。
