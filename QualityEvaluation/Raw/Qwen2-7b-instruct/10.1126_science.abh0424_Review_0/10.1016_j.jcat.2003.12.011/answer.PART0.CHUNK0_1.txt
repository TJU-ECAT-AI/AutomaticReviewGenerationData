Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing efficient coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This approach significantly reduces process complexity and costs compared to traditional multistage systems. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, for instance, demonstrates the potential for high energy efficiency and optimized process design by enabling high propane dehydrogenation rates with high alkene selectivities and yields, alongside selective H2 combustion, all facilitated by a single-stage system. This method avoids the cyclic operation typical of multistage systems, leading to enhanced economic viability and streamlined manufacturing processes.
