Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and staged O2 introduction for selective H2 removal. Abstract Small Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5-protected channels catalyze C3H8 and C2H6 dehydrogenation with unprecedented turnover rates and catalyst stability. Alkene selectivities are greater than 97% at near-equilibrium alkane conversions. Mild oxidative treatments fully restored initial catalytic rates and selectivities.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing the unique properties of small metal clusters within protected channels of shape-selective zeolites. This allows for high turnover rates and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for alkanes like C3H8 and C2H6. By staging the introduction of O2, selective H2 removal can be achieved, enhancing alkene yields beyond equilibrium. This method reduces process complexity and costs compared to traditional multi-stage systems, optimizing energy efficiency and process integration.

1. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing simultaneous or sequential execution of these steps on a single catalyst. This approach enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the need for multiple reactors and the associated energy costs, as well as minimizing the potential for product contamination. It achieves this by designing catalysts that can efficiently catalyze a series of reactions, where the output of one reaction serves as the input for the next, creating a seamless integration of processes.

2. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the potential implications of tandem catalysis for energy efficiency and process optimization. By coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, it achieves high yields and selectivities for the desired products. This is particularly noteworthy as it operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional three-stage processes, thereby reducing energy consumption and improving economic viability. Moreover, the single-stage system eliminates the need for complex, cyclic operations, simplifying the overall process and further enhancing its efficiency and sustainability.

3. In comparison to a three-stage cyclic process, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst system provides a more efficient and streamlined approach to achieving high C3H6 yields. While the three-stage process can achieve yields around 30% with high selectivity, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst surpasses this, offering enhanced yields through staged oxygen introduction. This demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis in achieving superior performance in chemical synthesis, particularly in terms of yield and selectivity.

4. The staged oxygen introduction technique employed by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst enables selective H2 combustion, even when hydrocarbons are the predominant reactants. This is a critical aspect of tandem catalysis, as it ensures that oxygen is efficiently utilized to drive desired reactions while avoiding wasteful or detrimental side reactions. The fact that staged oxygen introduction can achieve yield enhancements of 1.6 for propane dehydrogenation and 1.58 for hydrogen combustion at lower temperatures compared to three-stage processes highlights its potential to revolutionize industrial chemical synthesis, offering both efficiency gains and economic benefits.

3. 相比于三阶段循环过程，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂系统在实现高C3H6产率方面提供了更高效和精炼的方法。虽然三阶段过程可以达到约30%的高选择性产率，但In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂超越了这一水平，通过分阶段氧气引入实现了增强产率。这凸显了串联催化在化学合成中实现优越性能的潜力，特别是在产率和选择性方面的表现。

4. In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂所采用的分阶段氧气引入技术允许选择性氢燃烧，即使烃类是主要反应物时也是如此。这是串联催化的关键方面，因为它确保了氧气被有效利用来驱动所需反应，避免了浪费或有害的副反应。分阶段氧气引入能够实现1.6的丙烷脱氢产率增强和1.58的氢燃烧产率增强，与三阶段过程相比在较低温度下进行，这强调了其在工业化学合成中的革命潜力，提供效率提升和经济效益。

1. Introduction
The selective conversion of light alkanes to alkenes provides an attractive route to useful chemicals [1] . Several alkane dehydrogenation processes [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] use supported Cr oxide catalysts. Recently developed dehydrogenation processes are based on supported Pt catalysts [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . Both Pt and Cr catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent oxidative regenerations, which increase process complexity and capital and operating costs. Alkene yields are often limited by thermodynamics and the resulting low conversions introduce significant recycle and separation costs.

1. The selective conversion of light alkanes into alkenes offers a promising method for producing valuable chemicals. Various alkane dehydrogenation techniques, including those utilizing supported chromium oxide catalysts, have been developed recently. However, both platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) catalysts experience rapid degradation, necessitating frequent oxidative rejuvenations. This leads to increased process complexity, higher capital and operational expenses, and often limits alkene yields due to thermodynamic constraints, resulting in inefficient recycling and separation processes.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 in a packed-bed plug-flow reactor
C3H8 dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were measured on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst at 793 K, 25 kPa C3H8, and 4.178.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity in a plug-flow reactor ( Table 2 ). The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 under these conditions is 36%. This catalyst led to near-equilibrium C3H6 yields (35%) with 97% C3H6 selectivity, and a net C3H6 formation turnover rate of 1.4 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) at 4.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity. These net rates are similar to those reported (1.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) at 792 K and slightly lower space velocities (3.5 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) on 0.35 wt% PtSn/γ-Al2O3; these previously reported rates, however, decreased rapidly with time on stream [7] .

3.2. Comparison of Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 with previously reported alkane dehydrogenation catalysts
Pt and PtSn species on nonacidic supports, such as MgAl2O4, lead to lower cracking and oligomerization rates and to slower deactivation than similar active structures supported on γ-Al2O3 or SiO2 [11] ,[37] . C3H8 dehydrogenation on 0.5 wt% PtSn/MgAl2O4 at 823 K, 39 kPa, and a space velocity of 9 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) led to 9397% C3H6 selectivity and 1112% C3H8 conversion [11] . Deactivation rate constants obtained from forward reaction rates (0.05 h1) were lower than on PtSn/γ-Al2O3(0.11 h1) [7] , but much greater than reported here on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (0.008 h1).
