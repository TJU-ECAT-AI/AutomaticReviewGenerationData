[1] "High C3H8 dehydrogenation rates with high alkene selectivities and yields and unprecedented catalyst stability were achieved using Pt clusters residing within shape-selective channels in Na-[Fe]ZSM5."
[2] "Staged O2 introduction led to the combustion of H2 with 90% selectivity on these catalysts, even when hydrocarbons were predominant components in reacting mixtures."
[3] "Alkene yields higher than equilibrium by a factor of 1.6 were achieved for C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at 773 and 723 K, respectively."
[4] "These enhancements are significantly higher than previously reported with a more complex three-stage selective H2 combustion scheme."

1. The use of Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5 allows for high rates of dehydrogenation of C3H8 with high selectivity for alkene products, and unprecedented stability of the catalyst.
2. Staged introduction of O2 leads to selective combustion of H2, achieving 90% selectivity even when hydrocarbons dominate the reactant mixture.
3. For C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at temperatures of 773 and 723 K, respectively, yields exceeding equilibrium by a factor of 1.6 were accomplished.
4. The results surpass those obtained with a complex three-stage selective H2 combustion process, demonstrating the effectiveness of the staged O2 introduction method.

1. 使用位于Na-[Fe]ZSM5中的Pt簇允许以高速率脱氢C3H8并获得高烯烃选择性，以及催化剂的非凡稳定性。
2. 分阶段引入O2导致选择性燃烧H2，即使在反应混合物中碳氢化合物占主导地位时也能实现90%的选择性。
3. 对于在773和723 K温度下进行的C2H6和C3H8脱氢，分别实现了超过平衡状态的1.6倍产率。
4. 结果超越了使用复杂三段式选择性H2燃烧过程的结果，证明了分阶段引入O2方法的有效性。
