Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and staged O2 introduction for selective H2 removal. Abstract Small Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5-protected channels catalyze C3H8 and C2H6 dehydrogenation with unprecedented turnover rates and catalyst stability. Alkene selectivities are greater than 97% at near-equilibrium alkane conversions. Mild oxidative treatments fully restored initial catalytic rates and selectivities.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing the unique properties of small metal clusters within protected channels of shape-selective zeolites. This allows for high turnover rates and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for alkanes like C3H8 and C2H6. By staging the introduction of O2, selective H2 removal can be achieved, enhancing alkene yields beyond equilibrium. This method reduces process complexity and costs compared to traditional multi-stage systems, optimizing energy efficiency and process integration.
