<p>Although considerable progress has been made in direct synthesis gas (syngas) conversion to light olefins (C2=C4=) via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), the wide product distribution remains a challenge, with a theoretical limit of only 58% for C2C4 hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%.</p>
<p>This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties.</p>
<p>The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1).</p>
<p>Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat.</p>
<p>In the absence of MSAPO (corresponding to Mode 1 of Fig. 2A), syngas was converted mainly to CH4 (selectivity 53%), and selectivity to C2C4 hydrocarbons was only 38% over ZnCrOx.</p>
<p>Upon combination with MSAPO, which was packed below the oxide and separated by a layer of inert quartz wool (Mode 2), the products shifted and C2C4 selectivity increased to 69% containing 23% C2=C4=, whereas CH4 selectivity dropped to 26%.</p>
<p>Analysis of the effluent by TOF-MS shows that *C species were removed via hydrogenation forming hydrocarbons (fig. S7, b to d) (9).</p>
<p>In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D) in addition to stable hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p>When syngas was fed into the reactor in the absence of catalysts (a blank experiment), no other signal was observed.</p>
<p>By contrast, the composite catalyst delivered rather stable performance in OX-ZEO. No obvious degradation of CO conversion was observed for operation as long as 650 hours (fig. S13).</p>
<p>However, it is still a challenge to synthesize zeolites with a weaker acidity but without reducing the number of active sites (necessary to achieve a reasonable conversion).</p>

The document describes a bifunctional catalyst that enables selective conversion of syngas to light olefins. This catalyst, consisting of a zinc-chromium oxide and a zeolite, achieves high selectivity and stability, surpassing theoretical limits. The zinc-chromium oxide activates CO and H2, while the zeolite controls CC coupling within its acidic pores. The catalyst's performance is demonstrated to reach 80% C2=C4= selectivity and 94% C2C4 selectivity at 17% CO conversion. The process allows for the use of syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low H2/CO ratio. The document also discusses the potential for tuning the catalyst's acidity to optimize olefin formation and explores the possibility of adjusting hydrocarbon distribution through the shape selectivity of zeolites. However, challenges remain in synthesizing zeolites with weaker acidity without compromising the number of active sites.

文档描述了一种双功能催化剂，它能够选择性地将合成气转化为轻质烯烃。该催化剂由锌铬氧化物和沸石组成，实现了高选择性和稳定性，超过了理论极限。锌铬氧化物激活了CO和H2，而沸石在其酸性孔内控制了CC耦合。催化剂的性能显示，在17% CO转化率下，可以达到80%的C2=C4=选择性和94%的C2C4选择性。该过程允许使用煤炭和生物质来源的合成气，其中氢气与一氧化碳的比例较低。文档还讨论了通过调整沸石的酸性来优化烯烃形成的可能性，并探索了通过沸石形状选择性调整不同大小烃类分布的可能性。然而，挑战在于合成具有较弱酸性的沸石，同时不减少活性位点的数量。
