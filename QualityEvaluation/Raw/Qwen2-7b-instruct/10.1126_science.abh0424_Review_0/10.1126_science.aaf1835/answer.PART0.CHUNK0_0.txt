<p>Although considerable progress has been made in direct synthesis gas (syngas) conversion to light olefins (C2=C4=) via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), the wide product distribution remains a challenge, with a theoretical limit of only 58% for C2C4 hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>The key challenge of selective formation of light olefins from syngas lies in precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation.</p>
<p>The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1).</p>
<p>Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat).</p>
<p>In addition, Mode 3, where the oxides and MSAPO were packed in an alternating sequence and thus the transport distance was reduced, also leads to enhanced C2=C4= selectivity (65% at 7714 ml/h·gcat).</p>
<p>The above results show that reaction via methanol may not be the dominating pathway in OX-ZEO, although it cannot be excluded completely, whereas ketene likely plays an important role.</p>
<p>The capability of the partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores.</p>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the OX-ZEO process, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing a bifunctional catalyst that combines two types of active sites with complementary properties. This allows for precise control of carbon-carbon (CC) coupling, suppression of overhydrogenation, and reduction of methane formation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. The process demonstrates high selectivity for light olefins (up to 94%) and shows promise for utilizing syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H2/CO) ratio. The OX-ZEO process showcases how the combination of different catalyst types can optimize energy efficiency and process optimization by controlling the reaction pathways and product distributions effectively.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念，如在OX-ZEO过程中所体现的，通过利用具有互补性质的两种活性位点组合的双功能催化剂来解决化学工程过程中的多个反应步骤集成的挑战。这允许对碳-碳（CC）耦合进行精确控制，抑制过氢化和减少甲烷的形成。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活一氧化碳（CO）和氢气（H2），而分子筛孔内的酸性环境则调节CC耦合。该过程显示出高达94%的轻烯烃选择性，并且对于利用煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气（H2/CO比低）有潜力。OX-ZEO过程展示了不同催化剂类型的结合如何优化能源效率和过程优化，通过有效地控制反应路径和产品分布。
