[1] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."
[2] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[3] "This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS."
[4] "We attribute the efficiency of the OX-ZEO process to the bifunctionality of the catalyst, with two types of active sites exhibiting complementary and compatible properties."
[5] "The catalyst beds after reaction, representing Mode 1 to 4 from left to right: Mode 1, the catalyst contains ZnCrOx only; Mode 2, MSAPO packed below ZnCrOx, separated by an inert layer of quartz wool; Mode 3, MSAPO and ZnCrOx packed in an alternating sequence and separated by quartz wool; Mode 4, MSAPO and ZnCrOx well mixed."
[6] "This result shows that reaction intermediates generated over the oxides must have transported in the gas phase toward the active sites of MSAPO, where they were converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase."
[7] "In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D) in addition to stable hydrocarbon products."
[8] "In contrast, a composite catalyst with almost no medium strength acidic sites had a similar product distribution, as the catalyst contained no zeolite."
[9] "These findings open up a new avenue for development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, which may allow utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, exemplified by the bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al., addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing two types of active sites with complementary properties. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. This approach allows for higher conversion rates and avoids deactivation, surpassing the best values reported for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTTO) and exceeding the maximum predicted by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model in typical Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The bifunctionality of the catalyst enables precise control over the reaction pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency. The use of different packing modes (Modes 1-4) for the catalyst components facilitates the transport of reaction intermediates in the gas phase, ensuring their conversion to desired products. The detection of ketene and other intermediates using synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) confirms the active role of these species in the catalytic process. The ability to tune the acidity of the zeolite component, as indicated by the NH3 desorption peak temperature, allows for modulation of the olefin/paraffin ratio. These findings open up new avenues for developing syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

纳米尺度串联催化概念，通过由Jiao等人开发的双功能催化剂实现，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。利用两种具有互补性质的活性位点，该双功能催化剂实现了更高的转化率并避免了失活现象。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，而介孔酸性沸石中的受限酸性环境则控制了CC耦合。这种策略不仅提高了转化率，还超过了FTTO的最佳值，并超过了典型Fischer-Tropsch合成中C2C4烃预测的最大值。双功能催化剂的使用允许精确控制反应路径，从而提高选择性和效率。不同包装模式（模式1-4）对于催化剂组分的使用促进了气体相中反应中间体的运输，确保了其向所需产品的转化。使用同步辐射基团真空紫外光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）检测到酮烯和其他中间体，证实了这些物种在催化过程中的积极作用。通过NH3脱附峰温度调节沸石组件的酸度，可以调节烯烃/烷烃的比例。这些发现开辟了新的途径来开发合成气到烯烃技术，可能使煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气在低H2/CO比下得到应用。
