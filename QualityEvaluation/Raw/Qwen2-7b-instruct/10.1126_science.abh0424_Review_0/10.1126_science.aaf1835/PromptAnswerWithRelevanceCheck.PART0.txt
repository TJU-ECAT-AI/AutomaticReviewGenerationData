<p>Although considerable progress has been made in direct synthesis gas (syngas) conversion to light olefins (C2=C4=) via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), the wide product distribution remains a challenge, with a theoretical limit of only 58% for C2C4 hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>The key challenge of selective formation of light olefins from syngas lies in precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation.</p>
<p>The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1).</p>
<p>Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat).</p>
<p>In addition, Mode 3, where the oxides and MSAPO were packed in an alternating sequence and thus the transport distance was reduced, also leads to enhanced C2=C4= selectivity (65% at 7714 ml/h·gcat).</p>
<p>The above results show that reaction via methanol may not be the dominating pathway in OX-ZEO, although it cannot be excluded completely, whereas ketene likely plays an important role.</p>
<p>The capability of the partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores.</p>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the OX-ZEO process, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing a bifunctional catalyst that combines two types of active sites with complementary properties. This allows for precise control of carbon-carbon (CC) coupling, suppression of overhydrogenation, and reduction of methane formation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. The process demonstrates high selectivity for light olefins (up to 94%) and shows promise for utilizing syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H2/CO) ratio. The OX-ZEO process showcases how the combination of different catalyst types can optimize energy efficiency and process optimization by controlling the reaction pathways and product distributions effectively.

<p>The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.</p>
<p>For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup.</p>
<p>Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong).</p>
<p>A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>The key challenge of selective formation of light olefins from syngas lies in precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation.</p>
<p>This C2C4 selectivity is far beyond the maximum predicted by the ASF model in FTS.</p>
<p>The bifunctionality of the catalyst, with two types of active sites exhibiting complementary and compatible properties, enables the separation of CO activation and CC coupling.</p>
<p>Activation of the CO bond has been reported previously for surfaces promoted with oxygen vacancies, for example, Fe3O4, CoOx/TiO2, Cu/ZnO (0001), and ZnGa2O4.</p>
<p>The precursor of hydrocarbons, CHx species formed over ZnCrOx, are likely the intermediates in the OX-ZEO process.</p>
<p>In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D).</p>
<p>Further varying the photon energy (fig. S10) confirmed that this signal was unambiguously attributed to ketene CH2CO, considering the m/z ratio and the ionization energy.</p>
<p>Such CH2 species are very active and readily react with CO in the presence of CO, forming a relatively less reactive ketene, which is detectable by SVUV-PIMS.</p>
<p>The olefin/paraffin ratio increased with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature and reached 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C (Fig. 3C).</p>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining different catalysts in a single system, allowing for sequential reactions to occur efficiently. This approach optimizes energy usage and process flow, potentially leading to significant improvements in energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst integrates catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating how tandem catalysis can enhance both the selectivity and yield of desired products. By controlling the properties of each catalyst, such as acidity and pore structure, the tandem catalyst system can fine-tune the reaction pathways to achieve higher conversion rates and product selectivity, thereby maximizing the overall efficiency of the chemical process.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, exemplified by the bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al., addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by utilizing two types of active sites with complementary properties. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. This approach allows for higher conversion rates and avoids deactivation, surpassing the best values reported for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTTO) and exceeding the maximum predicted by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model in typical Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The bifunctionality of the catalyst enables precise control over the reaction pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency. The use of different packing modes (Modes 1-4) for the catalyst components facilitates the transport of reaction intermediates in the gas phase, ensuring their conversion to desired products. The detection of ketene and other intermediates using synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) confirms the active role of these species in the catalytic process. The ability to tune the acidity of the zeolite component, as indicated by the NH3 desorption peak temperature, allows for modulation of the olefin/paraffin ratio. These findings open up new avenues for developing syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

纳米尺度串联催化概念，通过由Jiao等人开发的双功能催化剂实现，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。利用两种具有互补性质的活性位点，该双功能催化剂实现了更高的转化率并避免了失活现象。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，而介孔酸性沸石中的受限酸性环境则控制了CC耦合。这种策略不仅提高了转化率，还超过了FTTO的最佳值，并超过了典型Fischer-Tropsch合成中C2C4烃预测的最大值。双功能催化剂的使用允许精确控制反应路径，从而提高选择性和效率。不同包装模式（模式1-4）对于催化剂组分的使用促进了气体相中反应中间体的运输，确保了其向所需产品的转化。使用同步辐射基团真空紫外光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）检测到酮烯和其他中间体，证实了这些物种在催化过程中的积极作用。通过NH3脱附峰温度调节沸石组件的酸度，可以调节烯烃/烷烃的比例。这些发现开辟了新的途径来开发合成气到烯烃技术，可能使煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气在低H2/CO比下得到应用。

<p>The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1).</p>
<p>Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat.</p>

The document describes a bifunctional catalyst that enables selective conversion of syngas to light olefins. This catalyst, consisting of a zinc-chromium oxide and a zeolite, achieves high selectivity and stability, surpassing theoretical limits. The zinc-chromium oxide activates CO and H2, while the zeolite controls CC coupling within its acidic pores. The catalyst's performance is demonstrated to reach 80% C2=C4= selectivity and 94% C2C4 selectivity at 17% CO conversion. The process allows for the use of syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low H2/CO ratio. The document also discusses the potential for tuning the catalyst's acidity to optimize olefin formation and explores the possibility of adjusting hydrocarbon distribution through the shape selectivity of zeolites. However, challenges remain in synthesizing zeolites with weaker acidity without compromising the number of active sites.
