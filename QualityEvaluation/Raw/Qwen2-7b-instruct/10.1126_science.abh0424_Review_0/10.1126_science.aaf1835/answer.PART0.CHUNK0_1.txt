<p>The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.</p>
<p>For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup.</p>
<p>Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong).</p>
<p>A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>The key challenge of selective formation of light olefins from syngas lies in precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation.</p>
<p>This C2C4 selectivity is far beyond the maximum predicted by the ASF model in FTS.</p>
<p>The bifunctionality of the catalyst, with two types of active sites exhibiting complementary and compatible properties, enables the separation of CO activation and CC coupling.</p>
<p>Activation of the CO bond has been reported previously for surfaces promoted with oxygen vacancies, for example, Fe3O4, CoOx/TiO2, Cu/ZnO (0001), and ZnGa2O4.</p>
<p>The precursor of hydrocarbons, CHx species formed over ZnCrOx, are likely the intermediates in the OX-ZEO process.</p>
<p>In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D).</p>
<p>Further varying the photon energy (fig. S10) confirmed that this signal was unambiguously attributed to ketene CH2CO, considering the m/z ratio and the ionization energy.</p>
<p>Such CH2 species are very active and readily react with CO in the presence of CO, forming a relatively less reactive ketene, which is detectable by SVUV-PIMS.</p>
<p>The olefin/paraffin ratio increased with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature and reached 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C (Fig. 3C).</p>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining different catalysts in a single system, allowing for sequential reactions to occur efficiently. This approach optimizes energy usage and process flow, potentially leading to significant improvements in energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst integrates catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating how tandem catalysis can enhance both the selectivity and yield of desired products. By controlling the properties of each catalyst, such as acidity and pore structure, the tandem catalyst system can fine-tune the reaction pathways to achieve higher conversion rates and product selectivity, thereby maximizing the overall efficiency of the chemical process.
