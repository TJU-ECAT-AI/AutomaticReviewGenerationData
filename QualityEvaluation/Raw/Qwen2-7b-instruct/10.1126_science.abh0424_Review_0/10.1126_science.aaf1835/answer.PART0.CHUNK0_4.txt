<p>The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1).</p>
<p>This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B.</p>
<p>Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15).</p>
<p>Activation of the CO bond has been reported previously for surfaces promoted with oxygen vacanciesfor example, Fe3O4 (16), CoOx/TiO2 (17), Cu/ZnO (0001) (18), and ZnGa2O4 (19).</p>
<p>In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D) in addition to stable hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p>Such CH2 species are very active and readily react with CO in the presence of CO, forming a relatively less reactive ketene (26, 27), which is detectable by SVUV-PIMS.</p>
<p>The product selectivity can be modulated by the medium strength acidity, characterized by temperature-programmed-desorption (TPD) of NH3, with the peak maximum located in the range from 350 to 410C.</p>
<p>These findings open up a new avenue for development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, which may allow utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. utilizes a partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) to activate CO and H2, followed by CC coupling within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This method prevents deactivation, achieves high selectivity for light olefins, and surpasses the theoretical limits of conventional catalysts. The catalyst system allows for the efficient conversion of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio. The process enables precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation, leading to improved energy efficiency and process optimization in syngas-to-olefin technologies.

由Jiao等人开发的双功能催化剂利用部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，随后在酸性孔道内进行CC耦合。这种方法可以防止失活，实现轻烯烃的高选择性，并超越了传统催化剂的理论极限。该催化体系允许高效地将煤炭和生物质衍生的煤气化为氢气与一氧化碳比例较低的气体。该过程能够精确控制CC耦合，同时抑制过氢化和甲烷形成，从而提高能源效率并优化煤气化到烯烃技术的过程。
