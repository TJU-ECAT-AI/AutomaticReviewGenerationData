1. The use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits unique and unexpected catalytic properties, leading to exceptional selectivity towards olefin products, notably propene and ethene.
2. The application of boron nitride materials demonstrates extraordinary selectivity for propene, surpassing many reported conditions in the field of ODHP.
3. Comparative analysis of critical reaction parameters across various catalysts is provided in table S1.
4. The study confirms the durability of the boron nitride catalyst, showing stable catalytic activity for at least 32 hours without degradation (figure S2).
5. The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of boron nitride (BN), which functions similarly to inorganic peroxide species, capable of performing oxidation reactions.
