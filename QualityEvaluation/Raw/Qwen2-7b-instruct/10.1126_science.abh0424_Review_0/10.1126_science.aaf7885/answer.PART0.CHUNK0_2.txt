[1] "Despite the vast progress in supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the selectivity to propene remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."
[2] "At 14% propane conversion, we obtain selectivity of 79% propene and 12% ethene, another desired alkene."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[4] "We found that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as an active site for the ODHP reaction."
[5] "This site shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11)."
[6] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical."

The study demonstrates how the use of boron nitride (BN) materials, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), can significantly enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propene with exceptional selectivity. These BN materials offer superior selectivity to propene (79% at 14% propane conversion) and ethene (12% at 14% propane conversion), surpassing traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The proposed active site for this reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, denoted as (>BOON<). This site facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane by abstracting hydrogen atoms from secondary carbons, generating a B-OH species and a nitroxyl radical. The one-dimensional nature of this edge structure helps stabilize the propyl radical and prevents overoxidation, leading to high olefin selectivity. The overall catalytic cycle involves the formation of a di-propoxyl intermediate, the desorption of propene, and regeneration of the active site through the desorption of water and oxygen addition. This innovative approach showcases the potential of BN materials in improving the efficiency and selectivity of chemical reactions, particularly in the production of propene from propane.

研究显示，使用硼氮（BN）材料，特别是六方硼氮（h-BN）和硼氮纳米管（BNNTs），可以在氧化脱氢反应中显著提高丙烷（ODHP）转化为丙烯的选择性。这些BN材料在丙烷转化率为14%时，能够提供高达79%的丙烯选择性和12%的乙烯选择性，超过传统的二氧化钒催化剂。提出的活性位点是BN的氧终止的臂椅边缘，标记为（>BOON<）。该位点通过从二级碳原子抽象氢原子来促进丙烷的脱氢作用，生成B-OH物种和一个硝基自由基。这种一维边缘结构的性质有助于稳定丙基自由基并防止过氧化，从而实现高烯烃选择性。整个催化循环涉及形成二丙氧基中间体、丙烯的释放和活性位点的再生，通过水的释放和氧气的添加。这种创新方法展示了BN材料在提高化学反应效率和选择性方面的潜力，特别是在从丙烷生产丙烯方面。
