The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling efficient sequential reactions on a single catalyst surface. This approach can significantly enhance energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, in the context of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it facilitates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. By operating these reactions in tandem, the catalyst can convert propane into propene through dehydrogenation and simultaneously utilize the generated hydrogen for combustion, thereby achieving a more integrated and efficient chemical process.

[1] "Despite the vast progress in supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the selectivity to propene remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."
[2] "At 14% propane conversion, we obtain selectivity of 79% propene and 12% ethene, another desired alkene."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[4] "We found that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as an active site for the ODHP reaction."
[5] "This site shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11)."
[6] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical."

The study demonstrates how the use of boron nitride (BN) materials, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), can significantly enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propene with exceptional selectivity. These BN materials offer superior selectivity to propene (79% at 14% propane conversion) and ethene (12% at 14% propane conversion), surpassing traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The proposed active site for this reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, denoted as (>BOON<). This site facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane by abstracting hydrogen atoms from secondary carbons, generating a B-OH species and a nitroxyl radical. The one-dimensional nature of this edge structure helps stabilize the propyl radical and prevents overoxidation, leading to high olefin selectivity. The overall catalytic cycle involves the formation of a di-propoxyl intermediate, the desorption of propene, and regeneration of the active site through the desorption of water and oxygen addition. This innovative approach showcases the potential of BN materials in improving the efficiency and selectivity of chemical reactions, particularly in the production of propene from propane.

研究显示，使用硼氮（BN）材料，特别是六方硼氮（h-BN）和硼氮纳米管（BNNTs），可以在氧化脱氢反应中显著提高丙烷（ODHP）转化为丙烯的选择性。这些BN材料在丙烷转化率为14%时，能够提供高达79%的丙烯选择性和12%的乙烯选择性，超过传统的二氧化钒催化剂。提出的活性位点是BN的氧终止的臂椅边缘，标记为（>BOON<）。该位点通过从二级碳原子抽象氢原子来促进丙烷的脱氢作用，生成B-OH物种和一个硝基自由基。这种一维边缘结构的性质有助于稳定丙基自由基并防止过氧化，从而实现高烯烃选择性。整个催化循环涉及形成二丙氧基中间体、丙烯的释放和活性位点的再生，通过水的释放和氧气的添加。这种创新方法展示了BN材料在提高化学反应效率和选择性方面的潜力，特别是在从丙烷生产丙烯方面。

[1] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins."
[2] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[3] "Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[5] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling the sequential execution of reactions on the same catalyst support. This approach optimizes energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for inter-stage separation and re-introduction of reactants, thus reducing energy consumption and enhancing yield. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, allowing for a seamless transition from one reaction to the next without significant energy loss or additional processing steps.

In this specific case, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates the efficient conversion of propane into propene through dehydrogenation while simultaneously promoting the combustion of excess hydrogen. This tandem operation reduces the overall energy requirement and improves the yield of propene compared to separate processes. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant, as this method could lead to more sustainable and cost-effective industrial chemical production processes.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining different catalysts in a single system, allowing for sequential reactions to occur efficiently. This approach can lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and process optimization, particularly in cases where multiple reactions are required to produce a desired product. As an example, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst integrates catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, enhancing the overall yield and selectivity of the desired products.

In the context of the literature provided, the potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization can be seen through the high selectivity demonstrated by boron nitride (BN) materials, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propene. The extraordinary selectivity to propene, along with the ability to control reaction parameters, showcases how tandem catalysis at the nanoscale can be tailored to optimize specific reaction conditions, leading to more efficient production processes.

Furthermore, the proposed active site for the ODHP reaction, an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (denoted as >BOON<), highlights the innovative design of catalysts that can selectively facilitate the desired chemical transformations while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This insight into the reaction mechanism provides a theoretical foundation for further development and optimization of catalytic systems, potentially revolutionizing industrial chemical processes by enabling more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods.
