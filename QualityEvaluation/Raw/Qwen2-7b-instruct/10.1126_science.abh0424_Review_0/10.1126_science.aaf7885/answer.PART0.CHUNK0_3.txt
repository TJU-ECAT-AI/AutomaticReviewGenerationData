[1] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins."
[2] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[3] "Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[5] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling the sequential execution of reactions on the same catalyst support. This approach optimizes energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for inter-stage separation and re-introduction of reactants, thus reducing energy consumption and enhancing yield. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, allowing for a seamless transition from one reaction to the next without significant energy loss or additional processing steps.

In this specific case, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates the efficient conversion of propane into propene through dehydrogenation while simultaneously promoting the combustion of excess hydrogen. This tandem operation reduces the overall energy requirement and improves the yield of propene compared to separate processes. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant, as this method could lead to more sustainable and cost-effective industrial chemical production processes.

纳米尺度的串联催化概念通过在相同的催化剂载体上顺序执行反应来解决将多个反应步骤集成到化学工程过程中的挑战。这种方法通过最小化中间阶段分离和重新引入反应物的需求，从而优化能源效率和过程优化，减少了能量消耗并提高了产率。例如，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂展示了催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧的耦合，允许从一个反应无缝过渡到下一个，而无需重大能量损失或额外的处理步骤。

在这个特定情况下，In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过脱氢高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时促进过剩氢的燃烧。这种串联操作减少了整体能量需求，并提高了丙烯的产率，相比于单独的过程。对于能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是重大的，因为这种方法可能导致更可持续和成本效益更高的工业化学品生产过程。
