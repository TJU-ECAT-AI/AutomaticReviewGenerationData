[1] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[2] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[3] "This site shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11)."
[4] "These >BOON< sites can be viewed as inorganic peroxide species able to perform oxidation reactions."
[5] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling efficient sequential reactions on a single catalyst surface. This approach can significantly enhance energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, in the context of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it facilitates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. By operating these reactions in tandem, the catalyst can convert propane into propene through dehydrogenation and simultaneously utilize the generated hydrogen for combustion, thereby achieving a more integrated and efficient chemical process.

纳米尺度上的串联催化方法通过在单一催化剂表面上实现多个反应步骤的高效集成，解决了化学工程过程中的挑战。这种方法可以显著提高能效和工艺优化。例如，在In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂的情况下，它能够将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合起来。通过串联运行这些反应，催化剂可以在同一表面上同时进行丙烷转化为丙烯的脱氢反应和生成的氢气的燃烧，从而实现更集成和高效的化学过程。
