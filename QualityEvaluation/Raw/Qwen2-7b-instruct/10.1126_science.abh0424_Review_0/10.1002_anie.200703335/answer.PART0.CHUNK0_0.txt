[1] "In general, an active catalyst for a consecutive reaction (ABC) usually has two types of active sites, one of which accelerates the reaction of A to B and the other the reaction of B to C."
[2] "However, a crucial factor that affects the product selectivity of this consecutive reaction is the ease of migration of the first reaction products to the active sites of the second reaction."
[3] "To enhance the ease of migration of the reactants to the active sites and improve the selectivity of this consecutive reaction we have designed a novel bifunctional catalyst with a core/shell structure where the core and shell components independently catalyze the different reactions."
[4] "This core/shell bifunctional catalyst is expected to show high selectivity in a consecutive reaction as it improves the collision possibility between intermediates and active sites significantly."
[5] "The H-beta membrane is coated directly onto the surface of a Co/Al2O3 pellet by a hydrothermal synthesis method."
[6] "The surface EDS analysis results confirm the integrity of the zeolite membrane on the Co/Al2O3 pellet."
[7] "The experimental results confirm that a compact H-beta zeolite membrane without cracks can be directly synthesized on the surface of a Co/Al2O3 pellet by a hydrothermal method."
[8] "For the mixture of Co/Al2O3 and zeolite, there is no spatial restriction between the FTS and hydrocracking/isomerization reactions, which means that this is a random process and the two reactions occur independently."
[9] "In contrast, the core/shell structure of the zeolite-coated catalyst provides an integrated, confined reaction environment."
[10] "Furthermore, the zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst shows a highly desirable lower methane selectivity than that of the normal FTS catalyst."
[11] "The CO conversion of the zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly lower than with the other catalysts, which can be ascribed to coverage of some of the Co active sites by the zeolite coating."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a confined reaction environment within a core/shell catalyst. This design allows for spatially controlled reactions, improving selectivity and efficiency. By independently catalyzing different reactions within the core and shell, the catalyst can enhance the collision probability between intermediates and active sites, leading to high selectivity. This tailored confinement also results in shape selectivity and lower methane selectivity compared to traditional catalysts, optimizing the process for cleaner, more efficient synthesis of desired products.

The implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. The ability to control reaction pathways precisely reduces unwanted side reactions and waste, conserving energy and resources. Lower methane selectivity minimizes the need for additional purification steps, streamlining the production process. The improved selectivity and reduced CO conversion loss due to catalyst coverage by the zeolite coating contribute to a more efficient use of reactants and catalysts, ultimately enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the chemical process.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过在核壳催化剂中创建受限反应环境，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种设计允许空间控制反应，提高选择性和效率。通过在核心和壳层中独立催化不同的反应，催化剂可以增强中间体与活性位点之间的碰撞概率，从而实现高选择性。这种定制的限制还导致形状选择性和较低的甲烷选择性，优化了对所需产品的合成过程。

对于能源效率和过程优化的影响是重大的。精确控制反应路径减少了不必要的副反应和浪费，节省了能源和资源。较低的甲烷选择性减少了额外净化步骤的需求，简化了生产流程。改进的选择性和由于由沸石涂层覆盖的钴活性位点引起的CO转化率降低，有助于更有效地利用反应物和催化剂，最终提高了化学过程的整体能源效率。
