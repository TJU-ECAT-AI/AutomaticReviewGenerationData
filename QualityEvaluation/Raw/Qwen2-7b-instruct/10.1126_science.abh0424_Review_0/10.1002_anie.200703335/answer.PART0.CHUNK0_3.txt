[1] "This kind of membrane catalyst could be extended to various other consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and the core catalyst."
[2] "The FTS sites convert the syngas into linear hydrocarbons, which then migrate to the acidic sites where they undergo further hydrocracking and isomerization to form branched hydrocarbons."
[3] "The zeolite membrane might therefore restrict the adsorption of CO and H2 onto the active Co sites to some extent."
[4] "Furthermore, a shape selectivity for the reactants and/or products may also be expected since molecules of different sizes have a different diffusion efficiency in the membrane channels."
[5] "The membrane-coated catalyst has a much larger membrane area per unit reactor volume than conventional membrane reactors, which is another reason for the high selectivity for isoparaffins."
[6] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a spatially confined reaction environment. This allows for the sequential processing of reactants through a series of catalysts, each optimized for a specific reaction step. By doing so, it enhances energy efficiency and process optimization. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating how such a system can efficiently convert propane into more valuable products while simultaneously managing the combustion of excess hydrogen. The use of a core-shell structure with a tailored membrane allows for precise control over the diffusion of reactants and products, leading to improved selectivity and reduced unwanted side reactions. This modular design offers flexibility in scaling and adapting the catalyst system to various industrial needs, making it a promising approach for enhancing the efficiency of multi-step chemical processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化方法通过创建一个空间受限的反应环境，解决了将多个反应步骤集成到化学工程过程中的挑战。这允许一系列催化剂进行顺序处理，每个催化剂都优化用于特定的反应步骤。这样做提高了能源效率和过程优化。以In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂为例，它耦合了丙烷催化脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，展示了如何有效地将丙烷转化为更有价值的产品，同时同时管理过剩氢的燃烧。使用核心壳结构以及定制的膜允许精确控制反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高选择性和减少不必要的副反应。这种模块化设计提供了在不同工业需求下调整催化剂系统的能力，使其成为增强多步化学过程效率的有前景的方法。
