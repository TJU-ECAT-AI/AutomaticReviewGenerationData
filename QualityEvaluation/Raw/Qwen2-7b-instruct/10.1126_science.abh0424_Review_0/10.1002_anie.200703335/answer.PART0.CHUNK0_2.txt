[1] "This kind of membrane catalyst could be extended to various other consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and the core catalyst."
[2] "Improving the dispersion of these two kinds of active sites whilst ensuring they are still close to each other is the most efficient approach to enhancing catalytic performance."
[3] "The zeolite membrane might therefore restrict the adsorption of CO and H2 onto the active Co sites to some extent."
[4] "Furthermore, the simple preparation method of this membrane-coated catalyst has great potential for practical applications."
[5] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a confined reaction environment within a core-shell structure. This allows for spatially controlled reactions, improving selectivity and efficiency. The shell membrane and core catalyst are independent components that can be tailored for different reactions, facilitating a more streamlined and optimized process. This method can extend to various consecutive reactions, offering a versatile solution for complex chemical transformations. The simple preparation method also suggests practical applicability, enhancing the energy efficiency and effectiveness of chemical engineering processes.
