[1] "This kind of membrane catalyst could be extended to various other consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and the core catalyst."
[2] "The combination of a conventional FTS catalyst and a zeolite is an effective method for producing isoparaffins in one step since zeolites, owing to their acidic sites, are hydrocracking/isomerization catalysts."
[3] "For example, the frequently used templates containing Cl or Br ions as well as the conventional ion-exchange method for obtaining H-type zeolite from Na-type zeolite via NH3-type zeolite could not be used because even small amounts of Cl, Br, or Na+ ions will deactivate the FTS catalyst completely."
[4] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a spatially confined reaction environment within a core/shell catalyst. This allows for better control over the selectivity and efficiency of consecutive reactions, such as the synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas. By modifying the shell membrane and core catalyst, this type of membrane catalyst can be adapted for various other consecutive reactions. Its potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization include more controlled and selective conversions, leading to higher yields of desired products with reduced waste and energy consumption.
