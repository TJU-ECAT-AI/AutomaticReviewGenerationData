[1] "This kind of membrane catalyst could be extended to various other consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and the core catalyst."
[2] "For example, the frequently used templates containing Cl or Br ions as well as the conventional ion-exchange method for obtaining H-type zeolite from Na-type zeolite via NH3-type zeolite could not be used because even small amounts of Cl, Br, or Na+ ions will deactivate the FTS catalyst completely."
[3] "It is clear from Figure5 that the conventional Co/Al2O3 FTS catalyst exhibits a wide product distribution in which straight-chain hydrocarbons are the main products."
[4] "The zeolite-coated catalyst gives a completely different product distribution to the other two samples as the product distribution deviates from the ASF law and the formation of heavy paraffins (C12+) is completely suppressed."
[5] "Furthermore, the middle isoparaffins are now the main products. This difference is caused by the unique core/shell structure of the zeolite-coated catalyst."
[6] "The CO conversion of the zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly lower than with the other catalysts, which can be ascribed to coverage of some of the Co active sites by the zeolite coating."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by creating a spatially confined reaction environment. This allows for optimized sequential reactions, improving energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the core/shell catalyst discussed in the document produces a tailored confined reaction environment, resulting in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity. This is exemplified by the direct synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas, where the formation of heavy paraffins is suppressed, and the middle isoparaffins become the main products. The CO conversion of the zeolite-coated catalyst is slightly lower due to the coverage of some of the Co active sites by the zeolite coating, but the selectivity for isoparaffins is significantly enhanced compared to conventional catalysts.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过创建一个空间限制的反应环境，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这允许优化连续反应，提高能效和过程优化。例如，文中提到的核壳催化剂产生了一个定制的受限反应环境，导致空间限定效应和形状选择性。这以直接从合成气合成异构烷烃为例得到体现，其中重烷烃的形成被完全抑制，中间异构烷烃成为主要产物。由于部分钴活性位点被沸石涂层覆盖，该涂层催化剂的CO转化率略低，但与传统催化剂相比，异构烷烃的选择性显著增强。
