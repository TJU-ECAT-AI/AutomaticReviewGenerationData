[1] "In the present work, a bifunctional catalyst that contains partially reducible metal oxides (In2O3) and H-form Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5) zeolites exhibits an excellent performance for the direct production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation with a high selectivity."
[2] "Such results thus suggest a promising potential for its industrial application."
[3] "Industry-relevant tests using the pellet catalyst were carried out to show that tail-gas recycling could improve further the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons, which suggests a promising prospect for industrial applications."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This approach enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by allowing for the sequential execution of reactions in a single catalyst system, thereby reducing the need for additional processing steps and minimizing energy consumption. The potential implications for industrial applications include the development of more sustainable and efficient processes for converting hydrocarbons into valuable products, contributing to the advancement of cleaner energy technologies.
