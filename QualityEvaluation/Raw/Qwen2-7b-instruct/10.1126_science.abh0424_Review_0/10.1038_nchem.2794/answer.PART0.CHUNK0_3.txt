[1] "Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline, directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high CC coupling barrier."
[2] "The oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and CC coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons with a high octane number."
[3] "The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial applications."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining catalysts that perform distinct but complementary functions within close proximity. This allows for the efficient and selective conversion of reactants into desired products, minimizing unwanted side reactions. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it combines the steps of coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The In2O3 component activates and converts CO2 to methanol, while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst efficiently dehydrates propane to propene, and selectively combusts excess H2. The proximity of these catalysts enhances the system's overall efficiency and selectivity, leading to optimized processes with reduced waste and energy consumption. The potential implications include significant improvements in energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and streamlined manufacturing processes.

纳米尺度串联催化通过将执行不同但互补功能的催化剂结合在一起，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这允许高效和选择性地将反应物转化为所需的产品，同时最小化不必要的副反应。对于In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂来说，它将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧的步骤结合在一起。In2O3部分激活并转化CO2为甲醇，而Pt/Al2O3催化剂则高效地将丙烷脱水为丙烯，并选择性地燃烧多余的H2。这些催化剂的邻近性提高了系统的整体效率和选择性，导致了能源消耗减少和环境影响减小的优化过程。潜在的影响包括显著提高能效、减少环境影响和简化制造流程。
