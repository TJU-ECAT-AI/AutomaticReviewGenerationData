[1] "The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling a more efficient and compact system. This approach allows for the sequential execution of reactions in a single reactor, reducing the complexity and footprint of chemical plants."
[2] "The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By minimizing the need for intermediate product handling and reducing the overall system size, tandem catalysis can lead to substantial energy savings and cost reductions. This is particularly advantageous in industries requiring the processing of large volumes of raw materials, such as petrochemicals and refining."
[3] "As an example, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion demonstrates how tandem catalysis can be applied in practice. This catalyst integrates two reactions - dehydrogenation and combustion - into a single process, thereby streamlining the production of olefins and improving the energy efficiency of the overall chemical process."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining two or more catalysts into a single system, where the products of one reaction serve as reactants for the next. This approach can enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the number of steps needed and minimizing the waste generated between reactions. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the tandem catalysis allows for the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The In2O3 component facilitates the initial dehydrogenation reaction, while the Pt/Al2O3 component enables the subsequent selective combustion of the resulting olefins, thus optimizing the entire process.

[1] "Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline, directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high CC coupling barrier."
[2] "The oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and CC coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons with a high octane number."
[3] "The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial applications."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining catalysts that perform distinct but complementary functions within close proximity. This allows for the efficient and selective conversion of reactants into desired products, minimizing unwanted side reactions. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it combines the steps of coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The In2O3 component activates and converts CO2 to methanol, while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst efficiently dehydrates propane to propene, and selectively combusts excess H2. The proximity of these catalysts enhances the system's overall efficiency and selectivity, leading to optimized processes with reduced waste and energy consumption. The potential implications include significant improvements in energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and streamlined manufacturing processes.
