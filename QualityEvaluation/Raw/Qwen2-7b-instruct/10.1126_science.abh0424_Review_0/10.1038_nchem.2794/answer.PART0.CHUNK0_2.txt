[1] "The bifunctional catalyst consists of a metal oxide (In2O3) with a small particle size of about 10nm (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) and a high specific surface area of 120m2g−1 (Supplementary Table 1), and a HZSM-5 zeolite with a hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure with a mesopore diameter of 4nm (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3a)."
[2] "The C5+ selectivity in hydrocarbon distribution reached up to 78.6% with only 1% for CH4 selectivity at a CO2 conversion of 13.1% (Fig. 1a)."
[3] "The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[4] "Industry-relevant tests using the pellet catalyst were carried out to show that tail-gas recycling could improve further the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons, which suggests a promising prospect for industrial applications."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining two or more catalysts into a single system, where the products of one reaction serve as reactants for the next. This approach can enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the number of steps needed and minimizing the waste generated between reactions. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the tandem catalysis allows for the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The In2O3 component facilitates the initial dehydrogenation reaction, while the Pt/Al2O3 component enables the subsequent selective combustion of the resulting olefins, thus optimizing the entire process.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过将两种或更多催化剂组合到一个系统中，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法可以通过减少所需步骤的数量和减少反应之间产生的废物来提高能量效率和过程优化。对于In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂来说，串联催化允许催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧之间的耦合。In2O3部分促进初始脱氢反应，而Pt/Al2O3部分则能够对产生的烯烃进行选择性燃烧，从而优化整个过程。
