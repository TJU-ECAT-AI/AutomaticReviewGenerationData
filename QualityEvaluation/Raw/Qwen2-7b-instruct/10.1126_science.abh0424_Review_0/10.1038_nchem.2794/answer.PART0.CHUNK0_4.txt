[1] "The bifunctional catalyst consists of a metal oxide (In2O3) with a small particle size of about 10nm (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) and a high specific surface area of 120m2g1 (Supplementary Table 1), and a HZSM-5 zeolite with a hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure with a mesopore diameter of 4nm (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3a)."
[2] "There was no obvious catalyst deactivation over 150 hours, and a much better performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons was observed using a pellet catalyst with internal gas recycling."
[3] "Industry-relevant tests using the pellet catalyst were carried out to show that tail-gas recycling could improve further the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to C5+ hydrocarbons, which suggests a promising prospect for industrial applications."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing the sequential execution of distinct reactions on different catalysts. This approach enhances energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the overall energy consumption and increasing the selectivity of the desired products. In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, demonstrating the potential for efficient and integrated chemical transformations that can streamline industrial processes and minimize waste.
