[1] "The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling a more efficient and compact system. This approach allows for the sequential execution of reactions in a single reactor, reducing the complexity and footprint of chemical plants."
[2] "The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By minimizing the need for intermediate product handling and reducing the overall system size, tandem catalysis can lead to substantial energy savings and cost reductions. This is particularly advantageous in industries requiring the processing of large volumes of raw materials, such as petrochemicals and refining."
[3] "As an example, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion demonstrates how tandem catalysis can be applied in practice. This catalyst integrates two reactions - dehydrogenation and combustion - into a single process, thereby streamlining the production of olefins and improving the energy efficiency of the overall chemical process."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale enables a more efficient and compact system for integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes. This approach facilitates the sequential execution of reactions within a single reactor, reducing complexity and footprint, which in turn enhances energy efficiency and process optimization. An example of this is the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, streamlining the production of olefins and improving the energy efficiency of the chemical process.
