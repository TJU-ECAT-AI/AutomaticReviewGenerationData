[1] "The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications."
[2] "One possible way in this direction is to identify the active sites or key atomic structures1,2 and, for the most part, to use this knowledge for catalyst design and preparation."
[3] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[4] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction16."
[5] "Acidbase, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2 can also be controlled through crystallite size."
[6] "The active site consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes."
[7] "ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of- the-art catalysts."
[8] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[9] "The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size."
[10] "To validate the importance of such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 C before testing in PDH at the same temperature."
[11] "Our DFT calculations also predict that oxygen vacancies are easier formed through removal of lattice oxygen by CO than by H2."
[12] "This result suggests that propene and cracking products are formed on different sites."
[13] "Such positive effect holds over a broad range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6)."
[14] "An insight into the formation and the kind of carbon deposits, which are the main undesired reaction product, was derived from the operando UV-vis analysis upon PDH over three ZrO2 samples with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites."
[15] "The obtained UV-vis spectra expressed as the relative KubelkaMunk function (F(Rrel) in Eq. (2)) after different times on propane stream are shown in Fig. 2ac."
[16] "Importantly, the duration of this induction period increased with a decrease in the size of ZrO2 crystallites (Supplementary Fig. 8)."
[17] "From a mechanistic point of view, adsorbed propene molecules interact with each other to initially form small aromatic structures followed by further oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures."
[18] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size (Fig. 3b)."
[19] "When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity."
[20] "The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f)."
[21] "Although the concentration of Zrcus can be adjusted in a controlled manner through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, further improvements are expected when the coordination number of zirconium cations, their location on certain facets and/or the shape of crystallites can also be tuned."
[22] "Owing to the presence of such defects, this typically non-reducible metal oxide showed unexpectedly high activity in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene and outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts possessing supported metal oxides or platinum."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, being an environmentally friendly process compared to oil-based cracking technologies. It contributes to the overall propene production growth with new plants under construction. The catalyst type, specifically ZrO2, plays a crucial role in its efficiency.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring costly treatments like chlorine or chloride compounds for re-dispersing platinum. The strategy to mitigate its formation involves designing ZrO2 catalysts that maximize the concentration of active sites without using dopants or supported species.

3. The PDH process benefits from ZrO2 catalysts with small crystallite sizes, which increase the concentration of catalytically active Zrcus sites. Treating ZrO2 with reducing agents like H2 or CO can also increase the rate of propene formation.

4. Coke formation during PDH can be explained by the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. The duration of an induction period before coke formation increases with smaller crystallite sizes.

5. Adsorbed propene molecules interact to form small aromatic structures, which undergo oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures. This process is influenced by the size of the ZrO2 crystallites, affecting the rate and selectivity of propene formation.

6. The PDH process exhibits a consistent activity order across different alkanes, but the dehydrogenation rate increases with decreasing crystallite size. At higher temperatures, the catalysts become less durable but maintain high productivity.

7. The coordination number, location on facets, and shape of ZrO2 crystallites can be tuned for further improvements in the PDH process. ZrO2 catalysts with small crystallite sizes show higher activity and selectivity in PDH compared to traditional catalysts.

8. ZrO2 catalysts with oxygen defects, specifically surface coordinately unsaturated Zr cations, show unexpectedly high activity in PDH, surpassing state-of-the-art catalysts. The oxygen defects facilitate the formation of propene and hydrogen with lower activation barriers.

9. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZrO2 facilitates the formation of propene and hydrogen through alternative pathways. This allows for the homolytic activation of the CH bond in alkanes without involving lattice oxygen.

10. The coke formation process is influenced by the size of the ZrO2 crystallites, with a longer induction period for smaller crystallites. This indicates the need for specific conditions to prevent or control coke formation during PDH.
