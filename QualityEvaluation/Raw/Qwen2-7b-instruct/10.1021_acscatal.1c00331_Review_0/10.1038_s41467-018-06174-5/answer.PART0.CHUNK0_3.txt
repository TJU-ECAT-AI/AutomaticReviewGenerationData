[1] "The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications."
[2] "One possible way in this direction is to identify the active sites or key atomic structures1,2 and, for the most part, to use this knowledge for catalyst design and preparation."
[3] "The present study elucidates at molecular level the effects of nanostructure of bare ZrO2 on the activity and selectivity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane or iso-butane to the corresponding olefins."
[4] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[5] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
[6] "Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane1820."
[7] "Acidbase, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2 can also be controlled through crystallite size."
[8] "No effect of the area would be visible if this catalyst property determined the activity exclusively."
[9] "The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size."
[10] "To validate the importance of such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 C before testing in PDH at the same temperature."
[11] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b)."
[12] "Such positive effect holds over a broad range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6)."
[13] "An insight into the formation and the kind of carbon deposits, which are the main undesired reaction product, was derived from the operando UV-vis analysis upon PDH over three ZrO2 samples with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites."
[14] "On the basis of the above discussion, the effect of the size of ZrO2 crystallites on coke formation can be explained as follows."
[15] "The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f)."
[16] "Methylene CH bond activation in propane: To identify the active sites and the modes of methylene CH bond dissociation on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface, we computed this route on a centre consisting either of one Zr site and one O site or two O sites."
[17] "The presence of oxygen defect was established to be essential for breaking the CH bond in CH4, too."
[18] "The most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred way for Zr6cI iso-C3H7 conversion is the cleavage of the methyl CH bond at the Zr6cIII site (Supplementary Fig. 20)."
[19] "When one H atom is subtracted from the methyl group of Zr5cIiso-C3H7 stabilized on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 21), weakly adsorbed propene (0.46 eV) is formed (TS2, Fig. 6)."
[20] "Moreover, CH4 activation on the latter centre is exothermic by 1.06 eV."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production. Key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Industrial applications aim for environmental sustainability and efficiency. Challenges involve health risks from catalysts containing Cr(VI) and the high cost and deactivation of Pt-based catalysts.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by leading to catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2-based catalysts, which are eco-friendly and cost-efficient.
