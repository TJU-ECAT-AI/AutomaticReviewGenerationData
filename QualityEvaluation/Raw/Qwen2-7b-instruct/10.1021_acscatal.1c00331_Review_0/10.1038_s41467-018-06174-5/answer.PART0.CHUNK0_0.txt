[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and leading to deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using catalysts with controlled surface properties, employing mild reaction conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxidation. Key considerations include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, catalyst types, such as Pt or CrOx, and industrial applications, such as environmental friendliness compared to oil-based cracking technologies. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces the surface area available for reactions, leading to deactivation and inefficiency. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using catalysts with controlled surface properties, employing mild reaction conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯而不进行氧化来实现。关键考虑因素包括反应条件，如温度和压力，催化剂类型，如Pt或CrOx，以及工业应用，如与基于石油的裂解技术相比的环保性。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成减少了可用的反应表面区域，导致失活，从而影响过程效率。缓解此问题并提高催化剂再生的策略包括使用具有控制表面性质的催化剂，采用温和的反应条件，并开发先进的再生技术以恢复催化剂活性。
