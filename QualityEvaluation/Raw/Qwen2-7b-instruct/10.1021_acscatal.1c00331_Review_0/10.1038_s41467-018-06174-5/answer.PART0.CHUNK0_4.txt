[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications."
[3] "This process is endothermic by 0.42 eV and has an activation barrier of 0.67 eV, which is slightly lower than that (0.74 eV) required for the activation of Zr6cIiso-C3H7 over the stoichiometric surface."
[4] "The concentration of anion vacancies in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size."
[5] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15."
[6] "The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH2123, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site."

1. Ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes compared to oil-based cracking technologies due to the lower impurities in natural or shale gas feedstocks. These processes are crucial for producing C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry.

2. The development of rational principles for designing heterogeneous catalysts plays a critical role in advancing sustainable global development and environmental protection applications.

3. The formation of propene from iso-C3H7 over the d-ZrO2(111) surface involves breaking the methyl CH bond, which is a slightly more exothermic process (by 0.42 eV) and has a lower activation barrier (0.67 eV) compared to the activation of Zr6cIiso-C3H7 over the stoichiometric surface.

4. The concentration of anion vacancies in ZrO2 can be manipulated by controlling the size of its crystallites.

5. Commercial catalysts often contain flaws associated with supported CrOx or Pt species, which can lead to issues such as occupational health risks and catalyst deactivation due to sintering.

6. The active site involved in the homolytic CH bond dissociation differs from what was previously proposed for doped ZrO2-based catalysts and other metal oxides used for PDH, where metal cations and neighboring lattice oxygen were thought to form the active site.

1. 与基于天然或页岩气的原料相比，乙烷蒸汽裂解和丙烷或异丁烷的脱氢过程在化学工业中提供了大量C2C4烯烃，因此更加环保。这些过程对于生产C2C4烯烃至关重要。

2. 合理设计异质催化剂的基本原理的发展对全球可持续发展和环境保护应用至关重要。

3. 在d-ZrO2(111)表面形成丙烯从iso-C3H7过程中，通过断裂甲基CH键，这是一个稍微更放热的过程（差值为0.42 eV）且激活能更低（0.67 eV），相比在纯相表面上激活Zr6cIiso-C3H7的激活能（0.74 eV）。

4. 可以通过控制其晶粒大小来调节ZrO2中的阴离子空位浓度。

5. 商业催化剂通常包含与支持CrOx或Pt物种相关的问题，这可能导致诸如职业健康风险和由于烧结导致的催化剂失效等问题。

6. 在进行CH键异裂时，参与反应的活性位点与之前对掺杂ZrO2基催化剂的提议以及用于PDH的其他金属氧化物有所不同，在这些氧化物中，金属离子和相邻晶格氧被认为形成了活性位点。
