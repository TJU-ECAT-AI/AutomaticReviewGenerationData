[1] "The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications."
[2] "For example, owing to the well-defined structure (size and/or shape) and composition of nanoparticles of metals or metal oxides, they are successfully used for the development of supported catalysts with controlled properties."
[3] "The present study elucidates at molecular level the effects of nanostructure of bare ZrO2 on the activity and selectivity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane or iso-butane to the corresponding olefins."
[4] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occu- pational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt- based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
[5] "Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane1820."
[6] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b)."
[7] "An insight into the formation and the kind of carbon deposits, which are the main undesired reaction product, was derived from the operando UV-vis analysis upon PDH over three ZrO2 samples with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites."
[8] "Importantly, the duration of this induction period increased with a decrease in the size of ZrO2 crystallites (Supplementary Fig. 8)."
[9] "Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic sites (Supplementary Fig. 15)."
[10] "This result is in agreement with previous DFT calculations predicting that the energy for the formation of an oxygen vacancy in ZrO2 lowers for nanoscale particles44."
