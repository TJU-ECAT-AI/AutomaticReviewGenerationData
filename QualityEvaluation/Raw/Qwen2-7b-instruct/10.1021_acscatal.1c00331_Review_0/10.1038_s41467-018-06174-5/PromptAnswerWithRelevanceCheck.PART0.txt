[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and leading to deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using catalysts with controlled surface properties, employing mild reaction conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxidation. Key considerations include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, catalyst types, such as Pt or CrOx, and industrial applications, such as environmental friendliness compared to oil-based cracking technologies. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces the surface area available for reactions, leading to deactivation and inefficiency. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using catalysts with controlled surface properties, employing mild reaction conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, being an environmentally friendly process compared to oil-based cracking technologies. It contributes to the overall propene production growth with new plants under construction. The catalyst type, specifically ZrO2, plays a crucial role in its efficiency.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring costly treatments like chlorine or chloride compounds for re-dispersing platinum. The strategy to mitigate its formation involves designing ZrO2 catalysts that maximize the concentration of active sites without using dopants or supported species.

3. The PDH process benefits from ZrO2 catalysts with small crystallite sizes, which increase the concentration of catalytically active Zrcus sites. Treating ZrO2 with reducing agents like H2 or CO can also increase the rate of propene formation.

4. Coke formation during PDH can be explained by the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. The duration of an induction period before coke formation increases with smaller crystallite sizes.

5. Adsorbed propene molecules interact to form small aromatic structures, which undergo oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures. This process is influenced by the size of the ZrO2 crystallites, affecting the rate and selectivity of propene formation.

6. The PDH process exhibits a consistent activity order across different alkanes, but the dehydrogenation rate increases with decreasing crystallite size. At higher temperatures, the catalysts become less durable but maintain high productivity.

7. The coordination number, location on facets, and shape of ZrO2 crystallites can be tuned for further improvements in the PDH process. ZrO2 catalysts with small crystallite sizes show higher activity and selectivity in PDH compared to traditional catalysts.

8. ZrO2 catalysts with oxygen defects, specifically surface coordinately unsaturated Zr cations, show unexpectedly high activity in PDH, surpassing state-of-the-art catalysts. The oxygen defects facilitate the formation of propene and hydrogen with lower activation barriers.

9. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZrO2 facilitates the formation of propene and hydrogen through alternative pathways. This allows for the homolytic activation of the CH bond in alkanes without involving lattice oxygen.

10. The coke formation process is influenced by the size of the ZrO2 crystallites, with a longer induction period for smaller crystallites. This indicates the need for specific conditions to prevent or control coke formation during PDH.
