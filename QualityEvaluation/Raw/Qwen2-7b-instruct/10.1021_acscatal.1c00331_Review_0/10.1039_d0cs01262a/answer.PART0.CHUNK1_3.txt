The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and concentration of reactants. Catalyst types, particularly precious metals like palladium and platinum, play a crucial role in the efficiency of PDH. Industrial applications involve the integration of PDH into petrochemical processes for propene production. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in catalyst efficiency and a reduction in propene yield. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, using promoter metals to enhance catalyst activity, and implementing advanced catalyst design techniques such as alloying and surface modification.
