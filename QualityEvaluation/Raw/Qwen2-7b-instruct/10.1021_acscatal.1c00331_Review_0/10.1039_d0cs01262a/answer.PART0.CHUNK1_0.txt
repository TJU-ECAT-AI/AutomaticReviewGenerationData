The main obstacle to the commercialization of DRM is the carbon formation on Ni-based catalysts. The rate ratio of the CH oxidation route to the C oxidation route coupled with the CO dissociation barrier can be used to measure the carbon formation probability. Kinetic analysis shows that the activity order for DRM is Ni(111) > Ni3C(001) > Ni(211) > Ni3C(111). Ni(111) catalysts exhibit the highest activity and the best carbon resistance.

商业化的最大障碍是Ni基催化剂上的碳形成。CH氧化途径与C氧化途径的速率比，结合CO解离壁垒，可以用来衡量碳形成的概率。动力学分析显示，DRM的活性顺序为Ni(111) > Ni3C(001) > Ni(211) > Ni3C(111)。Ni(111)催化剂具有最高的活性和最佳的碳抵抗力。

The mechanism of synthesis gas formation in the partial oxidation of methane (POM) is not yet fully understood despite numerous studies. A Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) redox cycle was postulated based on the study. It is crucial to further clarify the reaction mechanism from a microscopic perspective due to the ongoing controversy in the POM mechanism.

[1] "The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane."
[2] "For propane and propylene, the weakest CH bond has a bond energy of 4.16 and 3.74 eV respectively."
[3] "To achieve high selectivity, the weakest CH or CC bond in the olefin has to be less than 0.31 eV weaker than the weakest CH bond in the reacting paraffin."

The only raw material capable of achieving high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane. For propane and propylene, the weakest C-H bond has a bond energy of 4.16 and 3.74 eV, respectively. To attain high selectivity, the weakest C-H or C-C bond in the olefin must be no more than 0.31 eV weaker than the weakest C-H bond in the reacting paraffin.

唯一能够实现高选择性到烯烃的原料是乙烷，因为乙烯相对于乙烷在氧气中足够不活跃。对于丙烷和丙烯，最弱的C-H键的键能分别为4.16和3.74 eV。为了达到高选择性，烯烃中最弱的C-H或C-C键必须不超过0.31 eV弱于反应的饱和烷烃中最弱的C-H键。
