<p>Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide,polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on- purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydro- genation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts.</p>
<p>Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehy- drogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydro- gen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydro- genation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step,which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340</p>
<p>The critical challenges in ethane and propane dehydrogena- tion and oxidative dehydrogenation are the selectivities to olefins and coke formation. The DFT calculations and kinetic analysis unravel useful fundamental insights into these key challenges at the molecular level, where the difference in the desorption energy of olefins and the activation energy of deep dehydrogenation of surface intermediates is used as the descriptor. Computational catalysis suggested Pt-based alloys as the best candidates for industrial catalysts by lowering the olefin desorption energy.</p>
<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides is an attractive alter- native for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins due to the breaking of the thermodynamic limitation and in situ supply of heat for highly endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. However, the critical challenge in olefin selectivity still remains due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations elucidated the active sites and surface reactions responsible for the formation of olefins, COx, and other byproducts. The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT model- ing, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy. However, it also provides huge opportunities to tune the oxygen activity to reduce the CC bond cleavage and oxidation to COx. Oxides are a large family and present numerous oxide structures. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed the catalysts activity dependence on the oxide identity, doping, cluster size,and supports. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity was identified as the descriptor to describe the oxygen activity. However, a thorough screening of a huge number of oxide structures to find appropriate catalyst candi- dates for a given reaction remains a formidable challenge.</p>

1. Propylene is a key petrochemical product used in various industries. Its production traditionally involves steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts. With growing demand and the advent of shale gas, on-purpose propylene production, particularly through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is becoming more viable. PDH is an endothermic process typically conducted at around 600°C using PtSn or CrOx catalysts supported on Al2O3. Efforts to improve Pt-based catalyst performance include doping with additional promoters and modifying carriers. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane follows the MVK mechanism, which generates oxygen vacancies on the surface and facilitates the formation of oxygen on the surface. To overcome thermodynamic limitations, an oxidant is added to the reaction feed to produce water, releasing heat. However, for propane ODH, olefin products are easily oxidized, necessitating operation at lower temperatures to achieve higher selectivity. Propane dehydrogenation is kinetically controlled, with the activation of the CH bond as the rate-determining step requiring higher temperatures.

2. The key challenges in ethane and propane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation are achieving high olefin selectivity and minimizing coke formation. Computational catalysis identifies Pt-based alloys as optimal candidates by lowering olefin desorption energy. Oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides offers an alternative for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins, overcoming thermodynamic limitations and providing in situ heat supply for endothermic reactions. However, olefin selectivity remains a challenge due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations reveal the active sites and surface reactions leading to olefin, COx, and other byproducts. Lattice oxygen plays a central role, influencing oxygen activity and providing opportunities to reduce CC bond cleavage and COx formation. The activity of oxide catalysts depends on factors such as oxide identity, doping, cluster size, and supports. Oxygen vacancy formation energy or hydrogen affinity serves as a descriptor for oxygen activity, but thoroughly screening a vast number of oxide structures for specific reactions remains a daunting task.
