[1] "The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."
[2] "For the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity."
[3] "Clearly, the propane molecule experiences more attractive interactions from the stepped surface than those from the flat surface because there exists a larger contact area between them,and the strength of dispersion forces tends to increase with increasing molecular size."
[4] "Propylene binds preferentially to the Pt3Sn(111) surface in the dis mode to the p mode. The adsorption energy on Pt(111) obtained with the vdWDF functional agrees well with the experimental desorption energy determined using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements."
[5] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."

1. The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process typically uses platinum (Pt)- and chromium (Cr)-based catalysts, and it is performed at approximately 600°C on alumina-supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. 

2. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH), the reaction products are prone to oxidation into CO and CO2, necessitating a lower operating temperature to achieve higher selectivity for propene.

3. Propane molecules interact more strongly with stepped surfaces than flat surfaces due to the increased contact area, which enhances the dispersion forces and their strength with molecular size.

4. Propylene prefers to adsorb in the dis mode on the Pt3Sn(111) surface compared to the p mode. The calculated adsorption energy on Pt(111) using the vdWDF functional aligns well with the experimental desorption energy measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).

5. The increased rate of coke formation on smaller platinum clusters is attributed to their larger surface area, leading to quicker coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

1. 烯烃脱氢（PDH）过程通常使用铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）基催化剂，在大约600°C下在氧化铝支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂上进行。

2. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中，反应产物容易被氧化为CO和CO2，因此需要较低的操作温度来获得更高的丙烯选择性。

3. 由于接触面积的增加，使得分散力的强度随着分子大小的增加而增强，丙烷分子与阶梯表面的相互作用比平坦表面更强烈。

4. 丙烯倾向于以dis模式吸附在Pt3Sn(111)表面上，而不是p模式。使用vdWDF功能计算的Pt(111)上的吸附能与通过温度程序化脱附（TPD）测量的实验脱附能很好地匹配。

5. 小型铂簇中焦炭形成速率的增加是由于其较大的表面积，导致更快的焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。
