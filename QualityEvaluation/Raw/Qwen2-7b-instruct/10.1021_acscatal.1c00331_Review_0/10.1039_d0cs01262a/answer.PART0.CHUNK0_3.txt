1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the C-H bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations include reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types can vary widely, including metals like palladium and nickel, which are known for their effectiveness in PDH. Industrial applications often involve complex reactor designs to optimize the conversion of propane to propene. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to decreased propene yield and increased maintenance costs. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with high resistance to carbon deposition, such as Ni-Rh alloys, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

2. The size-dependent activity of steam reforming of methane (SRM) and dry reforming of methane (DRM) is influenced by the metal particle size. Smaller particles tend to exhibit higher activity due to a larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites that can act as active sites. The activity of SRM on Ni catalysts, for instance, was found to decrease with increasing particle size because the most active Ni(211) surface fraction decreases. This suggests that stabilizing Ni catalysts with particles sizes around 6 nanometers could enhance activity for SRM reactions. For DRM, Ni catalysts also show a positive size dependence, meaning that smaller particles have higher activity compared to larger particles.

3. Catalysts that can reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal are crucial for mitigating coke formation, which is a common issue in SRM and DRM. By alloying Ni with metals like Au, Ru, Rh, Co, Pt, Ag, and Sn, it is possible to create bimetallic catalysts that maintain or even improve the activity for SRM reactions while reducing the likelihood of carbon deposition. For example, NiRh, NiRu, and NiPt alloys have been shown to be effective in this regard. These catalysts offer a cost-effective solution to the problem of catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation, potentially extending the operational life of SRM and DRM processes.

1. 直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产方法，通过断裂丙烷分子中的C-H键来实现。关键考虑因素包括反应条件，如温度、压力和合适的催化剂。催化剂类型可以非常多样，包括铂金、镍等，这些金属在PDH中表现出良好的效能。工业应用往往涉及复杂的反应器设计，以优化丙烷向丙烯的转化。铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低催化剂的活性和选择性，导致丙烯产量下降和维护成本增加。为了减轻焦炭形成，可以采用高抗碳沉积能力的催化剂，如Ni-Rh合金，并实施先进的再生技术来恢复催化剂活性。

2. 蒸汽重整甲烷（SRM）和干式重整甲烷（DRM）的尺寸依赖性活性受金属颗粒尺寸的影响。较小的颗粒倾向于表现出更高的活性，因为它们拥有更多的未协调表面位点，可以作为活性位点。例如，对于SRM，Ni催化剂的活性随着颗粒尺寸的增大而降低，因为最活跃的Ni(211)表面面积减少。这表明稳定Ni催化剂，使其颗粒大小约为6纳米，可以增强SRM反应的活性。对于DRM，Ni催化剂也显示出正的尺寸依赖性，意味着较小的颗粒具有比较大颗粒更高的活性。

3. 可以通过将Ni与Au、Ru、Rh、Co、Pt、Ag、Sn等金属合金化来制造能够减少甲烷分解并增强表面反应去除碳沉积的催化剂，这对于缓解碳沉积问题至关重要，这是SRM和DRM过程中的常见问题。例如，NiRh、NiRu和NiPt合金已被证明在这方面是有效的。这些催化剂提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，可以延长SRM和DRM过程的使用寿命，由于减少了碳沉积的可能性。
