[1] "4.1.1 Adsorption of propane and propylene on metal surfaces. In the last few decades, the activation of CH bonds of propane over transition-metal and alloy surfaces has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally."
[2] "The surface reaction of PDH can lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on these surfaces."
[3] "As for the C3 species, propane and propylene are the reactant and the desired main product,respectively,347,348 and their adsorption on metal surfaces has been the subject of extensive research."
[4] "Generally, because the propane molecule is a saturated compound and has no unpaired electron, there is no hybridization between propane and metal d states, and therefore propane is physisorbed on the metal surfaces."
[5] "Clearly, the propane molecule experiences more attractive interactions from the stepped surface than those from the flat surface because there exists a larger contact area between them,and the strength of dispersion forces tends to increase with increasing molecular size."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of an oxidant to assist in the dehydrogenation process. Catalyst types, such as Pt-based alloys, are chosen for their ability to efficiently activate the CH bonds of propane, leading to propene production. Industrial applications of PDH involve its use in petrochemical industries for the production of various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy costs for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include modifying the catalyst structure to weaken the adsorption strength of propylene and suppress the deep dehydrogenation reactions. This can be achieved by alloying Pt with other metals or adjusting the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles. Additionally, the use of co-feeding hydrogen can decrease the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors and increase the number of free sites on the Pt surface, enhancing catalytic activity.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的手段，通过催化剂促进一系列化学反应将丙烷分子转化为丙烯。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和氧化剂的存在，以辅助脱氢过程。选择如铂基合金等催化剂类型，因其能够高效激活丙烷中的CH键，从而实现丙烯生产。工业应用涉及在石油化工行业中生产各种化学品，如丙烯氧化物、聚丙烯和丙烯腈。

焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的表面面积，导致催化活性下降并增加再生能量成本。为了减少焦炭形成，可以采用修改催化剂结构的方法来减弱丙烯的吸附强度并抑制深度脱氢反应。这可以通过合金化铂与其他金属或调整铂纳米颗粒的大小来实现。此外，通过共供给氢可以减少深度脱氢产物的覆盖度并增加铂表面的自由位点数量，增强催化活性。

For supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, the influence of supports and the dispersion of VOx on propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been extensively studied. The binding strength of the surface lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in determining the activities and selectivities for propane ODH. The active sites vary depending on the structure of the catalyst on the surface. On a supported VOx monolayer on TiO2(001), the activation of the CH bond in propane occurs through a concerted mechanism at the VO site, resulting in the formation of a metal hydride and adsorbed propoxide.

[1] "The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers."
[2] "Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period."

The size of the cluster must be balanced between activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx can yield a high propylene output, a finding recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and colleagues. Recently, Xiong and his team discovered that the PDH reaction can be split into two stages during the reduction of VOx by propane: an initial period where oxidative dehydrogenation is dominant leading to the formation of propylene, water, and CO2, and a later period where oxidative dehydrogenation is not the dominant process.
