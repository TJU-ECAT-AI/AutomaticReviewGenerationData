To function as a method for propene production, the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) relies on the breaking of the thermodynamic limitations of highly endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. Key considerations include the selection of appropriate catalyst types, such as Pt-based alloys, which can lower the olefin desorption energy. Industrial applications of PDH require strategies to mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which can impede the catalytic activity and lead to faster deactivation. Coke formation on these catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the availability of active sites, necessitating frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation might include the use of promoters, such as Sn, to weaken propylene adsorption, or the introduction of hydrogen to decrease the desorption barrier for propylene. This can improve propene selectivity and minimize coke formation. Additionally, the use of novel catalyst structures, such as bimetallic alloys or core-shell structures, can help maintain high activity, selectivity, and stability with reduced coking potential.

为了将丙烷的直接脱氢作为丙烯生产的手段，氧化脱氢在氧化物上的应用因其打破热力学限制和原位提供高吸热脱氢反应所需热量而成为有吸引力的选择。工业应用中需要注意的关键考虑因素包括选择合适的催化剂类型，如降低烯烃脱附能的铂基合金。丙烷脱氢和氧化脱氢过程面临的挑战在于选择性地生成烯烃和焦炭的形成。通过分子水平上的描述，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和动力学分析揭示了这些关键挑战，其中烯烃脱附能与表面中间体深度脱氢的活化能之间的差异被用作描述符。计算催化建议铂基合金作为工业催化剂的最佳候选者，以降低烯烃脱附能。氧化脱氢在氧化物上的应用是轻烷烃脱氢到烯烃的有吸引力的替代方案，因为它打破了热力学限制，并提供了原位供能的热能来处理高度吸热的脱氢反应。然而，选择性生成烯烃的挑战仍然存在，因为烯烃具有高反应性。为减少焦炭的形成，可以采取策略，如使用促进剂Sn来减弱丙烯的吸附，或者引入氢气以降低丙烯的脱附壁垒。这可以提高丙烯的选择性和减少焦炭的形成。此外，可以使用新型催化剂结构，如二元合金或核壳结构，以维持高活性、选择性和稳定性的同时减少结焦倾向。
