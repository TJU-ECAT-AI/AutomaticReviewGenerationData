The key considerations for direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) in propene production involve the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The process faces challenges like coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which impacts process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include weakening propylene adsorption strength, suppressing deep dehydrogenation, and improving catalyst stability. Coke formation can block active sites, hinder side reactions, and lead to faster catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, researchers have suggested using Pt-based alloys, as they lower olefin desorption energy and are considered the best candidates for industrial catalysts. 

For oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides, it offers an alternative for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins by overcoming thermodynamic limitations and providing in situ heat for highly endothermic reactions. However, achieving high olefin selectivity remains a challenge due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations have helped elucidate the active sites and surface reactions responsible for olefin formation, COx, and other byproducts. The lattice oxygen plays a major role as an active site in these reactions. Oxygen activity, influenced by local structure, coordination, and oxygen vacancy, is crucial for controlling olefin formation and reducing COx.

The valence state of catalysts is also significant, as it affects the PDH ability. Oxygen vacancy modifies the electronic structure of active species and can alter the reaction mechanism. This highlights the complexity of modeling reactions involving active sites on oxides, which undergo redox reactions and experience changes in the oxygen vacancy in the steady state. Understanding and optimizing these factors can lead to improvements in catalyst design and performance.

直接脱氢化丙烷（PDH）用于丙烯生产的关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。该过程面临的挑战包括铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成，这会影响过程效率。为解决焦炭形成问题，可采用策略包括减弱丙烯的吸附强度、抑制深度脱氢化表面中间体，并提高催化剂稳定性。焦炭形成可能会阻塞活性位点、阻碍副反应并导致催化剂更快地失活。

对于氧化脱氢化在氧化物上的应用，它提供了一种替代方法，用于轻烷烃的脱氢化以产生烯烃，通过克服热力学限制并在高吸热脱氢反应中提供就地供能。然而，实现高烯烃选择性仍然是一个挑战，由于烯烃的高反应性。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算帮助揭示了负责烯烃形成、COx和其他副产品的活性位点和表面反应。晶格氧是主要的活性位点。这些反应的氧活动受到局部结构、配位以及氧空位的影响，是控制烯烃形成和减少COx的关键。

催化剂的价态也非常重要，因为它影响PDH能力。氧空位修改了活性物种的电子结构，并可能改变反应机制。这强调了在氧化物上建模反应的复杂性，这些氧化物经历还原反应，其氧空位在稳态中发生变化。理解并优化这些因素可以导致催化剂设计和性能的改进。
