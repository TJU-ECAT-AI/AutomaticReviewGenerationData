1. The selective activation of CH bonds allows for the conversion of inexpensive hydrocarbons into valuable products, such as commodities, intermediates, and fine chemicals, potentially having a significant economic impact. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process by facilitating the activation of CH bonds and controlling reaction pathways to enhance selectivity and reduce carbon footprint. The demand for light alkenes has grown due to their usage in polymer production. Synthetic gas and hydrogen are produced industrially through methane steam reforming, dry reforming, partial oxidation, and dehydrogenation reactions. Catalytic dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that benefits from high temperatures and low alkane pressures. Controlling the oxidation of alkanes/alkenes to carbon oxides, due to the higher reactivity of products, poses a significant challenge in catalyst development. Central questions in the field include the identification of active sites for CH bond activation, understanding the detailed catalytic cycle, determining rate-determining steps, and managing the selectivity and carbon formation during methane and light alkane activation and conversion. The design of new catalysts relies on a deep understanding of molecular-level surface reactions. The integration of DFT and microkinetic modeling has advanced the field, offering a more convenient approach to catalyst design due to reduced computational complexity. Linear scaling relationships have been utilized to correlate DFT-calculated energetics of reaction intermediates, providing insights into CH bond activation trends across different catalyst surfaces. Methane consists of a carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. Its unique structure and electronic properties make it weakly interact with catalytic surfaces. The first step in methane conversion, the activation of the CH bond, is often the rate-limiting step in processes like methane decomposition, oxidation, and reforming on catalysts such as nickel, palladium, ruthenium, and rhodium. Nickel catalysts, particularly the Ni(111) surface, are extensively studied due to their industrial relevance. Direct CH4 dissociation is recognized as the dominant pathway for methane activation on nickel surfaces, although the exact mechanism for CO formation remains a subject of ongoing debate. The size of the metal particle significantly impacts the activity of both steam reforming and dry reforming reactions. Carbon formation is a common challenge for nickel-based catalysts, particularly filamentous carbon, which involves decomposition of carbon-containing gases, segregation and diffusion of carbon through the catalyst, and subsequent precipitation. To address this issue, nickel bimetallic catalysts, such as those alloyed with gold, ruthenium, rhodium, copper, palladium, silver, and tin, are used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance carbon removal, thereby improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation. Among these, nickel-ruthenium (NiRh), nickel-rhodium (NiRu), and nickel-palladium (NiPt) alloys have been found to effectively increase catalyst resistance to carbon deposition without compromising or even enhancing activity in steam reforming reactions.
