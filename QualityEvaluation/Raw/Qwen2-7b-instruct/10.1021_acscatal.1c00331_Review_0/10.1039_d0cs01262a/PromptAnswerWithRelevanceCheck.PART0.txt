The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of an oxidant to assist in the dehydrogenation process. Catalyst types, such as Pt-based alloys, are chosen for their ability to efficiently activate the CH bonds of propane, leading to propene production. Industrial applications of PDH involve its use in petrochemical industries for the production of various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy costs for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include modifying the catalyst structure to weaken the adsorption strength of propylene and suppress the deep dehydrogenation reactions. This can be achieved by alloying Pt with other metals or adjusting the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles. Additionally, the use of co-feeding hydrogen can decrease the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors and increase the number of free sites on the Pt surface, enhancing catalytic activity.

1. The selective activation of CH bonds allows for the conversion of inexpensive hydrocarbons into valuable products, such as commodities, intermediates, and fine chemicals, potentially having a significant economic impact. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process by facilitating the activation of CH bonds and controlling reaction pathways to enhance selectivity and reduce carbon footprint. The demand for light alkenes has grown due to their usage in polymer production. Synthetic gas and hydrogen are produced industrially through methane steam reforming, dry reforming, partial oxidation, and dehydrogenation reactions. Catalytic dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that benefits from high temperatures and low alkane pressures. Controlling the oxidation of alkanes/alkenes to carbon oxides, due to the higher reactivity of products, poses a significant challenge in catalyst development. Central questions in the field include the identification of active sites for CH bond activation, understanding the detailed catalytic cycle, determining rate-determining steps, and managing the selectivity and carbon formation during methane and light alkane activation and conversion. The design of new catalysts relies on a deep understanding of molecular-level surface reactions. The integration of DFT and microkinetic modeling has advanced the field, offering a more convenient approach to catalyst design due to reduced computational complexity. Linear scaling relationships have been utilized to correlate DFT-calculated energetics of reaction intermediates, providing insights into CH bond activation trends across different catalyst surfaces. Methane consists of a carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. Its unique structure and electronic properties make it weakly interact with catalytic surfaces. The first step in methane conversion, the activation of the CH bond, is often the rate-limiting step in processes like methane decomposition, oxidation, and reforming on catalysts such as nickel, palladium, ruthenium, and rhodium. Nickel catalysts, particularly the Ni(111) surface, are extensively studied due to their industrial relevance. Direct CH4 dissociation is recognized as the dominant pathway for methane activation on nickel surfaces, although the exact mechanism for CO formation remains a subject of ongoing debate. The size of the metal particle significantly impacts the activity of both steam reforming and dry reforming reactions. Carbon formation is a common challenge for nickel-based catalysts, particularly filamentous carbon, which involves decomposition of carbon-containing gases, segregation and diffusion of carbon through the catalyst, and subsequent precipitation. To address this issue, nickel bimetallic catalysts, such as those alloyed with gold, ruthenium, rhodium, copper, palladium, silver, and tin, are used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance carbon removal, thereby improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation. Among these, nickel-ruthenium (NiRh), nickel-rhodium (NiRu), and nickel-palladium (NiPt) alloys have been found to effectively increase catalyst resistance to carbon deposition without compromising or even enhancing activity in steam reforming reactions.

The key considerations for direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) in propene production involve the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The process faces challenges like coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which impacts process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include weakening propylene adsorption strength, suppressing deep dehydrogenation, and improving catalyst stability. Coke formation can block active sites, hinder side reactions, and lead to faster catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, researchers have suggested using Pt-based alloys, as they lower olefin desorption energy and are considered the best candidates for industrial catalysts. 

For oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides, it offers an alternative for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins by overcoming thermodynamic limitations and providing in situ heat for highly endothermic reactions. However, achieving high olefin selectivity remains a challenge due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations have helped elucidate the active sites and surface reactions responsible for olefin formation, COx, and other byproducts. The lattice oxygen plays a major role as an active site in these reactions. Oxygen activity, influenced by local structure, coordination, and oxygen vacancy, is crucial for controlling olefin formation and reducing COx.

The valence state of catalysts is also significant, as it affects the PDH ability. Oxygen vacancy modifies the electronic structure of active species and can alter the reaction mechanism. This highlights the complexity of modeling reactions involving active sites on oxides, which undergo redox reactions and experience changes in the oxygen vacancy in the steady state. Understanding and optimizing these factors can lead to improvements in catalyst design and performance.

催化剂的价态也非常重要，因为它影响PDH能力。氧空位修改了活性物种的电子结构，并可能改变反应机制。这强调了在氧化物上建模反应的复杂性，这些氧化物经历还原反应，其氧空位在稳态中发生变化。理解并优化这些因素可以导致催化剂设计和性能的改进。

To function as a method for propene production, the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) relies on the breaking of the thermodynamic limitations of highly endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. Key considerations include the selection of appropriate catalyst types, such as Pt-based alloys, which can lower the olefin desorption energy. Industrial applications of PDH require strategies to mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which can impede the catalytic activity and lead to faster deactivation. Coke formation on these catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the availability of active sites, necessitating frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation might include the use of promoters, such as Sn, to weaken propylene adsorption, or the introduction of hydrogen to decrease the desorption barrier for propylene. This can improve propene selectivity and minimize coke formation. Additionally, the use of novel catalyst structures, such as bimetallic alloys or core-shell structures, can help maintain high activity, selectivity, and stability with reduced coking potential.

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the C-H bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations include reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types can vary widely, including metals like palladium and nickel, which are known for their effectiveness in PDH. Industrial applications often involve complex reactor designs to optimize the conversion of propane to propene. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to decreased propene yield and increased maintenance costs. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with high resistance to carbon deposition, such as Ni-Rh alloys, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

2. The size-dependent activity of steam reforming of methane (SRM) and dry reforming of methane (DRM) is influenced by the metal particle size. Smaller particles tend to exhibit higher activity due to a larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites that can act as active sites. The activity of SRM on Ni catalysts, for instance, was found to decrease with increasing particle size because the most active Ni(211) surface fraction decreases. This suggests that stabilizing Ni catalysts with particles sizes around 6 nanometers could enhance activity for SRM reactions. For DRM, Ni catalysts also show a positive size dependence, meaning that smaller particles have higher activity compared to larger particles.

3. Catalysts that can reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal are crucial for mitigating coke formation, which is a common issue in SRM and DRM. By alloying Ni with metals like Au, Ru, Rh, Co, Pt, Ag, and Sn, it is possible to create bimetallic catalysts that maintain or even improve the activity for SRM reactions while reducing the likelihood of carbon deposition. For example, NiRh, NiRu, and NiPt alloys have been shown to be effective in this regard. These catalysts offer a cost-effective solution to the problem of catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation, potentially extending the operational life of SRM and DRM processes.

2. 蒸汽重整甲烷（SRM）和干式重整甲烷（DRM）的尺寸依赖性活性受金属颗粒尺寸的影响。较小的颗粒倾向于表现出更高的活性，因为它们拥有更多的未协调表面位点，可以作为活性位点。例如，对于SRM，Ni催化剂的活性随着颗粒尺寸的增大而降低，因为最活跃的Ni(211)表面面积减少。这表明稳定Ni催化剂，使其颗粒大小约为6纳米，可以增强SRM反应的活性。对于DRM，Ni催化剂也显示出正的尺寸依赖性，意味着较小的颗粒具有比较大颗粒更高的活性。

3. 可以通过将Ni与Au、Ru、Rh、Co、Pt、Ag、Sn等金属合金化来制造能够减少甲烷分解并增强表面反应去除碳沉积的催化剂，这对于缓解碳沉积问题至关重要，这是SRM和DRM过程中的常见问题。例如，NiRh、NiRu和NiPt合金已被证明在这方面是有效的。这些催化剂提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，可以延长SRM和DRM过程的使用寿命，由于减少了碳沉积的可能性。

Although many studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanism of POM reaction, the mechanism of synthesis gas formation is not yet completely clarified. In the literature, two reaction mechan- isms have been proposed for POM reaction: one is the direct partial oxidation (DPO) mechanism, in which CH4 and O2 react on the catalyst surface to generate CO and H2 directly; and the other is the combustion and reforming reaction (CRR) mechanism, which involves total methane combustion to form H2O and CO2 first, followed by SRM and DRM to produce CO and H2.38,48,69,70,211,212

反应机制的金属依赖性。已经进行了许多研究以阐明甲烷部分氧化（POM）的机制，但合成气形成机制仍然不完全清楚。文献中提出了两种POM机制：一种是直接部分氧化（DPO）机制，其中CH4和O2在催化剂表面上反应产生CO和H2；另一种是燃烧和重整反应（CRR）机制，首先涉及完全甲烷燃烧生成H2O和CO2，随后进行水蒸汽重整（SRM）和直接甲烷重整（DRM）以产生CO和H2。（参考文献：38, 48, 69, 70, 211, 212）

<p>Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide,polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on- purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydro- genation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts.</p>
<p>Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehy- drogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydro- gen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydro- genation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step,which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340</p>
<p>The critical challenges in ethane and propane dehydrogena- tion and oxidative dehydrogenation are the selectivities to olefins and coke formation. The DFT calculations and kinetic analysis unravel useful fundamental insights into these key challenges at the molecular level, where the difference in the desorption energy of olefins and the activation energy of deep dehydrogenation of surface intermediates is used as the descriptor. Computational catalysis suggested Pt-based alloys as the best candidates for industrial catalysts by lowering the olefin desorption energy.</p>
<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides is an attractive alter- native for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins due to the breaking of the thermodynamic limitation and in situ supply of heat for highly endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. However, the critical challenge in olefin selectivity still remains due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations elucidated the active sites and surface reactions responsible for the formation of olefins, COx, and other byproducts. The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT model- ing, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy. However, it also provides huge opportunities to tune the oxygen activity to reduce the CC bond cleavage and oxidation to COx. Oxides are a large family and present numerous oxide structures. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed the catalysts activity dependence on the oxide identity, doping, cluster size,and supports. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity was identified as the descriptor to describe the oxygen activity. However, a thorough screening of a huge number of oxide structures to find appropriate catalyst candi- dates for a given reaction remains a formidable challenge.</p>

1. Propylene is a key petrochemical product used in various industries. Its production traditionally involves steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts. With growing demand and the advent of shale gas, on-purpose propylene production, particularly through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is becoming more viable. PDH is an endothermic process typically conducted at around 600°C using PtSn or CrOx catalysts supported on Al2O3. Efforts to improve Pt-based catalyst performance include doping with additional promoters and modifying carriers. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane follows the MVK mechanism, which generates oxygen vacancies on the surface and facilitates the formation of oxygen on the surface. To overcome thermodynamic limitations, an oxidant is added to the reaction feed to produce water, releasing heat. However, for propane ODH, olefin products are easily oxidized, necessitating operation at lower temperatures to achieve higher selectivity. Propane dehydrogenation is kinetically controlled, with the activation of the CH bond as the rate-determining step requiring higher temperatures.

2. The key challenges in ethane and propane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation are achieving high olefin selectivity and minimizing coke formation. Computational catalysis identifies Pt-based alloys as optimal candidates by lowering olefin desorption energy. Oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides offers an alternative for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins, overcoming thermodynamic limitations and providing in situ heat supply for endothermic reactions. However, olefin selectivity remains a challenge due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations reveal the active sites and surface reactions leading to olefin, COx, and other byproducts. Lattice oxygen plays a central role, influencing oxygen activity and providing opportunities to reduce CC bond cleavage and COx formation. The activity of oxide catalysts depends on factors such as oxide identity, doping, cluster size, and supports. Oxygen vacancy formation energy or hydrogen affinity serves as a descriptor for oxygen activity, but thoroughly screening a vast number of oxide structures for specific reactions remains a daunting task.
