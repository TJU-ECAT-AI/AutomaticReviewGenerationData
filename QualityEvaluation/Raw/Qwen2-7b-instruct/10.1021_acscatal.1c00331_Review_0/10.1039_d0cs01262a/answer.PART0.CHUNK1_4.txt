Catalyst improvement. Carbon formation on Ni-based cata- lysts is the main obstacle to the commercialization of DRM.140 To investigate the carbon formation scheme on Ni-based cata- lysts, Wang et al.140 compared the whole reaction network of DRM over flat Ni(111) and step Ni(211) surfaces, as well as flat Ni3C(001) and step Ni3C(111) by DFT calculations. The kinetic analysis illustrated an activity order of Ni(111) 4 Ni3C(001) 4 Ni(211) 4 Ni3C(111) for DRM. That is, flat surfaces were more active than step surfaces, and metallic Ni catalysts were more active than nickel carbide.

The main obstacle to the commercialization of direct methane reforming (DRM) is the carbon formation on Ni-based catalysts. A study by Wang et al. compared the reaction networks of DRM over different surfaces: flat Ni(111), step Ni(211), flat Ni3C(001), and step Ni3C(111) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic analysis showed that flat surfaces were more active than step surfaces, and metallic Ni catalysts were more active than Ni carbide.

直接甲烷重整（DRM）商业化的主要障碍是Ni基催化剂上的碳形成。王等人进行的研究比较了不同表面的重整反应网络：平滑Ni(111)，台阶Ni(211)，平滑Ni3C(001)和台阶Ni3C(111)，使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。动力学分析表明，平滑表面比台阶表面更活跃，金属Ni催化剂比Ni碳化物更活跃。

In addition to pure metal catalysts, a few theoretical studies have been employed to investigate the mechanism on Ni catalysts with supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts for DRM reaction with improved performance. The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering.196 The DFT studies of Rodri- guez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15).

在Ni催化剂上，通过支持物、促进剂和Ni基双金属催化剂进行了几种理论研究，以提高DRM性能。Akri等人通过实验和计算研究发现，Ni在Ce掺杂羟基磷灰石（HAP-Ce）上的分散表现出高度的活性和内在的焦炭抵抗性，这是由于强金属支撑相互作用，仅有利于甲烷中的第一个CH键活化，并稳定Ni单原子防止烧结。Rodriguez及其同事的DFT研究表明，甲烷激活的有效势垒从Ni(111)表面上的0.9 eV降低到仅Ni/CeO2x(111)表面上的0.15 eV（图15）。

For Ni-based bimetallic catalysts, NiSn was observed to favor methane dissociation,203 and reduce coke formation204 more than pure Ni catalysts for DRM via both theoretical and experimental studies. NiFe bimetallic catalysts suppressed coke deposition due to the increased energy barrier of CH - C + H,in comparison to that on a pure Ni(111) surface.205 Further- more, under DRM conditions, Fe was oxidized partially to FeO,leading to a partial dealloying. FeO could react with surface carbon deposits to form CO, where the reduced Fe returned to the original NiFe alloy.205,206 The FeO/Ni(111) interface exhibited easier CO bond cleavage of CO2 and dehydrogenation of CHx (x = 13). Therefore, both improved DRM reactivity and coke resistance were obtained on NiFe catalysts.

对于Ni基双金属催化剂，NiSn被观察到有利于甲烷解离并减少DRM中纯Ni催化剂的焦炭形成，这通过理论和实验研究都得到了证实。NiFe双金属催化剂由于CH - C + H反应的能垒增加而避免了焦炭沉积，与纯Ni(111)表面相比。在DRM条件下，Fe部分氧化为FeO，导致部分合金化。FeO与表面碳沉积物反应生成CO，还原后的Fe返回原始NiFe合金。FeO/Ni(111)界面显示出更容易的CO键断裂CO2和CHx（x=13）的脱氢，导致NiFe催化剂中的改善DRM反应性和焦炭抵抗力。

The Ni2Cu(111) catalyst displayed superior carbon deposition resis- tance compared to Ni(111) and Ni2Fe(111) due to the higher energy barrier of CH dissociation. It could also improve carbon elimination by enhancing C* + O* reaction, resulting in improved catalyst stability.207 NiPt bimetallic catalysts showed higher reaction barriers for CH cracking and lower carbon adsorption energy than that on pure Ni(111), which decreased the possibility of coke formation. It can be concluded that the use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts can effectively suppress coke formation on Ni surfaces. Mean- while, some supports, such as CeO2, promoters such as La2O3,and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts such as NiSn and NiFe can improve the metal activity for DRM due to enhanced methane activation.

The Ni2Cu(111) catalyst showed superior carbon deposition resistance compared to Ni(111) and Ni2Fe(111) due to a higher energy barrier for CH dissociation. It could also enhance carbon elimination by boosting the C* + O* reaction, leading to improved catalyst stability. NiPt bimetallic catalysts exhibited higher CH cracking barriers and lower carbon adsorption energy than pure Ni(111), reducing the chance of coke formation. Therefore, the use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts can effectively suppress coke formation on Ni surfaces. Meanwhile, supports like CeO2, promoters like La2O3, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts like NiSn and NiFe can boost metal activity for DRM by enhancing methane activation.

Ni2Cu(111)催化剂在CH解离能垒较高时显示了相对于Ni(111)和Ni2Fe(111)的优越的碳沉积抵抗力。它还能通过增强C* + O*反应来提高碳消除，从而提高催化剂稳定性。NiPt双金属催化剂的CH裂解壁垒更高且碳吸附能量较低，比纯Ni(111)更低，减少了焦炭形成的可能性。因此，使用支撑物、促进剂和Ni基双金属催化剂可以有效地抑制Ni表面的焦炭形成。同时，像CeO2这样的支撑物，La2O3这样的促进剂，以及Ni基双金属催化剂如NiSn和NiFe可以通过增强甲烷激活来提升金属在DRM中的活性。

Metal dependence of the reaction mechanism. Although many studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanism of POM reaction, the mechanism of synthesis gas formation is not yet completely clarified. In the literature, two reaction mechan- isms have been proposed for POM reaction: one is the direct partial oxidation (DPO) mechanism, in which CH4 and O2 react on the catalyst surface to generate CO and H2 directly; and the other is the combustion and reforming reaction (CRR) mechanism, which involves total methane combustion to form H2O and CO2 first, followed by SRM and DRM to produce CO and H2.38,48,69,70,211,212

反应机制的金属依赖性。已经进行了许多研究以阐明甲烷部分氧化（POM）的机制，但合成气形成机制仍然不完全清楚。文献中提出了两种POM机制：一种是直接部分氧化（DPO）机制，其中CH4和O2在催化剂表面上反应产生CO和H2；另一种是燃烧和重整反应（CRR）机制，首先涉及完全甲烷燃烧生成H2O和CO2，随后进行水蒸汽重整（SRM）和直接甲烷重整（DRM）以产生CO和H2。（参考文献：38, 48, 69, 70, 211, 212）
