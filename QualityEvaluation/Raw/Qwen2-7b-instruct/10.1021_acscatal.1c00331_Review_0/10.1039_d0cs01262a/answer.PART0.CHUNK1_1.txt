[1] "In the case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) is the primary reaction. The process involves the breaking of one or more C-H bonds in propane, typically resulting in the formation of propene."
[2] "The key considerations regarding reaction conditions for PDH include temperature, pressure, and the type of catalyst used. Catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Ni, and Ni-Mo alloys are commonly used due to their high activity in promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process. Coke formation is a common side reaction that occurs when the catalyst becomes deactivated by the accumulation of carbonaceous materials. This can lead to a decrease in the catalyst's activity, increased energy consumption, and reduced product purity."
[4] "To mitigate the formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts and improve catalyst regeneration, several strategies can be implemented. These include the use of promoter metals (such as Sn, Sb, and In), which can alter the surface properties of the catalyst and reduce coke deposition. Additionally, the use of supports like Al2O3 or CeO2 can provide a more stable framework for the Pt catalyst, enhancing its resistance to coke formation. Regular catalyst regeneration processes, such as in-situ regeneration or off-line regeneration, are also crucial for maintaining the catalyst's activity and prolonging its useful life."
