[1] "Catalyst improvement. Carbon formation on Ni-based cata- lysts is the main obstacle to the commercialization of DRM.140 To investigate the carbon formation scheme on Ni-based cata- lysts, Wang et al.140 compared the whole reaction network of DRM over flat Ni(111) and step Ni(211) surfaces, as well as flat Ni3C(001) and step Ni3C(111) by DFT calculations."

[2] "That is, flat surfaces were more active than step surfaces, and metallic Ni catalysts were more active than nickel carbide. Therefore, the formation of nickel carbide would reduce the catalytic activity on both flat and step surfaces."

[3] "With respect to carbon formation, the authors sug- gested that the rate ratio of the CH oxidation route to the C oxidation route (rCH/rC) coupled with the CO dissociation barrier could be used to measure the carbon formation prob- ability."

[4] "Ni(111) was found to exhibit both the highest activity and the best carbon resistance."

1. Wang et al. compared the whole reaction network of DRM over various surfaces to understand the carbon formation scheme on Ni-based catalysts. They found that flat surfaces were more active than step surfaces, and metallic Ni catalysts were more active than nickel carbide. This suggests that the formation of nickel carbide reduces the catalytic activity on both flat and step surfaces.

2. The authors suggested using the rate ratio of the CH oxidation route to the C oxidation route (rCH/rC) coupled with the CO dissociation barrier to measure the carbon formation probability. 

3. They discovered that Ni(111) surface exhibited both the highest activity and the best carbon resistance.

1. 王等人通过比较不同表面的DRM全反应网络，研究了Ni基催化剂上的碳形成方案。他们发现平坦表面比台阶表面更活跃，金属Ni催化剂比镍碳化物更活跃。这表明镍碳化物的形成会降低平滑和台阶表面的催化活性。

2. 作者建议使用CH氧化途径与C氧化途径（rCH/rC）的速率比以及CO解离能来衡量碳形成概率。

3. 他们发现Ni(111)表面既表现出最高的活性，也具有最好的碳抵抗性。

[1] "Foppa et al.200 employed a multiscale (DFT and microkinetic) modeling approach to investigate the role of a Ni/Al2O3 interface in WGS (watergas shift) and DRM. The Ni/Al2O3 interface pro- vided the active site for WGS, while all Ni atoms were active for DRM, which was confirmed by the experimental measurements."

[2] "For La2O3 modified Ni(111), CH4 + CO2 + La2O3 - CH + CO2(La2O2O) + 3H CHO + CO2(La2O2) + 3H - 2CO + 2H2 + La2O3 was the dominant reaction pathway, with CH4 - CH3 + H as the RDS. The modified catalysts improved the DRM reaction both thermodynamically and kinetically."

[3] "Moreover, the carbon deposition was inhibited on La2O3 modified Ni(111) because of the lower reaction rate in CH - C + H, compared to that on La modified Ni(111)."

1. Foppa等人采用多尺度（DFT和微动力学）建模方法研究了Ni/Al2O3界面在水煤气变换(WGS)和直接甲烷裂解(DRM)中的作用。Ni/Al2O3界面提供了WGS的活性位点，所有Ni原子都对DRM有活性，这一点得到了实验测量的证实。

2. 对于La2O3改性的Ni(111)，主要反应路径是CH4 + CO2 + La2O3 - CH + CO2(La2O2O) + 3H CHO + CO2(La2O2) + 3H - 2CO + 2H2 + La2O3，其中CH4 - CH3 + H为反应的决速步骤。改性催化剂在热力学和动力学上均改善了DRM反应。

3. 此外，在La2O3改性的Ni(111)上，由于CH - C + H反应速率较低，碳沉积被抑制，这与La改性的Ni(111)相比。

1.NiSn双金属催化剂在理论上和实验上均显示出有利于甲烷分解并减少DRM过程中焦炭形成的效果，相比于纯Ni催化剂。NiFe双金属催化剂通过提高CH - C + H反应的能量壁垒，抑制了焦炭沉积，与纯Ni(111)表面相比，该壁垒更高。在DRM条件下，Fe部分氧化为FeO，导致合金的部分分解。FeO可以与表面碳沉积物反应生成CO，还原后的Fe回到原始的NiFe合金中。
