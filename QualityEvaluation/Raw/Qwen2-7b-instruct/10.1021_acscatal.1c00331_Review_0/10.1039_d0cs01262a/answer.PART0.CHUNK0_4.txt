[1] "Catalysts improving carbon formation resistance. Although the use of Ni-based catalysts for SRM is a relatively mature technology, catalyst deactivation through carbon formation, poisoning and sintering tends to occur on the Ni surface, which is an important challenge and is among the subjects of active research."
[2] "The C* site coverage is an important parameter to characterize carbon formation. Both experimental and DFT studies of Nrskov and co-workers suggested that the nucleation of graphene on Ni catalysts was initiated at the stepped Ni(211) sites."
