The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions under specific conditions. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Catalyst types, such as Ru-based phosphides, are crucial as they provide an active surface for the reactions to occur, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH process. Industrial applications require efficient catalysts with high stability and activity to ensure continuous operation and economic viability.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include using a dual-metal catalyst system, like Ru-P catalysts, which can enhance propene selectivity while reducing coke formation. This is achieved by tuning the composition of the catalyst to optimize the interaction between the metals, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst and ensuring efficient propene production without significant coke buildup.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产的手段，通过一系列化学反应将丙烷转化为丙烯。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和氢的存在，这些因素有助于促进脱氢过程。如Ru基磷化物等催化剂类型对于提供反应发生的活性表面至关重要，可以增强PDH过程的选择性和效率。工业应用需要高效的催化剂，具有高稳定性和活性，以确保连续操作和经济可行性。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为这减少了可用于反应的表面面积，导致活性和选择性下降。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略可能包括使用双金属催化剂系统，如Ru-P催化剂，这可以通过优化两种金属之间的相互作用来增强丙烯选择性，同时减少焦炭形成。这通过调整催化剂组成来实现，以优化金属间的相互作用，从而改善催化剂的整体性能，并确保高效地生产丙烯，而不会出现大量焦炭积累的问题。
