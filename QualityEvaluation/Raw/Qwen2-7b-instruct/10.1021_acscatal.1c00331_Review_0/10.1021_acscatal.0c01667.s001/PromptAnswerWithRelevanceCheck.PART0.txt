The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions under specific conditions. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Catalyst types, such as Ru-based phosphides, are crucial as they provide an active surface for the reactions to occur, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH process. Industrial applications require efficient catalysts with high stability and activity to ensure continuous operation and economic viability.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include using a dual-metal catalyst system, like Ru-P catalysts, which can enhance propene selectivity while reducing coke formation. This is achieved by tuning the composition of the catalyst to optimize the interaction between the metals, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst and ensuring efficient propene production without significant coke buildup.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen under specific reaction conditions. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing the reaction temperature, pressure, hydrogen-to-propane ratio, and catalyst type. Catalyst types such as Pt, Ru, and Ru-P have distinct properties that affect their efficiency in this process. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with better resistance to coking, implementing regeneration processes, and controlling the reaction conditions to minimize coke deposition. Ru-P catalysts, in particular, show improved performance over monometallic Ru catalysts due to their enhanced ability to selectively convert propane to propene, as evidenced by higher propene selectivity and conversion rates.
