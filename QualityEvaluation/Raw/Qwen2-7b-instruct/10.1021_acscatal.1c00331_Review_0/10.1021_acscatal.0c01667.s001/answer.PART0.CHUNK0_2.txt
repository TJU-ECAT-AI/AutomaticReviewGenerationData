The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen under specific reaction conditions. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing the reaction temperature, pressure, hydrogen-to-propane ratio, and catalyst type. Catalyst types such as Pt, Ru, and Ru-P have distinct properties that affect their efficiency in this process. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with better resistance to coking, implementing regeneration processes, and controlling the reaction conditions to minimize coke deposition. Ru-P catalysts, in particular, show improved performance over monometallic Ru catalysts due to their enhanced ability to selectively convert propane to propene, as evidenced by higher propene selectivity and conversion rates.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在特定反应条件下将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气来实现。PDH的关键考虑因素包括优化反应温度、压力、氢气与丙烷的比例以及催化剂类型。Pt、Ru和Ru-P等不同类型的催化剂具有不同的性质，影响其在这一过程中的效率。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著影响过程效率，导致活性和选择性下降。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用更抗积碳的催化剂、实施再生过程以及控制反应条件以减少焦炭沉积。特别是Ru-P催化剂显示出优于单金属Ru催化剂的性能，由于它们具有更好的丙烯选择性和转化率，这在Ru-P催化剂上得到了证明。
