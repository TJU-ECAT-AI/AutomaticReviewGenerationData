The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through chemical reactions under specific conditions. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing effective catalyst types, and optimizing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and increasing energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using alternative catalyst materials, such as Ru-based phosphides, which have been shown to enhance propane selective dehydrogenation. This results in higher propene yields and improved catalyst stability, making PDH a viable method for propene production.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过在特定条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯进行化学反应。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、选用有效的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，降低催化剂活性并增加再生所需的能量消耗。为减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂稳定性，可采取策略使用替代催化剂材料，如基于钌的磷化物，这些材料已被证明可以增强丙烷选择性脱氢。这导致更高的丙烯产率和催化剂性能的改进，使PDH成为一种可行的丙烯生产方法。
