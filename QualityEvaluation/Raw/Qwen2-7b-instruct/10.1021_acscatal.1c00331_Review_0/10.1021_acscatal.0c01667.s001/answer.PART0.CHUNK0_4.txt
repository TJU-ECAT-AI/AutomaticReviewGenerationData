1. The method of catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a technique for producing propene by selectively converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen under controlled conditions. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, utilizing effective catalyst types, and optimizing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and increasing energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve choosing catalysts with better resistance to coking, employing advanced regeneration techniques, and maintaining optimal operating conditions.

2. Ru-P catalysts demonstrated enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Ru catalysts, showing improved selectivity and conversion rates for propene production. This improvement suggests that the addition of phosphorus to the ruthenium base creates a more efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during PDH processes leads to decreased efficiency due to the accumulation of carbon deposits, which can deactivate the catalyst surface. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using catalysts with higher resistance to coking, implementing more frequent and efficient regeneration processes, and adjusting operational parameters such as temperature and gas flow rates to prevent excessive coke buildup.

4. Table S1 outlines the catalytic conditions for C3H8 dehydrogenation at a 25% propane conversion level and the corresponding reaction rates for different catalysts. The data shows the efficiency of various catalysts in terms of achieving high conversion rates while maintaining acceptable propene yields.

5. Figures S5-S8 provide graphical representations of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield over time for various catalysts during the PDH process. These visual aids help in understanding the comparative performance of different catalysts and identifying trends in conversion and selectivity.
