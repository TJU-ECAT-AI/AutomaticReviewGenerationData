The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through the conversion of propane into propene by removing hydrogen atoms. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen. Catalyst types play a crucial role, with Ru-based phosphides showing enhanced selectivity for propene production compared to monometallic Ru catalysts. Industrial applications require efficient and stable catalysts capable of handling large-scale processes. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing activity and requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing operating conditions, using promoters, and designing more active and selective catalysts.
