Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen. Catalyst types that can be used for PDH include Pt-based catalysts. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and loss of catalytic activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, using alloyed catalysts that reduce coke deposition, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through oxidation and reduction processes.

Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) indicates that an increasing donation of electronic charge from In to Pt occurs with increasing In content in the PtIn particles. The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%.

The Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) reveals that there is an increasing donation of electronic charge from In to Pt as the In content increases within the PtIn particles. The activity and selectivity of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are significantly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, the highest activity is observed at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and under this condition, the selectivity towards alkene approaches 100%.

Pt LIII边缘X射线吸收邻边结构(XANES)表明，在PtIn粒子中随着In含量增加，电子电荷从In捐赠到Pt。对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应，Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂的活性和选择性主要依赖于In/Pt的体比例。对于两种反应物，最大活性出现在In/Pt体比例为0.48的情况下，此时烯烃的选择性接近100%。

Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Characterization of the deposit by Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coke is present as highly disordered graphite particles <30 nm in diameter.
