[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butene are used extensively to pro- duce rubber, plastics and many other products."
[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."
[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation."
[4] "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support,whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene molecules. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, utilizing efficient catalyst types, and ensuring the process is economically viable for industrial applications. The efficiency of the process can be impacted by coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which can reduce the catalyst's activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve optimizing reaction conditions, using more stable catalysts, and designing processes that facilitate easier catalyst cleaning and reuse.

2. The impact of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts in the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is significant. Coke formation can reduce catalyst activity, leading to decreased propene production rates. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using Pt alloys with other metals like In, which can reduce coke deposition. Additionally, employing catalyst supports that inhibit carbon deposition, adjusting operating conditions to prevent excessive coke formation, and implementing regular catalyst cleaning techniques can enhance catalyst efficiency and longevity.

1. 烯烃的直接脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯分子，被广泛用于橡胶、塑料和其他产品的生产。在PDH过程中需要考虑的关键因素包括选择合适的反应条件、使用高效的催化剂类型以及确保过程对工业应用具有经济性。丙烷脱氢过程的效率可能受到Pt基催化剂上焦炭形成的负面影响，这会降低催化剂的活性。为了缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采用策略优化反应条件、使用更稳定的催化剂以及设计易于清洁和再利用的工艺流程。

2. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成对其影响重大。焦炭的形成会降低催化剂的活性，导致丙烯生成速率下降。为了缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采用与In等其他金属形成合金的Pt基催化剂，以减少焦炭沉积。此外，还可以采用抑制碳沉积的支持材料、调整操作条件以防止过度形成焦炭，以及实施定期催化剂清洁技术，以增强催化剂的效率和使用寿命。
