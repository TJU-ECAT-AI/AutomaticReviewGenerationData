Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst.

For both ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of carbon during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a loss in catalytic activity and requiring extensive regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include alloying Pt with other metals that reduce the adsorption of hydrogen and decrease the likelihood of carbon deposition. Catalyst regeneration can be improved by controlling reaction conditions, such as temperature and flow rates, to prevent excessive carbon buildup. Additionally, using supports with high surface areas and porosities can facilitate easier removal of deposited carbon.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through breaking the C-H bonds. Key considerations include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Catalyst types, such as Pt-based catalysts, are crucial for achieving high propene selectivity and efficient conversion rates. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively impacts process efficiency by reducing activity and requiring extensive regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve alloying Pt with other metals that reduce hydrogen adsorption and decrease carbon deposition. Improved catalyst regeneration is achieved by controlling reaction conditions, using catalyst supports with high surface areas and porosities, and implementing effective carbon removal techniques.
