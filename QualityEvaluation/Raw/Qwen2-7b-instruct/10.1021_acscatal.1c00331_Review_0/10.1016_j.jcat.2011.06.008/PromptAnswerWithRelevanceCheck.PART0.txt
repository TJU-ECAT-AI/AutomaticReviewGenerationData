Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature. 

The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. While only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for this process include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst type. Catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, are crucial for the PDH reaction as they facilitate the breaking of C-C bonds in propane molecules. The efficiency of the process can be impacted by coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which can reduce the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing reaction conditions, using catalysts with enhanced resistance to coke formation, and implementing effective regeneration methods.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during PDH impacts the process efficiency by causing a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Coke can accumulate on the catalyst surface and within the pores, blocking the active sites and reducing the conversion rates of propane to propene. To mitigate coke formation, researchers can use catalysts with improved dispersion of metals, incorporate additives that prevent coke formation, and develop advanced regeneration techniques to restore the catalyst's activity.

催化直接脱氢化丙烷（PDH）通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气，作为丙烯生产的手段。在这一过程中，需要考虑的关键因素包括选择合适的反应条件，如温度、压力和催化剂类型。特别是铂基催化剂对于PDH反应至关重要，它们能够促进丙烷分子中C-C键的断裂。该过程的效率受到在Pt基催化剂上形成的焦炭的影响，这会降低催化剂的活性和选择性。

焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会影响过程效率，因为它会导致催化剂活性和选择性的下降。焦炭可以在催化剂表面和孔内积累，阻塞活性位点并降低丙烷向丙烯的转化率。为了减少焦炭的形成，研究人员可以使用金属分散性更好的催化剂，加入防止焦炭形成的添加剂，并开发先进的再生技术以恢复催化剂的活性。

Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst.

For both ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)0.48.

The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a loss in catalytic activity and requiring extensive regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include alloying Pt with other metals that reduce the adsorption of hydrogen and decrease the likelihood of carbon deposition. Catalyst regeneration can be improved by controlling reaction conditions, such as temperature and flow rates, to prevent excessive carbon buildup. Additionally, using supports with high surface areas and porosities can facilitate easier removal of deposited carbon.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types play a crucial role, as they determine the efficiency of the conversion process. Indium (In)-promoted platinum (Pt) catalysts are effective for PDH due to their ability to enhance the selectivity towards propene production and reduce the formation of byproducts like methane. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve adjusting the catalyst composition and operating conditions to prevent carbon buildup on the catalyst surface, which can lead to decreased efficiency and catalyst deactivation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for the reaction, thereby lowering the overall conversion rates. To mitigate coke formation, one can implement strategies such as maintaining optimal operating conditions, using catalysts with enhanced resistance to carbon deposition, and periodically regenerating the catalyst to remove accumulated coke. The use of advanced catalyst designs, such as the ones described in the literature, can also help in improving catalyst regeneration and enhancing long-term process efficiency.
