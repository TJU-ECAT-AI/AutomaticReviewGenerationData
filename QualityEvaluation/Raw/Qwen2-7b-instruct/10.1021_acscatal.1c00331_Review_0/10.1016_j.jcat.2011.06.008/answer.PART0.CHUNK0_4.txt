Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In.

The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types play a crucial role, as they determine the efficiency of the conversion process. Indium (In)-promoted platinum (Pt) catalysts are effective for PDH due to their ability to enhance the selectivity towards propene production and reduce the formation of byproducts like methane. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve adjusting the catalyst composition and operating conditions to prevent carbon buildup on the catalyst surface, which can lead to decreased efficiency and catalyst deactivation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for the reaction, thereby lowering the overall conversion rates. To mitigate coke formation, one can implement strategies such as maintaining optimal operating conditions, using catalysts with enhanced resistance to carbon deposition, and periodically regenerating the catalyst to remove accumulated coke. The use of advanced catalyst designs, such as the ones described in the literature, can also help in improving catalyst regeneration and enhancing long-term process efficiency.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产的途径，通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气来实现。PDH的关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件，如温度、压力以及适宜的催化剂。催化剂类型对过程效率起着决定性作用，因为它们决定了转化过程的效率。含铟（In）促进铂（Pt）的催化剂对于PDH是有效的，由于它们能够增强丙烯选择性和减少副产品如甲烷的形成。为了减少焦炭在催化剂表面的沉积，可以通过调整催化剂组成和操作条件来实施策略，防止碳沉积导致催化剂效率下降。

焦炭在基于铂的催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的表面面积，从而降低了总体转换率。为了减少焦炭形成，可以实施策略如保持最佳的操作条件、使用具有增强抗碳沉积能力的催化剂以及定期再生催化剂以去除累积的焦炭。文献中描述的先进催化剂设计也可以帮助提高催化剂再生能力和长期过程效率。
