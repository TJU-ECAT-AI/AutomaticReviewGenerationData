1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production because it converts propane molecules into propene through oxidation. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, selecting appropriate catalyst types like well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, and understanding the practical applications in industry.
2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and increasing the accumulation of impurities, which can lead to decreased activity and stability of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate this issue include implementing controlled reaction conditions to prevent excessive coke formation and utilizing specific catalyst design features that enhance regenerability and reduce coke deposition.
