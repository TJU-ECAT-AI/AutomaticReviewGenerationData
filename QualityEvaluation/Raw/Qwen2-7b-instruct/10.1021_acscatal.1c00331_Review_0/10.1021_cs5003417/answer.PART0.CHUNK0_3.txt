The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Key considerations for the process involve selecting an appropriate catalyst, optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, and ensuring the presence of a suitable oxidant. Coke formation on catalysts, especially on platinum-based catalysts, impacts process efficiency by reducing activity and lifetime. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include utilizing promoters, adjusting reaction conditions, and developing more resistant catalyst materials.
