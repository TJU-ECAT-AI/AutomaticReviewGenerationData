1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through an oxidative process. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve selecting appropriate temperatures, pressures, and ensuring sufficient oxygen presence. Catalyst types are essential, with well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts known to enhance selectivity and activity. Pt-based catalysts, while efficient, are susceptible to coke formation, impacting process efficiency negatively. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include utilizing catalysts with high surface area supports and incorporating promoters. Improving catalyst regeneration focuses on optimizing desulfurization processes and employing mild regeneration conditions.
