1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production because it converts propane molecules into propene through oxidation. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, selecting appropriate catalyst types like well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, and understanding the practical applications in industry.
2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and increasing the accumulation of impurities, which can lead to decreased activity and stability of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate this issue include implementing controlled reaction conditions to prevent excessive coke formation and utilizing specific catalyst design features that enhance regenerability and reduce coke deposition.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过氧化将丙烷分子转化为丙烯。此过程的关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件，如温度、压力和反应物比例；选择合适的催化剂类型，如定义明确的钒氧化物支持催化剂；以及理解工业应用。
2. 在Pt基催化剂上形成的焦炭会显著影响工艺效率，因为它减少了可用的反应表面并增加了杂质积累，导致催化剂活性和稳定性下降。为缓解这一问题，可以采取控制反应条件以防止过量焦炭形成，并利用增强再生能力和减少焦炭沉积的特定催化剂设计特征的策略。
