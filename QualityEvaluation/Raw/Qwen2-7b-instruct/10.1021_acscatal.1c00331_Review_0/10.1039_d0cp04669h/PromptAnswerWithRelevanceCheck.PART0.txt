1. PDH catalysis is essential for propene production due to the growing demand for propylene and declining production from steam cracking. Catalysts like Pt or Cr are utilized but are costly or toxic. Earth-abundant metals like iron, forming in situ carbide phases, offer an alternative with high activity and selectivity.

2. DFT helps elucidate the high selectivity of Fe3C surfaces in PDH reactions. Carbon-rich surfaces exhibit superior selectivity for propylene production compared to iron-rich ones, based on the comparison of propylene desorption barriers versus CH scission barriers.

3. PDH functions by converting propane into propene, with critical factors being reaction conditions, catalyst type, and industrial application considerations.

4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces efficiency by diminishing activity and necessitating expensive regeneration. Strategies involve adjusting catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and optimizing regeneration procedures.

1. The PDH process converts propane into propylene by direct dehydrogenation, driven by the growing demand for propylene and the shift towards lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks. Traditionally, this process relies on expensive catalysts like platinum (Pt) or chromium (Cr), but recent research has shown that iron-based materials, particularly iron carbides, can offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly reduce process efficiency and require frequent catalyst regeneration, which can be costly and time-consuming. To mitigate this, researchers have explored the role of additives like phosphate. Phosphate can prevent rapid coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon through electron withdrawal, weakening the Fe-C interaction.

3. The selectivity of the PDH reaction is influenced by the surface chemistry of the catalyst. Carbon-rich iron carbide surfaces tend to have higher selectivity for propylene production, as evidenced by a higher propylene desorption barrier compared to iron-rich surfaces. This selectivity is due to a combination of factors including a decrease in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers.

4. The computational investigation revealed that the selectivity of Fe3C surfaces towards propylene is mainly attributed to a geometric ensemble effect. This effect reduces the propylene binding energy and increases the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation steps, making the process more selective.

5. The removal of van der Waals energy corrections from the data showed no significant qualitative differences between the activity and selectivity trends on Fe and Fe3C surfaces, suggesting that the geometric ensemble effect is the predominant factor influencing selectivity.

1. 直接脱氢化丙烷（PDH）过程将丙烷转化为丙烯，以满足对丙烯日益增长的需求和轻质烃原料的转变。传统上，这一过程依赖于昂贵的催化剂，如铂（Pt）或铬（Cr），但最近的研究表明，铁基材料，特别是铁碳化合物，可以提供一种成本效益高且环境友好的替代品。

2. 铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著降低过程效率，并需要频繁的催化剂再生，这既昂贵又耗时。为了缓解这一问题，研究人员探索了添加剂的作用，如磷酸。磷酸可以通过电子抽取作用来防止快速焦炭形成，从而削弱表面碳的稳定性，减弱Fe-C相互作用。

3. PDH反应的选择性受到催化剂表面化学的影响。富含碳的铁碳表面倾向于具有更高的丙烯选择性生产，因为与铁富表面相比，丙烯脱附势垒更高。这种选择性归因于几个因素的组合，包括丙烯结合能的下降和深层脱氢步骤的增加。

4. 计算调查揭示了Fe3C表面向丙烯选择性的主要归因是几何簇集效应。这种效应降低了丙烯的结合能并增加了深度脱氢步骤的可能性，使过程更具选择性。

5. 从范德华能量修正数据中去除后，发现Fe和Fe3C表面的活性和选择性趋势之间没有显著的定性差异，这表明几何簇集效应是影响选择性的主要因素。

[2] "Researchers recently have identified promising PDH catalysts with comparable selectivity and activity to commercialized catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports."

1. PDH (propane dehydrogenation) uses catalysts like Pt or Cr, which are either expensive or toxic. Researchers have discovered iron-based catalysts that are cheaper, non-toxic, and offer similar selectivity and activity to commercial Pt or Cr-based catalysts. These include iron supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports.

2. The high selectivity of Fe3C for propylene during PDH is attributed to the high stability of carbon-rich surfaces under reaction conditions. This is determined using ab initio thermodynamics. The kinetic barriers for PDH predict that these surfaces are highly selective towards propylene, as the difference in the desorption energy and dehydrogenation energy of propylene dictates selectivity.

3. Surface carbon on Fe-based catalysts forms a stable carbide phase, which separates large iron ensembles. This favors propylene adsorption and deep dehydrogenation, contributing to the high selectivity of Fe3C for PDH. The ensemble effect is crucial for the selectivity.

4. The detailed surface structure of the catalyst during the induction period is not clear.

5. Phosphate can prevent rapid coke formation on pure iron surfaces by weakening the FeC interaction, which destabilizes surface carbon. This is achieved through charge transfer, as phosphate is highly electron withdrawing. The destabilization of surface carbon leads to a reduction in coke formation.

1. PDH催化剂通常使用昂贵或有毒的Pt或Cr。研究人员已经发现，基于廉价且无毒的铁基材料（如Fe、Fe2O3支持的磺化铝硅酸盐、铁硅酸盐分子筛、单个Fe原子在硅胶上的沉积以及金属有机框架衍生的碳支持的铁纳米颗粒）的催化剂具有与商业化的Pt或Cr基催化剂相当的选择性和活性。

2. Fe3C在PDH过程中对丙烯的高度选择性可归因于反应条件下碳富集表面的高稳定性。通过原位热力学方法确定了这一点。PDH动力学壁垒预测这些表面高度选择性地向丙烯转化，因为丙烯脱附能和脱氢能之间的差异决定了选择性。

3. Fe基催化剂表面上的碳形成稳定的碳化物相，这将大型铁簇分离。这有利于丙烯吸附和深度脱氢，是Fe3C在PDH中表现出高度选择性的关键因素。簇效应对于选择性至关重要。

4. 在诱导期催化剂的详细表面结构尚不清晰。

5. 磷酸可以通过电子转移削弱Fe-C相互作用，从而从表面去除电子密度，进而减弱表面碳的稳定性，防止快速结焦。这导致表面碳的解稳并减少结焦。

1. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts have gained importance due to the rising demand for propylene and falling propylene production from steam cracking. Catalysts like Pt and Cr are expensive or toxic, but recent experiments showed that iron-based carbides, especially those with carbon-rich surfaces, offer good activity and high selectivity for PDH. Carbon-rich surfaces are more selective for propylene production over cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces, determined by the propylene desorption barrier versus the CH scission barrier for dehydrogenation steps beyond propylene. Carbon-rich Fe3C surfaces are highly selective for PDH, suggesting Fe3C could be an alternative catalyst. The detailed surface structure during the induction period needs further investigation. 

2. There is a significant difference in propane physisorption energy on Pt(111) compared to iron and Fe3C surfaces, mainly due to the D3 van der Waals energy correction. This difference aligns with the general trend that Fe3C is more selective but less active than Pt(111).

3. The high selectivity of carbon-rich surfaces is mainly due to a geometric effect. This effect reduces the propylene binding energy on the surface, allowing the C3H6 molecule to form bonds with more iron atoms. The alignment of surface atoms also contributes to this effect.

4. Phosphate helps suppress coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon, shifting the region of high C* coverage outside the PDH reaction conditions. The destabilization of surface carbon is related to the amount of charge transfer between the phosphate group and the surface.

1. 非氧化性的丙烷脱氢催化技术因其对丙烯的需求增加和蒸汽裂解产生的丙烯产量下降而变得越来越重要。铂或铬等催化剂昂贵或有毒，但近期实验表明，铁基碳化物，尤其是碳富集表面的铁基碳化物，在PDH中表现出良好的活性和高选择性。与铁富集表面相比，碳富集表面在丙烯生产过程中显示出更高的选择性，这是通过比较丙烯脱附势垒与脱氢步骤超过丙烯时的CH断裂势垒来确定的。碳富集的Fe3C表面在PDH中显示出高度的选择性，这表明Fe3C可能是PDH的潜在替代催化剂。关于催化剂诱导期的详细表面结构需要进一步研究。

2. 在铁和Fe3C表面与Pt(111)表面之间的丙烷物理吸附能存在显著差异，主要归因于D3范德华能量校正。这一差异与Fe3C在活性和选择性方面相对于Pt(111)的趋势一致，即Fe3C的选择性更高但活性较低。

3. 碳富集表面高选择性的主要原因在于几何效应。这种效应降低了表面的丙烯结合能，使C3H6分子能够与更多的铁原子形成键。表面原子的排列也对此效应有所贡献。

4. 磷酸有助于抑制焦炭形成，通过削弱表面碳，将表面碳的稳定区域移出PDH反应条件之外。表面碳的不稳定与磷酸组和表面之间电荷转移的数量有关。

The PDH process uses catalysts to convert propane into propylene, a crucial chemical feedstock. Traditionally, platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) based catalysts are employed, but these materials are costly or toxic. Researchers have turned to earth-abundant metals like iron, which form in situ carbide phases that exhibit both high activity and selectivity for PDH. Through density functional theory (DFT), scientists aim to understand why Fe3C surfaces are highly selective for PDH reactions. Carbon-rich surfaces of Fe3C show superior propylene selectivity compared to iron-rich surfaces. The electronic structure analysis reveals that carbon disrupts surface iron ensembles, enhancing the selectivity towards propylene. Phosphate helps in suppressing coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon atoms, thus preventing coking. The precise surface structure during the induction period needs further exploration.
