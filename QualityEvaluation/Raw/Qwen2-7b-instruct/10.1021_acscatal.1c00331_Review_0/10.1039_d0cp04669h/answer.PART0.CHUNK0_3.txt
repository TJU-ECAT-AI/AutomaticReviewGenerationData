1. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts have gained importance due to the rising demand for propylene and falling propylene production from steam cracking. Catalysts like Pt and Cr are expensive or toxic, but recent experiments showed that iron-based carbides, especially those with carbon-rich surfaces, offer good activity and high selectivity for PDH. Carbon-rich surfaces are more selective for propylene production over cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces, determined by the propylene desorption barrier versus the CH scission barrier for dehydrogenation steps beyond propylene. Carbon-rich Fe3C surfaces are highly selective for PDH, suggesting Fe3C could be an alternative catalyst. The detailed surface structure during the induction period needs further investigation. 

2. There is a significant difference in propane physisorption energy on Pt(111) compared to iron and Fe3C surfaces, mainly due to the D3 van der Waals energy correction. This difference aligns with the general trend that Fe3C is more selective but less active than Pt(111).

3. The high selectivity of carbon-rich surfaces is mainly due to a geometric effect. This effect reduces the propylene binding energy on the surface, allowing the C3H6 molecule to form bonds with more iron atoms. The alignment of surface atoms also contributes to this effect.

4. Phosphate helps suppress coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon, shifting the region of high C* coverage outside the PDH reaction conditions. The destabilization of surface carbon is related to the amount of charge transfer between the phosphate group and the surface.

1. 非氧化性的丙烷脱氢催化技术因其对丙烯的需求增加和蒸汽裂解产生的丙烯产量下降而变得越来越重要。铂或铬等催化剂昂贵或有毒，但近期实验表明，铁基碳化物，尤其是碳富集表面的铁基碳化物，在PDH中表现出良好的活性和高选择性。与铁富集表面相比，碳富集表面在丙烯生产过程中显示出更高的选择性，这是通过比较丙烯脱附势垒与脱氢步骤超过丙烯时的CH断裂势垒来确定的。碳富集的Fe3C表面在PDH中显示出高度的选择性，这表明Fe3C可能是PDH的潜在替代催化剂。关于催化剂诱导期的详细表面结构需要进一步研究。

2. 在铁和Fe3C表面与Pt(111)表面之间的丙烷物理吸附能存在显著差异，主要归因于D3范德华能量校正。这一差异与Fe3C在活性和选择性方面相对于Pt(111)的趋势一致，即Fe3C的选择性更高但活性较低。

3. 碳富集表面高选择性的主要原因在于几何效应。这种效应降低了表面的丙烯结合能，使C3H6分子能够与更多的铁原子形成键。表面原子的排列也对此效应有所贡献。

4. 磷酸有助于抑制焦炭形成，通过削弱表面碳，将表面碳的稳定区域移出PDH反应条件之外。表面碳的不稳定与磷酸组和表面之间电荷转移的数量有关。
