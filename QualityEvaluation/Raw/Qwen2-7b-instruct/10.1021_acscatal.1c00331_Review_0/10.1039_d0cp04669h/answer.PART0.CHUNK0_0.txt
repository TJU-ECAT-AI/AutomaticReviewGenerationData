[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."
[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."
[4] "We use density functional theory (DFT) to better understand why the PDH reaction is highly selective on Fe3C surfaces."
[5] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces, which is determined by comparing the propylene desorption barrier to the CH scission barrier for dehydrogenation steps beyond propylene."
[6] "Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, where the key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications."
[7] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring costly regeneration processes."
[8] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include modifying catalyst composition, enhancing cooling rates, and implementing more efficient regeneration protocols."

1. PDH catalysis is essential for propene production due to the growing demand for propylene and declining production from steam cracking. Catalysts like Pt or Cr are utilized but are costly or toxic. Earth-abundant metals like iron, forming in situ carbide phases, offer an alternative with high activity and selectivity.

2. DFT helps elucidate the high selectivity of Fe3C surfaces in PDH reactions. Carbon-rich surfaces exhibit superior selectivity for propylene production compared to iron-rich ones, based on the comparison of propylene desorption barriers versus CH scission barriers.

3. PDH functions by converting propane into propene, with critical factors being reaction conditions, catalyst type, and industrial application considerations.

4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces efficiency by diminishing activity and necessitating expensive regeneration. Strategies involve adjusting catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and optimizing regeneration procedures.

1.PDH催化是丙烯生产的关键方法，因为对丙烯的需求增长而蒸汽裂解的产量下降。Pt或Cr等催化剂成本高或有毒。铁等地球丰富的金属形成原位碳化物相，表现出高活性和高选择性。

2.DFT有助于理解Fe3C表面在PDH反应中的高选择性。碳富集表面在丙烯生产中表现出比铁富集表面更高的选择性，这是通过比较丙烯脱附壁垒与超过丙烯的CH断裂壁垒来确定的。

3.PDH通过将丙烷转化为丙烯起作用，关键因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用考虑。

4.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了效率，减少了活性并需要昂贵的再生过程。策略包括调整催化剂组成、提高冷却速率以及优化再生程序。
