The PDH process uses catalysts to convert propane into propylene, a crucial chemical feedstock. Traditionally, platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) based catalysts are employed, but these materials are costly or toxic. Researchers have turned to earth-abundant metals like iron, which form in situ carbide phases that exhibit both high activity and selectivity for PDH. Through density functional theory (DFT), scientists aim to understand why Fe3C surfaces are highly selective for PDH reactions. Carbon-rich surfaces of Fe3C show superior propylene selectivity compared to iron-rich surfaces. The electronic structure analysis reveals that carbon disrupts surface iron ensembles, enhancing the selectivity towards propylene. Phosphate helps in suppressing coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon atoms, thus preventing coking. The precise surface structure during the induction period needs further exploration.
