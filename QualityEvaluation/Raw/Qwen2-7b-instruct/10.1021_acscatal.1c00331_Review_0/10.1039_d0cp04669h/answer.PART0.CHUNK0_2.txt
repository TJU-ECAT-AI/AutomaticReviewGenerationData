1. PDH (propane dehydrogenation) uses catalysts like Pt or Cr, which are either expensive or toxic. Researchers have discovered iron-based catalysts that are cheaper, non-toxic, and offer similar selectivity and activity to commercial Pt or Cr-based catalysts. These include iron supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports.

2. The high selectivity of Fe3C for propylene during PDH is attributed to the high stability of carbon-rich surfaces under reaction conditions. This is determined using ab initio thermodynamics. The kinetic barriers for PDH predict that these surfaces are highly selective towards propylene, as the difference in the desorption energy and dehydrogenation energy of propylene dictates selectivity.

3. Surface carbon on Fe-based catalysts forms a stable carbide phase, which separates large iron ensembles. This favors propylene adsorption and deep dehydrogenation, contributing to the high selectivity of Fe3C for PDH. The ensemble effect is crucial for the selectivity.

4. The detailed surface structure of the catalyst during the induction period is not clear.

5. Phosphate can prevent rapid coke formation on pure iron surfaces by weakening the FeC interaction, which destabilizes surface carbon. This is achieved through charge transfer, as phosphate is highly electron withdrawing. The destabilization of surface carbon leads to a reduction in coke formation.

1. PDH催化剂通常使用昂贵或有毒的Pt或Cr。研究人员已经发现，基于廉价且无毒的铁基材料（如Fe、Fe2O3支持的磺化铝硅酸盐、铁硅酸盐分子筛、单个Fe原子在硅胶上的沉积以及金属有机框架衍生的碳支持的铁纳米颗粒）的催化剂具有与商业化的Pt或Cr基催化剂相当的选择性和活性。

2. Fe3C在PDH过程中对丙烯的高度选择性可归因于反应条件下碳富集表面的高稳定性。通过原位热力学方法确定了这一点。PDH动力学壁垒预测这些表面高度选择性地向丙烯转化，因为丙烯脱附能和脱氢能之间的差异决定了选择性。

3. Fe基催化剂表面上的碳形成稳定的碳化物相，这将大型铁簇分离。这有利于丙烯吸附和深度脱氢，是Fe3C在PDH中表现出高度选择性的关键因素。簇效应对于选择性至关重要。

4. 在诱导期催化剂的详细表面结构尚不清晰。

5. 磷酸可以通过电子转移削弱Fe-C相互作用，从而从表面去除电子密度，进而减弱表面碳的稳定性，防止快速结焦。这导致表面碳的解稳并减少结焦。
