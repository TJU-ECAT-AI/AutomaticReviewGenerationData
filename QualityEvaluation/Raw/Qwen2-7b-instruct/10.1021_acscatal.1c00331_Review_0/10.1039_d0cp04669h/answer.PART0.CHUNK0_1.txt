[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."
[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."
[4] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces, which is determined by comparing the propylene desorption barrier to the CH scission barrier for dehydrogena- tion steps beyond propylene."
[5] "In this work we consider both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric terminations that can persist under the carbon-rich conditions of the PDH reaction."
[6] "We find that the carbon-rich surfaces are more stable under the carbon-rich reaction environment, and that these surfaces generally show high selectivity for propylene due to a combined decrease in the propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers."
[7] "The detailed surface structure of the catalyst during the induction period remains unclear. Here, we report a computational investigation of the PDH reaction mechanism on Fe3C surfaces to better understand how this material achieves high PDH selectivity."
[8] "The stability of the surface itself is not causally related to the selectivity, but the carbon-rich surfaces tend to be more stable under carbon-rich conditions and they exhibit higher selectivity."
[9] "Since there is some uncertainly in the empirical parameters of the D3 van der Waals energy correction when it is applied to metal surfaces, we also report this data with the van der Waals energy removed to determine if there are qualitative differences."
[10] "We found a significant difference in the propane physisorption energy on Pt(111) compared to the Fe and Fe3C surfaces that was nearly entirely attributed to the D3 van der Waals energy correction."

1. The PDH process converts propane into propylene by direct dehydrogenation, driven by the growing demand for propylene and the shift towards lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks. Traditionally, this process relies on expensive catalysts like platinum (Pt) or chromium (Cr), but recent research has shown that iron-based materials, particularly iron carbides, can offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly reduce process efficiency and require frequent catalyst regeneration, which can be costly and time-consuming. To mitigate this, researchers have explored the role of additives like phosphate. Phosphate can prevent rapid coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon through electron withdrawal, weakening the Fe-C interaction.

3. The selectivity of the PDH reaction is influenced by the surface chemistry of the catalyst. Carbon-rich iron carbide surfaces tend to have higher selectivity for propylene production, as evidenced by a higher propylene desorption barrier compared to iron-rich surfaces. This selectivity is due to a combination of factors including a decrease in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers.

4. The computational investigation revealed that the selectivity of Fe3C surfaces towards propylene is mainly attributed to a geometric ensemble effect. This effect reduces the propylene binding energy and increases the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation steps, making the process more selective.

5. The removal of van der Waals energy corrections from the data showed no significant qualitative differences between the activity and selectivity trends on Fe and Fe3C surfaces, suggesting that the geometric ensemble effect is the predominant factor influencing selectivity.

1. 直接脱氢化丙烷（PDH）过程将丙烷转化为丙烯，以满足对丙烯日益增长的需求和轻质烃原料的转变。传统上，这一过程依赖于昂贵的催化剂，如铂（Pt）或铬（Cr），但最近的研究表明，铁基材料，特别是铁碳化合物，可以提供一种成本效益高且环境友好的替代品。

2. 铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著降低过程效率，并需要频繁的催化剂再生，这既昂贵又耗时。为了缓解这一问题，研究人员探索了添加剂的作用，如磷酸。磷酸可以通过电子抽取作用来防止快速焦炭形成，从而削弱表面碳的稳定性，减弱Fe-C相互作用。

3. PDH反应的选择性受到催化剂表面化学的影响。富含碳的铁碳表面倾向于具有更高的丙烯选择性生产，因为与铁富表面相比，丙烯脱附势垒更高。这种选择性归因于几个因素的组合，包括丙烯结合能的下降和深层脱氢步骤的增加。

4. 计算调查揭示了Fe3C表面向丙烯选择性的主要归因是几何簇集效应。这种效应降低了丙烯的结合能并增加了深度脱氢步骤的可能性，使过程更具选择性。

5. 从范德华能量修正数据中去除后，发现Fe和Fe3C表面的活性和选择性趋势之间没有显著的定性差异，这表明几何簇集效应是影响选择性的主要因素。
