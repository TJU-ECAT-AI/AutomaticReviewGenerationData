[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a chemical reaction that converts propane (C3H8) into propene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2)."
[2] "The performance of PDH on Ga2O3-based catalysts depends on the coordination environment and acidity of surface sites."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly reduce their activity and lifetime."
[4] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include temperature control, support materials, and catalyst design."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a process that transforms propane into propene and hydrogen. The effectiveness of PDH on gallium oxide (Ga2O3)-based catalysts is influenced by the arrangement of atoms around surface sites and the acidity of these sites.
2. Coke formation on platinum (Pt)-based catalysts substantially decreases their efficiency and lifespan. Strategies to combat coke buildup and enhance catalyst rejuvenation involve managing temperature, utilizing supportive materials, and optimizing catalyst design.

1. 烷基化（PDH）是一种化学反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。Ga2O3基催化剂上PDH的性能取决于表面位点周围原子的排列环境以及表面位点的酸性。
2. 在铂(Pt)-基催化剂上形成的焦炭显著降低了它们的活性和寿命。对抗焦炭生成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括温度控制、使用支持材料和优化催化剂设计。
