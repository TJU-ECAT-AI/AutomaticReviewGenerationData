Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on how the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production. However, it mentions that the performance of PDH on Ga2O3-based catalysts depends on the coordination environment and acidity of surface sites. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring more frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation might include modifying the catalyst composition or operating conditions.

答案：文献没有提供关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)作为丙烯生产方法的具体细节。然而，它提到了Ga2O3基催化剂上PDH的性能取决于表面位点的配位环境和酸性。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，降低催化剂活性并需要更频繁的再生。减少焦炭形成的策略可能包括修改催化剂组成或操作条件。
