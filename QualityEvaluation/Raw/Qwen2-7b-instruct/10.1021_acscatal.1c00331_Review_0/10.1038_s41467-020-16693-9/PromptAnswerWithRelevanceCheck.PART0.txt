1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, which relies on high reaction temperatures for sufficient yields. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate catalyst types and managing the process conditions to prevent severe catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The efficiency of the process is impacted by coke deposition on the catalyst, necessitating continuous or short-cycle regeneration.

2. Strategies for mitigating coke formation in PDH include designing catalysts that reduce side reactions and developing methods for efficient catalyst regeneration. The selection of catalyst types is crucial, as certain materials are better suited for high-temperature reactions without deactivating.

3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts leads to deactivation and requires frequent regeneration, impacting the overall efficiency of the PDH process. To address this, the development of catalysts that minimize undesired side reactions and facilitate effective regeneration is essential.

4. Challenges in PDH catalyst development stem from balancing selectivity and stability, particularly in preventing coke formation and maintaining high performance at high temperatures. This requires sophisticated catalyst design and optimization to ensure efficient propene production without compromising the catalyst's longevity.

5. The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts due to coke formation is a critical issue in PDH processes. Mitigation strategies focus on designing catalysts that inhibit side reactions and enable efficient regeneration, aiming to maintain high propene yields and process efficiency.

6. To improve PDH process efficiency, efforts are directed towards developing catalysts that reduce coke formation and facilitate effective regeneration. This involves optimizing catalyst design and conditions to prevent deactivation, ensuring sustainable and economically viable propene production.

1. Propylene serves as a crucial component in the synthesis of various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. High temperatures (around 600°C) are necessary to achieve sufficient propylene yields due to the endothermic nature of the process. However, severe catalyst deactivation occurs under such conditions, often due to coke deposition and sintering. This necessitates the continuous regeneration of catalysts or their use in short cycles, posing a significant challenge in both theoretical and applied chemistry.

2. In Pt-based catalysts, clusters of Pt atoms (PtPt ensembles) are active in the over-dehydrogenation of propylene and hydrogenolysis, leading to unwanted side reactions. Isolating Pt atoms can help inhibit these side reactions, enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts.

3. The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst, featuring single-atom Pt, achieves a remarkable 30% conversion rate with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600°C for 96 hours without performance degradation. This is due to the single-atom Pt's ability to efficiently catalyze the first and second carbon-hydrogen (CH) activations while effectively inhibiting the third one, thereby minimizing coke formation and enhancing selectivity and stability.

1. 丙烯是生产各种化学品如聚合物、树脂、表面活性剂、染料和药物的重要基础。由于过程的吸热特性，需要高达600°C的高温以获得足够的丙烯产量。然而，在这种苛刻条件下，催化剂容易因焦炭沉积或熔融而失效，因此必须对催化剂进行连续或短周期的再生，这在纯化学和应用化学中是一个巨大的挑战。

2. 在基于铂的催化剂中，铂原子簇（PtPt簇）在丙烯过度脱氢和氢解反应中是活跃的，导致不希望的副反应。孤立铂原子策略可以抑制这些副反应，提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

3. PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂含有单个铂原子，实现了30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性，持续运行96小时且性能不降级。这是由于单个铂原子能够有效地催化第一个和第二个碳-氢（CH）裂解，同时有效抑制第三个裂解，从而最小化焦炭形成并增强选择性和稳定性。

1. Propylene is crucial for manufacturing various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. The recent shift in steam cracker feedstock from naphtha to ethane has led to a decline in propylene supply. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts is a viable method to meet growing propylene demand. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and sintering necessitates continuous or cyclic catalyst regeneration. Developing a catalyst capable of enduring such conditions is a significant challenge in both pure and applied chemistry. Coke buildup on Pt-based catalysts reduces their efficiency by diminishing activity and selectivity over time. Strategies to combat coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, refining catalyst structure, and optimizing reaction conditions. Catalyst regeneration involves treating spent catalysts with oxidizers like oxygen or air to remove coke deposits.

2. Almost all of the propylene production relies on the conversion of propane through the PDH process, with the majority of revenue coming from widget sales. Gadget sales account for the remainder of the revenue, contributing less significantly.
