[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
[2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[3] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[4] "Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation610."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts, requiring frequent regeneration."
[6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include designing catalysts with isolated active sites, using modifiers that block unwanted reaction pathways, and employing catalyst supports that resist sintering."

1. Propylene serves as a fundamental component in the manufacturing of various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. High reaction temperatures are essential to achieve sufficient propylene yields, but these conditions lead to severe catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and sintering, necessitating continuous or periodic catalyst regeneration.

2. Meeting the challenge of developing a catalyst capable of operating efficiently under such demanding conditions is a significant hurdle in both pure and applied chemistry.

3. Selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are influenced by the balance between the propylene product's desorption and involvement in undesired side reactions, including further CH(C) scissions leading to coke formation.

4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts diminishes the process's efficiency by deactivating the catalysts, necessitating frequent regeneration procedures.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration involve the design of catalysts with isolated active sites, utilization of modifiers to block undesired reaction pathways, and selection of catalyst supports that resist sintering.

6. Implementing these strategies can lead to more stable and selective catalysts for PDH, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the propene production process.

1. 丙烯是生产各种化学品（如聚合物、树脂、表面活性剂、染料和药物）的重要基础原料。为了获得足够的丙烯产量，需要使用高反应温度，但这些条件会导致催化剂由于焦炭沉积和/或聚集而失效，因此必须进行连续或短周期的催化剂再生。

2. 面对在如此苛刻条件下开发满足需求的催化剂这一重大挑战，在纯粹和应用化学领域都是一项艰巨的任务。

3. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，选择性和稳定性取决于产品丙烯的脱附与参与不希望的副反应之间的平衡，包括进一步的CH(C)断裂导致焦炭形成。

4. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了过程效率，导致催化剂失效，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

5. 减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生性的策略包括设计具有孤立活性位点的催化剂、利用能阻断不希望的反应路径的修饰剂以及选择能抵抗聚集的催化剂支撑材料。

6. 实施这些策略可以实现更稳定和选择性更好的催化剂用于PDH，从而提高丙烯生产过程的整体效率。
