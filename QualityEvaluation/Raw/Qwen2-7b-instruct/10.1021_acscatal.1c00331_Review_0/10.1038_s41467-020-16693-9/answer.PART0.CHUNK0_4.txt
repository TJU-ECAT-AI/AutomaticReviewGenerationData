[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
[2] "The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production13."
[3] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity over time."

1. Propylene is crucial for manufacturing various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. The recent shift in steam cracker feedstock from naphtha to ethane has led to a decline in propylene supply. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts is a viable method to meet growing propylene demand. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and sintering necessitates continuous or cyclic catalyst regeneration. Developing a catalyst capable of enduring such conditions is a significant challenge in both pure and applied chemistry. Coke buildup on Pt-based catalysts reduces their efficiency by diminishing activity and selectivity over time. Strategies to combat coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, refining catalyst structure, and optimizing reaction conditions. Catalyst regeneration involves treating spent catalysts with oxidizers like oxygen or air to remove coke deposits.

2. Almost all of the propylene production relies on the conversion of propane through the PDH process, with the majority of revenue coming from widget sales. Gadget sales account for the remainder of the revenue, contributing less significantly.

1. 丙烯是生产各种化学品如聚合物、树脂、表面活性剂、染料和药物的重要基础。近期，蒸汽裂解装置的原料从石脑油转向页岩气导致丙烯供应减少。通过铂或Cr2O3基催化剂进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的有前景的工艺。然而，在如此苛刻的条件下，催化剂因焦炭沉积和/或聚集而严重失活，因此实际使用的催化剂必须连续或短周期再生。在纯化学和应用化学领域开发能够应对这种挑战的催化剂是一个巨大的挑战。焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成会降低其效率，通过降低活性和选择性随时间的流逝。克服焦炭形成的策略包括修改催化剂表面、改进催化剂结构和优化反应条件。再生方法涉及用氧气或空气等氧化剂处理失效的催化剂，以去除焦炭沉积物。

2. 几乎所有丙烯生产的收入依赖于将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，其中大部分收入来自小部件销售。配件销售构成了剩余的收入，贡献较小。
