[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
[2] "The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production13."
[4] "Although a number of literatures on catalytic PDH have been reported to this day, no catalyst that exhibits high catalytic activity, selectivity, and day-long stability at high temperatures (600 C) has been developed to the best of our knowledge15."
[5] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH11."
[7] "However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by the conventional alloying approach."
[8] "For instance, alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability1."
[9] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms17 or alloy nanoparticles11,16 without spatial separation13 are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
[10] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[11] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[12] "The convex Pt1 site is unfavorable geometrically and energetically for Pb deposition."
[13] "We show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
[14] "The combination of (1) the specific crystal structure of intermetallic PtGa providing isolated Pt, (2) its thermal stability, and (3) the large atomic size of Pb enables the remarkably high selectivity and stability even in harsh conditions."
[15] "The catalytic performance in PDH is much superior to those of the reported systems."
[16] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

1. Propylene serves as a crucial building block for producing various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. The decrease in propylene supply is due to the shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane.
2. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising method for satisfying the growing global demand for propylene production.
3. Despite numerous studies on catalytic PDH, no catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability at high temperatures (600 C) has been developed.
4. High temperatures are required for PDH to obtain sufficient propylene yields, but this leads to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
5. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH, but conventional alloying methods struggle to achieve complete isolation.
6. Alloying active metals (such as Pt) with inactive metals (like Sn) can dilute Pt clusters and enhance propylene selectivity and stability, but it is challenging to apply this to high-temperature reactions like PDH.
7. At high temperatures, Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation tend to aggregate and form larger nanoparticles, compromising stability.
8. Single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds offers a potential solution to address this challenge.
9. In this study, a Pb-modified PtGa catalyst selectively blocks threefold Pt sites while preserving the single-atom Pt, ensuring its integrity.
10. The convex Pt1 site is energetically and geometrically unfavorable for Pb deposition.
11. The designed Pb-modified PtGa catalyst exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability in PDH at high temperatures.
12. The catalyst's remarkable performance surpasses those of previously reported systems.
13. The high selectivity of the isolated Pt1 sites minimizes coke accumulation, leading to exceptional catalyst stability.
