[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
[2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation610."
[4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by leading to deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration of the catalyst."
[6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the design of catalysts that minimize side reactions and the development of methods for catalyst regeneration."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, which relies on high reaction temperatures for sufficient yields. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate catalyst types and managing the process conditions to prevent severe catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The efficiency of the process is impacted by coke deposition on the catalyst, necessitating continuous or short-cycle regeneration.

2. Strategies for mitigating coke formation in PDH include designing catalysts that reduce side reactions and developing methods for efficient catalyst regeneration. The selection of catalyst types is crucial, as certain materials are better suited for high-temperature reactions without deactivating.

3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts leads to deactivation and requires frequent regeneration, impacting the overall efficiency of the PDH process. To address this, the development of catalysts that minimize undesired side reactions and facilitate effective regeneration is essential.

4. Challenges in PDH catalyst development stem from balancing selectivity and stability, particularly in preventing coke formation and maintaining high performance at high temperatures. This requires sophisticated catalyst design and optimization to ensure efficient propene production without compromising the catalyst's longevity.

5. The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts due to coke formation is a critical issue in PDH processes. Mitigation strategies focus on designing catalysts that inhibit side reactions and enable efficient regeneration, aiming to maintain high propene yields and process efficiency.

6. To improve PDH process efficiency, efforts are directed towards developing catalysts that reduce coke formation and facilitate effective regeneration. This involves optimizing catalyst design and conditions to prevent deactivation, ensuring sustainable and economically viable propene production.
