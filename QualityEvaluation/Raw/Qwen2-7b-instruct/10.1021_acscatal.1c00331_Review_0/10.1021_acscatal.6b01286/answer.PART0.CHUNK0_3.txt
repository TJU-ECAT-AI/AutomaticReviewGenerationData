1. Propane dehydrogenation functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by specific catalysts. Key considerations include the type of catalyst used, reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, and the potential for coke formation which can reduce catalyst efficiency. Industrial applications require efficient catalysts that maintain high activity and selectivity while minimizing coke buildup.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces their efficiency by clogging the active sites and reducing the surface area available for reactions. Strategies to mitigate this include using catalysts with higher resistance to coke formation, maintaining optimal operating conditions to prevent coke accumulation, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

1. 丙烷脱氢作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过特定催化剂促进一系列化学反应实现丙烷向丙烯的转化。关键考虑因素包括使用的催化剂类型、反应条件如温度和压力，以及焦炭形成对催化剂效率的影响。工业应用需要保持高活性和选择性的催化剂，同时尽量减少焦炭积聚。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低其效率，因为焦炭堵塞活性位点并减少了可用的反应表面。缓解策略包括使用具有更高抗焦炭形成能力的催化剂、维持最佳操作条件以防止焦炭积累，并实施先进的再生技术恢复催化剂活性。
