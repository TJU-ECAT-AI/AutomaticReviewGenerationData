1. Propane dehydrogenation functions as a method for propene production through the direct conversion of propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for this process include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, catalyst types, particularly those containing iron and phosphorus supported on alumina, and the impact of coke formation on catalyst efficiency. Industrial applications often require high activity and selectivity for propylene, which can be achieved by controlling the structural evolution of iron species on the catalyst surface.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly affects the process efficiency due to its carbonaceous nature, which leads to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with enhanced resistance to coking, optimizing operating conditions to reduce coke deposition, and employing advanced regeneration techniques that aim to remove coke more effectively without compromising the catalyst's structure.

1. 烷烃脱氢通过将烷烃分子直接转化为丙烯和氢气，作为生产丙烯的方法。这一过程的关键考虑因素包括反应条件，如温度和压力、催化剂类型，特别是含铁和磷的氧化铝支持催化剂，以及焦炭形成对催化剂效率的影响。工业应用通常需要高活性和丙烯选择性，这可以通过控制催化剂表面铁物种的结构演化来实现。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成显著影响了工艺效率，因为其碳质性质导致催化活性降低和再生能耗增加。为了减少焦炭形成，可以采用具有更强抗结焦性能的催化剂、优化操作条件以减少焦炭沉积，以及采用更先进的再生技术，这些技术旨在更有效地去除焦炭而不损害催化剂的结构。
