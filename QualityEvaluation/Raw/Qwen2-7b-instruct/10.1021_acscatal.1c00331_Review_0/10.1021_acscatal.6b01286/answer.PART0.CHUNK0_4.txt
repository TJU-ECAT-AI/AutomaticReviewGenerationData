1. Propane dehydrogenation functions as a method for propene production through the conversion of propane into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, catalyst types, including the specific composition and support material, and industrial applications focusing on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. The structural evolution of iron species on alumina-supported catalysts is critical for achieving high activity and propylene selectivity.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly affects process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and increasing the risk of catalyst poisoning. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration typically involve optimizing operating conditions, using promoters, and developing advanced catalyst designs that enhance stability and resistance to coke formation.

1. 烷烃脱氢通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气，作为生产丙烯的方法。考虑的关键因素包括反应条件，如温度和压力，催化剂类型，包括特定组分和支持材料，以及关注效率、成本效益和环境影响的工业应用。铁物种在氧化铝支持催化剂上的结构演变对于实现高活性和丙烯选择性至关重要。

2. 在Pt基催化剂上形成的焦炭显著影响了过程效率，减少了可用于反应的表面积，并增加了催化剂中毒的风险。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略通常涉及优化操作条件、使用促进剂和开发增强稳定性和焦炭形成抗性的先进催化剂设计。
