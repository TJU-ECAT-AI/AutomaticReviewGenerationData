1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through the conversion of propane molecules into propylene, a critical feedstock in the petrochemical industry. Key considerations for the process include reaction conditions, the type of catalyst used, and industrial applications. Catalyst types often consist of transition metals, such as platinum (Pt), iron (Fe), and phosphorus (P). The structural evolution of iron species is pivotal in influencing the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by clogging active sites, thus reducing their effectiveness. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include employing promoters, utilizing specific support materials, and optimizing operational conditions.

2. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts in the PDH process significantly reduces their efficiency due to the clogging of active sites. To address this issue, various strategies can be implemented. Promoters can be added to the catalyst to enhance its resistance against coke formation. Support materials, such as alumina, can be incorporated to improve thermal stability and prevent the deposition of coke. Additionally, careful control of operational parameters, including temperature, pressure, and feed composition, can optimize the process and reduce coke formation. These measures collectively aim to maintain high catalyst activity and prolong its useful life.
