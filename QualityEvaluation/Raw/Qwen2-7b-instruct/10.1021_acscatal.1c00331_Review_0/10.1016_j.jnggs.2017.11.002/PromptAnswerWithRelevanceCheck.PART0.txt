1. The paper identifies five fundamental characteristics of shale gas resources, including resource distribution, reservoir space, sweet spot areas, hydrocarbon types, and development methods. It also categorizes the development of shale gas in China and the US into three stages and outlines four future challenges for the Chinese shale gas industry. The paper predicts that global shale gas production will reach 1.1 × 10^12 cubic meters by 2040, with China likely to remain the second-largest shale gas-producing region globally.

2. The development period from investment to gas well production is typically around 1.5 to 2 years. This period includes the time from the start of investment to the start of gas production.

3. The global shale gas output in 2016 was approximately 5068 × 10^8 cubic meters. This figure includes 4447 × 10^8 cubic meters from the US, 510 × 10^8 cubic meters from Canada, 78 × 10^8 cubic meters from China, and 18 × 10^8 cubic meters from Argentina.
