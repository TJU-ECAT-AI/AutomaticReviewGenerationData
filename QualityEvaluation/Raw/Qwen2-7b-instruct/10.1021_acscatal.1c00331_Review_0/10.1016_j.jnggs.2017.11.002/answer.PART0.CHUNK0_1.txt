[1] "The development of shale gas in the United States has made a breakthrough, profoundly changed the pattern of oil and gas supply. It created the shale gas revolution on a global scale."
[2] "Shale gas reservoir is in continuous distribution, in case that a breakthrough is made at one point, the technology to make a breakthrough shall be generalized in the whole area, therefore, it is possible to build the shale gas reservoir into a big gas field in short period."
[3] "Effective development of shale gas field is the result of constant progress in geologic theory and engineering technology, the breakthrough in multi-stage fracturing technology for horizontal well achieved production revolution in development of shale gas for the first time."
[4] "The single well for shale gas is characterized by higher initial output and quick decrease in output and long stable production period, therefore, it is necessary to drill a large number of wells to stabilize and increase production in development of shale gas field."
[5] "There are abundant shale gas resources in the world, with output on the rapid growth. In 2016, global shale gas output was up to 5068  108 m3, including 4447  108 m3 in the US,510  108 m3 in Canada, 78  108 m3 in China and 18  108 m3 in Argentina."

1. Shale gas development in the United States has led to a global shift in oil and gas supply patterns, creating the shale gas revolution. 

2. A breakthrough in shale gas development can rapidly expand the size of the gas field by applying the same technology across the entire area.

3. Continuous advancements in geological theory and engineering techniques, particularly the introduction of multi-stage horizontal well fracturing, have driven the first production revolution in shale gas development.

4. Shale gas wells exhibit high initial production rates followed by a rapid decline, necessitating the drilling of multiple wells to maintain and increase production levels.

5. Global shale gas production has surged, with the US, Canada, China, and Argentina leading the output in 2016.
