[1] "The paper summarizes basic characteristic of shale gas and divides stages of development and recognition of shale gas field based on detailed analysis of typical shale gas fields in China and the US and determines challenge to development of shale gas in China inspired by shale gas revolution."
[2] "It is observed from data on shale gas development that the entire period from investment to gas well production shall be from 1.5 to 2 years."
[3] "There are abundant shale gas resources in the world, with output on the rapid growth. In 2016, global shale gas output was up to 5068  108 m3, including 4447  108 m3 in the US,510  108 m3 in Canada, 78  108 m3 in China and 18  108 m3 in Argentina."

1. The paper identifies five fundamental characteristics of shale gas resources, including resource distribution, reservoir space, sweet spot areas, hydrocarbon types, and development methods. It also categorizes the development of shale gas in China and the US into three stages and outlines four future challenges for the Chinese shale gas industry. The paper predicts that global shale gas production will reach 1.1 × 10^12 cubic meters by 2040, with China likely to remain the second-largest shale gas-producing region globally.

2. The development period from investment to gas well production is typically around 1.5 to 2 years. This period includes the time from the start of investment to the start of gas production.

3. The global shale gas output in 2016 was approximately 5068 × 10^8 cubic meters. This figure includes 4447 × 10^8 cubic meters from the US, 510 × 10^8 cubic meters from Canada, 78 × 10^8 cubic meters from China, and 18 × 10^8 cubic meters from Argentina.

1. 该论文总结了页岩气资源的五个基本特征，包括资源分布、储层空间、甜点区域、烃类类型和发展模式。它还根据中国和美国典型页岩气田的详细分析将页岩气的发展阶段分为三个阶段，并确定了中国页岩气发展的四个未来挑战。该论文预测，全球页岩气产量将在2040年达到1.1×10^12立方米，中国很可能在接下来的很长一段时间内成为仅次于北美地区的第二大页岩气生产地区。

2. 从投资到气井生产的开发周期通常在1.5到2年之间。这个时间段涵盖了从开始投资到开始产气的时间。

3. 2016年全球页岩气产出约为5068×10^8立方米。这一数字包括美国的4447×10^8立方米、加拿大的510×10^8立方米、中国的78×10^8立方米以及阿根廷的18×10^8立方米。
