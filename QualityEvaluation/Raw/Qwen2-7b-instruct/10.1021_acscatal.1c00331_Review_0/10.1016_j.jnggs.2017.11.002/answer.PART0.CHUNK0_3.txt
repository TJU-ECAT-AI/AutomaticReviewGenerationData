[1] "The development of shale gas in the United States has made a breakthrough, profoundly changed the pattern of oil and gas supply. It created the shale gas revolution on a global scale."
[2] "Shale gas reservoir is in continuous distribution, in case that a breakthrough is made at one point, the technology to make a breakthrough shall be generalized in the whole area, therefore, it is possible to build the shale gas reservoir into a big gas field in short period."

1. The breakthrough in the development of shale gas in the United States has significantly altered the global landscape of oil and gas supply, initiating a worldwide shale gas revolution.
2. A key characteristic of shale gas reservoirs is their continuous spatial distribution. When a breakthrough is achieved at one location, the successful techniques can be applied across the entire area, enabling the rapid formation of substantial gas fields.

The literature does not provide specific details about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production, coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, or strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration. Therefore, I am unable to provide answers to questions related to PDH, coke formation, and catalyst regeneration based on the given text.
