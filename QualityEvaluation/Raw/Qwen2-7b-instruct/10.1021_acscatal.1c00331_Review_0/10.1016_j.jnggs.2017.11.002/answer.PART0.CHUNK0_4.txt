<quotes>

[1] "Shale gas resources are primarily in mountain, desert and loess tableland, with longer construction period for well site; shale gas reservoir is under complex crustal stress, with difficulty in horizontal well completion and volume transformation, at present, the period for single horizontal well completion in 1500 m of horizontal section is from 60 d to 80 d."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

6. The majority of shale gas resources are found in mountainous areas, deserts, and loess plains, leading to a longer well construction period. The shale gas reservoir experiences complex tectonic stress, making horizontal well completion and volume transformation challenging. Currently, the time required for the completion of a single horizontal well with a 1500-meter-long section ranges from 60 to 80 days.
