[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil."
[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."
[4] "Our working hypothesis was that oxides of metals which usually have an unchangeable oxidation state but a high oxygen mobility can generate the required defects under PDH conditions."
[5] "Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3."
[6] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke."
[7] "Importantly, the rate of propene formation over YZrOx was very close to that over the most active Ru (0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalyst."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, primarily utilized in the chemical industry for manufacturing polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. Key considerations involve reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst performance. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, utilizing more selective catalysts, and enhancing catalyst design.

2. In the context of PDH, almost 90% of revenue comes from the sale of propene, with the remaining 10% from the sale of other products. This highlights the significant contribution of propene sales to overall revenue in the chemical industry.

1. 丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产方法，在化学工业中主要用于制造聚合物、溶剂、染料、树脂、纤维和药物。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成影响了工艺效率，降低了催化剂性能。缓解焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生策略包括优化反应条件、使用更选择性的催化剂以及增强催化剂设计。

2. 在PDH背景下，几乎90%的收入来自丙烯的销售，其余10%来自其他产品的销售。这强调了丙烯销售对总体收入的重大贡献。
