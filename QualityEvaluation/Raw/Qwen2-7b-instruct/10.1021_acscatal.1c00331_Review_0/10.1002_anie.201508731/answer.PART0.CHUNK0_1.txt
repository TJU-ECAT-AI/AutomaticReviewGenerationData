[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Comprehensive characterization supports the hypothesis that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Their concentration can be adjusted by varying the kind of ZrO2 promoter and/or supporting tiny amounts of hydrogenation-active metal."
[3] "Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3."
[4] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. The coke could be completely removed within only 5min by an air stream at the PDH temperature."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the C-H bonds in propane molecules to form propene. Key considerations involve reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Industrial applications aim to efficiently produce propene from propane, which is crucial for manufacturing polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. Catalyst types must be carefully chosen to balance cost, durability, and activity. The process faces challenges such as the toxicity of chromium compounds and the high cost of platinum. 

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by clogging the catalyst bed, reducing the surface area available for reactions, and decreasing the overall throughput. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using materials with lower reactivity towards coke deposition, optimizing operating conditions to minimize coke formation, implementing regenerative processes that allow for the removal of coke, and improving catalyst design to enhance resistance against coke buildup.

1. 烷烃非氧化脱氢化（PDH）方法通过破坏丙烷分子中的C-H键形成丙烯，从而实现丙烯生产。主要考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。工业应用旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，这对于制造聚合物、溶剂、染料、树脂、纤维和药物至关重要。必须仔细选择催化剂类型以平衡成本、耐用性和活性。该过程面临的挑战包括铬化合物的毒性以及铂的高成本。

2. 在基于Pt的催化剂上形成的焦炭会降低过程效率，因为它堵塞催化剂床，减少可用于反应的表面积，并降低总体吞吐量。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括使用对焦炭沉积反应性较低的材料、优化操作条件以减少焦炭形成、实施可去除焦炭的再生过程以及改进催化剂设计以增强抵抗焦炭积累的能力。
