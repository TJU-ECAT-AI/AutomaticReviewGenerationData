[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil2"
[3] "Propene formation over Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx and Cr(19.6wt%)K(0.9wt.%)/Al2O39 in each cycle between 550C and 625C. It is clear that Cu(0.05 wt%)/LaZrOx give a similar or even superior STY than the industrially relevant reference material and did not significantly change its performance from cycle to cycle."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by breaking the carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane molecules under specific conditions, allowing the formation of propene. Key considerations involve the selection of appropriate reaction conditions, the use of effective catalysts, and managing the formation of coke, a byproduct that can reduce catalyst efficiency. Coke formation impacts process efficiency by decreasing the surface area available for reactions, necessitating frequent regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with enhanced stability, incorporating regenerable components, and optimizing operational parameters.

2. The industrial application of PDH processes relies on efficient catalysts capable of maintaining performance over extended periods. Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalysts, in particular, show promising results in propene production, offering comparable or superior performance to industrially relevant Cr-based catalysts. These findings suggest potential for wider adoption in the chemical industry, especially considering the advantages of using materials like LaZrOx over traditional CrOx or Pt-based catalysts.

1.PDH方法通过在特定条件下断裂丙烷分子中的碳-氢键，从而生成丙烯。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、有效催化剂的使用以及管理焦炭的形成，焦炭的形成会降低催化剂的效率。焦炭的形成影响了过程的效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的表面面积，需要进行频繁的再生步骤。为减少焦炭的形成，可以采用稳定性增强的催化剂、集成可再生组件或优化操作参数。

2.PDH工艺的工业应用依赖于能够维持长期性能的高效催化剂。Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx催化剂在丙烯生产中表现出良好的前景，提供与工业上相关的Cr基催化剂相当甚至更优的性能。这些发现表明，对于化学工业，可能广泛采用LaZrOx等材料制成的催化剂，而不仅仅是传统的CrOx或Pt基催化剂。
