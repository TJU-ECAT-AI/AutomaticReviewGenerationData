[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil2"
[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."
[4] "Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3."
[5] "Catalytic tests were performed in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed reactors. The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890)."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxygen. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, choosing suitable catalyst types, and managing the process to minimize unwanted byproducts. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring costly regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using alternative catalysts with less tendency to produce coke or implementing more efficient regeneration processes.

2. Industrial applications of PDH often involve large-scale plants that rely on catalysts for propene production. Challenges include dealing with toxic compounds, high costs associated with precious metals like platinum, and maintaining catalyst durability over time. Innovations focus on developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalysts, such as those based on bulk metal oxides with lattice defects that act as active sites for PDH reactions.

1. 炔烃直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯而不使用氧气来实现。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件，如温度和压力，选择合适的催化剂类型，并管理过程以最小化副产品的生成。在铂基催化剂上形成的焦炭可以影响过程效率，因为它会降低催化剂活性并需要昂贵的再生步骤。缓解焦炭生成的策略包括使用更不易生成焦炭的催化剂或实施更高效的再生过程。

2. PDH在工业应用中通常涉及依赖催化剂进行丙烯生产的大型工厂。面临的挑战包括处理有毒化合物、与铂等贵金属相关联的高昂成本以及保持催化剂持久性的时间问题。创新集中在开发更可持续和成本效益更高的催化剂上，这些催化剂基于具有表面缺陷的块状金属氧化物，这些缺陷作为PDH反应中的活性位点。
