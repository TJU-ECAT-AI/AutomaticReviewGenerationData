          The PDH process is essential for converting propane into propene, involving the breaking of C-H bonds to produce propene and hydrogen. Key factors in PDH are reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Noble metals like Pt, CrOx, GaOx, and In2O3 are typical catalysts. Pt catalysts are active and selective but lose effectiveness due to coke buildup. Coke formation affects efficiency; mitigation strategies include using low-acidity supports, adding promoters, and adjusting conditions. Catalyst regeneration under oxidizing atmospheres aids in coke removal and activity restoration, requiring careful management to avoid permanent deactivation.

          In the 1960s, a novel technology emerged for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins used in biodegradable detergents. Factors such as high energy demands, low olefin selectivity, diminishing oil reserves, and rising oil prices are prompting the petrochemical industry to seek more cost-effective raw materials and efficient conversion methods. Hydraulic fracturing technologies have advanced to enable the extraction of large volumes of shale gas at reasonable costs. The increased availability of natural gas has led to a significant decrease in gas prices, making shale gas an attractive energy source and raw material for producing transportation fuels or chemicals. Shale gas deposits contain substantial amounts of natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas. The US has become a low-cost chemical producer due to the growth in shale gas production, with investments totaling $84 billion by September 2013. Propane dehydrogenation profits from the price gap between propane and propylene. Further expansion of US shale gas production is anticipated due to the focus on energy independence. A new technology for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents was developed in the 1960s. It was observed that step sites are more reactive, with a lower energy barrier for propylene formation (2434 kJ/mol) compared to the flat surface (6372 kJ/mol). The turnover frequency (TOF) cannot be calculated due to missing Pt dispersion values in most references in Table 3. Dehydrogenation is a one-step process converting light paraffins into corresponding olefins and hydrogen. Side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites, enabling high olefin yields with precise catalyst design. Membrane permeability can withdraw hydrogen, favoring higher olefin yields, but is more applicable to dehydrogenating isobutene. Propane dehydrogenation profitability is largely influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene. Coke deposition requires frequent catalyst regeneration through combustion. High temperatures during regeneration and dehydrogenation lead to platinum nanoparticle aggregation, causing catalyst deactivation. Promoters can modify platinum properties and inhibit side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Adding CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances chromium dehydrogenation catalyst activity.

          Despite the superior performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, concerns such as catalyst poisoning, high Pt cost, and environmental issues related to Cr usage have led to the exploration of alternatives. Vanadium oxides are active for numerous hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the species formed, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominating at higher loadings. When coke is removed via catalyst calcination, further deactivation occurs as vanadium oxide species coalesce, forming larger V2O5 crystals or mixed oxides like AlVO4, which are less active. Alumina is typically used as a vanadium oxide catalyst support, but Sokolov et al. found that doping alumina with silica enhances catalyst stability and activity. Molybdenum oxides are also utilized as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. Molybdenum oxide chemistry mirrors that of vanadium oxide, with Mo appearing as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, contingent on molybdenum loading, support type, and catalyst preparation conditions. Catalysts rapidly deactivate due to coke formation, typically offering low conversion and selectivity. Consistent with MoOxCy's role in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. demonstrated that MoO3 deposited on SiC exhibits significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains debatable. Testing silica-supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, for isobutane dehydrogenation revealed superior performance compared to their respective oxides. Indium shares many catalytic properties with gallium, notably in NOx reduction. Halasz et al. found that both Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts are active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly employed to explain catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. While metal oxide catalysts can achieve comparable yields to Pt-based formulations, Pt catalysts can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts. Dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases ensures the catalyst remains in its most active state. UVvis spectroscopy allows for measurement of the relative amounts of active chromia and irreversibly deactivated chromium due to migration into the support, providing insight into when catalyst replacement is necessary.

          尽管铂（Pt）和CrOx催化剂在烷烃裂解中的表现优秀，但催化剂中毒、铂成本高以及Cr使用带来的环境问题促进了替代品的探索。钒氧化物对许多烃类氧化反应具有活性，包括脱氢。表面面积与金属负载比决定了物种的形成。吴等人报告指出，低于1.2 V/nm2时以单体为主，1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间以聚合物钒物种为主，更高负载时以结晶V2O5物种为主。当通过催化剂煅烧去除焦炭时，催化剂可能进一步失活，因为钒氧化物聚集形成更大V2O5晶体或如AlVO4之类的混合氧化物，这些都活性较低。通常使用铝氧化物作为钒氧化物催化剂的支撑，但Sokolov等人发现，通过将二氧化硅掺入铝氧化物支撑，可以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。钼氧化物也经常用作烃转化反应的催化剂，包括脱氢。钼氧化物的化学性质类似于钒氧化物，钼可以以MoOx单体、聚合物或MoO3结晶体的形式存在，这取决于钼的负载、所使用的支撑类型以及催化剂制备条件。催化剂迅速因焦炭形成而失效，通常提供较低的转化率和选择性。与钼OxCy在丁烷脱氢中的作用一致，Harlin等人展示了在氢气和蒸汽存在的条件下，SiC上沉积的MoO3显示出显著的催化性能。Ga基脱氢催化剂的活性位点的确切性质仍在争议中。测试了硅酸盐支持的金属硫化物，如ZnS、FeS、CuS、CoS、MnS、NiS和MoS，用于异丁烷脱氢，发现其性能明显优于各自的氧化物。与Ga共享许多催化性质的In，在NOx减少方面显示出两种金属的活性。Halasz等人发现，Ga-和In负载的ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中均表现出活性，并且具有相似的活性和选择性值。1934年提出的HoriutiPolanyi机制通常被用来解释催化脱氢反应。虽然金属氧化物催化剂可以达到与基于Pt的配方相当的产率，但后者可以在更高的空间速度下运行，并表现出比金属氧化物催化剂更低的失活率。动态调整脱氢和再生阶段可以确保催化剂保持在其最活跃的状态。通过紫外可见光谱可以测量活性氧化铬和由于迁移进入支撑而不可逆失活的铬的相对量，这一技术提供了确定催化剂更换时间的手段。

          The PDH reaction mechanism involves either the dissociative adsorption of alkane or the second CH bond cleavage, acting as the rate-determining step. Coke, defined as a collective term for highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules, tends to accumulate on the catalyst surface during the reaction, effectively obstructing reactant diffusion to the surface through pore and active site blockage. This leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. For both industrially used Pt and CrOx catalyst formulations, the removal of coke from spent catalyst surfaces might cause irreversible catalyst deactivation if regeneration conditions are not meticulously controlled.

          Despite the outstanding performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, concerns such as catalyst poisoning, high Pt cost, and environmental issues linked to Cr usage have prompted the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are active for numerous hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the species formed, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species taking precedence between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominating at higher loadings. Upon coke removal via catalyst calcination, further deactivation occurs as vanadium oxide species consolidate, forming larger V2O5 crystals or mixed oxides like AlVO4, both less active. Alumina is typically used as a vanadium oxide catalyst support, yet Sokolov et al. found that incorporating silica into the alumina support enhances catalyst stability and activity across a broad range of Si- and Al-based supports. Molybdenum oxides are also commonly employed in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. Molybdenum oxide chemistry parallels that of vanadium oxide, with Mo existing as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, contingent on molybdenum loading, support type, and catalyst preparation conditions. Catalysts rapidly deactivate due to coke formation, usually offering low conversion and selectivity. Consistent with MoOxCy's role in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. demonstrated that MoO3 deposited on SiC exhibits significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains uncertain. Testing silica-supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, for isobutane dehydrogenation revealed superior performance compared to their respective oxides. Indium shares many catalytic properties with gallium, notably in NOx reduction. Halasz et al. found that both Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts are active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, introduced in 1934, is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. While metal oxide catalysts can achieve comparable yields to Pt-based formulations, Pt catalysts can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts. Dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases ensures the catalyst remains in its most active state. Through UVvis spectroscopy, the relative amounts of active chromia and irreversibly deactivated chromium due to migration into the support can be quantified, providing insight into when catalyst replacement is necessary.

          尽管铂（Pt）和CrOx催化剂在烷烃裂解中的表现卓越，但催化剂中毒、铂成本高以及Cr使用带来的环境问题促使寻找替代品。钒氧化物对许多烃类氧化反应具有活性，包括脱氢。表面面积与金属负载比决定了物种的形成，单体物种在低于1.2 V/nm2时占主导地位，聚合物钒物种在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间占优势，更高负载时以结晶V2O5物种为主导。通过催化剂煅烧去除焦炭后，进一步的失活发生，因为钒氧化物聚集形成更大的V2O5晶体或如AlVO4之类的混合氧化物，这两种都活性较低。通常使用铝氧化物作为钒氧化物催化剂的支撑，但Sokolov等人发现，通过将二氧化硅掺入铝氧化物支撑，可以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性，适用于广泛的Si-和Al基支撑。钼氧化物也经常用于烃转化反应，包括脱氢。钼氧化物的化学性质类似于钒氧化物，钼可以以MoOx单体、聚合物或MoO3结晶体的形式存在，这取决于钼的负载、所使用的支撑类型以及催化剂制备条件。催化剂迅速因焦炭形成而失效，通常提供较低的转化率和选择性。与钼OxCy在丁烷脱氢中的作用一致，Harlin等人展示了在氢气和蒸汽存在的条件下，SiC上沉积的MoO3显示出显著的催化性能。Ga基脱氢催化剂的活性位点的确切性质仍在争议中。测试了硅酸盐支持的金属硫化物，如ZnS、FeS、CuS、CoS、MnS、NiS和MoS，用于异丁烷脱氢，发现其性能明显优于各自的氧化物。与Ga共享许多催化性质的In，在NOx减少方面显示出两种金属的活性。Halasz等人发现，Ga-和In负载的ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中均表现出活性，并且具有相似的活性和选择性值。1934年提出的HoriutiPolanyi机制通常被用来解释催化脱氢反应。虽然金属氧化物催化剂可以达到与基于Pt的配方相当的产率，但后者可以在更高的空间速度下运行，并表现出比金属氧化物催化剂更低的失活率。动态调整脱氢和再生阶段可以确保催化剂保持在其最活跃的状态。通过紫外可见光谱可以量化活性氧化铬和由于迁移进入支撑而不可逆失活的铬的相对量，这一技术提供了确定更换催化剂时间的手段。

          [2] "Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10-40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."

          [4] "However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time."
          [5] "This has been attributed to the fact that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."

          In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, UOP utilized catalysts consisting of chromium oxide supported on alumina to industrially dehydrogenate butane into butene, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuels. Using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), experiments depicted in Figure 17 indicated that the catalyst's weight rose during the initial stages (10-40 minutes) of the reaction, with no additional carbon deposition after this period. It is believed that the similar ionic radii and charges of Al3+ and Cr3+ aid in the diffusion and subsequent integration of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, generating an inactive chromia-alumina spinel for the dehydrogenation reaction. Beyond this point, conversion continued to decline, suggesting that the initially deposited carbon becomes increasingly detrimental to catalytic activity over time. This behavior has been linked to the observation that when the space velocity (GHSV) was reduced from 3600 to 600 hours−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, whereas ethylene selectivity decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%.
