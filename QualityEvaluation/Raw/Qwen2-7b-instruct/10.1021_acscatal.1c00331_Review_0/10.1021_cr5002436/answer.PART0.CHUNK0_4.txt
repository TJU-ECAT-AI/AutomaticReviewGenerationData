[1] "As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe."
[2] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[3] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[4] "Part of the heat required for the reaction is introduced to the reactors by preheating the reaction feed, additional heat being provided by adjacent reactors that are regenerating the coked catalysts."
[5] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."

1. As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene were being produced globally by 14 propane dehydrogenation plants. The global demand for propylene was 103 million tons that year, expecting a 45% annual increase. 

2. Due to planned or ongoing constructions, by 2018, there would be an additional 14 million tons of propylene produced annually, primarily in China and the US, using Catofin or Oleflex technologies.

3. Heat for the reaction is provided by preheating the feed and the heat generated by regenerating reactors. 

4. The catalyst has a lifespan of 23 years, with its activity gradually declining over time. This decline is countered by incrementally raising the temperature to maintain a consistent level of dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst's life.

1. 截至2012年4月，全球有14家丙烷脱氢装置生产了500万吨丙烯。当年全球丙烯需求量为1.03亿吨，预计每年增长45%。

2. 鉴于计划中的或正在建设的设施，到2018年，将额外增加1400万吨每年的丙烯产量，主要在中国和美国，使用Catofin或Oleflex技术。

3. 反应所需的热量通过预热反应物提供，并由再生反应器产生的热量补充。

4. 催化剂的使用寿命为23年，随着运行时间的增加，其活性逐渐下降。为了保持催化剂在整个生命周期内的恒定活性，通过逐步提高温度来抵消这一下降。
