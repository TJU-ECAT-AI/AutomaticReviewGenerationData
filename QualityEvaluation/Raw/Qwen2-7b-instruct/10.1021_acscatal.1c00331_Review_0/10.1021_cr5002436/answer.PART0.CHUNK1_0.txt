[1] "The process of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a crucial method for producing propene from propane. It functions by breaking the C-H bonds in propane, yielding propene and hydrogen as products."
[2] "Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Reaction conditions involve temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition."
[3] "Catalysts play a critical role in the efficiency of the PDH process. Common catalysts include noble metals like platinum (Pt), chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium oxide (GaOx), and indium oxide (In2O3)."
[4] "Pt-based catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity, but they can deactivate quickly due to coke formation. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface blocks active sites and hinders reactant access."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using supports with low Brnsted acidity, adding promoters, and controlling reaction conditions."
[6] "Regeneration of catalysts under oxidative atmospheres can help remove coke and restore catalyst activity. However, careful control of regeneration conditions is crucial to prevent irreversible catalyst deactivation."

PDH functions by breaking the C-H bonds in propane to produce propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Catalysts like Pt, CrOx, GaOx, and In2O3 are common. Coke formation on Pt catalysts impacts efficiency, requiring strategies like low-acidity supports, promoters, and controlled conditions. Regeneration helps restore activity but must be managed carefully to avoid deactivation.

PDH通过断裂丙烷中的C-H键产生丙烯和氢气。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。常用的催化剂有Pt、CrOx、GaOx和In2O3。Pt催化剂上的焦炭沉积影响效率，需要策略如低酸性支撑、促进剂和控制条件来减少。再生有助于恢复活性，但需要仔细管理以避免失活。
