[1] "The reaction function of PDH is a mechanism where either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step."
[2] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[3] "Coke deposition effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[4] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through a mechanism where either the dissociative adsorption of propane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate reaction conditions, employing suitable catalyst types, and optimizing industrial applications.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by blocking pores and active sites, hindering reactant diffusion and causing a drop in catalytic activity. 

3. Coke deposition leads to irreversible catalyst deactivation if not properly managed during regeneration, necessitating careful control of regeneration conditions.

1.PDH作为丙烷转化为丙烯的方法，其反应机制涉及丙烷的离解吸附或第二个C-H键断裂作为速率决定步骤。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、采用适当的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭沉积阻碍了反应物向催化剂表面的扩散，通过堵塞孔隙和活性位点，导致催化活性下降。

3. 如果不妥善管理再生过程中的条件，从失效催化剂上清除焦炭可能导致不可逆的催化剂失活，因此需要仔细控制再生条件。
