[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[2] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[3] "A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst."
[5] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[6] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[7] "When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation)."
[8] "For the dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt-based catalyst, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s−1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."
