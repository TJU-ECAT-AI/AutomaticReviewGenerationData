[1] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts comprising chromium oxide supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[2] "Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10-40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[3] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromia-alumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time."
[5] "This has been attributed to the fact that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."

1. Industrially, UOP used chromium oxide supported on alumina catalysts to dehydrogenate butane into butene for the production of high-octane aviation fuels.
2. The weight of the catalyst increased during the initial stages of the reaction, indicating coke deposition, but no additional carbon was deposited after 10-40 minutes.
3. The incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina leads to the formation of an inactive spinel compound due to the similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+.
4. The deposited carbon becomes increasingly detrimental to the catalytic activity over time.
5. Lowering the space velocity (GHSV) from 3600 to 600 h−1 increased ethane conversion from 27.6% to 31.4%, but decreased the selectivity towards ethylene from 91.7% to 64.9%.

1. UOP工业上使用了铝酸盐上负载的铬氧化物催化剂来脱氢丁烷生成丁烯，用于生产高辛烷值航空燃料。
2. 反应的初始阶段（10-40分钟），催化剂的重量增加，表明了焦炭沉积，但在此之后没有额外的碳沉积。
3. 铝离子和三价铬离子的相似半径和电荷使得三价铬离子能够扩散并随后被整合到铝氧八面体位点中，形成一种不活性的铝酸铬晶相。
4. 原始沉积的碳随着时间的推移变得对催化活性更加有害。
5. 将空间速度（GHSV）从3600降低到600 h−1，乙烷转化率从27.6%增加到31.4%，而乙烯选择性从91.7%降低到64.9%。
