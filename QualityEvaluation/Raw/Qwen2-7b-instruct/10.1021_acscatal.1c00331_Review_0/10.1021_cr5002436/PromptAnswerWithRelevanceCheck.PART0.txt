[1] "The process of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a crucial method for producing propene from propane. It functions by breaking the C-H bonds in propane, yielding propene and hydrogen as products."
[2] "Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Reaction conditions involve temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition."
[3] "Catalysts play a critical role in the efficiency of the PDH process. Common catalysts include noble metals like platinum (Pt), chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium oxide (GaOx), and indium oxide (In2O3)."
[4] "Pt-based catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity, but they can deactivate quickly due to coke formation. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface blocks active sites and hinders reactant access."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using supports with low Brnsted acidity, adding promoters, and controlling reaction conditions."
[6] "Regeneration of catalysts under oxidative atmospheres can help remove coke and restore catalyst activity. However, careful control of regeneration conditions is crucial to prevent irreversible catalyst deactivation."

[1] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred."
[3] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[4] "The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Dehydrogenation for propene production through propane (PDH) functions by converting propane into propene, often in a catalytic process. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts, necessitating frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve adjusting reaction conditions, utilizing specific catalyst promoters, and enhancing catalyst design to resist sintering and maintain active sites.

[1] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts comprising chromium oxide supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[2] "Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10-40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[3] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromia-alumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time."
[5] "This has been attributed to the fact that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."

1. Industrially, UOP used chromium oxide supported on alumina catalysts to dehydrogenate butane into butene for the production of high-octane aviation fuels.
2. The weight of the catalyst increased during the initial stages of the reaction, indicating coke deposition, but no additional carbon was deposited after 10-40 minutes.
3. The incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina leads to the formation of an inactive spinel compound due to the similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+.
4. The deposited carbon becomes increasingly detrimental to the catalytic activity over time.
5. Lowering the space velocity (GHSV) from 3600 to 600 h−1 increased ethane conversion from 27.6% to 31.4%, but decreased the selectivity towards ethylene from 91.7% to 64.9%.

[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[2] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[3] "A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst."
[5] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[6] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[7] "When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation)."
[8] "For the dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt-based catalyst, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s−1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."

[1] "As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe."
[2] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[3] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[4] "Part of the heat required for the reaction is introduced to the reactors by preheating the reaction feed, additional heat being provided by adjacent reactors that are regenerating the coked catalysts."
[5] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."

1. As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene were being produced globally by 14 propane dehydrogenation plants. The global demand for propylene was 103 million tons that year, expecting a 45% annual increase. 

2. Due to planned or ongoing constructions, by 2018, there would be an additional 14 million tons of propylene produced annually, primarily in China and the US, using Catofin or Oleflex technologies.

3. Heat for the reaction is provided by preheating the feed and the heat generated by regenerating reactors. 

4. The catalyst has a lifespan of 23 years, with its activity gradually declining over time. This decline is countered by incrementally raising the temperature to maintain a consistent level of dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst's life.
