[1] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred."
[3] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[4] "The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction."

Dehydrogenation for propene production through propane (PDH) functions by converting propane into propene, often in a catalytic process. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts, necessitating frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation involve adjusting reaction conditions, utilizing specific catalyst promoters, and enhancing catalyst design to resist sintering and maintain active sites.

丙烷（PDH）用于生产生物可降解洗涤剂长链线性烯烃的新技术在20世纪60年代得到发展。考虑的关键因素包括选择合适的反应条件、催化剂类型以及管理工业应用。铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响了工艺效率，导致催化剂活性下降，需要频繁再生。为了减少焦炭形成并保持活性位点，可以采取调整反应条件、使用特定催化剂促进剂和增强催化剂设计等策略。
