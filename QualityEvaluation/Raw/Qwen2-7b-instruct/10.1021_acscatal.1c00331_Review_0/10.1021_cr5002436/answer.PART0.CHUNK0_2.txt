[1] "Due to the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[5] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[6] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[9] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[10] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

1. The petrochemical industry is seeking more efficient conversion technologies due to high energy demands, low olefin selectivity, diminishing petroleum reserves, and escalating oil prices.
2. Hydraulic fracturing has enabled the extraction of substantial volumes of shale gas at competitive costs.
3. The substantial decline in natural gas prices, reaching about 75% below 2005 levels, has made shale gas a cost-effective energy and feedstock source.
4. The US now derives approximately 25% of its natural gas production from shale gas, with expectations of a further increase in the coming years as energy independence is prioritized.
5. Shale gas deposits consist of significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas.
6. The surge in shale gas production has transformed the US into the world's lowest-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as evidenced by a total of $84 billion worth of 126 investment projects made up to September 2013.
7. The abundance of cheap ethane, derived from shale gas, has led to a shift from naphtha-based to ethane-based steam cracking in the US, with ethane crackers becoming prevalent and naphtha crackers being decommissioned or converted.
8. Steam cracking of ethane yields minimal olefins apart from ethylene, which has diminished propylene supply and escalated its price, paving the way for on-purpose catalytic technologies like propane dehydrogenation.
9. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is heavily influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making current market conditions particularly advantageous.
10. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no comprehensive comparison of a broad spectrum of dehydrogenation catalysts has been attempted in a single review article, though other recent reviews have addressed the dehydrogenation of light paraffins.

1. 化学工业正在寻求更高效的转化技术，原因是能源需求高、特定烯烃的选择性低、石油储备减少以及油价上涨。
2. 水力压裂技术使得大量页岩气以成本效益的方式得以开采。
3. 天然气价格大幅下降，与2005年的水平相比大约降低了75%，这使得页岩气成为经济有效的能源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料来源。
4. 美国现在从页岩气中获得约25%的天然气产量，预计在未来几年随着能源独立性的优先考虑，这一比例将进一步增加。
5. 页岩气藏包含大量的天然气体液体（NGL），包括乙烷和丙烷，这些可以很容易地从天然气中分离出来。
6. 页岩气产量的激增使美国成为全球除中东之外的最低成本化学生产商，截至2013年9月，总计有126个价值840亿美元的投资项目。
7. 由于从页岩气中获得的廉价乙烷，美国已经从基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解转向基于乙烷的蒸汽裂解，乙烷裂解工厂正在建设中，而石脑油裂解工厂则被拆卸或转换。
8. 乙烷蒸汽裂解产生的烯烃除乙烯外很少，这导致丙烯供应减少和价格上涨，为轻烷烃的催化脱氢提供了机会。
9. 丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，当前市场条件非常有利。
10. 到目前为止，没有尝试在一个单一的综述文章中对如此广泛的脱氢催化剂进行全面比较，尽管最近的综述文章已经讨论了轻烷烃的脱氢。
