1. Shale gas exploration and development has significantly advanced global oil and gas industry's theoretical and technological innovation. Chinese researchers have proposed two-element enrichment rule and enrichment models for marine shale gas in structurally complex regions.

2. The No. to No. thin layers of the sweet spot intervals generally have an organic carbon content exceeding 4%, with local exceptions below 2%, averaging over 3%.

3. The high-quality shale layers in the sweet spot intervals typically feature high organic carbon content, with organic matter predominantly composed of algae and acritarchs, having hydrogen-rich lipid structures indicative of high hydrocarbon potential and good gas-bearing capacity.

4. In structurally complex areas, the preservation condition plays a pivotal role in geological evaluation of shale gas, influencing the pressure coefficient as a comprehensive indicator of its preservation status.

5. The Jiaoshiba area showcases a NE-trending box anticline with a northwest-trending Wujiang fault zone in its southwest. This fault zone is a thrust belt formed through multi-stage compression and thrusting, with Silurian strata as the detachment layer. It comprises faults of varying hierarchy extending to the surface.

6. Approximately 67% of China's favorable shale gas areas are situated in mountainous regions with fragile ecosystems, posing stringent environmental protection demands. Additionally, the absence of natural gas networks exacerbates the challenges for profitable shale gas development.

1. 不同常规油气产业，页岩气的勘探与开发在理论和技术创新上取得了巨大进步。中国研究人员提出了复杂结构区域页岩气的双元素富集规则和结构型甜点及连续型甜点的富集模型。

2. 第至第薄层一般具有超过4%的有机碳含量，局部低于2%，平均超过3%。

3. 甜点层中的高质量页岩层通常具有高有机碳含量，有机物质主要由藻类和异核体构成，具有富含氢的脂质结构，表明了高烃潜力和良好的气体承载能力。

4. 在地质结构复杂的地区，保存条件是评价页岩气的关键参数，压力系数作为判断其保存状况的综合指标。

5. 峨眉山区块是一个NE向的箱形构造，西南部发育有NW向的巫江断裂带，这是一个在三叠系地层为脱层层的多阶段压缩和推覆形成的推覆带，包含不同等级的断层延伸到表面。

6. 大约67%的中国有利页岩气区域位于脆弱生态的山区，对环境保护要求极高。此外，缺乏天然气网络也加剧了页岩气开发的盈利挑战。
