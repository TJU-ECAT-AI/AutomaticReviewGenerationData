[6] "In the development of shale gas, we have come up with the integrated evaluation idea of evaluating geological sweet spot, engi- neering sweet spot, and economic sweet spot at the same time."
[7] "The Wufeng FormationLongmaxi Formation in the Sichuan Basin has Ro values between 1.5% and 3.5%, with an average of 2.5%."
[8] "In the Jiaoshiba area, the lower member of the WufengLongmaxi Formation can be divided into - nine thin layers, and the nine thin layers are grouped into two gas-bearing intervals, the lower interval composed of - and the upper interval composed of - ."
[9] "In the Jiaoshiba area, the lower gas bearing interval has an average content of organic carbon of about 3.39%, average porosity of 4.31% to 7.8%, mostly organic pores (accounting for more than 50% of the total pores)."
[10] "In the Jiaoshiba area, the lower gas bearing layers in Well Dingye 1 has an average TOC of 3.4%, similar to that in Jiaoshiba area; average porosity of 3.03%, lower than that of Jiaoshiba area, and the pores are dominated by inorganic pores, and the organic pores account for 1040% of the total pore volume, which is much lower than that of the Jiaoshiba area (50%)."
[11] "For shale reservoirs with the same TOC, the development degree of organic pores is positively correlated with the single well production."
[12] "Pressure coefficient is also a comprehensive indicator to judge the preservation conditions."
[13] "The Jiaoshiba block is a NE trending box anticline, there develops a northwest trending Wujiang fault zone in the southwest of the anticline, which is a thrust belt formed under multiple-stage compression and thrusting with the Silurian strata as the detachment layer, with a damages zones composed of faults of various hierarchies extending to the surface."
[14] "The effect of tectonics on shale gas enrichment and high production can be two-sided. On one hand, it can improve the storage capacity of shale. On the other hand, tectonics can damage the sealing capacity of shale and the shale gas can dissipate."

Diffusion occurs in pores smaller than 1 nanometer under low pressure."
