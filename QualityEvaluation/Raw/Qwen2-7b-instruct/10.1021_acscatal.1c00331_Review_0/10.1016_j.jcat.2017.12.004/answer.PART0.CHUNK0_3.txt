[1] "Lower olefins are essential petrochemical intermediates, especially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the production of a variety of chemicals."
[2] "Propene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [14]."
[3] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]."
[4] "Over high gelation temperature (75 C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts."
[5] "Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxidizing it further. Key considerations for this process include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing the right catalyst type, and optimizing the industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing the catalyst's ability to convert propane. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve using alternative catalysts, adjusting operating conditions, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

2. The study focuses on VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reactions, showing that the catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the gelation and calcination temperatures. High gelation temperatures lead to decreased integrity and catalytic activity. The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, prepared with a gelation temperature of 60°C and a calcination temperature of 580°C, exhibits superior PDH performance compared to catalysts with lower gelation temperatures or higher calcination temperatures. The catalyst maintains high propane conversion and propene selectivity even after eight reaction-regeneration cycles.

1.PDH过程通过将丙烷转化为丙烯而不进一步氧化来实现丙烯的生产。在该过程中需要考虑的关键因素包括选择合适的反应条件、选择正确的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为它会导致催化剂活性下降并减少其转化丙烷的能力。为了减轻焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生性，可以采用替代催化剂、调整操作条件或实施先进的再生技术等策略。

2.研究重点是用于PDH反应的VOX-SiO2催化剂，结果显示，催化剂的催化性能受到凝胶化和煅烧温度的影响。高温凝胶化会导致材料的完整性和催化活性下降。凝胶化温度为60°C、煅烧温度为580°C的60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂表现出优于低温凝胶化或高温煅烧催化剂的PDH性能。即使经过八次反应-再生周期，催化剂仍能保持高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
