[1] "Lower olefins are essential petrochemical intermediates, especially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the production of a variety of chemicals."
[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used."
[3] "Catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used."
[4] "The structural and performance results for the catalysts reveal that gelation temperature has only a slight effect on the surface acidity, textural properties and VOX species dispersion of VOX-SiO2 catalysts within a reasonable temperature range (3060 C)."
[5] "Over high gelation temperature (75 C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts."
[6] "Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts exhibit better catalytic activity and stability."
[7] "Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."
[8] "This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species."
[9] "Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a series of chemical reactions, typically facilitated by catalysts. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing effective catalyst types, and ensuring efficient catalyst regeneration to maintain process efficiency. Industrial applications of PDH often involve the use of precious metal catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr).

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by causing deactivation, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include adjusting reaction conditions, employing advanced catalyst formulations, and implementing periodic regeneration protocols.

1.PDH方法通过一系列化学反应将丙烷分子转化为丙烯，从而实现丙烯的生产。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、有效催化剂类型以及确保催化剂再生以维持过程效率。工业应用中的PDH经常使用铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）等贵金属催化剂。

2. 在Pt基催化剂上形成的焦炭可以显著影响过程效率，导致催化活性下降。为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采用调整反应条件、采用先进的催化剂配方以及实施定期再生程序等策略。
