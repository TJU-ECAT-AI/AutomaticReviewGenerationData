[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used."
[2] "Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene."
[3] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH."
[4] "Over high gelation temperature (75 C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts."
[5] "Catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used."

1. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercially applied method for producing propene, typically utilizing Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. While the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium constraints and reducing carbon deposition, it inevitably produces by-products due to the deep oxidation of propene.

2. At a reaction temperature of 580°C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst displays remarkable long-term catalytic stability during eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH.

3. High gelation temperatures lead to the degradation of the catalyst's integrity and reduce its catalytic activity.

4. The choice of support material significantly impacts catalyst performance. Different supports like SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 have been found to affect catalyst efficiency differently.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene under specific conditions, primarily through heat and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. Different catalyst types, such as Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, are commonly used in PDH reactions for propene production. Industrial applications often involve the integration of PDH processes with other chemical production lines to maximize efficiency and yield.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reaction, leading to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy consumption for regenerating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration may include operating the reactor at lower temperatures, using a more active catalyst, or incorporating a regeneration step that effectively removes the coke without causing significant damage to the catalyst.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxidizing it further. Key considerations for this process include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing the right catalyst type, and optimizing the industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing the catalyst's ability to convert propane. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve using alternative catalysts, adjusting operating conditions, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

2. The study focuses on VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reactions, showing that the catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the gelation and calcination temperatures. High gelation temperatures lead to decreased integrity and catalytic activity. The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, prepared with a gelation temperature of 60°C and a calcination temperature of 580°C, exhibits superior PDH performance compared to catalysts with lower gelation temperatures or higher calcination temperatures. The catalyst maintains high propane conversion and propene selectivity even after eight reaction-regeneration cycles.

1.PDH过程通过将丙烷转化为丙烯而不进一步氧化来实现丙烯的生产。在该过程中需要考虑的关键因素包括选择合适的反应条件、选择正确的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为它会导致催化剂活性下降并减少其转化丙烷的能力。为了减轻焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生性，可以采用替代催化剂、调整操作条件或实施先进的再生技术等策略。

2.研究重点是用于PDH反应的VOX-SiO2催化剂，结果显示，催化剂的催化性能受到凝胶化和煅烧温度的影响。高温凝胶化会导致材料的完整性和催化活性下降。凝胶化温度为60°C、煅烧温度为580°C的60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂表现出优于低温凝胶化或高温煅烧催化剂的PDH性能。即使经过八次反应-再生周期，催化剂仍能保持高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, primarily by converting propane into propene through a non-oxidative process. Key considerations include the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. High reaction temperatures and specific catalyst compositions are crucial for efficient PDH. For instance, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, with a gelation temperature of 60°C, exhibits superior catalytic performance for PDH. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts demonstrate better catalytic activity and stability compared to VOX-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Moreover, at a reaction temperature of 580°C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst maintains remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. It shows a slow decrease in propane conversion from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, while maintaining a high propene selectivity at approximately 91%.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst, reducing its activity, and leading to decreased productivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include optimizing operating conditions, using alternative catalyst materials, or implementing advanced regeneration techniques. For example, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst demonstrates improved long-term stability, suggesting it could be a viable alternative for reducing coke formation and improving catalyst regeneration in PDH processes.
