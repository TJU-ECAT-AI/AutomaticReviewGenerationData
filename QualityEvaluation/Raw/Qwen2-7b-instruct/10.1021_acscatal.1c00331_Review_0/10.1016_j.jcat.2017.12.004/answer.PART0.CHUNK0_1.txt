1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene under specific conditions, primarily through heat and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. Different catalyst types, such as Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, are commonly used in PDH reactions for propene production. Industrial applications often involve the integration of PDH processes with other chemical production lines to maximize efficiency and yield.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reaction, leading to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy consumption for regenerating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration may include operating the reactor at lower temperatures, using a more active catalyst, or incorporating a regeneration step that effectively removes the coke without causing significant damage to the catalyst.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在特定条件下将丙烷分子转化为丙烯，主要通过热能和合适的催化剂。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和催化剂的性质。Pt-和Cr基催化剂是PDH反应中用于丙烯生产的常见催化剂类型。工业应用通常涉及将PDH过程与化学生产线集成，以最大化效率和产率。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，通过减少可用于反应的表面面积，导致催化活性下降和催化剂再生过程中能耗增加。减轻焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的策略可能包括在较低温度下操作反应器、使用更活跃的催化剂或引入有效去除焦炭而不对催化剂造成重大损害的再生步骤。
