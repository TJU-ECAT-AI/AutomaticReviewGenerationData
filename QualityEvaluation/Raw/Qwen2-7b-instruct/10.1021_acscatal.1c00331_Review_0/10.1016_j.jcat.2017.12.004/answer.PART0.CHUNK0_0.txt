[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used."
[2] "Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene."

1. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercially applied method for producing propene, typically utilizing Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. While the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium constraints and reducing carbon deposition, it inevitably produces by-products due to the deep oxidation of propene.

2. At a reaction temperature of 580°C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst displays remarkable long-term catalytic stability during eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH.

3. High gelation temperatures lead to the degradation of the catalyst's integrity and reduce its catalytic activity.

4. The choice of support material significantly impacts catalyst performance. Different supports like SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 have been found to affect catalyst efficiency differently.

1. 非氧化脱氢反应（PDH）是商业应用中生产丙烯的方法，通常使用铂和铬基催化剂。尽管氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）具有避免热力学平衡限制和减少碳沉积等优点，但由于丙烯的深度氧化，该过程不可避免地会产生副产品。

2. 在580°C的反应温度下，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂在PDH的八次反应再生周期中显示出显著的长期催化稳定性。

3. 较高的凝胶化温度会导致催化剂结构破坏并降低其催化活性。

4. 支撑材料的选择对催化剂性能有很大影响。不同的支撑材料如二氧化硅、锆酸盐和氧化铝已被发现以不同方式影响催化剂效率。
