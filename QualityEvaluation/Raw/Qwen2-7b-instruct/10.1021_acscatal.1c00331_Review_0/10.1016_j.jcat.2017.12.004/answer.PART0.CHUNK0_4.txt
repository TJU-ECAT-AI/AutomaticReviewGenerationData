The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, primarily by converting propane into propene through a non-oxidative process. Key considerations include the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. High reaction temperatures and specific catalyst compositions are crucial for efficient PDH. For instance, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, with a gelation temperature of 60°C, exhibits superior catalytic performance for PDH. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts demonstrate better catalytic activity and stability compared to VOX-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Moreover, at a reaction temperature of 580°C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst maintains remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. It shows a slow decrease in propane conversion from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, while maintaining a high propene selectivity at approximately 91%.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst, reducing its activity, and leading to decreased productivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include optimizing operating conditions, using alternative catalyst materials, or implementing advanced regeneration techniques. For example, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst demonstrates improved long-term stability, suggesting it could be a viable alternative for reducing coke formation and improving catalyst regeneration in PDH processes.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，主要是通过非氧化过程将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。高温和特定的催化剂组成对于PDH的高效进行至关重要。例如，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂，其凝胶化温度为60°C，显示出优异的PDH催化性能。与通过一步水热法制备的VOX-MCM-41催化剂相比，VOX-SiO2催化剂表现出更好的活性和稳定性。此外，在580°C的反应温度下，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂在PDH的八次反应再生周期中展现出显著的长期催化稳定性。它的丙烷转化率在4小时反应时间内从55%缓慢下降到45%，而丙烯选择性保持在约91%左右。

Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，通过降低催化剂活性并导致生产率降低。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略可能包括优化操作条件、使用替代催化剂材料或实施先进的再生技术。例如，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂显示出改善的长期稳定性，这表明它可能是减少焦炭形成并提高PDH过程中催化剂再生的有效替代方案。
