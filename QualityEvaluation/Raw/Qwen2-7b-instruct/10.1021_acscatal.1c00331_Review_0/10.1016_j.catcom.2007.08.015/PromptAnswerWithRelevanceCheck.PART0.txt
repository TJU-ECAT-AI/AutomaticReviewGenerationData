1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a chemical reaction facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and the choice of catalyst type, particularly focusing on the particle size of the catalyst. Industrial applications of PDH rely on efficient and selective catalysts to produce propene in high yields. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring frequent regeneration, which increases operational costs and process complexity.

2. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting catalysts with appropriate particle sizes, and developing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coking. Additionally, employing advanced analytical tools like the TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information about the reaction dynamics, helping to understand the role of different catalyst properties in the PDH process.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a chemical reaction facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve temperature, pressure, and flow rates, ensuring optimal conditions for propene formation. Catalyst types, specifically those containing platinum (Pt), play a crucial role in the efficiency of the PDH process. Industrial applications often require catalysts that balance high activity for propane conversion with selectivity towards propene formation. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity, necessitating regular regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation might include optimizing reaction conditions, using catalysts with controlled particle sizes, and employing advanced analytical tools like TEOM coupled with GC/MS for real-time monitoring and adjustment.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity for propene formation. It leads to a decrease in the desired product yield and increases the complexity and cost of the process. Mitigation strategies include optimizing the catalyst design, particularly the particle size, to control the surface properties that contribute to coke formation. Advanced analytical tools like TEOM coupled with GC/MS allow for real-time monitoring of the reaction, enabling timely adjustments to prevent excessive coke buildup. Regular catalyst regeneration techniques are also employed to restore activity, although these processes can be resource-intensive and require careful management to maintain overall efficiency and economic viability.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen through a chemical reaction. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, utilizing suitable catalyst types, and optimizing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to decreased propene yield and increased operational costs. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve adjusting operating parameters, modifying catalyst design, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

2. The size of the Pt particles plays a crucial role in PDH as smaller particles (3 nm) exhibit higher activity but lower selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). This difference affects the rate of coke formation, selectivity towards coke formation, and the amount of coke produced, with smaller particles showing significantly higher rates of coking. Homogeneous distribution of Pt particles with a narrow size range (3 nm) is indicative of smaller particle sizes, enhancing activity but compromising selectivity.

3. The TEOM/GC system offers an advantageous approach for deriving comprehensive information about catalytic reactions, including activity, selectivity, and coke formation, from a single experiment. This enables a holistic assessment of catalyst performance and optimization of the PDH process.

4. Selectivity to propene formation in PDH depends on the balance between the activation of CH bonds (dehydrogenation reactions) and CC bonds (cracking reactions). Larger Pt particles, which are more selective for CH bond activation, facilitate higher propene yields but lower overall activity compared to smaller particles, which are more active but less selective.

5. The TOF (turnover frequency) of surface Pt sites is lower for catalysts with smaller particles (3 nm) than those with larger particles (21 nm). This is due to the rapid deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites by coke formation, particularly noticeable in catalysts with smaller particle sizes.

1.PDH作为丙烯生产的催化方法，通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气来实现丙烯生产。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、使用合适的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成影响了过程效率，减少了催化剂的活性和选择性，导致丙烯产量降低和运营成本增加。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括调整操作参数、修改催化剂设计以及实施先进的再生技术。

2.Pt颗粒大小对PDH起着至关重要的作用，较小的颗粒（3 nm）比较大颗粒（21 nm）具有更高的活性但较低的选择性。这种差异影响了焦炭形成速率、焦炭形成的选择性和形成的焦炭量，较小颗粒显示出较高的焦炭形成速率。具有窄粒径范围（3 nm）的均匀分布的Pt颗粒指示较小的颗粒大小，增强活性但牺牲选择性。

3.TEOM/GC系统提供了一种优势方法，可以从单一实验中获取关于催化反应的全面信息，包括活性、选择性和焦炭形成。这使得对催化剂性能进行综合评估和优化PDH过程成为可能。

4.PDH中丙烯选择性的形成取决于CH键（脱氢反应）和CC键（裂解反应）激活之间的平衡。与更选择性激活CH键的大颗粒相比，大颗粒促进了更高的丙烯产率但降低了总体活性，而活性更高但选择性较低的小颗粒。

5.表面Pt位点的TOF（周转频率）对于具有较小颗粒（3 nm）的催化剂而言低于具有较大颗粒（21 nm）的催化剂。这是由于高度活跃的配位不饱和表面Pt位点由焦炭形成快速失活，尤其是在具有较小颗粒大小的催化剂中特别明显。

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through the breaking of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing activity and increasing deactivation rates. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve modifying reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and implementing advanced analytical techniques for monitoring the reaction.

2. The size of Pt particles significantly influences the activity and selectivity of the Pt-SBA-15 catalysts in the PDH process. Smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective, leading to higher rates of coking and coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm). The activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation determines the selectivity towards propene formation. Coke acts as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites active for CC bond activation. However, this comes at the cost of reduced activity with respect to surface Pt sites.

3. The TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on the activity, selectivity, and coke formation during the PDH reaction. It allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters, offering insights into the complex interactions within the catalytic process.

4. Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation, while larger particles are less active but more selective for propene formation. Understanding the role of Sn in bimetallic catalysts requires further investigation, as it can influence both activity and selectivity.
