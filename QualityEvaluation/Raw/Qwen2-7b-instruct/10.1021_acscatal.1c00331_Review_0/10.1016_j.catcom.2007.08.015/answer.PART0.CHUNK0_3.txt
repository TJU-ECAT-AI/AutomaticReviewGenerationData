[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "Pt particle size is an important parameter to be taken into account while designing a rational catalyst for DHP since particle size not only influences the activity but also plays a crucial role in determining selectivity as evidenced by coking."
[5] "Smaller particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation while, larger particles are less active for both the reactions but more selective for propene formation."
[6] "It is also evident from this work that TEOM coupled with GC/MS is a powerful tool for obtaining comprehensive information of intricate catalytic reactions such as DHP."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen. Catalyst types commonly used include those containing metals such as platinum (Pt), chromium (Cr), and bimetallic combinations. Industrial applications of PDH involve the production of propene, a critical component in the manufacturing of polymers, solvents, and other petrochemical products.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. This leads to a decrease in the yield of desired products and an increase in the formation of unwanted byproducts, such as carbon deposits. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include operating under conditions that minimize the risk of coke buildup, such as maintaining high temperatures and using hydrogen as a diluent. Additionally, catalyst regeneration processes aim to remove coke deposits and restore the catalyst's performance. Advanced catalyst design, including the use of supported metal catalysts like Pt-SBA-15, helps in managing coke formation by balancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

3. The TEOM coupled with GC/MS is a powerful tool for obtaining comprehensive information on intricate catalytic reactions such as DHP. This technique allows for real-time monitoring of gas compositions, mass changes due to coke formation, and the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. By analyzing these parameters simultaneously, researchers can gain insights into the dynamics of the catalytic process and optimize the conditions for efficient propene production.
