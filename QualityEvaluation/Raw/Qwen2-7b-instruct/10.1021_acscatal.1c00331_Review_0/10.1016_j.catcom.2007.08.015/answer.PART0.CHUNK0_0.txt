[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[5] "Consequently, selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
[6] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a chemical reaction facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and the choice of catalyst type, particularly focusing on the particle size of the catalyst. Industrial applications of PDH rely on efficient and selective catalysts to produce propene in high yields. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring frequent regeneration, which increases operational costs and process complexity.

2. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting catalysts with appropriate particle sizes, and developing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coking. Additionally, employing advanced analytical tools like the TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information about the reaction dynamics, helping to understand the role of different catalyst properties in the PDH process.

1.PDH作为丙烷转化为丙烯的方法，通过催化作用将丙烷分子转化为丙烯。PDH的关键考虑因素包括反应条件（如温度和压力）以及催化剂类型的选择，特别是催化剂颗粒大小。工业应用依赖于高效和选择性的催化剂以高产率生产丙烯。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，导致催化剂需要频繁再生，增加运营成本和过程复杂性。

2.缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的策略包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型，并开发具有抗结焦能力增强的催化剂。此外，采用先进的分析工具，如TEOM/GC系统，可以提供关于反应动态的全面信息，帮助理解不同催化剂性质在PDH过程中的作用。
