[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[5] "Coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
[6] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."
[7] "It is also evident from this work that TEOM coupled with GC/MS is a powerful tool for obtaining comprehensive information of intricate catalytic reactions such as DHP."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene through a chemical reaction facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve temperature, pressure, and flow rates, ensuring optimal conditions for propene formation. Catalyst types, specifically those containing platinum (Pt), play a crucial role in the efficiency of the PDH process. Industrial applications often require catalysts that balance high activity for propane conversion with selectivity towards propene formation. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity, necessitating regular regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation might include optimizing reaction conditions, using catalysts with controlled particle sizes, and employing advanced analytical tools like TEOM coupled with GC/MS for real-time monitoring and adjustment.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity for propene formation. It leads to a decrease in the desired product yield and increases the complexity and cost of the process. Mitigation strategies include optimizing the catalyst design, particularly the particle size, to control the surface properties that contribute to coke formation. Advanced analytical tools like TEOM coupled with GC/MS allow for real-time monitoring of the reaction, enabling timely adjustments to prevent excessive coke buildup. Regular catalyst regeneration techniques are also employed to restore activity, although these processes can be resource-intensive and require careful management to maintain overall efficiency and economic viability.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产方法，通过催化剂促进丙烷分子转化为丙烯进行化学反应。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和流速，确保在最佳条件下形成丙烯。特定铂（Pt）基催化剂的类型在PDH过程的效率中扮演着重要角色。工业应用通常需要平衡高活性与丙烯选择性的催化剂。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为这会减少催化剂的活性和丙烯选择性，要求定期再生。缓解焦炭形成的策略可能包括优化催化剂设计，特别是控制导致焦炭形成的表面特性，以及使用如TEOM结合GC/MS等高级分析工具进行实时监控，以便及时调整以防止过度焦炭积累。 

2. 焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成显著影响过程效率，因为它会降低催化剂的活性和丙烯选择性，导致预期产品产量下降，并增加过程的复杂性和成本。缓解策略可能包括优化催化剂设计，尤其是控制颗粒尺寸，以控制导致焦炭形成的表面性质。如TEOM结合GC/MS等高级分析工具允许进行实时监控反应，以便及时调整以防止过量焦炭积聚。定期进行催化剂再生技术以恢复活性也是采用的策略，尽管这些过程可能资源密集且需要仔细管理，以维持整体效率和经济可行性。
