[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[5] "Consequently, selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
[6] "For Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke."
[7] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
[8] "However, activity with respect to the surface Pt sites (TOF) is lower on the former than on the latter (Table 1)."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through the breaking of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing activity and increasing deactivation rates. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve modifying reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and implementing advanced analytical techniques for monitoring the reaction.

2. The size of Pt particles significantly influences the activity and selectivity of the Pt-SBA-15 catalysts in the PDH process. Smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective, leading to higher rates of coking and coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm). The activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation determines the selectivity towards propene formation. Coke acts as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites active for CC bond activation. However, this comes at the cost of reduced activity with respect to surface Pt sites.

3. The TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on the activity, selectivity, and coke formation during the PDH reaction. It allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters, offering insights into the complex interactions within the catalytic process.

4. Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation, while larger particles are less active but more selective for propene formation. Understanding the role of Sn in bimetallic catalysts requires further investigation, as it can influence both activity and selectivity.

1. 丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产方法，通过断裂碳-碳（CC）键将丙烷转化为丙烯。PDH的关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理工业应用。焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成影响了过程效率，因为它降低了活性并增加了催化剂失活率。为了减轻焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采取修改反应条件、增强催化剂设计和实施先进的分析技术以监控反应等策略。

2. 铂颗粒大小显著影响了Pt-SBA-15催化剂在PDH过程中的活性和选择性。较小的颗粒（3nm）更活跃但选择性较低，导致与较大颗粒（21nm）相比更高的焦炭生成率和焦炭形成量。CH和CC键激活的活性比决定了向丙烯形成的选择性。焦炭作为促进剂通过使活性较高的CC键激活位点失活来提高选择性。然而，这伴随着表面铂位点活性的降低。

3. TEOM/GC系统提供了PDH反应中活性、选择性和焦炭形成等多参数的综合信息。它允许同时测量多个参数，为理解催化过程中的复杂相互作用提供见解。

4. 较小的铂颗粒对于丙烷转化和焦炭形成更为活跃，而较大的颗粒则活性较低但选择性较高。理解二元催化剂中Sn的作用需要进一步研究，因为它可以影响活性和选择性。
