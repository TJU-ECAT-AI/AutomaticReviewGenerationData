The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is used as an alternative method for propene production due to the increasing demand for propylene that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet efficiently. Noble metals, particularly platinum (Pt), are commonly used because of their superior activity. To enhance propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is often added as a promoter to monometallic Pt catalysts. Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles exhibit high propene selectivity. The absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibits unwanted side reactions like cracking, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is a novel and efficient catalyst with high atom efficiency and excellent dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability. Hierarchical nanoalumina supports are preferred due to their open structure, which improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst stability. The discrepancy in weight loss between oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres during thermal gravimetric analysis is attributed to the presence of nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon. Multiple Pt-Pt sites in Pt-based catalysts are active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene and cracking, leading to subsequent secondary reactions. The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding activity, high selectivity, and stability, making it suitable for industrial applications.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程被用作丙烯生产的一种替代方法，以满足对丙烯的需求，因为传统的裂解方法如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解无法有效满足。铂（Pt）是常用的贵金属，因为它具有优异的活性。为了提高丙烯选择性，通常会在单金属Pt催化剂中添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂。分散的Pt和大的Pt纳米粒子都表现出高丙烯选择性。多个Pt-Pt位点的缺乏有效地抑制了深氢化和裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂是一种新型且高效的催化剂，具有高原子效率和出色的脱氢能力、选择性和稳定性。分级纳米氧化铝支持材料由于其开放结构而受到青睐，这可以改善质量传输、扩散动力学和催化剂稳定性。在热重分析过程中，氧气和氮气气氛下重量损失差异归因于非挥发性的预石墨碳的存在。Pt基催化剂中的多个Pt-Pt位点对丙烷的深氢化和裂解活性以及后续的二次反应有作用。原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂显示出卓越的活性、高选择性和稳定性，使其适用于工业应用。
