The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propylene through breaking their carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing the potential coke formation on Pt-based catalysts to maintain efficiency and prolong catalyst life. Coke formation, resulting from the unwanted deep dehydrogenation of propylene, can significantly impact process efficiency by blocking reaction pathways and requiring costly regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve:

1. Minimizing noble metal usage to lower production costs.
2. Maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels.
3. Enhancing the catalyst's anticoking ability by controlling the Pt particle size and structure.

The atomically dispersed Pt catalysts are particularly advantageous because they offer superior activity, high propylene selectivity, and stability. The positive charge on the Pt centers enhances the activity and prevents the deep dehydrogenation of propylene. Moreover, the absence of multiple PtPt sites inhibits undesired side reactions like CC cracking, thus improving propylene selectivity and stability. This work highlights the promising application of supported atomically dispersed Pt catalysts for highly selective propane dehydrogenation, offering a valuable alternative for propene production with reduced environmental impact and improved economic efficiency.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的替代方法，通过断裂丙烷分子中的碳-碳（C-C）键来转换为丙烯。在这一过程中需要考虑的关键因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理Pt基催化剂上可能形成的焦炭以维持效率并延长催化剂寿命。焦炭形成，由丙烯的过度裂解引起，可以显著影响过程效率，因为这会堵塞反应途径并要求昂贵的再生步骤。为了减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取以下策略：

1. 减少贵金属的使用量以降低生产成本。
2. 在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性。
3. 通过控制Pt颗粒大小和结构增强催化剂的抗焦化能力。

原子分散的Pt催化剂尤其具有优势，因为它们提供更高的活性、高丙烯选择性和稳定性。Pt中心的正电荷增强了活性并阻止了丙烯的深度脱氢。此外，缺乏多个PtPt位点抑制了如CC裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。这项工作强调了支持的原子分散型Pt催化剂在高度选择性丙烷脱氢方面的有前景的应用，为丙烯生产提供了经济高效且环境影响较小的有价值的替代方案。
