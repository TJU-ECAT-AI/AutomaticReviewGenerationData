1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is used to produce propylene because traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are insufficient to meet the growing demand for propylene. However, the selectivity of PDH towards propylene is not fully satisfactory. To enhance propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is commonly used as a promoter in a monometallic platinum (Pt) catalyst. The gradual deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is a significant challenge. The key demands for PDH include minimizing the use of noble metals to reduce costs, maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels, and increasing the catalyst's anti-coking capability.

2. The size dependence of PDH catalyst performance is categorized into three regions: atomically dispersed, small clusters, and nanoparticles. As the Pt particle size decreases to subnanometer clusters, the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows superior performance with high propylene selectivity and stability. The atomically dispersed Pt centers with a positive charge enhance activity, weaken propylene adsorption, and prevent deep dehydrogenation. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibits undesired side reactions like carbon-carbon cracking, thus improving propylene selectivity and stability.

3. The size dependence of the propylene selectivity on Pt-based catalysts is similar when normalized to a comparable conversion level, as shown in Figure 2e and f. The stability index, which relates to coke formation, follows a similar trend as the propylene selectivity. The atomically dispersed Pt catalysts show the least conversion loss during the reaction, demonstrating good stability. Therefore, the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst offers high catalytic activity, high propylene selectivity, and good stability.

4. The Pt particle size affects the electronic properties of the catalyst. As the Pt loading decreases, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy shifts towards higher values, and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species increases. This indicates a stronger interaction between Pt and the support. At a low Pt loading, the Pt species exist primarily as positively charged Ptδ+ atoms, which are advantageous for propane adsorption and activation, leading to high catalytic activity. The shift in binding energy suggests that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms have more positive charges compared to small clusters and nanoparticles.

5. The CO adsorption strength on the catalysts relates directly to the selectivity. On the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the adsorption strength of propylene is relatively weak, facilitating its desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation. This leads to higher levels of selectivity compared to sub-nanocatalysts and nanocatalysts. The absence of multiple PtPt sites on atomically dispersed Pt catalysts prevents the combination of multiple Pt atoms for deep dehydrogenation reactions, effectively inhibiting side reactions and improving propylene selectivity and stability.

1. PDH被用作生产丙烯的一种重要替代方法，因为传统的丙烯生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。然而，PDH对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为提高丙烯选择性，通常在单金属铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂。由于催化剂逐渐因焦炭形成而失效，这是难以克服的问题。PDH的关键要求包括：（1）降低贵金属使用量以降低成本；（2）在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；（3）提高催化剂的抗结焦能力。

2. PDH催化剂性能的尺寸依赖性可以分为三个区域：原子分散、小簇和纳米颗粒。当铂颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇时，原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂显示出优越的性能，同时保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性。原子分散的铂中心带有正电荷，增强活性，削弱丙烯吸附，并防止深度脱氢。多个PtPt位点的有效缺失有效抑制了碳-碳裂解等副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。

3. 在相同转化率下，丙烯选择性的尺寸依赖性在图2e和f中以类似的方式表现出来。稳定性指数与丙烯选择性相关，该指数与焦炭形成有关。原子分散的Pt催化剂在反应过程中显示出最低的转化损失，表明良好的稳定性。因此，原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂提供高催化活性、高丙烯选择性和良好稳定性。

4. 铂颗粒大小影响催化剂的电子性质。随着铂负载量的减少，铂4d5/2结合能向较高值移动，氧化铂δ+物种的比例逐渐增加。这表明Pt与支撑物之间的相互作用更强。在低铂负载量下，Pt物种主要以正电荷的Ptδ+原子存在，这对丙烷吸附和激活有利，导致高催化活性。结合能的偏移表明，原子分散的Pt原子比小簇和纳米颗粒具有更多的正电荷。

5. 丙烯吸附强度与催化剂直接相关。在原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，丙烯的吸附强度相对较弱，有利于其脱附而不是深度脱氢。这导致了与亚纳米催化剂和纳米催化剂相比更高的选择性。原子分散的Pt催化剂上没有多个PtPt位点，防止了多个Pt原子组合进行深度脱氢反应，有效抑制了副反应并提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。
