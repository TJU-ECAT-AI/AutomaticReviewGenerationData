<p>The demand for propylene is ever-increasing due to its limited supply from traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.</p>
<p>Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity.</p>
<p>To address the problem, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.</p>
<p>However, alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH.</p>
<p>The gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue.</p>
<p>Therefore, the critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity on Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the particle size in the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves in an opposite manner.</p>
<p>According to density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus are more reactive for propane conversion, but large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces exhibit a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the fabrication of single-atom catalysts, establishing a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, in-depth research of catalysts has been performed at a smaller size scale.</p>
<p>Single-atom catalysts are providing new approaches for designing desired propane dehydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>When the size of a metal particle reduces to subnanometer or atomically dispersed, it typically manifests the unique catalytic properties differing from the conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the exclusive structural and electronic attribution.</p>
<p>A combined catalyst characterization and kinetic studies reveal the underlying nature of the structure-performance relationship.</p>
<p>The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a precious high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability.</p>
<p>The size dependence of Pt catalysts for PDH can be divided into three groups: atomically dispersed, small clusters, and nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has an outstanding catalytic activity while still retaining a high propylene selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has an activity approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than small clusters and nanoparticles, respectively.</p>
<p>The nature of the size dependence is attributed to the exposure of increased effective active sites, positively charged Ptδ+ centers, which enhance propane adsorption and facilitate the CH bond activation compared to small clusters and nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Weakened propylene adsorption on the atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher levels of selectivity compared to the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 sub-nanocatalyst and the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst.</p>
<p>The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts leads to deactivation and requires strategies to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration.</p>
<p>Strategies can include minimizing the presence of multiple PtPt sites, which are active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and subsequent secondary reactions.</p>

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as an alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand for propylene. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting suitable catalyst types, and enhancing the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation, necessitating strategies to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration.

Coke formation occurs when the catalyst's surface becomes covered with carbonaceous materials, hindering the reaction's efficiency. Mitigation strategies include:
1. Minimizing the presence of multiple PtPt sites, which are active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and subsequent secondary reactions.
2. Designing catalysts with atomically dispersed Pt particles to prevent undesired side reactions and improve propene selectivity and stability.

The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst stands out for its superior catalytic activity, high propylene selectivity, and stability. This catalyst type surpasses traditional nanocatalysts in performance, offering significant potential for industrial applications by minimizing noble metal usage and improving overall efficiency.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产丙烯的替代方法，满足了对丙烯需求的增长。此过程的关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及增强催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成影响了过程效率，因为它导致催化剂失活，需要采取策略来减少其形成并改善催化剂的再生性。

焦炭形成发生在催化剂表面覆盖碳化物时，这会阻碍反应效率。减少策略包括：
1. 减少多个PtPt位点的存在，这些位点活跃于丙烯深脱氢、裂解和随后的二次反应。
2. 设计原子分散的铂/氧化铝催化剂，以防止不希望的副反应并提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。

原子分散的铂/氧化铝催化剂因其出色的催化活性、高丙烯选择性和稳定性而突出。这种催化剂类型超越了传统的纳米催化剂，在性能上具有显著优势，并且通过减少贵金属的使用量和提高整体效率，为工业应用提供了巨大潜力。
