The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is becoming an important alternative for producing propylene, as it meets the ever-increasing demand for propylene production. Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. However, achieving high propylene selectivity is a challenge, which has led to the addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter to enhance propylene selectivity in industrial processes. Unfortunately, alloying Pt with Sn significantly reduces the PDH reaction rate. The gradual catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation is another major issue. The main concerns in PDH are to reduce the usage of noble metals for cost-effectiveness, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation. 

PDH is a structure-sensitive reaction, where the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles increases as the particle size decreases within the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves oppositely. Smaller Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, making them more reactive for propane conversion. Conversely, larger Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(111) faces have a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts offer new approaches for designing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with high atom efficiency, excellent dehydrogenation ability, and stability.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程正在成为满足日益增长的丙烯生产需求的重要替代方法。由于铂（Pt）的优越活性，Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性成分。然而，实现高丙烯选择性是一个挑战，这导致添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂来提高工业过程中的丙烯选择性。不幸的是，将Pt与Sn合金化显著降低了PDH反应速率。催化剂逐渐因焦炭形成而失活是另一个主要问题。PDH的主要关注点是在减少贵金属使用以降低成本、维持高丙烯选择性在高活性水平、并增加催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力。

PDH是一种结构敏感反应，当Pt纳米颗粒的粒径在19 nm范围内减小时，其催化活性增加，而丙烯选择性表现出相反的方式。较小的Pt纳米颗粒，具有主导的Pt(211)面，显示较低的脱氢能垒，使其更有利于丙烷转化。相反，较大的Pt纳米颗粒，具有主导的Pt(111)面，具有较高的CH键激活能垒和较弱的丙烯结合强度。单原子催化剂为设计具有高活性和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂提供了新的途径。Al2O3支持的原子分散的Pt催化剂是一种具有高原子效率、优秀脱氢能力以及稳定性的新型催化剂。

The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is used as an alternative method for propene production due to the increasing demand for propylene that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet efficiently. Noble metals, particularly platinum (Pt), are commonly used because of their superior activity. To enhance propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is often added as a promoter to monometallic Pt catalysts. Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles exhibit high propene selectivity. The absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibits unwanted side reactions like cracking, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is a novel and efficient catalyst with high atom efficiency and excellent dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability. Hierarchical nanoalumina supports are preferred due to their open structure, which improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst stability. The discrepancy in weight loss between oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres during thermal gravimetric analysis is attributed to the presence of nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon. Multiple Pt-Pt sites in Pt-based catalysts are active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene and cracking, leading to subsequent secondary reactions. The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding activity, high selectivity, and stability, making it suitable for industrial applications.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propylene through breaking their carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing the potential coke formation on Pt-based catalysts to maintain efficiency and prolong catalyst life. Coke formation, resulting from the unwanted deep dehydrogenation of propylene, can significantly impact process efficiency by blocking reaction pathways and requiring costly regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve:

1. Minimizing noble metal usage to lower production costs.
2. Maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels.
3. Enhancing the catalyst's anticoking ability by controlling the Pt particle size and structure.

The atomically dispersed Pt catalysts are particularly advantageous because they offer superior activity, high propylene selectivity, and stability. The positive charge on the Pt centers enhances the activity and prevents the deep dehydrogenation of propylene. Moreover, the absence of multiple PtPt sites inhibits undesired side reactions like CC cracking, thus improving propylene selectivity and stability. This work highlights the promising application of supported atomically dispersed Pt catalysts for highly selective propane dehydrogenation, offering a valuable alternative for propene production with reduced environmental impact and improved economic efficiency.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的替代方法，通过断裂丙烷分子中的碳-碳（C-C）键来转换为丙烯。在这一过程中需要考虑的关键因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理Pt基催化剂上可能形成的焦炭以维持效率并延长催化剂寿命。焦炭形成，由丙烯的过度裂解引起，可以显著影响过程效率，因为这会堵塞反应途径并要求昂贵的再生步骤。为了减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取以下策略：

1. 减少贵金属的使用量以降低生产成本。
2. 在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性。
3. 通过控制Pt颗粒大小和结构增强催化剂的抗焦化能力。

原子分散的Pt催化剂尤其具有优势，因为它们提供更高的活性、高丙烯选择性和稳定性。Pt中心的正电荷增强了活性并阻止了丙烯的深度脱氢。此外，缺乏多个PtPt位点抑制了如CC裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。这项工作强调了支持的原子分散型Pt催化剂在高度选择性丙烷脱氢方面的有前景的应用，为丙烯生产提供了经济高效且环境影响较小的有价值的替代方案。

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is used to produce propylene because traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are insufficient to meet the growing demand for propylene. However, the selectivity of PDH towards propylene is not fully satisfactory. To enhance propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is commonly used as a promoter in a monometallic platinum (Pt) catalyst. The gradual deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is a significant challenge. The key demands for PDH include minimizing the use of noble metals to reduce costs, maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels, and increasing the catalyst's anti-coking capability.

2. The size dependence of PDH catalyst performance is categorized into three regions: atomically dispersed, small clusters, and nanoparticles. As the Pt particle size decreases to subnanometer clusters, the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows superior performance with high propylene selectivity and stability. The atomically dispersed Pt centers with a positive charge enhance activity, weaken propylene adsorption, and prevent deep dehydrogenation. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibits undesired side reactions like carbon-carbon cracking, thus improving propylene selectivity and stability.

3. The size dependence of the propylene selectivity on Pt-based catalysts is similar when normalized to a comparable conversion level, as shown in Figure 2e and f. The stability index, which relates to coke formation, follows a similar trend as the propylene selectivity. The atomically dispersed Pt catalysts show the least conversion loss during the reaction, demonstrating good stability. Therefore, the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst offers high catalytic activity, high propylene selectivity, and good stability.

4. The Pt particle size affects the electronic properties of the catalyst. As the Pt loading decreases, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy shifts towards higher values, and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species increases. This indicates a stronger interaction between Pt and the support. At a low Pt loading, the Pt species exist primarily as positively charged Ptδ+ atoms, which are advantageous for propane adsorption and activation, leading to high catalytic activity. The shift in binding energy suggests that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms have more positive charges compared to small clusters and nanoparticles.

5. The CO adsorption strength on the catalysts relates directly to the selectivity. On the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the adsorption strength of propylene is relatively weak, facilitating its desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation. This leads to higher levels of selectivity compared to sub-nanocatalysts and nanocatalysts. The absence of multiple PtPt sites on atomically dispersed Pt catalysts prevents the combination of multiple Pt atoms for deep dehydrogenation reactions, effectively inhibiting side reactions and improving propylene selectivity and stability.

1. PDH被用作生产丙烯的一种重要替代方法，因为传统的丙烯生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。然而，PDH对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为提高丙烯选择性，通常在单金属铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂。由于催化剂逐渐因焦炭形成而失效，这是难以克服的问题。PDH的关键要求包括：（1）降低贵金属使用量以降低成本；（2）在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；（3）提高催化剂的抗结焦能力。

2. PDH催化剂性能的尺寸依赖性可以分为三个区域：原子分散、小簇和纳米颗粒。当铂颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇时，原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂显示出优越的性能，同时保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性。原子分散的铂中心带有正电荷，增强活性，削弱丙烯吸附，并防止深度脱氢。多个PtPt位点的有效缺失有效抑制了碳-碳裂解等副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。

3. 在相同转化率下，丙烯选择性的尺寸依赖性在图2e和f中以类似的方式表现出来。稳定性指数与丙烯选择性相关，该指数与焦炭形成有关。原子分散的Pt催化剂在反应过程中显示出最低的转化损失，表明良好的稳定性。因此，原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂提供高催化活性、高丙烯选择性和良好稳定性。

4. 铂颗粒大小影响催化剂的电子性质。随着铂负载量的减少，铂4d5/2结合能向较高值移动，氧化铂δ+物种的比例逐渐增加。这表明Pt与支撑物之间的相互作用更强。在低铂负载量下，Pt物种主要以正电荷的Ptδ+原子存在，这对丙烷吸附和激活有利，导致高催化活性。结合能的偏移表明，原子分散的Pt原子比小簇和纳米颗粒具有更多的正电荷。

5. 丙烯吸附强度与催化剂直接相关。在原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，丙烯的吸附强度相对较弱，有利于其脱附而不是深度脱氢。这导致了与亚纳米催化剂和纳米催化剂相比更高的选择性。原子分散的Pt催化剂上没有多个PtPt位点，防止了多个Pt原子组合进行深度脱氢反应，有效抑制了副反应并提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。
