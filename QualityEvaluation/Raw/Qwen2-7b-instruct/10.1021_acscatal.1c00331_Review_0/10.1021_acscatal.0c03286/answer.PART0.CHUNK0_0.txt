The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is becoming an important alternative for producing propylene, as it meets the ever-increasing demand for propylene production. Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. However, achieving high propylene selectivity is a challenge, which has led to the addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter to enhance propylene selectivity in industrial processes. Unfortunately, alloying Pt with Sn significantly reduces the PDH reaction rate. The gradual catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation is another major issue. The main concerns in PDH are to reduce the usage of noble metals for cost-effectiveness, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation. 

PDH is a structure-sensitive reaction, where the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles increases as the particle size decreases within the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves oppositely. Smaller Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, making them more reactive for propane conversion. Conversely, larger Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(111) faces have a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts offer new approaches for designing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with high atom efficiency, excellent dehydrogenation ability, and stability.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程正在成为满足日益增长的丙烯生产需求的重要替代方法。由于铂（Pt）的优越活性，Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性成分。然而，实现高丙烯选择性是一个挑战，这导致添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂来提高工业过程中的丙烯选择性。不幸的是，将Pt与Sn合金化显著降低了PDH反应速率。催化剂逐渐因焦炭形成而失活是另一个主要问题。PDH的主要关注点是在减少贵金属使用以降低成本、维持高丙烯选择性在高活性水平、并增加催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力。

PDH是一种结构敏感反应，当Pt纳米颗粒的粒径在19 nm范围内减小时，其催化活性增加，而丙烯选择性表现出相反的方式。较小的Pt纳米颗粒，具有主导的Pt(211)面，显示较低的脱氢能垒，使其更有利于丙烷转化。相反，较大的Pt纳米颗粒，具有主导的Pt(111)面，具有较高的CH键激活能垒和较弱的丙烯结合强度。单原子催化剂为设计具有高活性和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂提供了新的途径。Al2O3支持的原子分散的Pt催化剂是一种具有高原子效率、优秀脱氢能力以及稳定性的新型催化剂。
