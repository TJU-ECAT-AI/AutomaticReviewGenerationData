The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by utilizing a high-yielding reaction pathway. Key considerations in PDH involve optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations to maximize propene yield. Catalyst types, especially those based on transition metals like platinum (Pt), are critical in PDH processes, impacting both reaction kinetics and product distribution. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively affects process efficiency, requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include fine-tuning operating conditions, incorporating promoters to enhance catalyst stability, and developing more efficient catalyst materials.
