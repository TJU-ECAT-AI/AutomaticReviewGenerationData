The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by utilizing a high-yielding reaction pathway. Key considerations in PDH involve optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations to maximize propene yield. Catalyst types, especially those based on transition metals like platinum (Pt), are critical in PDH processes, impacting both reaction kinetics and product distribution. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively affects process efficiency, requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include fine-tuning operating conditions, incorporating promoters to enhance catalyst stability, and developing more efficient catalyst materials.

为了将丙烷（PDH）直接脱氢作为丙烯生产的手段，该过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力以及使用合适的催化剂。铂（Pt）催化剂通常被采用，因其在PDH反应中具有高活性和选择性。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的表面面积并降低了催化剂的活性。为缓解焦炭的形成并提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取的策略包括在较低温度下操作、使用预处理的催化剂以及定期更换或再生催化剂。
