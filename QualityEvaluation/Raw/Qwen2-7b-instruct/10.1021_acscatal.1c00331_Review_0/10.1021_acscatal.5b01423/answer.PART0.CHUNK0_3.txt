To function as a method for propene production, catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) involves converting propane into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of a suitable catalyst. Platinum (Pt) catalysts are commonly employed due to their high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively affects process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and decreasing catalyst activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include operating under lower temperatures, using pretreated catalysts, and periodically replacing or regenerating the catalyst.

为了将丙烷（PDH）直接脱氢作为丙烯生产的手段，该过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力以及使用合适的催化剂。铂（Pt）催化剂通常被采用，因其在PDH反应中具有高活性和选择性。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的表面面积并降低了催化剂的活性。为缓解焦炭的形成并提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取的策略包括在较低温度下操作、使用预处理的催化剂以及定期更换或再生催化剂。
