[1] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions."
[2] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[3] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[4] "Over modified catalysts, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler."
[5] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
[6] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[7] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step."
[8] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."

To function as a method for propene production, catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) relies on a catalyst to accelerate the main reaction of converting propane into propene, while simultaneously controlling unwanted side reactions. Key considerations for this process include the type of catalyst used, the reaction conditions, and the industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and necessitating costly regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include using modified catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and employing advanced regeneration techniques.

Answer: Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts in PDH impacts process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and requiring expensive regeneration. Strategies to mitigate this include using modified catalysts, optimizing conditions, and employing advanced regeneration methods.
