[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[2] "The primary purpose of this butane dehydrogenation was to produce butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes using solid phosphoric acid catalysts discovered by Schaad and Ipatieff."
[3] "Other companies, including Shell, Gulf,and Dow, also practiced similar dehydrogenation technologies."
[4] "For propane dehydrogenation,a four-stage reactor system becomes more economical because higher average temperatures are needed."
[5] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[6] "Coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[7] "Selectivity decreases sharply as conversion approaches equilibrium because the main dehydrogenation process is limited by equilibrium, but other reactions continue to occur."
[8] "As Eq. (4) is the ratio of two functions, the rate constants become relative values and can be expressed as ki(T)/k0(T), where k0(T) is the rate constant for the forward reaction of paraffin dehydrogenation to mono-olefins."
[9] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[10] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."
[11] "The choice of reactor design plays a very important role in the success of catalytic processes."
[12] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
[13] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[14] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene, with coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacting process efficiency negatively. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve optimizing reaction conditions, using selective catalyst types, and implementing effective regeneration techniques.

2. In PDH, the key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve achieving high temperatures to facilitate the dehydrogenation process, ensuring adequate residence time for complete conversion, and maintaining proper pressure levels. Catalyst types typically include Pt-based catalysts, which offer high activity but require careful management to prevent coke formation.

3. The impact of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts in PDH is significant, as it leads to decreased catalytic activity and increased energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using catalyst supports with high dispersion capabilities, incorporating coke removal mechanisms into the reactor design, and employing advanced regeneration methods such as cyclic operation or fluidized bed reactors.

4. To improve catalyst regeneration, companies can implement multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) systems, which allow for efficient heat management and extended catalyst life. Additionally, using catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity can reduce the frequency of regeneration required.

5. The regeneration process for Pt-based catalysts in PDH often involves heating the catalyst to high temperatures, typically through the use of air or gas turbine exhaust, to remove deposited coke. Ensuring that the regeneration process is efficient and does not excessively degrade the catalyst is crucial for maintaining overall process efficiency.

6. As the conversion approaches equilibrium, selectivity to propene decreases sharply, as other reactions continue to occur alongside the main dehydrogenation process. Optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst types can help maintain high selectivity even as conversion levels increase.

7. The rate constants for the dehydrogenation reactions become relative values when expressed in terms of the forward reaction rate constant, k0(T), which allows for the quantification of the relative activity of the catalyst under different conditions.

8. The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is approximately 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol), which influences the choice of reactor design and regeneration methods required to manage the heat generated during the process.

9. The regeneration process for PDH catalysts often involves heating the catalyst to high temperatures, typically through the use of air or gas turbine exhaust, to remove deposited coke. Efficient regeneration methods aim to minimize energy consumption and catalyst degradation.

10. The choice of reactor design is critical in PDH processes, as it affects the efficiency of heat management, gas flow distribution, and catalyst utilization. Different reactor designs, such as cyclic, isothermal, or fluidized bed reactors, offer trade-offs in terms of energy efficiency, heat management, and catalyst life.

11. Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C utilizes reducible metal oxide catalysts, particularly those containing vanadium, to convert ethane to ethylene.

12. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of surface ethoxide on the catalyst, which then undergoes a beta-elimination process to form ethylene. This process also produces coproducts like acetic acid, depending on the catalyst composition and reaction conditions.

13. The products of ethane oxydehydrogenation include ethylene (80-93% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity), with the latter requiring separation for practical use.

14. For vinyl chloride producers, a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene can be economically attractive if the stream can be utilized without separation, reducing the overall costs associated with product purification.

15. Catalysts examined by Phillips Petroleum for ethane oxydehydrogenation include those comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, as well as those containing cobalt, phosphorous, potassium, and zirconium.

16. The addition of tin to the catalyst and hydrogen to the feed can increase the selectivity to ethylene to above 85% at a conversion of ethane of 67%.

17. Achieving high selectivity to ethylene coupled with low contact time and high conversion of ethane makes ethane oxydehydrogenation an attractive alternative to steam cracking for producing ethylene, especially considering its potential for reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.
