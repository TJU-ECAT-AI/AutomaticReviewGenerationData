[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[3] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene."
[4] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene."
[5] "Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, and the key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications involve the optimization of conversion, selectivity, and efficiency."
[6] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and causing a decrease in selectivity. Strategies to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of catalyst modifiers, adjusting operating conditions, and implementing advanced catalyst designs."

1. The catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes for the production of butenes during World War II involved using a chromia-alumina catalyst. Butenes were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to create high-octane aviation fuel.
2. In the dehydrogenation process utilizing chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is placed in a fixed shallow bed inside a reactor, which can be spherical, vertical cylindrical, or horizontal.
3. The Houdry Catadiene process was widely applied for the production of butadiene, both independently (n-butane to butadiene) and in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene.
4. In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the use of chromia-alumina catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene.
5. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production. Key considerations in optimizing the process include refining reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and enhancing industrial applications to maximize conversion, selectivity, and efficiency.
6. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts affects process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include utilizing catalyst modifiers, adjusting operational parameters, and adopting advanced catalyst designs.
