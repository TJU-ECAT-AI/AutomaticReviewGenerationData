[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydro- genation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[5] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved. Over modified catalysts, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler (Fig. 7)."
[6] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
[7] "Catalyst stability and regeneration is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[8] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[9] "The heat of reaction is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include operating at temperatures around 400-500°C, maintaining low pressures, and ensuring adequate hydrogen-to-propane ratios to maximize propene yield. Catalyst types typically involve modified platinum-based catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity towards propene formation, with coke formation being a critical issue that impacts process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include regular catalyst regeneration and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize side reactions.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts in PDH processes impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity, leading to decreased propene yield and increased operational costs. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using catalysts with high dispersion and selectivity, maintaining proper reaction conditions to prevent excessive cracking, and implementing advanced catalyst design that reduces coke formation propensity. Additionally, employing continuous catalyst regeneration techniques allows for maintaining high catalyst activity and selectivity over time, thus enhancing overall process efficiency.
