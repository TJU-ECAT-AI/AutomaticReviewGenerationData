<p>Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines.</p>
<p>In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China,it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo-dynamic equilibrium. If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken. In this regard, oxidative dehydrogenation has attracted more and more attention.</p>
<p>Between 500 1C and 700 1C, the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes increases nearly linearly with temperature (Fig. 1a); the accepted upper limit of temperature for PDH,however, may be about 630 1C. Exceeding the limit will cause severe side reactions including thermal cracking and coking. Hence, operating at around 600 1C seems to be more feasible.</p>
<p>For isobutane dehydrogenation, the temperature can be a little lower. As shown in Fig. 1b, the equilibrium conversion drops exponentially with pressure. Reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons is very effective for increasing the conversion.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560630 1C. If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed by the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed, and then the temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds.</p>

<p>To lengthen the time between regenerations, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor. For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition.</p>
<p>The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst. Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity. The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively.</p>
<p>For isobutane dehydrogenation over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the conversion of propane reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%.</p>
<p>Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by abstracting hydrogen from propane to form propene. The key considerations are reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include modifying catalyst composition to reduce coking and employing additives that inhibit coke formation.

2. The equilibrium conversion of light alkanes increases nearly linearly with temperature between 500-700°C, with an accepted upper limit of 630°C for PDH. Operating at around 600°C seems more feasible. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the temperature can be a little lower. Reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons is very effective for increasing the conversion.

3. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560-630°C. If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed by the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed. The temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds.
