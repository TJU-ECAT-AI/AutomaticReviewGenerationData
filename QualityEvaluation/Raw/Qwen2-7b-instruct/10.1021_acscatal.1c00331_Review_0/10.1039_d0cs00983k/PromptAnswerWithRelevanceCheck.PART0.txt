[1] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[2] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
[3] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
[5] "The origin of the permanent deactivation is the sintering of Pt particles."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560630 1C."
[7] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
[8] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
[9] "For propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalyst, the highest yield and selectivity to propylene is obtained from Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3 (0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn)."
[10] "Adding Sn reduces the energy barriers of olefin desorption and simultaneously increases the activation energy for deep dehydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to olefins is improved markedly."
[11] "In order to inhibit deep dehydrogenation and CC bond breaking of alkanes, the strong interaction between Ni and formed alkenes should be weakened."
[12] "The addition of B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst can further enhance the dispersion of vanadium species and improve the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to olefins."
[13] "For a Sn-based catalyst, the low-melting-point of Sn results in a longer distance between liquid Sn atoms under the reaction temperature, inhibiting the adsorption of more than one pair of hydrogen atoms and increasing olefin selectivity."
[14] "The correct understanding of dehydrogenation mechanism is of great significance to the design and development of both catalyst and reactor."
[15] "Shortening the mean residence time of oil vapor in the catalyst bed of the reactor is the most effective measure to improve the selectivity to olefins."

1. The commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These catalysts show good activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation. The process of converting ethane to ethylene is not commercially viable because the steam cracker is more efficient at higher temperatures. For propane dehydrogenation, operating at around 600 degrees Celsius is more feasible due to the high energy consumption of the process. In the OleflexTM process, controlling the coking rate and adjusting the time between regenerations is achieved by adjusting the hydrogen input. To increase propane conversion, three measures can be taken: increasing temperature, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, and lowering hydrogen partial pressure. Lowering hydrogen partial pressure shifts the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation. Slowing down coke formation and extending the time between regenerations are crucial for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies. The coking resistance of the catalyst can be improved to prolong the time between regenerations. Slowing down coke formation and extending the time between regenerations are critical for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies. Introducing hydrogen or steam can also help extend the time between regenerations. The introduction of phosphorus in the NiP catalyst affects its dehydrogenation performance. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the selectivity to isobutylene exceeds 60% over the Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst. Solving the Pt sintering problem is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts compared to dehydrogenation catalysts.

1. 商业过程OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂进行轻烷烃的脱氢。这些催化剂在脱氢反应中显示出良好的活性和选择性。将乙烷转化为乙烯的过程在商业上不可行，因为蒸汽裂解器在较高温度下具有更高的转化率。对于丙烷脱氢，大约600度的操作是可行的，因为该过程的能量消耗很高。在OleflexTM过程中，通过调整氢气输入来控制焦化速率并调整再生周期。为了提高丙烷转化率，可以采取三种措施：提高温度、降低烃类分压以及降低氢气分压。降低氢气分压使脱氢平衡向右移动。减缓焦化速率并延长再生周期对改善轻烷烃脱氢技术至关重要。可以通过改进催化剂来提高其抗结焦性能以延长再生周期。减缓焦化速率并延长再生周期是改善轻烷烃脱氢技术的关键。引入氢气或蒸汽也可以帮助延长再生周期。在NiP催化剂中引入磷会影响其脱氢性能。对于异丁烷脱氢，Ni2P/SiO2催化剂的异丁烯选择性超过60%。解决汽车排气催化剂中的Pt烧结问题比解决脱氢催化剂中的问题更为紧迫。

<p>Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines.</p>
<p>In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China,it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo-dynamic equilibrium. If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken. In this regard, oxidative dehydrogenation has attracted more and more attention.</p>
<p>Between 500 1C and 700 1C, the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes increases nearly linearly with temperature (Fig. 1a); the accepted upper limit of temperature for PDH,however, may be about 630 1C. Exceeding the limit will cause severe side reactions including thermal cracking and coking. Hence, operating at around 600 1C seems to be more feasible.</p>
<p>For isobutane dehydrogenation, the temperature can be a little lower. As shown in Fig. 1b, the equilibrium conversion drops exponentially with pressure. Reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons is very effective for increasing the conversion.</p>

<p>The dehydrogenation of light alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Many metal complexes, such as Ir, Rh, Ru and Ti, are active for the dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes in the presence or absence of a H2 acceptor.</p>
<p>In the OleflexTM process, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied. Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot. Moreover, there are many reports on the improvement of traditional supported CrOx catalysts.</p>

<p>To improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, researchers have introduced second metals to form alloys with Pt. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, anchoring them on the surface of the carriers. This makes the particles not easy to migrate and coalesce.</p>
<p>To improve the time between regenerations, researchers have optimized the reaction conditions. Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation.

<p>Some metals, such as Sn, In, Zn, Ga, and Cu, have been added to Pt catalysts as promoters.

<p>The commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity, and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, the rapid deactivation and loss of active components limit their application to some extent. Effective protective measures should be taken to keep workers away from the harmful effect of the catalyst.</p>
<p>It is known that alkane dehydrogenation is a very fast reaction, and the conversion can approach the thermodynamic equilibrium within 1 s. It is likely that the two hydrogen atoms bonded with adjacent carbon atoms of the alkane molecule collide with the active site at the same time, leading to the formation of a mono-olefin.</p>
<p>In the fixed-bed CatofinTM process, the shallow catalyst-bed is applied to reduce pressure drop, leading to a decreased energy consumption. Prior to entering the reactors, the feed is vaporized and then heated to about 600 °C by heat-exchange with a hot effluent and heating in the furnace.</p>
<p>The OleflexTM process uses a continuous moving-bed reaction/regeneration system with PtSn/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The four reactors are operated adiabatically, and the heat required for the reaction is mainly provided by heating the feed to the temperature of 610-650 °C before entering the reactor.</p>
<p>The ADHO process uses a low backmixing co-current circulating fluidized-bed reaction/regeneration system. The WO3-containing catalyst, highly active and selective, has been applied in the ADHO process.</p>
