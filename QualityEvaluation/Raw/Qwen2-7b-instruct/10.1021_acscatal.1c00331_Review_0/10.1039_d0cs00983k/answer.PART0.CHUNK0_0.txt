[1] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[2] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
[3] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
[5] "The origin of the permanent deactivation is the sintering of Pt particles."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560630 1C."
[7] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
[8] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
[9] "For propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalyst, the highest yield and selectivity to propylene is obtained from Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3 (0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn)."
[10] "Adding Sn reduces the energy barriers of olefin desorption and simultaneously increases the activation energy for deep dehydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to olefins is improved markedly."
[11] "In order to inhibit deep dehydrogenation and CC bond breaking of alkanes, the strong interaction between Ni and formed alkenes should be weakened."
[12] "The addition of B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst can further enhance the dispersion of vanadium species and improve the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to olefins."
[13] "For a Sn-based catalyst, the low-melting-point of Sn results in a longer distance between liquid Sn atoms under the reaction temperature, inhibiting the adsorption of more than one pair of hydrogen atoms and increasing olefin selectivity."
[14] "The correct understanding of dehydrogenation mechanism is of great significance to the design and development of both catalyst and reactor."
[15] "Shortening the mean residence time of oil vapor in the catalyst bed of the reactor is the most effective measure to improve the selectivity to olefins."

1. The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is an endothermic process, limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Three measures can increase propane conversion: increasing temperature, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, and lowering H2 partial pressure.

2. Slowing down coke formation and extending regeneration intervals is crucial for light alkane dehydrogenation technology improvement.

3. The permanent deactivation of catalysts is primarily due to particle sintering.

4. Propane dehydrogenation typically occurs between 560 and 630°C.

5. Coking rate is influenced by H2, H2O, hydrocarbon partial pressure, space-time, and vapor linear velocity.

6. Slowing coke formation and extending regeneration intervals are essential for light alkane dehydrogenation.

7. The Pt catalyst composition has a significant impact on regeneration intervals.

8. Sintering of Pt particles causes permanent deactivation.

9. Pt0.5Sn0.75/Al2O3 yields the highest propylene yield and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

10. Adding Sn reduces olefin desorption barriers, increases activation energy for deep dehydrogenation, and markedly improves olefin selectivity.

11. To prevent alkane deep dehydrogenation, the interaction between Ni and alkenes should be weakened.

12. Adding B to the V-MCM-41 catalyst enhances vanadium dispersion and dehydrogenation performance.

13. The low melting point of Sn in a catalyst creates a longer distance between liquid Sn atoms, inhibiting multiple hydrogen pairs from adsorbing and boosting olefin selectivity.

14. Understanding the dehydrogenation mechanism aids in catalyst and reactor design.

15. Shortening oil vapor residence time in the catalyst bed maximizes olefin selectivity.
