[1] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
[2] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
[3] "The high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment- friendly catalysts."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560630 1C. If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed by the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed, and then the temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds."
[5] "The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is also affected by the introduced P content. For isobutane dehydrogenation over the NiP/SiO2 catalyst, with the increase of P loading amount, various NiP compounds (Ni3P, Ni12P5, Ni2P) are formed on the catalyst surface, leading to different dehydrogenation performances."

1. Dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and hydrogen is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Commercial processes like OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. The high cost of platinum and environmental concerns have prompted researchers to develop cheaper and more environmentally friendly catalysts with improved coking and sintering resistance.

2. Light alkanes are typically dehydrogenated in a temperature range of 560 to 630 degrees Celsius. Adiabatic operation supplies heat through preheating the feed, ensuring the feed's temperature exceeds the highest catalyst bed temperature.

3. The performance of catalysts like NiP is influenced by the phosphorus content. For instance, with an increase in phosphorus loading for isobutane dehydrogenation, various compounds like Ni3P, Ni12P5, and Ni2P form on the catalyst surface, affecting the dehydrogenation performance.

1. 烷烃脱氢生成烯烃和氢是吸热的，并且单次转化受到热力学平衡的限制。商业过程如OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4使用支持型PtSn或CrOx催化剂。铂的高昂成本和环境问题促使研究人员开发更便宜和更环保的催化剂，以提高其结焦和烧结抵抗力。

2. 轻烷烃通常在560至630摄氏度的温度范围内进行脱氢。在绝热操作中，通过预热进料来提供热量，确保进料温度高于催化剂床的最高温度。

3. 催化剂如NiP的性能受磷含量的影响。例如，在异丁烷脱氢过程中，随着磷加载量的增加，在催化剂表面形成各种化合物，如Ni3P、Ni12P5和Ni2P，这影响了脱氢性能。
