<p>Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of light alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Many metal complexes, such as Ir, Rh, Ru and Ti, are active for the dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes in the presence or absence of a H2 acceptor.</p>
<p>In the OleflexTM process, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied. Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot. Moreover, there are many reports on the improvement of traditional supported CrOx catalysts.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560-630 °C. If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed by the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed, and then the temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds.</p>
<p>To improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, researchers have introduced second metals to form alloys with Pt. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, anchoring them on the surface of the carriers. This makes the particles not easy to migrate and coalesce.</p>
<p>To improve the time between regenerations, researchers have optimized the reaction conditions. Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to competitive adsorption.</p>
<p>Some metals, such as Sn, In, Zn, Ga, and Cu, have been added to Pt catalysts as promoters. These metals can improve the dispersion of Pt, reduce coke formation, and increase the selectivity to olefins. However, the high price and high loading amount of Ga2O3 limit its application to some extent.</p>
<p>The commercial Pt and CrOx-based catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity, and stability for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, the rapid deactivation and loss of active components limit their application to some extent. Effective protective measures should be taken to keep workers away from the harmful effect of the catalyst.</p>
<p>It is known that alkane dehydrogenation is a very fast reaction, and the conversion can approach the thermodynamic equilibrium within 1 s. It is likely that the two hydrogen atoms bonded with adjacent carbon atoms of the alkane molecule collide with the active site at the same time, leading to the formation of a mono-olefin.</p>
<p>In the fixed-bed CatofinTM process, the shallow catalyst-bed is applied to reduce pressure drop, leading to a decreased energy consumption. Prior to entering the reactors, the feed is vaporized and then heated to about 600 °C by heat-exchange with a hot effluent and heating in the furnace.</p>
<p>The OleflexTM process uses a continuous moving-bed reaction/regeneration system with PtSn/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The four reactors are operated adiabatically, and the heat required for the reaction is mainly provided by heating the feed to the temperature of 610-650 °C before entering the reactor.</p>
<p>The ADHO process uses a low backmixing co-current circulating fluidized-bed reaction/regeneration system. The WO3-containing catalyst, highly active and selective, has been applied in the ADHO process.</p>
