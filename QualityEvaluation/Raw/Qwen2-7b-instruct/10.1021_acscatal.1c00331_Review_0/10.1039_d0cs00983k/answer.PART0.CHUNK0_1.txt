1. The commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These catalysts show good activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation. The process of converting ethane to ethylene is not commercially viable because the steam cracker is more efficient at higher temperatures. For propane dehydrogenation, operating at around 600 degrees Celsius is more feasible due to the high energy consumption of the process. In the OleflexTM process, controlling the coking rate and adjusting the time between regenerations is achieved by adjusting the hydrogen input. To increase propane conversion, three measures can be taken: increasing temperature, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, and lowering hydrogen partial pressure. Lowering hydrogen partial pressure shifts the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation. Slowing down coke formation and extending the time between regenerations are crucial for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies. The coking resistance of the catalyst can be improved to prolong the time between regenerations. Slowing down coke formation and extending the time between regenerations are critical for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies. Introducing hydrogen or steam can also help extend the time between regenerations. The introduction of phosphorus in the NiP catalyst affects its dehydrogenation performance. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the selectivity to isobutylene exceeds 60% over the Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst. Solving the Pt sintering problem is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts compared to dehydrogenation catalysts.

1. 商业过程OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂进行轻烷烃的脱氢。这些催化剂在脱氢反应中显示出良好的活性和选择性。将乙烷转化为乙烯的过程在商业上不可行，因为蒸汽裂解器在较高温度下具有更高的转化率。对于丙烷脱氢，大约600度的操作是可行的，因为该过程的能量消耗很高。在OleflexTM过程中，通过调整氢气输入来控制焦化速率并调整再生周期。为了提高丙烷转化率，可以采取三种措施：提高温度、降低烃类分压以及降低氢气分压。降低氢气分压使脱氢平衡向右移动。减缓焦化速率并延长再生周期对改善轻烷烃脱氢技术至关重要。可以通过改进催化剂来提高其抗结焦性能以延长再生周期。减缓焦化速率并延长再生周期是改善轻烷烃脱氢技术的关键。引入氢气或蒸汽也可以帮助延长再生周期。在NiP催化剂中引入磷会影响其脱氢性能。对于异丁烷脱氢，Ni2P/SiO2催化剂的异丁烯选择性超过60%。解决汽车排气催化剂中的Pt烧结问题比解决脱氢催化剂中的问题更为紧迫。
