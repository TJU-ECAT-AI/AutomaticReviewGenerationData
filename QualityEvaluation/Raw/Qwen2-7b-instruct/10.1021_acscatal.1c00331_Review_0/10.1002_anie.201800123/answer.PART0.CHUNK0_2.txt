[1] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."
[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[5] "Many density-functional theory (DFT) studies have focused on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and found that the surface oxygen atom was the active site for the ODH reaction."
[6] "However, very few studies are concerned with the detailed structure of the surface VOx species under the reaction conditions."
[7] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[8] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."
[9] "The existence of hydroxyl groups blocks the exposed V ion and thus enhances C3H6 desorption and prevents coke formation, resulting in higher stability of the catalyst."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the hydrogen bonds in propane molecules, converting them into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing coke formation to maintain process efficiency and catalyst regeneration.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the available active sites for the reaction, leading to decreased productivity and increased energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include adjusting the operating conditions, modifying the catalyst composition, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

1. PDH通过断裂丙烷分子中的氢键，将它们转化为丙烯和氢，从而实现丙烯生产。关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理焦炭形成以维持过程效率和催化剂再生。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响了过程效率，因为它减少了可用于反应的有效活性位点，导致产量降低和再生过程中能耗增加。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括调整操作条件、修改催化剂组成以及实施先进的再生技术。
