[1] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."
[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[5] "Many density-functional theory (DFT) studies have focused on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and found that the surface oxygen atom was the active site for the ODH reaction."
[6] "For the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, the active sites and surface structure of the VOx species under reductive reaction conditions still remain elusive."
[7] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[8] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[9] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments."
[10] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[11] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

1. Propylene production through PDH is commercially attractive due to the low cost of propane. Industrial PDH catalysts, like supported vanadium, offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance compared to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts.
2. The surface structure of supported vanadium catalysts under PDH conditions is not well understood, especially concerning the active sites. Hydroxyl groups play a crucial role in the catalytic performance and stability of PDH reactions.
3. DFT studies have identified the surface oxygen atom as the active site for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the active sites and surface structure for non-oxidative PDH remain elusive.
4. Hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts improve stability and reduce coke formation during PDH reactions.
5. Hydroxyl groups are produced during H2 pre-reduction and are connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst.
6. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the VOx catalyst significantly impacts its catalytic performance in PDH reactions.
7. In situ DRIFTS experiments are used to characterize the surface structure and properties of the catalyst under PDH conditions.
8. The relative intensity of the hydroxyl group band is used to quantitatively describe the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the VOx species.
9. Coke deposition is the primary reason for catalyst deactivation in vanadium-based catalysts.

1. 炔烃通过PDH生产丙烯具有商业吸引力，主要是因为丙烷的成本较低。工业PDH催化剂，如支持型钒，与铂基和CrOx基催化剂相比，在活性、丙烯选择性和再生性能方面具有显著优势。
2. 钒基催化剂在PDH条件下的表面结构理解尚不充分，特别是在非氧化性PDH反应中，关于活性位点和表面结构的知识仍然匮乏。羟基团在催化性能和稳定性方面起着关键作用。
3. DFT研究已将表面氧原子识别为氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。然而，在非氧化性PDH反应中，活性位点和表面结构仍然是未知的。
4. 在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上，羟基团的存在提高了稳定性并减少了焦炭形成。
5. 在H2预处理期间生成的羟基团与催化剂上的VOH物种浓度有关。
6. 表面羟基团的存在对VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能有显著影响。
7. 在线DRIFTS实验用于表征催化剂在PDH条件下的表面结构和性质。
8. 相对于VOx物种的羟基团带的相对强度被用来定量描述羟基团的浓度。
9. 焦炭沉积是钒基催化剂失活的主要原因。
