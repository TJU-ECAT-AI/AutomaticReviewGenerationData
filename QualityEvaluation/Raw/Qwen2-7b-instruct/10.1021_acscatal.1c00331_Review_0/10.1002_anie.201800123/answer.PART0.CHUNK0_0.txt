[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."
[2] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[3] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[4] "However, unlike Pt-based catalysts, the nature of the active site and surface structure of the supported vanadium catalysts under reductive reaction conditions still remain elusive."
[5] "The catalytic performance, including initial activity and relative deactivation rate, are connected with the relative intensity of VOH band which represents the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[6] "Therefore, the hydroxyl groups on the supported VOx catalysts are strongly connected with the intrinsic activity for PDH reaction and coke formation."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through the conversion of propane to propene. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency due to its toxicity and inability to regenerate efficiently. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve adjusting reaction conditions, utilizing alternative catalyst types like supported vanadium, and controlling the surface structure and hydroxyl group coverage of catalysts. The hydroxyl groups on supported vanadium catalysts influence PDH activity and coke formation, leading to better stability and lower coke deposition rates.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯进行催化。PDH的关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，因为它具有毒性且难以再生。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括调整反应条件、使用替代催化剂如支持型钒催化剂以及控制催化剂表面结构和羟基覆盖率。支持型钒催化剂上的羟基团影响PDH活性和焦炭形成，导致更好的稳定性并降低焦炭沉积率。
