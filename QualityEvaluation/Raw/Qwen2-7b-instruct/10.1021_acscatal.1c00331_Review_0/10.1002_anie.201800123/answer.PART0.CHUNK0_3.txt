Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is utilized as a method for propene production, particularly when the price of propane is low due to the growing production of shale gas. Industrial PDH catalysts often feature vanadium because of its high activity, suitable propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration capability. Contrary to Pt-based catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, vanadium catalysts offer a more cost-effective alternative. Density-functional theory (DFT) studies have primarily focused on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation, identifying the surface oxygen atom as the active site. However, the active sites and surface structure of VOx species under reductive reaction conditions for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation remain unclear. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of vanadium catalysts improves stability by preventing coke formation. These groups block exposed vanadium ions, enhancing the desorption of C3H6 and reducing coke deposition.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly reduce process efficiency by blocking reaction pathways and decreasing catalyst activity. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies such as controlling the reaction conditions, optimizing catalyst composition, and implementing effective cleaning procedures are employed. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of vanadium catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing stability by blocking exposed vanadium ions, thereby promoting propene production and reducing coke formation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，尤其是在丙烷价格较低的情况下，由于页岩气产量的增加。工业PDH催化剂通常采用钒，因为其活性高、丙烯选择性适中以及出色的再生性能。与价格高昂且有毒的铂基催化剂相比，钒催化剂提供了成本效益更高的替代方案。密度泛函理论（DFT）研究主要集中在氧化脱氢作用下支持的VOx催化剂的表面结构上，发现表面氧原子是该反应的活性位点。然而，在还原反应条件下非氧化性丙烷脱氢的活性位点和表面结构仍然未知。表面含有的羟基团能够改善催化剂稳定性，防止积碳形成。这些团块阻止暴露的钒离子，增强丙烷的脱氢并减少积碳沉积。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成会显著降低过程效率，因为它会阻塞反应路径并降低催化剂活性。为了减少积碳形成并提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取控制反应条件、优化催化剂组成以及实施有效的清洁程序等策略。表面含有的羟基团在提高稳定性方面起着关键作用，通过阻止暴露的钒离子，促进丙烯生成并减少积碳形成。
