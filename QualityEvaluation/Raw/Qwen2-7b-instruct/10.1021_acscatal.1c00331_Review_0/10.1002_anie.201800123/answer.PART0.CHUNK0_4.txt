1. Propylene production is typically achieved through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes involving naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. However, the rising production of shale gas and the affordable cost of propane have made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) a more economically viable method for propylene production. Industrial PDH catalysts often face challenges due to the high costs and toxicity of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. Supported vanadium catalysts offer an alternative solution because they exhibit significant activity, appropriate propylene selectivity, and outstanding regeneration capabilities.

2. The surface structure of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to study the evolution of hydroxyl groups under an H2 atmosphere. It was discovered that the catalytic performance, including initial activity and stability, of the 6V catalyst is directly related to the concentration of VOH species, which is influenced by the duration of H2 pretreatment.

3. Catalysts with lower initial activity tend to deactivate more slowly. The visible Raman spectra revealed that the catalysts primarily consist of two-dimensional VOx species, such as monovanadates and polyvanadates, rather than V2O5 nanoparticles.

4. The band at 1021 cm-1 in the UV Raman spectrum is attributed to the V=O bond of the surface VOx species. 

5. An HD exchange experiment was conducted on a pure γ-Al2O3 sample to differentiate between hydroxyl groups on the VOx species and those on the support.

6. Previous research has indicated that the primary cause of vanadium catalyst deactivation is coke deposition.

7. The XPS profile demonstrated that the vanadium is a combination of V5+, V4+, and V3+ after reduction, with the latter state being prevalent in the fresh catalyst.

1. 丙烯生产通常通过蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解（FCC）过程实现，涉及石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品。然而，随着页岩气产量的增加和丙烷价格的降低，丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程已成为更经济的丙烯生产方法。工业PDH催化剂经常面临Pt-和CrOx基催化剂高昂成本和高度毒性的问题。支持的钒催化剂因其显著的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和卓越的再生性能而成为替代方案。

2. 通过原位漫反射红外傅立叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）研究了VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂表面结构在H2气氛下的演变过程，以研究羟基团的形成。发现6V催化剂的催化性能，包括初始活性和稳定性，与VOH物种的浓度紧密相关，该浓度受H2预处理时间的影响。

3. 初始活性较低的催化剂会更缓慢地失活。可见拉曼光谱显示，催化剂主要由二维VOx物种组成，如单钒酸盐和多钒酸盐，而不是V2O5纳米粒子。

4. UV拉曼光谱中的1021 cm-1带归因于表面VOx物种的V=O键。

5. 对纯γ-Al2O3样品进行了HD交换实验，以区分VOx物种上的羟基团和支持上的羟基团。

6. 以往的研究表明，钒催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积。

7. XPS光谱显示，还原后，钒是V5+、V4+和V3+的混合物，其中V3+状态在新鲜催化剂中占主导地位。
