1. Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxygen involvement. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and assessing their applicability in industrial settings. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts affects process efficiency by reducing catalytic activity and increasing energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration include controlling temperature, designing more efficient catalysts, and adjusting operational parameters.
