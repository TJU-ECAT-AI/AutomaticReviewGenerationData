1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a chemical reaction facilitated by a catalyst. Key considerations for this process include maintaining optimal temperature, pressure levels, and using a suitable catalyst. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can negatively affect the process efficiency by decreasing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. To mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration, strategies such as adjusting reaction conditions, employing alternative catalyst materials, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques can be implemented.
