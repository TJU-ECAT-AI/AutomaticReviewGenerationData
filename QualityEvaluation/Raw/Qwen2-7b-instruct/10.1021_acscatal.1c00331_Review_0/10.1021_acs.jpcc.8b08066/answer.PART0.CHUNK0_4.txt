1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene without oxygen, potentially offering an efficient alternative for propene synthesis. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve optimizing temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types, particularly iron-based catalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are crucial for achieving high yields and selectivity of propene. Industrial applications of PDH require careful management of these factors to ensure economic viability and environmental sustainability.

2. Coke formation on platinum (Pt)-based catalysts during PDH impacts the process efficiency by reducing activity and selectivity. This occurs because coke, a carbonaceous deposit, covers the catalyst surface, hindering the reaction. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include catalyst regeneration techniques, controlling the reaction temperature to prevent excessive carbon deposition, and the use of promoter metals that can enhance the catalyst's resistance to coke buildup. These measures aim to maintain high productivity and prolong the catalyst's operational life.

1. 烯丙非氧化脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯，提供了一种生产丙烯的方法，潜在地为丙烯合成提供了有效途径。PDH反应的关键考虑因素包括优化温度、压力以及合适的催化剂存在。尤其是基于金属有机框架（MOFs）的铁基催化剂对于实现丙烯高产率和选择性至关重要。工业应用要求对这些因素进行精细管理，以确保经济可行性及环境可持续性。

2. 铂（Pt）基催化剂在PDH过程中形成的焦炭会降低效率，因为焦炭作为碳沉积物覆盖催化剂表面，阻碍了反应。通过催化剂再生技术、控制反应温度以防止过量碳沉积以及使用增强催化剂抗焦炭积聚能力的促进剂金属等策略，可以缓解焦炭形成并提高催化剂性能。这些措施旨在维持高生产力并延长催化剂的使用寿命。
