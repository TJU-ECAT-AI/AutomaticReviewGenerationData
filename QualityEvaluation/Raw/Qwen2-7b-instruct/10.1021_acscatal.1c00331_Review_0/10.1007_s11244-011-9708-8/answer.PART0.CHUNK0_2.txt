[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years."
[2] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene."

Propane dehydrogenation serves as a method for propene production, and the process efficiency can be significantly impacted by coke formation on Pt-based catalysts. Coke formation is crucial for catalyst regeneration and productivity. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst efficiency, researchers have focused on modifying the Pt catalyst with substances like tin (Sn) or alkali metals. The formation rate of coke is influenced by various operating conditions, including the temperature and the composition of the gas mixture. For instance, the rate of coke formation on the Pt catalyst surface increases with the propane pressure but remains largely unaffected by hydrogen and propylene pressures. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation enables the optimization of reaction conditions to control the rate of coke formation, thereby enhancing propylene productivity. Additionally, rational catalyst design can aim to reduce coke formation while preserving the catalyst's activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

丙烷脱氢作为丙烯生产的工艺，其效率受到铂基催化剂上焦炭形成的影响。焦炭的形成对于催化剂再生和产率至关重要。为了减轻焦炭形成并提高催化剂效率，研究人员已经关注于通过添加如锡（Sn）或碱金属等物质来修改铂催化剂。焦炭形成的速率受到多种操作条件的影响，包括温度和气体混合物的组成。例如，随着丙烷压力的增加，催化剂表面的焦炭形成速率会增加，但氢气和丙烯的压力对其影响不大。理解焦炭形成机制使我们能够优化反应条件以控制焦炭形成速率，从而增强丙烯的产率。此外，合理的催化剂设计可以旨在减少焦炭形成同时保持催化剂在脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。
