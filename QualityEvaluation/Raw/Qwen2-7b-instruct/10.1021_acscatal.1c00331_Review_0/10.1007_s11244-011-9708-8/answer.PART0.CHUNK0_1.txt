[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years."
[2] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
[5] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation. Studies on the influences of reaction conditions on the rate of coke formation and the nature of the coke deposited on different sites are essential for the understanding of the mechanism of coke formation as well as the mechanism of catalyst deactivation."
[6] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene."
[7] "Coke formation on the support mainly involves polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, hydride transfer, etc. Referring to the mechanism proposed by Caeiro et al. [39], coke formation on the support can be divided into two stages, i.e., the conversion of propane to olefins (propylene and ethylene) by protolysis and transformation of these olefins to aromatic hydrocarbons."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the C-H bonds in propane to produce propene and hydrogen. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the selection of appropriate catalyst types, the control of temperature and pressure, and the optimization of the feedstock composition. Industrial applications involve the use of PDH processes to efficiently convert propane into propene, which is a critical component in the petrochemical industry for the production of various downstream products such as plastics and solvents.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing deactivation of the catalysts, reducing their activity and selectivity over time. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include modifying the catalyst with other metals like tin (Sn) or alkali metals, using catalyst supports with weak acidity to suppress propylene adsorption and polymerization, and optimizing the reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure to control the rate of coke formation. Additionally, understanding the mechanism of coke formation allows for the optimization of the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity.

3. The mechanism of coke formation during PDH has been studied extensively, focusing on the reduction of coking rates through catalyst modifications. Researchers have targeted to reduce coke formation by altering the Pt catalyst with metals such as tin or alkali metals, and by utilizing different catalyst supports with weaker acidity. The formation of coke is influenced by operating conditions, including the gas composition, temperature, and pressure. Studies suggest that only a small portion of the coke formed is responsible for catalyst deactivation, while the majority is formed independently of the gas composition but dependent on temperature.

4. The rate of coke formation varies depending on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. (2011) found that a significant portion of the coke formed is not responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that the formation of coke is largely dependent on temperature rather than gas composition. The coke can form on either the support or the metal surface, and the nature of the coke deposited on these different sites affects catalyst deactivation differently. Understanding the influence of reaction conditions on the rate of coke formation and the characteristics of the coke deposited on different sites is crucial for elucidating the mechanism of coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

5. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced by the propane pressure, with an apparent reaction order of approximately 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene. On the other hand, the rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propylene and propane pressures, while it decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The coke formation mechanism on the support involves the conversion of propane to olefins via protolysis, followed by the transformation of these olefins into aromatic hydrocarbons through polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions. This mechanism explains how the partial pressures of different gases affect the formation of coke on the support during the PDH process.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化过程通过断裂丙烷中的C-H键来生产丙烯，从而实现丙烯的生产。在工业应用中，PDH过程用于高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，丙烯是聚乙烯、聚丙烯等下游产品的关键原料。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低催化剂的活性和选择性，影响PDH过程的效率。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的方法包括对催化剂进行修改，例如添加锡（Sn）或碱金属，以及使用具有较弱酸性的载体来抑制丙烯吸附和聚合。通过优化反应条件，如温度、压力和进料组成，控制焦炭形成速率，可以提高丙烯生产力。理解焦炭形成机制有助于优化反应条件，减少脱氢和再生周期的频率。

3. 大量研究聚焦于通过催化剂修改降低焦炭形成速率，以减少PDH过程中催化剂的失活。研究人员通过添加金属如锡或碱金属，以及使用具有较弱酸性的不同载体来抑制丙烯吸附和聚合，来降低焦炭形成。焦炭形成受到操作条件的影响，包括气体组成、温度和压力。研究表明，只有部分形成的焦炭对催化剂失活负责，而大部分焦炭的形成主要依赖于温度而不是气体组成。

4. 不同的操作条件会影响焦炭形成的速率。Larsson等人（2011）发现，大部分形成的焦炭不是导致催化剂失活的原因，并且焦炭的形成主要依赖于温度而不是气体组成。焦炭可以在催化剂表面的不同位置形成，焦炭沉积在这些不同位置对催化剂失活的影响不同。了解反应条件对焦炭形成速率和不同位置沉积的焦炭特性的影响对于解释焦炭形成和催化剂失活机制至关重要。

5. 金属表面上的焦炭形成速率受丙烷压力影响，其显着的反应顺序约为1.7与丙烷有关，而与氢气和丙烯无关。另一方面，支持面上的焦炭形成速率随丙烯和丙烷压力增加而增加，而随氢气压力减小而减少。支持面上的焦炭形成机制涉及丙烷通过原位裂解转化为烯烃，随后烯烃通过聚合、缩合、环化和氢转移反应转化为芳香烃。这一机制解释了不同气体分压如何影响支持面上PDH过程中焦炭的形成。
