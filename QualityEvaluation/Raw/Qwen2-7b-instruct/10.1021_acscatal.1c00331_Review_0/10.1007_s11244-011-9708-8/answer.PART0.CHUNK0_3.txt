[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years."
[2] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
[3] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
[4] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[6] "A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support. In addition, the propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is a commercialized process used for propylene production. It plays a significant role in the global supply of propylene.
2. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to minimize the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby enhancing propylene productivity. It also aids in designing catalysts that reduce coke formation while preserving dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
3. Coke formation rate is highly sensitive to operational conditions.
4. Coke can form on both the catalyst support and the metal surface, with different implications for catalyst deactivation depending on its location.
5. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced by propane pressure but not by propylene or hydrogen pressures. Conversely, the rate on the support surface is affected by both propylene and propane pressures, and decreases with hydrogen pressure.
6. Coke formation on the support occurs via migration of precursor from the metal surface, as well as direct adsorption of propylene from the gas phase, leading to reactions involving polymerization, condensation, and cyclization.
