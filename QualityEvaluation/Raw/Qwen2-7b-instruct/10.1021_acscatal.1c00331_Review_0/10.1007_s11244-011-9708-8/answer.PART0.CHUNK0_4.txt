1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene. Key considerations in PDH include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst, necessitating frequent regeneration cycles. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include modifying catalysts, using supports with weak acidity, and adjusting gas compositions to reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles.

2. The formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation is influenced by various factors, including the type of catalyst, the composition of the gas mixture, and the operating conditions. Coke can form on either the metal or the support of the catalyst, with implications for the catalyst's deactivation. Controlling the rate of coke formation through adjustments to reaction conditions can enhance propylene productivity.

3. Researchers have studied the mechanism of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operational parameters such as the pressures of propylene and hydrogen, as well as the concentration of propane. Understanding these relationships allows for the optimization of conditions to minimize coke formation.

4. The coke formed on the metal surface of the catalyst is less dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with the propane pressure. Conversely, the coke formed on the support increases with the propane and propylene pressures but decreases with the hydrogen pressure.

5. A kinetic mechanism has been proposed to explain the process of coke formation. This mechanism identifies the dimerization of adsorbed propane (C3H6) as the key step leading to coke formation on the metal surface of the Pt catalyst. Propylene in the gas phase can also contribute to coke formation through polymerization, oligomerization, condensation, and cyclization reactions on the support.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化法用于丙烯生产，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理工业应用。在Pt基催化剂上形成的焦炭会降低过程效率，导致催化剂活性下降，需要频繁进行再生循环。为减少焦炭形成而采取的策略包括催化剂改性、使用酸性较弱的支持体以及调整气体组成以减少再生循环的频率。

2. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，焦炭的形成受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂类型、气体混合物组成和操作条件。焦炭可以在催化剂的金属或支持表面上形成，并对催化剂的失活产生影响。通过调整反应条件来控制焦炭形成率可以提高丙烯产量。

3. 已有多位研究者探讨了在丙烷脱氢过程中Pt基催化剂上焦炭形成的机制。焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作参数，如丙烯和氢的压力，以及丙烷的浓度。理解这些关系允许优化条件以减少焦炭形成。

4. 在Pt催化剂的金属表面形成的焦炭依赖于丙烯和氢的压力较小，但随着丙烷压力的增加而增加。相反，支持表面上形成的焦炭随丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，但随氢压力的降低而减少。

5. 提出了一个动力学机制来解释焦炭形成的过程。该机制确定了吸附的丙烷（C3H6）的二聚化作为导致Pt催化剂金属表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。在支持体上的丙烯也可以通过聚合、寡聚化、缩合和环化反应形成焦炭。
