          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years."
          [2] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity."
          [3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [5] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "Coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure."
          [7] "Coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

          The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, specifically targeting the conversion of propane into propene. This process is significant in contributing to the global propene supply, particularly after its commercial development in the 1980s. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles by controlling the rate of coke formation, thereby increasing propylene productivity. Researchers have studied coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, recognizing that the rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions, such as the pressures of propylene and hydrogen, as well as the concentration of propane. Coke can form on either the metal or the support of the catalyst, with different implications for catalyst deactivation. Controlling the rate of coke formation through adjustments to reaction conditions can minimize its negative impact on process efficiency.

          烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化法是丙烯生产的一种专门技术，自1980年代商业化以来，对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。理解焦炭形成机制对于优化反应条件至关重要，通过控制焦炭形成速率来减少脱氢和再生循环的频率，从而提高丙烯产量。研究者已经研究了在丙烷脱氢过程中Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成，认识到焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作条件，如丙烯和氢的压力，以及丙烷的浓度。焦炭可以在催化剂的金属或支持表面上形成，对催化剂失活产生不同的影响。通过调整反应条件来控制焦炭形成率可以最小化其对过程效率的负面影响。

          [8] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis."
          [9] "The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."
          [10] "In addition, the propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on."

      <English>
          A kinetic mechanism has been proposed to explain the process of coke formation. This mechanism identifies the dimerization of adsorbed propane (C3H6) as the key step leading to coke formation on the metal surface of the Pt catalyst. Propylene in the gas phase can also contribute to coke formation through polymerization, oligomerization, condensation, and cyclization reactions on the support.
