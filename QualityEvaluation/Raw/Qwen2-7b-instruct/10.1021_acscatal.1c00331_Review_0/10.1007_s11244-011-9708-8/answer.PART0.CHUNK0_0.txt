[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years."
[2] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
[5] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Studies on the influences of reaction conditions, especially gas compositions, during propane dehydrogenation are seldom reported."
[7] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."
[8] "A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, specifically targeting the conversion of propane into propene. This process is significant in contributing to the global propene supply, particularly after its commercial development in the 1980s.

2. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by leading to catalyst deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration cycles. To mitigate this issue and enhance propylene productivity, optimizing reaction conditions and controlling the rate of coke formation becomes crucial.

3. Numerous studies have focused on coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. The rate of coke formation is notably influenced by operational conditions.

4. Coke can form on either the support or the metal of the catalyst, with the type of coke having distinct effects on catalyst deactivation. However, research examining the influence of gas compositions on the reaction conditions during propane dehydrogenation is scarce.

5. A kinetic mechanism has been proposed to elucidate coke formation. The key step involves the reaction of two strong adsorbed C3H6*, produced through propane dehydrogenation, on the Pt surface.

6. A portion of the coke precursor migrates to the acid site, where it is involved in the coke formation process on the support, alongside the adsorbed propylene undergoing polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions.

3. 多项研究关注于丙烷脱氢过程中铂或改性铂催化剂上的焦炭形成。焦炭生成速率高度依赖于操作条件。

4. 焦炭可以在催化剂的支撑物或金属表面形成，并且不同位置形成的焦炭对催化剂失活有不同影响。然而，关于气体组成对反应条件在丙烷脱氢过程中的影响的研究相对较少。

5. 根据动力学分析，提出了焦炭形成的机制。关键步骤涉及由丙烷脱氢产生的两个强吸附的C3H6*在铂表面上的反应。

6. 部分焦炭前体迁移到酸位，在那里它参与了支持物上的焦炭形成过程，同时吸附的丙烯经历聚合、缩合、环化和氢转移等反应。
