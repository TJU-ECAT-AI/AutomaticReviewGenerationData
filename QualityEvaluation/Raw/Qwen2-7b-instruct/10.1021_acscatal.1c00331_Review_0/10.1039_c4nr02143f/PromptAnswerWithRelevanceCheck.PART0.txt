1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making this route more economically competitive. Key considerations involve reaction conditions requiring a high temperature to achieve high propene yields, catalyst types such as chromium- and platinum-based catalysts, and industrial applications focusing on efficient and sustainable production methods. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing active sites and causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include enhancing propylene selectivity, suppressing methane formation, and promoting propylene desorption.

2. The catalytic PDH process aims to efficiently convert propane into propene, a crucial building block for the production of various chemicals. The process faces challenges due to the endothermic nature and equilibrium limitations, necessitating high temperatures for optimal propene yields. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly affects process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst through coverage of the metal surface and reduction of active sites. To address this issue, strategies focus on enhancing propylene selectivity, inhibiting methane formation, and facilitating propylene desorption to maintain catalyst performance and extend its operational life.

### How does the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) function as a method for propene production, and what are the key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications?

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it more economically competitive. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. High reaction temperatures are needed thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene, as the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction. Industrially, Pt-based catalysts are commonly used, though they are limited by issues such as catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity. Promoters like Cu can enhance the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by inhibiting propylene adsorption and elevating the energy barrier of CC bond rupture, thus reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability.

### What strategies can be implemented to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration in PDH processes?

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration in PDH processes, strategies can include the use of promoters like Cu to inhibit propylene adsorption, thereby reducing the possibility of coke formation. By elevating the energy barrier of CC bond rupture, the effectiveness of cracking reactions is suppressed, minimizing the formation of lighter hydrocarbons and coke. Additionally, Cu addition can improve propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate, enhancing overall process efficiency. Optimizing the loading content of Cu to an optimal level (0.5 wt% in this case) can ensure the highest propylene selectivity and lowest deactivation rate, facilitating efficient catalyst regeneration.

### How does coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impact the process efficiency, and what strategies can be implemented to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration?

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering the metal surface and diminishing the active sites available for the dehydrogenation reaction. This leads to a decline in catalytic activity, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration, which can be costly and time-consuming. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using promoters like Cu, which can inhibit propylene adsorption and elevate the energy barrier for CC bond rupture. This reduces the likelihood of coke formation and enables more efficient cracking reactions, leading to lighter hydrocarbons rather than coke. Optimizing the Cu loading content to an optimal level ensures the highest propylene selectivity and lowest deactivation rate, facilitating efficient catalyst regeneration.

### How does the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation contribute to the improvement of PDH processes?

The promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation contributes to the improvement of PDH processes by enhancing propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate. Cu addition inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. This results in higher propylene selectivity and a lower deactivation rate, improving overall process efficiency and economic competitiveness. The optimized Cu loading content of 0.5 wt% leads to a propylene selectivity of 90.8% and a propylene yield of 36.5%, showcasing the effectiveness of Cu in enhancing the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts for PDH.

PDH方法通过将低成本饱和烃转化为价值增加的烯烃来实现烯烃的生产，从而使其更具经济竞争力。PDH过程的关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。由于丙烷脱氢是一个吸热且平衡限制的反应，因此需要较高的反应温度以获得高产率的丙烯。工业上常用的催化剂是铂基催化剂，尽管它们受到由焦炭形成导致的催化剂活性下降和丙烯选择性低的问题限制。Cu等促进剂可以增强铂催化剂的催化性能，通过抑制丙烯吸附并提高CC键断裂的能量壁垒，从而减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂稳定性。

### 实施哪些策略可以缓解PDH过程中焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生？

缓解PDH过程中焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括使用促进剂如Cu，以抑制丙烯吸附并提高CC键断裂的能量壁垒，从而减少焦炭形成的机会。这减少了较轻烃和焦炭的形成，提高了过程效率。Cu添加还可以提高丙烯的选择性和产量，同时降低催化剂失活率，从而增强整体过程效率。优化Cu负载量至最优水平（本例中的0.5 wt%），可确保最高丙烯选择性和最低失活率，促进高效催化剂再生。

### Pt基催化剂中焦炭形成的形成对过程效率有何影响，以及可以采取哪些策略缓解其形成并提高催化剂再生？

在Pt基催化剂中形成焦炭显著影响过程效率，因为它覆盖了金属表面并减少了可用于脱氢反应的有效位点。这导致催化活性下降，需要频繁进行催化剂再生，这既昂贵又耗时。缓解焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括使用促进剂如Cu，通过抑制丙烯吸附并提高CC键断裂的能量壁垒来缓解焦炭形成。这导致更有效的裂解反应产生较轻的烃而非焦炭，从而提高整体过程效率。优化Cu负载量至最优水平（0.5 wt%）可实现90.8%的丙烯选择性和36.5%的丙烯产率，这展示了Cu在增强Pt基催化剂PDH性能方面的有效性。

### Cu对Pt/Al2O3催化剂丙烷脱氢催化性能的促进作用如何改进PDH过程？

Cu对Pt/Al2O3催化剂丙烷脱氢催化性能的促进作用通过提高丙烯选择性和产量，同时降低催化剂失活率，改进PDH过程。Cu添加抑制丙烯吸附并提高CC键断裂的能量壁垒，最终减少焦炭形成的可能性并抑制向形成较轻烃的裂解反应。这导致更高的丙烯选择性和更低的失活率，从而提高整体过程效率和经济竞争力。优化的Cu负载含量为0.5 wt%，可实现90.8%的丙烯选择性和36.5%的丙烯产率，展示了Cu在增强PDH中铂基催化剂性能方面的有效提升。
