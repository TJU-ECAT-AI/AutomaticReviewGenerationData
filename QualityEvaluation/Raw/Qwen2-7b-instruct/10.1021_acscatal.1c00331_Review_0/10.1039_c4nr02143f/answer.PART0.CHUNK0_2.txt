1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production in the petrochemical industry, particularly for creating polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. The process is favored for its potential as a more economical alternative among commercialized methods. 

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively impacts PDH process efficiency by covering the metal surface and reducing active sites, causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include adding promoters to the catalyst, which can suppress its formation and improve catalyst regeneration.

3. Copper (Cu) acts as a promoter that enhances the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The PtCu interaction reduces propylene adsorption and raises the energy barrier for carbon-carbon (CC) bond rupture.

4. The PtCu interaction decreases methane formation, as indicated by the decreased methane selectivity. This occurs due to a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst.

5. The paper references a study published in Nanoscale in 2014, authored by Jinlong Gong and colleagues, which investigates the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 在石油化工行业中，丙烯是生产多种化学品的重要基础材料，例如聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和丙烯腈。丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程被认为是具有潜力的替代方法之一，特别在商业运行过程中。

2. 焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成对PDH过程的效率产生负面影响，因为它会覆盖金属表面并减少活性位点，导致催化剂失活。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括向催化剂中添加促进剂，这可以抑制其形成并改善催化剂再生。

3. 铜（Cu）作为促进剂，在丙烷脱氢用的铂/氧化铝催化剂中提高了催化性能。铂铜相互作用减少了丙烯吸附并提高了碳-碳（CC）键断裂的能量壁垒。

4. 通过铂铜相互作用，PDH催化剂上甲烷的生成量减少，表现为甲烷选择性的降低。这是因为需要更高的能量壁垒才能在铂铜/氧化铝催化剂上进行CC键断裂。

5. 论文引用了2014年发表在《纳米尺度》上的研究，作者为金龙龚及其同事，该研究探讨了铜在铂/氧化铝催化剂上提高丙烷脱氢催化性能的促进作用。
