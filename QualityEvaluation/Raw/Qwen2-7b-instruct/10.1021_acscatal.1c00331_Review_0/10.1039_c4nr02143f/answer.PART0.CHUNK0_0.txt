[1] "Propene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chemicals, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile."
[2] "The imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
[3] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives."
[4] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by covering the metal surface and diminishing the active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include enhancing propylene selectivity, suppressing methane formation, and promoting propylene desorption."
[7] "The primary origin of the enhancement upon Cu addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making this route more economically competitive. Key considerations involve reaction conditions requiring a high temperature to achieve high propene yields, catalyst types such as chromium- and platinum-based catalysts, and industrial applications focusing on efficient and sustainable production methods. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing active sites and causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include enhancing propylene selectivity, suppressing methane formation, and promoting propylene desorption.

2. The catalytic PDH process aims to efficiently convert propane into propene, a crucial building block for the production of various chemicals. The process faces challenges due to the endothermic nature and equilibrium limitations, necessitating high temperatures for optimal propene yields. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly affects process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst through coverage of the metal surface and reduction of active sites. To address this issue, strategies focus on enhancing propylene selectivity, inhibiting methane formation, and facilitating propylene desorption to maintain catalyst performance and extend its operational life.

1. 丙烯脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的重要方法，通过将低成本饱和烃转化为附加值较高的烯烃，使该途径在经济上更具竞争力。关键考虑因素包括需要高温以实现高丙烯产率的反应条件、催化剂类型如铬基和铂基催化剂以及工业应用重点在于高效和可持续的生产方法。丙烷脱氢过程中，铂基催化剂上的焦油形成会降低活性位点并导致催化剂失活，影响过程效率。为缓解焦油形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采取增强丙烯选择性、抑制甲烷生成以及促进丙烯脱附等策略。

2. 催化PDH过程旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是生产各种化学品的关键组成部分。由于该过程具有吸热性和平衡限制，需要高温才能达到理想的丙烯产率。铂基催化剂上的焦油形成显著影响过程效率，通过覆盖金属表面并减少活性位点来导致催化剂失活。为解决这一问题，策略集中在增强丙烯选择性、抑制甲烷生成以及促进丙烯脱附，以维持催化剂性能并延长其使用寿命。
