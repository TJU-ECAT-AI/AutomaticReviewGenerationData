[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem- icals, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni- trile."
[2] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
[3] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency, and what strategies can be implemented to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins. Key considerations include suitable reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The process requires high temperature due to its endothermic nature and is limited by equilibrium, making efficient catalysts essential. 

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly affects process efficiency by covering the metal surface, diminishing active sites, and leading to catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve optimizing catalyst composition, modifying reaction conditions, and enhancing catalyst design to reduce coke deposition and promote its desorption.

1. 丙烯是石化工业中生产各种化学品的重要组成部分，例如聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和丙烯腈。考虑的关键因素包括适当的反应条件、催化剂类型以及工业应用。由于其为吸热反应且受平衡限制，因此需要高效催化剂来确保高产率。 

2. 在铂基催化剂上形成的焦炭显著影响了工艺效率，通过覆盖金属表面，减少了活性位点并导致催化剂失活。缓解焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的方法包括优化催化剂组成、调整反应条件以及增强催化剂设计以减少焦炭沉积并促进其脱附。
