1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production due to its high efficiency and potential for scalability in industrial settings. Key considerations for PDH include optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and understanding their industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to decreased efficiency and increased operational costs. Strategies to mitigate this issue include employing temperature control, pressure optimization, and the strategic use of catalyst promoters to enhance stability and extend the life of the catalyst.

2. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts during the PDH process impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions and potentially altering the catalytic properties of the material. Strategies to mitigate this include adjusting operational parameters like temperature and pressure to prevent excessive coke buildup. Additionally, incorporating promoters into the catalyst formulation can help maintain its activity and reduce coke formation. These strategies aim to improve catalyst regeneration and prolong the catalyst's useful life.
