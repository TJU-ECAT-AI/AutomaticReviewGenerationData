1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for this process include temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of reactants. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts affects process efficiency by reducing the active surface area of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include operating under low-temperature conditions, using promoters, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through processes such as hydrogen treatment.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化直接法是丙烯生产的一种方法，通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气。此过程的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和反应物的摩尔比。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响工艺效率，因为碳沉积减少了催化剂的活性表面积。缓解焦炭形成策略包括在低温条件下操作、使用促进剂以及通过如氢处理等过程定期再生催化剂。
