PDH functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through direct dehydrogenation. Key considerations include ensuring optimal reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and considering industrial applications for practical implementation. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces their efficiency, leading to decreased productivity. To mitigate this issue and enhance catalyst regeneration, implementing strategies such as precise temperature control, utilizing support materials, and alloying the catalysts can be effective.
