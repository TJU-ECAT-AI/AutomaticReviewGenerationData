To produce propene through the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH), propane molecules undergo a thermal decomposition process, yielding propene and hydrogen. Important factors to consider for the reaction conditions are temperature, pressure, and the use of an appropriate catalyst. Coke formation on platinum-based catalysts affects process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst surface. To mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration, strategies include optimizing operational parameters like temperature and pressure, and utilizing catalyst supports.
