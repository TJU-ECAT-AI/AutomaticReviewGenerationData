[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."
[2] "Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CAH bonds in propane."
[3] "The activity in PDH could be tuned by changing crystallite size: the smaller the crystallite size, the higher the activity is."
[4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol−1."
[5] "As this amount correlates with the concentration of generated Zrcus sites, a correlation between the rate of propene formation and the concentration of removed oxygen species can exist if Zrcus is responsible for propane activation."

1. The PDH process efficiently produces propene, offering high selectivity. 

2. Two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) on the surface of ZrO2 are responsible for homolytic breaking of the CAH bond in propane.

3. Smaller crystallite sizes enhance the activity in PDH, indicating a positive correlation between crystallite size and activity.

4. The activation energy for propene formation is consistently around 150 kJ/mol, regardless of the ZrO2 sample tested.

5. The correlation between the rate of propene formation and the concentration of removed oxygen species indicates the involvement of Zrcus sites in propane activation.
