1. PDH serves as a method for propene production, offering high selectivity. It involves the direct dehydrogenation of propane, which can be carried out using catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3. Alternative catalysts, including ZrO2, have also been explored.

2. The primary industrial processes for propene production involve the Catofin and Oleflex processes. These utilize CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.

3. Beyond Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, other alternatives have been reported in the literature for alkane dehydrogenation, including materials based on ZnO, GaOx, VOx, isolated FeII, and CoII.

4. The experimental determination of activation energy (Ea) values for propene formation over differently structured ZrO2 materials indicates that regardless of the catalyst, Ea values are approximately 150 kJ/mol.

1. Propene is extensively utilized in manufacturing numerous everyday chemicals. Its demand and production are growing due to increased usage in downstream products. The global propene market is forecasted to reach 165 million tons by 2030 from 103 million in 2012. Traditionally, propene is produced through steam or fluid catalytic cracking, but these methods are insufficient to meet propene demand. Alternative technologies like metathesis, methanol-to-olefins, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), etc., have been developed to bridge the gap between demand and supply.

2. PDH is a significant process for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The activity and propene selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts can be tuned through the kind of crystal phase (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size.

3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration include adjusting reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and implementing effective catalyst handling protocols.

1. 丙烯被广泛用于制造大量日常化学品。其需求和生产正在增长，因为下游产品的使用量增加。到2030年，全球丙烯市场预计将从2012年的1030万吨增长至1650万吨。传统上，丙烯通过蒸汽或流化床催化裂解生产，但这些方法无法满足丙烯需求。开发了替代技术，如烷烃裂解、甲醇制烯烃、丙烷脱氢等，以缩小需求与供应之间的差距。

2. 丙烷脱氢（PDH）是大规模生产丙烯的过程，并且具有高的丙烯选择性。通过改变晶相（单斜相与四方相）和晶粒尺寸，可以调节ZrO2催化剂的活性和丙烯选择性。

3. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了过程效率。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括调整反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及实施有效的催化剂处理程序。

The global annual pro- pene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012. 

Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. 

PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. 

Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CAH bonds in propane. 

Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase. 

Both the activity and the selectiv- ity to propene increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites. 

Regardless of phase composition and crystallite size, the selectivity to propene is above 85% at propane conversion below 5% but decreases with increasing propane conversion or contact time.

Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples.

Coke formation over m-ZrO2 mainly occurs with participation of propane or its surface intermediates also leading to propene.

The selectivity to propene over m-ZrO2 decreases from 90% to 83% with an increase in propane conversion from 9% to 33%.

The effect of crystallite size on coke formation can be explained as follows. As the ratio of r(C3H6)/r(coke) increases with a decrease in the size of ZrO2 crystallites, it is reasonable to suggest that there are at least two different active sites for propane/propene adsorption and further reaction. One type is Zrcus sites, which are active for propene formation and may also form coke but with a significantly lower rate in comparison with the rate of propene formation.

1. Propene production primarily comes from steam and fluid catalytic cracking processes, but these methods struggle to meet the growing demand for propene. PDH is a major process for producing propene specifically and offers high selectivity for propene production.

2. The activity of monoclinic ZrO2 is higher than that of tetragonal ZrO2 in PDH. This is because monoclinic ZrO2 can release its lattice oxygen more easily, resulting in a higher concentration of Zrcus sites.

3. The selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 is higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This is attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation.

4. Coke formation over m-ZrO2 occurs via the participation of propane or its surface intermediates leading to propene. The selectivity to propene over m-ZrO2 decreases with an increase in propane conversion.

5. The size of ZrO2 crystallites impacts coke formation. Smaller crystallites lead to a higher ratio of Zrcus sites, which are active for propene formation and may also form coke but at a lower rate compared to propene formation.

1. 现在，丙烯主要通过蒸汽（60%-65%）或各种油分的流化催化裂解（30%）生产，但这些方法无法满足丙烯的需求。PDH是专门生产丙烯的最大过程之一，并且具有高丙烯选择性。

2. 在PDH中，单斜相ZrO2的活性高于四方相ZrO2。这是因为单斜相ZrO2可以更轻松地释放其晶格氧，从而导致Zrcus位点的更高浓度。

3. 与四方相ZrO2相比，单斜相ZrO2对丙烯的选择性更高。这是由于Zrcus位点与负责焦炭形成位点之间的较高比率所致。

4. 在m-ZrO2上，焦炭形成通过参与丙烯或其表面中间体产生丙烯进行。随着丙烯转化率的增加，m-ZrO2上的丙烯选择性降低。

5. ZrO2晶体粒度影响焦炭形成。较小的粒度导致更高的Zrcus位点比率，这些位点对于丙烯形成是活跃的，并且可能也形成焦炭，但速率低于丙烯形成的速率。

[3] "The highest activity achieved over bare monoclinic ZrO2 was comparable to that of commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on the PDH performance were related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create Zrcus sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
PDH utilizes high-temperature processes to produce propene, offering high selectivity for this product. Bare monoclinic ZrO2 was found to be as active as commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts in this process. The activity and selectivity to propene can be tuned by controlling the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, which affects its ability to release lattice oxygen and create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites).

The coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can reduce process efficiency and require frequent catalyst regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include adjusting reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and using additives that prevent coke deposition. Additionally, developing more durable catalysts or periodically replacing spent catalysts can help maintain process efficiency.

PDH利用高温过程生产丙烯，提供高丙烯选择性。裸露的单斜晶系ZrO2的活性与商用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂相当。通过控制ZrO2的粒径大小和相组成，可以调节其释放晶格氧的能力以及生成配位不饱和Zr离子（Zrcus位点）的能力，从而影响PDH性能。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低工艺效率并需要频繁的催化剂再生。减少焦炭形成的策略包括调整反应条件，如温度和压力，并使用防止焦炭沉积的添加剂。此外，开发更耐用的催化剂或定期更换失效的催化剂可以帮助维持工艺效率。
