[1] "Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1,2]."
[2] "Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene."

[5] "However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene."
[6] "Therefore, some on- purpose technologies,such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7], methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production."

[9] "Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase."

1. Propene is extensively utilized in manufacturing numerous everyday chemicals. Its demand and production are growing due to increased usage in downstream products. The global propene market is forecasted to reach 165 million tons by 2030 from 103 million in 2012. Traditionally, propene is produced through steam or fluid catalytic cracking, but these methods are insufficient to meet propene demand. Alternative technologies like metathesis, methanol-to-olefins, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), etc., have been developed to bridge the gap between demand and supply.

2. PDH is a significant process for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The activity and propene selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts can be tuned through the kind of crystal phase (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size.

3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration include adjusting reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and implementing effective catalyst handling protocols.

1. 丙烯被广泛用于制造大量日常化学品。其需求和生产正在增长，因为下游产品的使用量增加。到2030年，全球丙烯市场预计将从2012年的1030万吨增长至1650万吨。传统上，丙烯通过蒸汽或流化床催化裂解生产，但这些方法无法满足丙烯需求。开发了替代技术，如烷烃裂解、甲醇制烯烃、丙烷脱氢等，以缩小需求与供应之间的差距。

2. 丙烷脱氢（PDH）是大规模生产丙烯的过程，并且具有高的丙烯选择性。通过改变晶相（单斜相与四方相）和晶粒尺寸，可以调节ZrO2催化剂的活性和丙烯选择性。

3. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了过程效率。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的策略包括调整反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及实施有效的催化剂处理程序。
