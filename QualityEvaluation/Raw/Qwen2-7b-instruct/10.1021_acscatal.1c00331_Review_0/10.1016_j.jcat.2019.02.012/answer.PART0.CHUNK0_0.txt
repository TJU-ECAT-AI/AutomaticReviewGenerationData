[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."
[2] "The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."
[3] "Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature."
[4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1."
[5] "It is also worth mentioning that PDH activity of ZrO2 strongly correlates with the conductivity."
[6] "Furthermore, operando UVvis tests were used to investigate the formation of coke species during PDH reaction over t-ZrO2 catalysts with crystallite size of 3.7, 4.6 or 5.7 nm and over m-ZrO2 with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites."

1. PDH serves as a method for propene production, offering high selectivity. It involves the direct dehydrogenation of propane, which can be carried out using catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3. Alternative catalysts, including ZrO2, have also been explored.

2. The primary industrial processes for propene production involve the Catofin and Oleflex processes. These utilize CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.

3. Beyond Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, other alternatives have been reported in the literature for alkane dehydrogenation, including materials based on ZnO, GaOx, VOx, isolated FeII, and CoII.

4. The experimental determination of activation energy (Ea) values for propene formation over differently structured ZrO2 materials indicates that regardless of the catalyst, Ea values are approximately 150 kJ/mol.

5. There is a strong correlation between the PDH activity of ZrO2 and the conductivity of the catalyst. This suggests that the ability of ZrO2 to generate active sites depends on its conductivity.

6. Operando UVvis tests have been employed to study the formation of coke species during PDH reactions over ZrO2 catalysts with varying crystallite sizes. These tests provide insights into the mechanisms of coke formation and its dependence on the size of the catalyst's crystallites.

1.PDH是一种用于丙烯生产的最大工艺之一，提供高丙烯选择性。它涉及丙烷的直接脱氢，可以使用CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3等催化剂进行。文献中还报告了其他替代催化剂，包括基于ZnO、GaOx、VOx、孤立FeII和CoII的催化剂。

2.主要的工业丙烯生产过程涉及Catofin和Oleflex过程。这些分别使用CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3作为催化剂。

3.除了Pt基或CrOx基催化剂之外，文献中还报道了一些用于烷烃脱氢的其他替代催化剂，包括基于ZnO、GaOx、VOx、孤立FeII和CoII的材料。

4.对不同结构的ZrO2材料中丙烯形成时的活化能（Ea）值的实验测定显示，无论催化剂如何，Ea值约为150 kJ/mol。

5.ZrO2的PDH活性与催化剂的导电性之间存在很强的相关性。这表明生成活性位点的能力取决于ZrO2的导电性。

6.进行了原位UVvis测试，以研究不同晶粒大小的ZrO2催化剂在PDH反应期间形成的焦炭物种。这些测试提供了关于焦炭形成机制及其依赖于催化剂晶粒大小的信息。
