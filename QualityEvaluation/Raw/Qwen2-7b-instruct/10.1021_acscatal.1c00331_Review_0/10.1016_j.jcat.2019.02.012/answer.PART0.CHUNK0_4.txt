[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."
[2] "Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CAH bonds in propane."
[3] "The highest activity achieved over bare monoclinic ZrO2 was comparable to that of commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on the PDH performance were related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create Zrcus sites."

PDH utilizes high-temperature processes to produce propene, offering high selectivity for this product. Bare monoclinic ZrO2 was found to be as active as commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts in this process. The activity and selectivity to propene can be tuned by controlling the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, which affects its ability to release lattice oxygen and create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites).

The coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can reduce process efficiency and require frequent catalyst regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include adjusting reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and using additives that prevent coke deposition. Additionally, developing more durable catalysts or periodically replacing spent catalysts can help maintain process efficiency.

PDH利用高温过程生产丙烯，提供高丙烯选择性。裸露的单斜晶系ZrO2的活性与商用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂相当。通过控制ZrO2的粒径大小和相组成，可以调节其释放晶格氧的能力以及生成配位不饱和Zr离子（Zrcus位点）的能力，从而影响PDH性能。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低工艺效率并需要频繁的催化剂再生。减少焦炭形成的策略包括调整反应条件，如温度和压力，并使用防止焦炭沉积的添加剂。此外，开发更耐用的催化剂或定期更换失效的催化剂可以帮助维持工艺效率。
