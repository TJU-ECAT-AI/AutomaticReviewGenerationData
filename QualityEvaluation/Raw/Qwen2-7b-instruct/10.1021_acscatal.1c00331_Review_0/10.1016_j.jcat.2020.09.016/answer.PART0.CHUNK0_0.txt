1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for producing propene. Important factors to consider for the reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the utilization of an appropriate catalyst. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts affects the process efficiency by decreasing the accessible surface area for reactions. To address the issue of coke formation, employing promoters like Sn can enhance catalyst activity and stability.
