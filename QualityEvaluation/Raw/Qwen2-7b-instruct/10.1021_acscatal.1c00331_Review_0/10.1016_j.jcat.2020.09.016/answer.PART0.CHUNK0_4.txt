The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalyst types play a crucial role in the efficiency of PDH reactions; specifically, the addition of Sn to RhSn catalysts has been found to significantly enhance their activity and stability during PDH reactions. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by decreasing yield and increasing energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve operating under lower temperatures, utilizing a more selective catalyst, and conducting regenerations at higher temperatures.
