1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as an efficient method for propene production, with key considerations including reaction conditions like temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. Catalyst types, particularly Pt-based catalysts, are crucial in PDH processes. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can affect process efficiency, and strategies to mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration include using promoters like Sn.
