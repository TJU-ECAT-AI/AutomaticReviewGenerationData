The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by specific catalysts. Key considerations for PDH processes include setting optimal reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of reactants to maximize efficiency and yield. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can decrease their activity and selectivity, impacting the overall process efficiency negatively. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing operational parameters, employing pretreatment methods to prevent coke deposition, and implementing effective catalyst regeneration techniques to restore their performance.
