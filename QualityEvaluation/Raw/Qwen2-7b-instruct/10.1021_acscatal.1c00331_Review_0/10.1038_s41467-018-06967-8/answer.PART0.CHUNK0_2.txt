[1] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream."
[2] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[3] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane11."
[4] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[5] "The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 5a)."
[6] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b). As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b) and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 even after 120 h on stream."
[7] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

1. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with a low loading of Pt, exhibits a high propylene selectivity of 90% and a formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520°C, WHSV = 4 h1, and C3H8/N2 = 1/1. This catalyst maintains excellent stability for at least 120 hours. 
2. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a key industrial process for propylene production, is typically catalyzed by PtM alloys like PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. 
3. Our previous computational models revealed that these PtM alloys are constrained by a scaling relationship, leading to enhanced propylene selectivity but diminished intrinsic dehydrogenation activity.
4. Unlike previous low-temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows outstanding stability for at least 120 hours at 520°C.
5. The activation of CH bonds in propane begins at 188°C on Pt nanoparticles, 204°C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298°C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively.
6. The propylene formation rate for the 0.1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst sharply declined from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 after 12 hours, whereas the 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst did not show deactivation, maintaining a slightly reduced formation rate of 10.6 to 10.3 mol g1Pt h1 after 120 hours.
7. The correlation between the dehydrogenation degree of coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal indicates that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the sequence of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, aligning with the deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations.

1. Pt/Cu SAA催化剂，Pt加载量低，具有90%的高丙烯选择性和10.6 mol g1Pt h1的形成速率，在大气压、520°C、WHSV = 4 h1和C3H8/N2 = 1/1的条件下。该催化剂在至少120小时内保持良好的稳定性。
2. 烷烃脱氢（PDH），用于丙烯生产的工业关键过程，通常由如PtSn、PtZn、PtGa、PtIn、PtGe、和PtCu等PtM合金催化。
3. 我们之前的计算模型表明，这些PtM合金受到缩放关系的限制，导致丙烯选择性增强但脱氢活性降低。
4. 与之前报道的低温SAA应用不同，我们合成的Pt/Cu SAA在520°C时表现出至少120小时的优良稳定性。
5. 烯烃分子中CH键的活化开始于188°C在Pt纳米粒子上，204°C在Pt/Cu SAA上，298°C在Cu纳米粒子上。
6. 0.1Pt/Al2O3催化剂的丙烯形成速率从3.7下降到1.6 mol g1Pt h1后12小时急剧下降，而0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂未显示出失活，丙烯形成速率仅从10.6降低到10.3 mol g1Pt h1后120小时。
7. 金属表面软焦油的燃烧温度与焦油的深度脱氢程度之间的良好一致性表明，Pt纳米粒子、Pt/Cu SAA、和Cu纳米粒子的深度脱氢反应性依次递减，与通过DFT计算确定的深度脱氢障碍一致。
