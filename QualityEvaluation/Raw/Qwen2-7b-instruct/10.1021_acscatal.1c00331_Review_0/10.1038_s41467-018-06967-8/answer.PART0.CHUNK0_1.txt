[1] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction."
[2] "However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reactions, requiring more than one Pt atom."
[3] "Therefore, isolated Pt atoms are expected to be a potential active center with high propylene selectivity."
[4] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state."
[5] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[6] "The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2 eV), compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1 eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA."
[7] "The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di-σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (1.10 eV), further facilitating propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA."
[8] "Our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[9] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[10] "Although DFT calculations predict slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA, its higher propylene formation rate can be attributed to its better Pt dispersion compared with 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Pt dispersion = 29%)."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of appropriate catalysts. Catalyst types that are effective for PDH include noble metal alloys, particularly those containing platinum. Industrial applications of PDH involve the production of propene, which is a valuable intermediate in the petrochemical industry.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate its formation include using catalysts with better dispersion of Pt atoms, employing more inert supports, and controlling reaction conditions to prevent overheating. Catalyst regeneration can be improved by periodically removing coke through processes like hydrogenation or treating the catalyst with a suitable reagent that can convert coke back into the metal.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而实现丙烯生产的方法。考虑反应条件的关键因素包括温度、压力和合适的催化剂使用。有效的催化剂类型包括贵金属合金，尤其是铂基合金。工业应用涉及丙烯的生产，这是石化行业的重要中间体。

2. 在基于Pt的催化剂上形成焦炭会影响过程效率，因为这会减少可用于反应的表面面积，导致活性和选择性降低。缓解其形成的策略包括使用具有更好分散的Pt原子的催化剂、采用更惰性的支撑材料，并控制反应条件以防止过热。通过周期性地通过氢化或用适当试剂处理催化剂来去除焦炭可以改善催化剂再生。
