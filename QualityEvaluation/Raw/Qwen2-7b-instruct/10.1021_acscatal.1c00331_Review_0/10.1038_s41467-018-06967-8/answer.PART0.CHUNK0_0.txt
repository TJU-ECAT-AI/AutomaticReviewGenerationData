[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity."
[3] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently."
[6] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis."
[7] "A large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions."
[8] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[9] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction."
[10] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state."
[11] "Due to the existence of the scaling relationship for Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals), low dehydrogenation barrier (i.e., high PDH activity) accompanies with strong CPt interaction, leading to strong propene adsorption (i.e., low propene selectivity)."
[12] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity."
[13] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[14] "The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di-σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (1.10 eV), further facilitating propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA."
[15] "For the first two dehydrogenation steps, the geometry effects mentioned above are less apparent, due to no binding mode change for propyl over our calculated surfaces."
[16] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."

1. The development of new catalysts with both enhanced activity and selectivity is the ultimate goal in catalysis research. The scaling relationship restricts the catalytic properties of PtM alloys, leading to increased selectivity for propylene but reduced intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, researchers aim to develop catalysts that can break the scaling relationship, thereby improving both activity and selectivity simultaneously.

2. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, offering distinct advantages in a variety of chemical reactions. These catalysts typically exhibit superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

3. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a critical industrial process for producing propylene. Traditionally, PtM alloys, such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu, have been utilized for this purpose. However, they are limited by the scaling relationship, which affects their catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

4. The synthesized Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst shows remarkable stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. This stability is maintained for at least 120 hours of continuous operation.

5. The structure of Pt particles does not significantly affect the dehydrogenation of alkane compounds. Instead, the activity and selectivity are influenced by the interaction between the Pt atoms and the dehydrogenation intermediates. 

6. Noble metals, including Pt, are active for dehydrogenation reactions when in the metallic state. This property makes them suitable for the synthesis of efficient catalysts.

7. The scaling relationship between the dehydrogenation barrier and the propylene desorption barrier in PtM alloys (where M stands for 3d and 4d transition metals) leads to a trade-off between high PDH activity and low propene selectivity. 

8. In contrast, isolated Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles maintain a moderate dehydrogenation barrier while exhibiting high selectivity. This is due to the weak interaction between the Pt atoms and propylene, which facilitates its desorption.

9. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst breaks the scaling relationship observed in conventional Pt alloys, leading to improved propylene selectivity without compromising the dehydrogenation activity.

10. The binding strength of propylene over Pt/Cu SAA is weaker compared to that over Pt-based alloys, which promotes propylene desorption and enhances the selectivity towards propylene.

11. The geometry of the propyl molecule does not significantly influence the dehydrogenation process on the surfaces of the calculated models. This allows for less destabilization of dehydrogenated intermediates, contributing to the reasonable dehydrogenation barriers for the first two steps.

12. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibits higher initial propylene formation rate and improved selectivity (90%) compared to the conventional Pt catalyst (70%). This is attributed to its better dispersion of Pt atoms and lower dehydrogenation barriers.

13. The deactivation rate of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is significantly lower (0.0005 h−1) compared to the conventional Pt catalyst (0.07 h−1), indicating its higher stability and efficiency in PDH.

14. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst maintains its activity and stability during successive oxidation-reduction cycles, demonstrating its robust performance under repeated usage.

15. The coke formation on the surface of the catalyst can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency in PDH processes. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibits excellent anti-coke capability, allowing it to maintain its performance even after prolonged use.

16. The thermodynamic conversion of the catalyst can be quantified by measuring the mole of propylene produced per gram of Pt per hour, which helps in assessing the catalyst's efficiency.

17. The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles reveal the presence of two types of coke on each spent catalyst, with the coke formation being influenced by the temperature at which the catalyst operates.
