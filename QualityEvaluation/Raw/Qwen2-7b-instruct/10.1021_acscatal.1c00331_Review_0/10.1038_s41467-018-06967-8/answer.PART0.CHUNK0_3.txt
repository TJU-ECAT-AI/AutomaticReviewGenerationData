[1] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1."
[2] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[3] "The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively."
[4] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream."
[5] "While for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, the formation rate of propylene only decreased from 16.8 to 15.8 mol g1Pt h1 and the deactivation rate became 0.012 h1, verifying its higher activity and better coke resistance."
[6] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production. The key considerations involve the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Catalyst types play a crucial role, especially in terms of achieving high propene selectivity and stability. For instance, Pt/Cu SAA catalysts offer superior performance compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts. They maintain high propene selectivity (90%) and a high formation rate (10.6 mol g1Pt h1) under specific conditions (atmospheric pressure, 520°C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1). Moreover, they demonstrate excellent stability for at least 120 hours under continuous operation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency. Coke deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, thereby reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using Pt/Cu SAA catalysts, which show improved activity and better coke resistance compared to pure Pt nanoparticles. The coke resistance is attributed to the unique structure of Pt/Cu SAA, which reduces the deep dehydrogenation reactivity, thus minimizing carbon deposits on the active Pt sites.

Catalysts like Pt/Cu SAA can maintain high activity and selectivity for PDH, even under prolonged operation. This is due to their ability to break the scaling relationship associated with conventional Pt alloys, offering a more stable and efficient process for propene production. By mitigating coke formation, the efficiency of the PDH process can be significantly improved, ensuring better catalyst performance and industrial applicability.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种方法。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。催化剂类型在实现高丙烯选择性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。例如，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂相比传统Pt基催化剂表现出更优性能。它们在特定条件下（大气压、520°C、WHSV = 4 h1、C3H8/N2 = 1/1）保持高丙烯选择性（90%）和高形成速率（10.6 mol g1Pt h1）。此外，它们展现出至少120小时的出色稳定性，在连续操作中。

Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著影响过程效率。焦炭沉积导致催化剂失活，从而降低催化剂的活性和选择性。减轻焦炭形成的战略包括使用Pt/Cu SAA催化剂，与纯Pt纳米粒子相比，这些催化剂显示出更高的活性和更好的焦炭抵抗力。焦炭抵抗力归因于Pt/Cu SAA的独特结构，它降低了深度脱氢反应性，从而减少了在活性Pt位点上的碳沉积。

像Pt/Cu SAA这样的催化剂可以维持PDH过程中的高活性和选择性，即使是在长时间操作下也是如此。这是由于它们能够打破与常规Pt合金相关的缩放关系，提供更稳定且高效的丙烯生产过程。通过减轻焦炭形成，PDH过程的效率可以显著提高，确保更好的催化剂性能和工业应用。
