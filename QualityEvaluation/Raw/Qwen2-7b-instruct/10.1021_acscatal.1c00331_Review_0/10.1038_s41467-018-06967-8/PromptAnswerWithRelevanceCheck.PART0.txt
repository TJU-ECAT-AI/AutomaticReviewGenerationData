[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity."
[3] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently."
[6] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis."
[7] "A large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions."
[8] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[9] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction."
[10] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state."
[11] "Due to the existence of the scaling relationship for Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals), low dehydrogenation barrier (i.e., high PDH activity) accompanies with strong CPt interaction, leading to strong propene adsorption (i.e., low propene selectivity)."
[12] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity."
[13] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[14] "The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di-σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (1.10 eV), further facilitating propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA."
[15] "For the first two dehydrogenation steps, the geometry effects mentioned above are less apparent, due to no binding mode change for propyl over our calculated surfaces."
[16] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[17] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g−1Pt h−1 is presented (dash line)."

1. The development of new catalysts with both enhanced activity and selectivity is the ultimate goal in catalysis research. The scaling relationship restricts the catalytic properties of PtM alloys, leading to increased selectivity for propylene but reduced intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, researchers aim to develop catalysts that can break the scaling relationship, thereby improving both activity and selectivity simultaneously.

2. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, offering distinct advantages in a variety of chemical reactions. These catalysts typically exhibit superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

3. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a critical industrial process for producing propylene. Traditionally, PtM alloys, such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu, have been utilized for this purpose. However, they are limited by the scaling relationship, which affects their catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

4. The synthesized Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst shows remarkable stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. This stability is maintained for at least 120 hours of continuous operation.

5. The structure of Pt particles does not significantly affect the dehydrogenation of alkane compounds. Instead, the activity and selectivity are influenced by the interaction between the Pt atoms and the dehydrogenation intermediates. 

6. Noble metals, including Pt, are active for dehydrogenation reactions when in the metallic state. This property makes them suitable for the synthesis of efficient catalysts.

7. The scaling relationship between the dehydrogenation barrier and the propylene desorption barrier in PtM alloys (where M stands for 3d and 4d transition metals) leads to a trade-off between high PDH activity and low propene selectivity. 

8. In contrast, isolated Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles maintain a moderate dehydrogenation barrier while exhibiting high selectivity. This is due to the weak interaction between the Pt atoms and propylene, which facilitates its desorption.

9. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst breaks the scaling relationship observed in conventional Pt alloys, leading to improved propylene selectivity without compromising the dehydrogenation activity.

10. The binding strength of propylene over Pt/Cu SAA is weaker compared to that over Pt-based alloys, which promotes propylene desorption and enhances the selectivity towards propylene.

11. The geometry of the propyl molecule does not significantly influence the dehydrogenation process on the surfaces of the calculated models. This allows for less destabilization of dehydrogenated intermediates, contributing to the reasonable dehydrogenation barriers for the first two steps.

12. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibits higher initial propylene formation rate and improved selectivity (90%) compared to the conventional Pt catalyst (70%). This is attributed to its better dispersion of Pt atoms and lower dehydrogenation barriers.

13. The deactivation rate of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is significantly lower (0.0005 h−1) compared to the conventional Pt catalyst (0.07 h−1), indicating its higher stability and efficiency in PDH.

14. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst maintains its activity and stability during successive oxidation-reduction cycles, demonstrating its robust performance under repeated usage.

15. The coke formation on the surface of the catalyst can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency in PDH processes. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibits excellent anti-coke capability, allowing it to maintain its performance even after prolonged use.

16. The thermodynamic conversion of the catalyst can be quantified by measuring the mole of propylene produced per gram of Pt per hour, which helps in assessing the catalyst's efficiency.

17. The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles reveal the presence of two types of coke on each spent catalyst, with the coke formation being influenced by the temperature at which the catalyst operates.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of appropriate catalysts. Catalyst types that are effective for PDH include noble metal alloys, particularly those containing platinum. Industrial applications of PDH involve the production of propene, which is a valuable intermediate in the petrochemical industry.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, leading to decreased activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate its formation include using catalysts with better dispersion of Pt atoms, employing more inert supports, and controlling reaction conditions to prevent overheating. Catalyst regeneration can be improved by periodically removing coke through processes like hydrogenation or treating the catalyst with a suitable reagent that can convert coke back into the metal.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production. The key considerations involve the reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Catalyst types play a crucial role, especially in terms of achieving high propene selectivity and stability. For instance, Pt/Cu SAA catalysts offer superior performance compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts. They maintain high propene selectivity (90%) and a high formation rate (10.6 mol g1Pt h1) under specific conditions (atmospheric pressure, 520°C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1). Moreover, they demonstrate excellent stability for at least 120 hours under continuous operation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency. Coke deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, thereby reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using Pt/Cu SAA catalysts, which show improved activity and better coke resistance compared to pure Pt nanoparticles. The coke resistance is attributed to the unique structure of Pt/Cu SAA, which reduces the deep dehydrogenation reactivity, thus minimizing carbon deposits on the active Pt sites.

Catalysts like Pt/Cu SAA can maintain high activity and selectivity for PDH, even under prolonged operation. This is due to their ability to break the scaling relationship associated with conventional Pt alloys, offering a more stable and efficient process for propene production. By mitigating coke formation, the efficiency of the PDH process can be significantly improved, ensuring better catalyst performance and industrial applicability.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种方法。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。催化剂类型在实现高丙烯选择性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。例如，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂相比传统Pt基催化剂表现出更优性能。它们在特定条件下（大气压、520°C、WHSV = 4 h1、C3H8/N2 = 1/1）保持高丙烯选择性（90%）和高形成速率（10.6 mol g1Pt h1）。此外，它们展现出至少120小时的出色稳定性，在连续操作中。

Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著影响过程效率。焦炭沉积导致催化剂失活，从而降低催化剂的活性和选择性。减轻焦炭形成的战略包括使用Pt/Cu SAA催化剂，与纯Pt纳米粒子相比，这些催化剂显示出更高的活性和更好的焦炭抵抗力。焦炭抵抗力归因于Pt/Cu SAA的独特结构，它降低了深度脱氢反应性，从而减少了在活性Pt位点上的碳沉积。

像Pt/Cu SAA这样的催化剂可以维持PDH过程中的高活性和选择性，即使是在长时间操作下也是如此。这是由于它们能够打破与常规Pt合金相关的缩放关系，提供更稳定且高效的丙烯生产过程。通过减轻焦炭形成，PDH过程的效率可以显著提高，确保更好的催化剂性能和工业应用。

1. 烷烃脱氢化（PDH）是生产丙烯的关键工业过程。包括PtSn、PtZn、PtGa、PtIn、PtGe和PtCu在内的PtM合金通常用于这一反应。然而，这些催化剂受到缩放关系的限制，这通常会导致丙烷选择性增强但脱氢化活性降低。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）已成为异质催化的一个有前景的新前沿，它们在各种化学反应中显示出独特的卓越性能。特别是在选择性氢化反应中特别有用。

3. 在这项研究中开发的Pt/Cu SAAs在PDH中表现出卓越的稳定性和选择性，实现了90％的丙烯选择性，在标准工业条件下。与之前在较低温度下报道的SAAs相比，这种稳定性显著提高。

4. Pt/Cu SAAs通过简单的原子稀释方法合成，并通过多种表征技术，包括CO-DRIFTS、AC-HAADF-STEM和EXAFS光谱，确认了其结构。

5. 与Pt纳米粒子相比，Pt/Cu SAAs在PDH过程中显示出了改进的选择性和稳定性。Pt/Cu SAAs的失活速率明显较低，量化为0.0005 h−1，而Pt纳米粒子的失活速率为0.07 h−1。

6. 准备相似的原子稀释方法的Pt/Ag SAAs，显示出与Pt/Cu SAAs相似的CH激活能力。然而，在PDH条件下，Pt/Ag SAAs的丙烷转化率仅为600°C下的32%，远低于Pt/Cu SAAs的41%，与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算预测的趋势一致。

7. 耗尽的催化剂的拉曼光谱表明，Pt/Cu SAAs上的焦炭脱氢程度高于Pt纳米粒子和Cu纳米粒子。这表明Pt/Cu SAAs形成焦炭的倾向较低。

8. 温度程序氧化（TPO）轮廓揭示了Pt/Cu SAAs具有更好的焦炭抵抗力。Pt/Cu SAAs上的焦炭燃烧温度高于Pt纳米粒子和Cu纳米粒子上的焦炭，进一步验证了它们出色的抗焦炭能力。
