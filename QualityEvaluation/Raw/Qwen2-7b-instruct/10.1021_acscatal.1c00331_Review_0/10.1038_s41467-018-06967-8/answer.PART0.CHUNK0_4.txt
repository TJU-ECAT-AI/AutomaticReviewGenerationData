[1] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[2] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane11."
[3] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis13. A large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation14,15, water-gas shift reaction (WGS)1618, methanol steam reforming (MSR)19,20, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)2123, hydrogenation of substituted nitroarenes24,25, hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes2629, and hydrogenation of carbon dioxide3032."
[4] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[5] "In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary Table 9)."
[6] "We prepared the Pt/Ag SAA catalyst according to similar atomic dilution method mentioned above. The TPSR of PD scrambling experiment indicates similar CH activation ability between Pt/Ag SAA and Pt/Cu SAA (Supplementary Figure 20a). However, under reaction conditions, the propane conversion for Pt/Ag SAA is only 32% at 600 C, which is lower than 41% for Pt/Cu SAA, consistent with the DFT predicted trends (Supplementary Figure 20b and Supplementary Table 6)."
[7] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."
[8] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key industrial process for producing propylene. Catalysts like PtM alloys, including PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu, are commonly used for this reaction. However, these catalysts are restricted by a scaling relationship, which typically leads to enhanced propylene selectivity but reduced dehydrogenation activity for propane.

2. Single-atom alloy (SAAs) have emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, showing exceptional performance across various chemical reactions. They are particularly useful in selective hydrogenation reactions.

3. The Pt/Cu SAAs developed in this study exhibit remarkable stability and selectivity in PDH, achieving 90% propylene selectivity under standard industrial conditions. This stability is superior to previously reported SAAs at lower temperatures.

4. The Pt/Cu SAAs were synthesized using a simple atomic dilution method, and their structure was confirmed through multiple characterization techniques, including CO-DRIFTS, AC-HAADF-STEM, and EXAFS spectra.

5. The Pt/Cu SAAs showed improved stability and selectivity in PDH compared to Pt nanoparticles. The deactivation rate for the Pt/Cu SAAs was significantly lower, quantified at 0.0005 h−1 versus 0.07 h−1 for the Pt nanoparticles.

6. The Pt/Ag SAAs, prepared similarly to the Pt/Cu SAAs, exhibited comparable CH activation abilities. However, under PDH conditions, the propane conversion for Pt/Ag SAAs was lower, at 32% at 600°C, compared to 41% for Pt/Cu SAAs, aligning with the predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

7. The Raman spectra of the spent catalysts indicated a higher dehydrogenation degree of coke on the Pt/Cu SAAs compared to the Pt nanoparticles and Cu nanoparticles. This suggests that the Pt/Cu SAAs have a lower tendency to form coke during PDH.

8. The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles revealed that the Pt/Cu SAAs showed better coke resistance. The coke on the Pt/Cu SAAs burned at a higher temperature compared to the coke on the Pt nanoparticles and Cu nanoparticles, further validating their superior anti-coke capability.

1. 烷烃脱氢化（PDH）是生产丙烯的关键工业过程。包括PtSn、PtZn、PtGa、PtIn、PtGe和PtCu在内的PtM合金通常用于这一反应。然而，这些催化剂受到缩放关系的限制，这通常会导致丙烷选择性增强但脱氢化活性降低。
