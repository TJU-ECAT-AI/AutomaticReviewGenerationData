[1] "Propane dehydrogenation undergoes a very complex dehydro- genation network. Particularly, at high temperatures, parasitic reactions (such as cracking and hydrogenolysis to lighter hydrocarbons, further dehydrogenation and formation of coke deposits) lead to rapid loss of activity and lower yields over Pt-based catalysts."
[2] "Coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[3] "The catalysts included here are only the best performing ones from the articles considered."
