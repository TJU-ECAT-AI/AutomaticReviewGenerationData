1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial process that transforms propane into propylene, receiving significant interest in recent years. To enhance the conversion of propane, increasing the reaction temperature or decreasing the partial pressure is beneficial.

2. To boost the dehydrogenation of propane, it is essential to raise the temperature and/or reduce the partial pressure, which increases the conversion rate.

3. Platinum (Pt) particles face challenges primarily due to carbon cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation. High temperatures during dehydrogenation and regeneration cause severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles.

4. Chromium oxide catalysts are complex substances that make it difficult to elucidate their reaction and deactivation mechanisms. 

5. The accumulation of carbon on the chromium oxide surface and aggregation of Cr3+ ions are the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.

6. Significant deactivation occurred in nickel catalysts (Ni/SiO2) during propane dehydrogenation due to coke formation and accumulation.

7. Comparing the regions in Figure 9, chromium oxide and vanadium oxide (CrOx, VOx) catalysts, which are located in region B, display higher propylene formation rates but suffer from higher deactivation rates.

8. Catalysts in regions C and D, such as those containing indium oxide (InOx), show lower activity than others.

9. Indium oxide (InOx) catalysts, situated in region A, offer advantageous formation rates at lower deactivation rates, potentially making them promising alternatives for PDH processes.
