2.Coke formation on platinum-based catalysts affects the efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to address this include controlled regeneration, doping, and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere. While efforts are being made to enhance the activation of CH bonds, the propylene formation rates are still limited compared to noble platinum-based catalysts. The most critical direction for metal oxide-based catalysts is to further improve the activation of CH bonds.
