[1] "The rapid developments of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts urge us to review the progress in recent years. Further understanding on the principles could essentially provide a creative perspective on propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Catalyst development In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity."
[3] "The active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Many efforts have been made to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts. Doping can effectively increase the activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
[4] "Carbon was first found to exhibit catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions in the 1970s, and the rapid development of nanocarbon materials at the end of the last century provides ideal platforms for catalysis."
