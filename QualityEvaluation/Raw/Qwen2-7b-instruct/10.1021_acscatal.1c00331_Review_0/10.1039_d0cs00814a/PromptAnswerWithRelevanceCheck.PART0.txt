<quotes>
[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "Increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane."
[3] "The main problems of Pt particles are CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation."
[4] "Compared with Pt, chromium oxide is more complex and it is difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation mechanism."
[5] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide."
[6] "Significant deactivation over Ni/SiO2 catalysts was observed because of coke formation and accumulation during propane dehydrogenation."
[7] "In the direct comparisons in Fig. 9, there are 4 regions (A, B, C and D), and we can find that although CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts, in region B, show higher propylene formation rates,they suffer higher deactivation rates."
[8] "Some metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity."
[9] "Importantly, GaOx-based catalysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH catalysts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial process that transforms propane into propylene, receiving significant interest in recent years. To enhance the conversion of propane, increasing the reaction temperature or decreasing the partial pressure is beneficial.

2. To boost the dehydrogenation of propane, it is essential to raise the temperature and/or reduce the partial pressure, which increases the conversion rate.

3. Platinum (Pt) particles face challenges primarily due to carbon cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation. High temperatures during dehydrogenation and regeneration cause severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles.

4. Chromium oxide catalysts are complex substances that make it difficult to elucidate their reaction and deactivation mechanisms. 

5. The accumulation of carbon on the chromium oxide surface and aggregation of Cr3+ ions are the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.

6. Significant deactivation occurred in nickel catalysts (Ni/SiO2) during propane dehydrogenation due to coke formation and accumulation.

7. Comparing the regions in Figure 9, chromium oxide and vanadium oxide (CrOx, VOx) catalysts, which are located in region B, display higher propylene formation rates but suffer from higher deactivation rates.

8. Catalysts in regions C and D, such as those containing indium oxide (InOx), show lower activity than others.

9. Indium oxide (InOx) catalysts, situated in region A, offer advantageous formation rates at lower deactivation rates, potentially making them promising alternatives for PDH processes.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）是一种工业技术，用于直接生产丙烯，并在过去几年中受到了广泛的关注。为了提高丙烷的转化率，可以增加反应温度或降低分压。

2. 提高丙烷的脱氢速率需要提升温度和/或减少部分压力，这能提高丙烷的转化率。

3. 铂（Pt）颗粒的主要问题在于碳键断裂和深度脱氢导致焦炭形成。在脱氢和再生过程中，高温会引发Pt纳米粒子严重的凝聚。

4. 铬氧化物催化剂较为复杂，使得对其反应和失活机制的解释变得困难。

5. 在铬氧化物表面沉积的碳以及Cr3+离子的聚集是催化剂失效的主要原因。

6. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，镍催化剂（Ni/SiO2）由于焦炭形成和积累而经历了显著的失活。

7. 比较图9中的区域，位于区域B的铬氧化物和钒氧化物（CrOx，VOx）催化剂虽然具有较高的丙烯生成率，但其失活率也较高。

8. 区域C和D中的催化剂，如含铟氧化物（InOx），显示的活性低于其他催化剂。

9. 位于区域A的铟氧化物（InOx）催化剂提供有利的生成率和较低的失活率，可能成为PDH过程的有前景替代品。
