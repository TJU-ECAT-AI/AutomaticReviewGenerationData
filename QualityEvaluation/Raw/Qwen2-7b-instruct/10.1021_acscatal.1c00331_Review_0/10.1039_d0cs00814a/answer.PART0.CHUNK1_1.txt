[1] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions,undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The catalysts included here are only the best performing ones from the articles considered."
[3] "The formation rate is defined as mol C3H6 gCo 1 h1."
[4] "kd, the deactivation rate constant is calculated from ln((1  Xfinal)/Xfinal) = kdt + ln((1  Xinitial)/Xinitial)."
[5] "The catalysts included here are only the best performing ones from the articles considered."
[6] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[7] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."

1. Side reactions such as the deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive. Unwanted products are formed, leading to catalyst deactivation.

2. The catalysts mentioned are the top performers based on the studies reviewed.

3. The formation rate is defined as the amount of propene produced per gram of cobalt per hour.

4. The deactivation rate constant is calculated using a logarithmic equation that compares the final conversion percentage to the initial conversion percentage.

5. The catalysts listed are the most effective based on the articles examined.

6. Coke deposition primarily occurs on the uncoordinated active sites of the catalyst surface, possibly causing a faster decline in activity on smaller nanoparticles.

7. The deactivation rate constant is measured in hours to the power of -1. A higher kd value signifies faster deactivation and lower stability.

1. 深度脱氢化丙烯和丙烷氢解这些副反应是结构敏感的。形成不希望的产品，导致催化剂失活。

2. 提到的催化剂是基于所审阅文章中表现最好的。

3. 形成率定义为每克钴每小时产生的丙烯量。

4. 催化剂的失活速率常数通过比较最终转化百分比与初始转化百分比的对数方程来计算。

5. 列出的催化剂是基于所审阅文章中最有效的。

6. 焦炭主要沉积在催化剂表面的非配位活性位点上，可能是较小纳米粒子上活性下降速度更快的原因。

7. 失活速率常数以小时的负一次方测量。kd值越高，表明失活越快，稳定性越低。
