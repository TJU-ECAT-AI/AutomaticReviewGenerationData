The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene under specific conditions. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate reaction conditions, utilizing effective catalyst types, and addressing potential issues like coke formation. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalytic activity and requiring costly regeneration steps. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with high resistance to coke deposition and employing techniques for efficient catalyst regeneration.

The CoSn/NC microwave catalyst is highlighted for its high activity in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene, achieving a 15% conversion rate and 80% selectivity at 450°C. This is notably superior to the conventional reaction mode, where the conversion and selectivity were only 3.2% and 67.8%, respectively. The microwave catalyst demonstrates remarkable stability, maintaining its effectiveness over 180 minutes without significant change. Additionally, the apparent activation energy for the direct dehydrogenation reaction over the CoSn/NC catalyst drops significantly under microwave irradiation, from 59.58 kJ/mol in the conventional mode to 20.98 kJ/mol in the microwave catalytic mode, suggesting a pronounced microwave direct catalytic effect.

催化直接脱氢化丙烷作为丙烯生产的手段，通过在特定条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、使用有效的催化剂类型以及解决潜在问题，如焦炭形成。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成影响了过程效率，因为它降低了催化剂的活性并需要昂贵的再生步骤。为缓解焦炭形成的问题，可以采用具有高焦炭沉积抵抗力的催化剂，并采用高效的催化剂再生技术。

CoSn/NC微波催化剂因其在丙烷直接脱氢化到丙烯中的高活性而受到强调，在450°C时，其转化率和选择性分别达到15%和80%。这明显优于传统的反应模式，该模式下的转化率和选择性仅为3.2%和67.8%。微波催化剂表现出极高的稳定性，经过180分钟的测试后，其性能没有显著变化。此外，CoSn/NC催化剂在微波照射下的直接脱氢反应的显着激活能从常规模式下的59.58 kJ/mol降低到微波催化模式下的20.98 kJ/mol，表明微波直接催化效应显著。
