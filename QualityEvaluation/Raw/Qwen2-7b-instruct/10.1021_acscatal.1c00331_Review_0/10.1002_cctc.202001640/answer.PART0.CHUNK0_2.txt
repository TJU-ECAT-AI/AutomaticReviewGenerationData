[1] "The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention."
[2] "However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."
[3] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."
[4] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient."
[5] "The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."
[6] "Comparatively, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity were respectively only 3.2% and 67.8% for CoSn/NC catalyst at 450C in the conventional reaction mode under identical conditions."
[7] "Moreover, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."
[8] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode."
[9] "This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production by converting propane (C3H8) into propene (C3H6). Key considerations involve reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, catalyst types, including precious metals like platinum, and industrial applications. Strategies to mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts include improving catalyst design, enhancing regeneration methods, and operating the process under conditions that prevent excessive heat generation.

2. The efficiency of the direct dehydrogenation process can be impacted by coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which leads to decreased activity and increased energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate this issue include implementing advanced catalyst design, optimizing operating conditions to prevent coke formation, and developing efficient catalyst regeneration techniques.
