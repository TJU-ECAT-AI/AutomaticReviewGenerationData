[1] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention."
[2] "However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."
[3] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."
[4] "This work opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."
[5] "The CoSn/NC catalyst has an outstanding activity with a high C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity up to 15% and 80%, respectively, even at 450C."
[6] "The apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a chemical reaction. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting suitable catalyst types, and ensuring efficient operation in industrial applications. Coke formation on catalysts like those based on platinum can impact process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might involve using catalysts with better resistance to coke buildup, implementing more efficient regeneration processes, or modifying operating conditions to minimize coke formation.

Answer: The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane serves as a method for propene production, focusing on efficient conversion under controlled conditions. Important factors include catalyst selection, operational parameters, and strategies to prevent or manage coke formation on catalysts, which can degrade efficiency and necessitate regeneration.
