[1] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention."
[2] "However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."
[3] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."
[4] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient."
[5] "This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature."
[6] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propylene (C3H6) is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium."
[7] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."
[8] "In this regard, it would be desirable to exploit a new environment-friendly dehydrogenation catalyst system with high activity, good stability and much lower cost."
[9] "Recently, there is increasing attention that the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction potentially opening the way for the production of propylene."
[10] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium."
[11] "Moreover, due to the policy adjustment in recent years, the price of coal has risen sharply and the price of propylene has shifted downward."
[12] "This situation has caused the profit of the coal-to-propylene process has been far less than before, which makes it extremely urgent to explore novel, lower-cost ways to produce propylene."
[13] "In recent years, the shale gas that is an abundant source of propane has emerged, making it very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals including C2 to C4 olefins."
[14] "Moreover, there is a large extent of the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes people pay attention to the process of direct dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene with high added value."
[15] "However, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[16] "In this regard, it would be desirable to exploit a new environment-friendly dehydrogenation catalyst system with high activity, good stability and much lower cost."
[17] "On the other hand, microwave irradiation is considered as a promising approach to reduce energy consumption effectively."
[18] "The development of excellent microwave catalysts for microwave catalytic reactions is very critical, because an excellent microwave catalyst can display dramatic enhancement in reaction rates and selectivity."
[19] "To the best of our knowledge, CoSn/NC as microwave catalyst in PDH under microwave irradiation has not been reported yet so far."
[20] "Previously, our work of direct H2S decomposition reaction proved that the H2S equilibrium conversion can be broken under microwave irradiation."
[21] "Unfortunately, microwave catalysis did not break the equilibrium conversion of the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction in our catalytic system."
[22] "Compared with the catalytic performance of the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst in the conventional reaction mode, microwave irradiation significantly reduced the reaction temperature of direct propane dehydrogenation and obtained higher catalytic performance."
[23] "Previously, our work of direct NO decomposition reaction and direct decomposition of H2S by microwave catalysis both confirmed that the dramatic accelerations under microwave irradiation was not simply ascribed to the hot-spots hypothesis."
[24] "Clearly, this indicates that CoSn/NC catalyst exhibits a microwave catalytic effect in the MCRM."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene through a chemical reaction. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include selecting appropriate temperature, pressure, and catalyst type. Catalyst types often involve precious metals like platinum (Pt) or less hazardous alternatives like gallium, cobalt, nickel, iron, and cobalt-tin (CoSn) combinations. Industrial applications require catalysts with high activity, stability, and lower cost. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst surface area and increasing deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include operating at lower temperatures, using catalyst supports, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through processes like thermal or chemical treatments.

To mitigate the formation of coke and improve catalyst regeneration, consider the following strategies:

1. **Operate at Lower Temperatures**: Running the process at lower temperatures can decrease the rate of coke formation, allowing for longer catalyst life cycles.
   
2. **Use Catalyst Supports**: Incorporating materials like carbon nitride or carbon materials into the catalyst can improve heat dissipation, reducing the risk of localized hotspots that promote coke formation.
   
3. **Regenerate the Catalyst Periodically**: Implementing periodic regeneration processes can remove accumulated coke and restore catalyst activity, extending its useful life.
   
4. **Design Catalysts with Coke Resistance**: Selecting or developing catalyst compositions that inherently resist coke formation can enhance overall process efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
   
5. **Monitor and Control Reaction Conditions**: Regular monitoring of temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios can help optimize conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize propene yield.
   
6. **Utilize Advanced Catalysts**: Researching and implementing advanced catalyst designs, such as those with enhanced stability or those specifically tailored for lower temperature operation, can significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs.

催化直接脱氢化丙烷（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产方法，通过化学反应将丙烷转化为丙烯。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括选择合适的温度、压力和催化剂类型。催化剂类型通常涉及铂等贵金属或更安全的替代品，如镓、钴、镍、铁和钴锡（CoSn）组合。工业应用需要具有高活性、稳定性和较低成本的催化剂。

石墨形成在铂基催化剂上会影响过程效率，因为这会减少催化剂表面面积并增加去活化。为减少石墨形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采取以下策略：

1. **运行较低温度**：在较低温度下运行过程可以降低石墨形成的速率，从而延长催化剂使用寿命。
   
2. **使用催化剂载体**：将碳材料或碳氮化物等材料加入催化剂中可以改善热传导性，减少局部热点形成的风险，从而减少石墨形成。
   
3. **定期再生催化剂**：实施定期再生过程可以去除积累的石墨并恢复催化剂活性，延长其使用寿命。
   
4. **设计抗石墨催化剂**：选择或开发具有内在抗石墨性能的催化剂组合可以显著提高整体过程效率并减少维护成本。
   
5. **监控和控制反应条件**：定期监控温度、压力和反应物比例可以帮助优化条件以减少石墨形成并最大化丙烯产量。
