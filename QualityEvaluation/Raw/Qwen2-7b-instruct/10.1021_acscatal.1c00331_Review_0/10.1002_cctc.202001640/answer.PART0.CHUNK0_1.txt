[1] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention."
[2] "However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."
[3] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."
[4] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient."
[5] "The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."
[6] "Compared to CoSn/NC catalyst at 450C in the conventional reaction mode, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity were respectively only 3.2% and 67.8%."
[7] "This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, utilizing suitable catalyst types, and ensuring efficient industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring frequent regeneration, which can be costly and time-consuming. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using less hazardous catalysts, improving catalyst design to prevent coking, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques to extend catalyst life.
