The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene through a chemical reaction. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include selecting appropriate temperature, pressure, and catalyst type. Catalyst types often involve precious metals like platinum (Pt) or less hazardous alternatives like gallium, cobalt, nickel, iron, and cobalt-tin (CoSn) combinations. Industrial applications require catalysts with high activity, stability, and lower cost. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst surface area and increasing deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include operating at lower temperatures, using catalyst supports, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through processes like thermal or chemical treatments.

To mitigate the formation of coke and improve catalyst regeneration, consider the following strategies:

1. **Operate at Lower Temperatures**: Running the process at lower temperatures can decrease the rate of coke formation, allowing for longer catalyst life cycles.
   
2. **Use Catalyst Supports**: Incorporating materials like carbon nitride or carbon materials into the catalyst can improve heat dissipation, reducing the risk of localized hotspots that promote coke formation.
   
3. **Regenerate the Catalyst Periodically**: Implementing periodic regeneration processes can remove accumulated coke and restore catalyst activity, extending its useful life.
   
4. **Design Catalysts with Coke Resistance**: Selecting or developing catalyst compositions that inherently resist coke formation can enhance overall process efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
   
5. **Monitor and Control Reaction Conditions**: Regular monitoring of temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios can help optimize conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize propene yield.
   
6. **Utilize Advanced Catalysts**: Researching and implementing advanced catalyst designs, such as those with enhanced stability or those specifically tailored for lower temperature operation, can significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs.
