[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,1 such as ethane and propane,2 which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
[4] "In contrast, when tin (Sn) is added to CeO2, the single-atom Pt catalyst undergoes an activation phase where it transforms into PtSn clusters under reaction conditions."
[5] "Formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product."
[6] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."
[7] "Furthermore, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst."
[8] "Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2."
[9] "To investigate the causes for the observed lack of selectivity of the single-atom Pt/CeO2 material towards propylene, we performed DFT calculations for Pt single atoms supported on CeO2."
[10] "On single-atom Pt supported by CeO2, the product of the dehydrogenation (propylene) adsorbs strongly at the atomic Pt sites via di-σ bonds with Pt."
[11] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[12] "What is unique about the CeO2 support is that these PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state."
[13] "Furthermore, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through breaking the C-C bonds under high temperatures. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing suitable catalyst types, and optimizing the process to maximize propene yield and minimize by-product formation. Industrial applications of PDH involve the production of propene, a crucial component in the synthesis of plastics, solvents, and other chemical intermediates.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. This leads to decreased productivity and increased energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using supports with better trapping properties, incorporating additives that enhance catalyst stability, and utilizing milder operating conditions, such as adding water vapor, which suppresses coke formation.

1. 烷烃的直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在高温下断裂碳-碳键将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、挑选合适的催化剂类型以及优化过程以最大化丙烯产率并减少副产物形成。PDH的工业应用涉及丙烯的生产，这是塑料、溶剂和其他化学中间体合成的关键成分。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响过程效率，导致催化剂活性和选择性降低，进而导致生产效率下降和能源消耗增加。缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用具有更好捕获性能的支撑材料、加入增强催化剂稳定性的添加剂以及采用更温和的操作条件，如添加水蒸气，这可以抑制焦炭形成。
