[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2."
[3] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[4] "What is unique about the CeO2 support is that these PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state (Figure2d)."
[5] "The CeO2 support is unique because trapping sites allow the size of the PtSn clusters to remain small even when used at such high temperatures."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through breaking the carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include operating temperature, pressure, and the type of catalyst used. Catalyst types include Pt-based catalysts, PtSn clusters on CeO2, and Sn/CeO2. Industrial applications involve the production of propene as a building block for various chemical industries. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing catalyst life. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using water vapor as an oxidant and employing a regenerable catalyst design that avoids the need for corrosive halogens.

2. The main consideration in PDH is the choice of catalyst type. For instance, adding Sn to Pt in an atomically dispersed catalyst enhances selectivity towards propene production but might reduce the reaction rate due to an increased activation barrier. The catalyst design is crucial, especially concerning the support material, as it affects the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

3. The uniqueness of the CeO2 support lies in its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form, facilitating redispersion of Pt without needing corrosive halogens. Moreover, it allows the use of water vapor as an oxidant, which almost completely eliminates coke deposition during PDH at high temperatures. This feature contributes to the catalyst's stability and regenerability.

4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during PDH impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing the yield of propene. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using a regenerable catalyst design, such as the PtSn/CeO2 system, which uses water vapor as an oxidant to suppress coke formation and allows for complete redispersion of Pt atoms without needing corrosive halogens.

1.PDH作为丙烯生产的方法，通过打破丙烷分子中的碳-氢键将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、压力和催化剂类型。催化剂类型包括基于Pt的催化剂、CeO2上的PtSn簇和Sn/CeO2。工业应用涉及丙烯作为化学工业基础材料的生产。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，导致催化剂失效并减少催化剂寿命。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，并采用避免使用腐蚀性卤素的可再生催化剂设计。

2.PDH的主要考虑因素是催化剂类型的选取。例如，在原子分散型催化剂中添加Sn到Pt中可以提高丙烯选择性，但可能会因较高的活化能壁垒而降低反应速率。催化剂设计至关重要，尤其是支持材料的选择，它影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3.CeO2支持的独特之处在于其能够以离子形式捕获Pt原子，从而在不需要腐蚀性卤素的情况下实现Pt原子的重新分散。此外，它允许使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，几乎完全消除在高温下PDH过程中形成的焦炭沉积物。这一特性有助于催化剂的稳定性与可再生性。

4.PDH过程中焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会影响过程效率，导致催化剂失效并降低丙烯产率。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括采用可再生催化剂设计，如CeO2上的PtSn系统，使用水蒸气作为氧化剂来抑制焦炭形成，并允许完全无腐蚀性卤素条件下实现Pt原子的重新分散。
