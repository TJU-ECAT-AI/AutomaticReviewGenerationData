[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2."
[3] "Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[4] "What is unique about the CeO2 support is that these PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state (Figure2d)."
[5] "The CeO2 support is unique because trapping sites allow the size of the PtSn clusters to remain small even when used at such high temperatures."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through breaking the carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include operating temperature, pressure, and the type of catalyst used. Catalyst types include Pt-based catalysts, PtSn clusters on CeO2, and Sn/CeO2. Industrial applications involve the production of propene as a building block for various chemical industries. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing catalyst life. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using water vapor as an oxidant and employing a regenerable catalyst design that avoids the need for corrosive halogens.

2. The main consideration in PDH is the choice of catalyst type. For instance, adding Sn to Pt in an atomically dispersed catalyst enhances selectivity towards propene production but might reduce the reaction rate due to an increased activation barrier. The catalyst design is crucial, especially concerning the support material, as it affects the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

3. The uniqueness of the CeO2 support lies in its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form, facilitating redispersion of Pt without needing corrosive halogens. Moreover, it allows the use of water vapor as an oxidant, which almost completely eliminates coke deposition during PDH at high temperatures. This feature contributes to the catalyst's stability and regenerability.

4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during PDH impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing the yield of propene. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using a regenerable catalyst design, such as the PtSn/CeO2 system, which uses water vapor as an oxidant to suppress coke formation and allows for complete redispersion of Pt atoms without needing corrosive halogens.

1.PDH作为丙烯生产的方法，通过打破丙烷分子中的碳-氢键将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、压力和催化剂类型。催化剂类型包括基于Pt的催化剂、CeO2上的PtSn簇和Sn/CeO2。工业应用涉及丙烯作为化学工业基础材料的生产。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，导致催化剂失效并减少催化剂寿命。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，并采用避免使用腐蚀性卤素的可再生催化剂设计。

2.PDH的主要考虑因素是催化剂类型的选取。例如，在原子分散型催化剂中添加Sn到Pt中可以提高丙烯选择性，但可能会因较高的活化能壁垒而降低反应速率。催化剂设计至关重要，尤其是支持材料的选择，它影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3.CeO2支持的独特之处在于其能够以离子形式捕获Pt原子，从而在不需要腐蚀性卤素的情况下实现Pt原子的重新分散。此外，它允许使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，几乎完全消除在高温下PDH过程中形成的焦炭沉积物。这一特性有助于催化剂的稳定性与可再生性。

4.PDH过程中焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会影响过程效率，导致催化剂失效并降低丙烯产率。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括采用可再生催化剂设计，如CeO2上的PtSn系统，使用水蒸气作为氧化剂来抑制焦炭形成，并允许完全无腐蚀性卤素条件下实现Pt原子的重新分散。

### How does the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) function as a method for propene production, and what are the key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications? Furthermore, how does coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impact the process efficiency, and what strategies can be implemented to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration?

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations in PDH include:
- **Reaction Conditions**: High temperatures are essential for the endothermic reaction to achieve economically attractive yields. However, these temperatures can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation.
- **Catalyst Types**: Single-atom Pt/CeO2 catalysts are unstable and not selective for propene production. By contrast, PtSn clusters supported on CeO2 offer high selectivity towards propene because of easier product desorption, preventing further reactions.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and increasing energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
- **Use of Water Vapor**: Water vapor, thanks to its redox properties, can suppress coke deposition during PDH at high temperatures.
- **Regeneration Processes**: Oxidative treatment at high temperatures can remove coke, but it may also deactivate the catalyst. The use of CeO2 as a support helps maintain small PtSn cluster sizes during reaction, facilitating redispersion and regeneration without the need for corrosive halogens.
- **Selective Catalyst Design**: Incorporating tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) in the form of PtSn clusters on CeO2 provides better selectivity for propene production, reducing unwanted reactions and improving overall efficiency.

### 烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化方法是如何作为丙烯生产的手段的，以及在反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用方面的主要考虑因素是什么？此外，铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成如何影响过程效率，以及可以采取哪些策略来减少其形成并改善催化剂再生？

烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化方法通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气，作为丙烯生产的方法。在PDH中需要考虑的关键因素包括：
- **反应条件**：高温对于此吸热反应至关重要，以实现经济上吸引人的产率。然而，这些温度会导致催化剂失活，通过结碳。
- **催化剂类型**：单原子Pt/CeO2催化剂不稳定且对丙烯生产缺乏选择性。相比之下，CeO2支持的PtSn簇提供了高丙烯选择性，因为产品易于脱附，从而防止进一步反应。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，通过减少催化剂活性并增加能耗。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生性的策略包括：
- **使用水蒸气**：由于其氧化还原性质，水蒸气可以抑制高温下PDH过程中的焦炭沉积。
- **再生过程**：高温下的氧化处理可以去除焦炭，但可能也会使催化剂失效。CeO2作为支撑物有助于维持反应期间PtSn簇的小尺寸，便于在不使用腐蚀性卤素的情况下实现分散和再生。
- **选择性催化剂设计**：在CeO2上以PtSn簇形式结合铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）提供更好的丙烯选择性，减少不必要的反应，从而提高整体效率。

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene and hydrogen under specific reaction conditions. Key considerations include optimizing temperature, pressure, and the type of catalyst used. Industrial applications often require high efficiency and selectivity in propene production. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing catalyst life. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve the use of water vapor as an oxidant and the incorporation of elements like tin (Sn) that can enhance selectivity and stability. The presence of water vapor suppresses coke deposition during dehydrogenation at high temperatures.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through breaking the carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as high temperatures, and utilizing suitable catalyst types. The catalysts' stability, selectivity, and regeneration capability are crucial for industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency by causing deactivation and necessitating costly regeneration procedures. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve using supports like ceria (CeO2) that can trap Pt atoms, facilitating redispersion without the need for corrosive halogens. Water vapor can be used as an oxidant to suppress coke formation during dehydrogenation, enhancing catalyst stability and reducing the risk of sintering and particle growth.

Answer: PDH utilizes high temperatures and specific catalysts to convert propane into propene by breaking C-C bonds. Industrial considerations focus on catalyst stability, selectivity, and regeneration. Coke formation negatively affects process efficiency, requiring mitigation strategies such as using ceria supports for redispersion without halogen additives and employing water vapor as an oxidant to prevent coke formation. These approaches enhance catalyst stability and reduce risks associated with sintering and particle growth.
