[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."
[4] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."
[5] "Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2."
[6] "The as-prepared PtSn/CeO2 catalyst contains both Sn and Pt in an atomically dispersed form, with more Sn than Pt, while the subnanometer clusters contain more Pt than Sn, consistent with the overall composition of the catalyst."
[7] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."
[8] "The ability of mobile Pt to reduce the dispersed Sn species is similar to that seen previously where Pt was found to reduce PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through breaking the carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as high temperatures, and utilizing suitable catalyst types. The catalysts' stability, selectivity, and regeneration capability are crucial for industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency by causing deactivation and necessitating costly regeneration procedures. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve using supports like ceria (CeO2) that can trap Pt atoms, facilitating redispersion without the need for corrosive halogens. Water vapor can be used as an oxidant to suppress coke formation during dehydrogenation, enhancing catalyst stability and reducing the risk of sintering and particle growth.

Answer: PDH utilizes high temperatures and specific catalysts to convert propane into propene by breaking C-C bonds. Industrial considerations focus on catalyst stability, selectivity, and regeneration. Coke formation negatively affects process efficiency, requiring mitigation strategies such as using ceria supports for redispersion without halogen additives and employing water vapor as an oxidant to prevent coke formation. These approaches enhance catalyst stability and reduce risks associated with sintering and particle growth.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）通过断裂丙烷分子中的碳-碳（C-C）键来生产丙烯，从而实现丙烯的生产。PDH的关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件，如高温，以及使用适当的催化剂类型。催化剂的稳定性、选择性和再生能力对于工业应用至关重要。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活，并需要昂贵的再生程序。减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的方法包括使用能够捕获Pt原子的支持体，如氧化铈（CeO2），以促进在不含腐蚀性卤素的情况下分散。可以使用水蒸气作为氧化剂来抑制脱氢过程中形成的焦炭，增强催化剂稳定性并降低结块和颗粒生长的风险。

答案：PDH通过高温和特定催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，断裂C-C键。工业考虑重点在于催化剂的稳定性和选择性，以及再生能力。焦炭形成对过程效率产生负面影响，需要采取策略来减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生。这包括使用能够捕获Pt原子的支持体（如氧化铈）以促进在不添加卤素的情况下分散，以及使用水蒸气作为氧化剂来防止焦炭形成，增强催化剂稳定性并降低结块和颗粒生长的风险。
