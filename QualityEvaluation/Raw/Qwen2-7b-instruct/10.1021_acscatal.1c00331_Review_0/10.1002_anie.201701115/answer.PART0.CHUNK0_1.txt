### How does the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) function as a method for propene production, and what are the key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications? Furthermore, how does coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impact the process efficiency, and what strategies can be implemented to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration?

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations in PDH include:
- **Reaction Conditions**: High temperatures are essential for the endothermic reaction to achieve economically attractive yields. However, these temperatures can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation.
- **Catalyst Types**: Single-atom Pt/CeO2 catalysts are unstable and not selective for propene production. By contrast, PtSn clusters supported on CeO2 offer high selectivity towards propene because of easier product desorption, preventing further reactions.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and increasing energy consumption. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
- **Use of Water Vapor**: Water vapor, thanks to its redox properties, can suppress coke deposition during PDH at high temperatures.
- **Regeneration Processes**: Oxidative treatment at high temperatures can remove coke, but it may also deactivate the catalyst. The use of CeO2 as a support helps maintain small PtSn cluster sizes during reaction, facilitating redispersion and regeneration without the need for corrosive halogens.
- **Selective Catalyst Design**: Incorporating tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) in the form of PtSn clusters on CeO2 provides better selectivity for propene production, reducing unwanted reactions and improving overall efficiency.

### 烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化方法是如何作为丙烯生产的手段的，以及在反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用方面的主要考虑因素是什么？此外，铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成如何影响过程效率，以及可以采取哪些策略来减少其形成并改善催化剂再生？

烷烃脱氢（PDH）催化方法通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气，作为丙烯生产的方法。在PDH中需要考虑的关键因素包括：
- **反应条件**：高温对于此吸热反应至关重要，以实现经济上吸引人的产率。然而，这些温度会导致催化剂失活，通过结碳。
- **催化剂类型**：单原子Pt/CeO2催化剂不稳定且对丙烯生产缺乏选择性。相比之下，CeO2支持的PtSn簇提供了高丙烯选择性，因为产品易于脱附，从而防止进一步反应。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，通过减少催化剂活性并增加能耗。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生性的策略包括：
- **使用水蒸气**：由于其氧化还原性质，水蒸气可以抑制高温下PDH过程中的焦炭沉积。
- **再生过程**：高温下的氧化处理可以去除焦炭，但可能也会使催化剂失效。CeO2作为支撑物有助于维持反应期间PtSn簇的小尺寸，便于在不使用腐蚀性卤素的情况下实现分散和再生。
- **选择性催化剂设计**：在CeO2上以PtSn簇形式结合铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）提供更好的丙烯选择性，减少不必要的反应，从而提高整体效率。
