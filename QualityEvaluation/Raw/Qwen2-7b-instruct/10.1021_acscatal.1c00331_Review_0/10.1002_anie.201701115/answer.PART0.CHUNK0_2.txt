The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene and hydrogen under specific reaction conditions. Key considerations include optimizing temperature, pressure, and the type of catalyst used. Industrial applications often require high efficiency and selectivity in propene production. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency by causing deactivation and reducing catalyst life. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve the use of water vapor as an oxidant and the incorporation of elements like tin (Sn) that can enhance selectivity and stability. The presence of water vapor suppresses coke deposition during dehydrogenation at high temperatures. After use, the PtSn clusters readily revert to an atomically dispersed state on the ceria support upon oxidation, making the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst fully regenerable without the need for additional chlorine-containing molecules.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在特定反应条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来实现。关键考虑因素包括优化温度、压力以及催化剂的类型。工业应用通常需要高效且选择性高的丙烯生产。焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成会显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失效并降低催化剂寿命。缓解焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生策略包括使用水蒸气作为氧化剂和引入如锡（Sn）这样的元素，以增强选择性和稳定性。水蒸气在高温下可以抑制焦炭沉积。使用后，在氧化作用下，PtSn簇可立即重新分散到氧化铈支持物上，使得PtSn/CeO2催化剂完全可再生，无需额外的氯化物分子。
