[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism."
[2] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[3] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene under certain conditions. Key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The efficiency of the process can be impacted by coke formation on catalysts, especially Pt-based catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration typically involve optimizing reaction conditions, using suitable catalyst materials, and implementing advanced catalyst design principles.

2. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the PDH process enhances the reaction due to the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction. These reactions facilitate the conversion of propane to propene by shifting equilibrium reactions towards the product side.

3. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph of gallium oxide is found to exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity, both in the presence and absence of CO2. It surpasses chromium oxide in activity when CO2 is present.

4. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is attributed to the presence of abundant surface medium-strong acid sites. These sites are associated with coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides.

5. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3, enhancing the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst activity is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.

7. Heterolytic dissociation is suggested as the reaction pathway for the dehydrogenation of propane, and it is enhanced by CO2 due to the existence of specific reaction pathways.

8. H2-TPR and XPS studies indicate that gallium oxide catalysts are hardly reduced below 600°C, suggesting a stable catalyst structure under reaction conditions.

9. The study involves comparing the catalytic performance of various gallium oxide polymorphs in dehydrogenation reactions with and without CO2.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在特定条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。催化剂上焦炭的形成会影响过程效率，特别是铂基催化剂。减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生的方法通常涉及优化反应条件、使用合适的催化剂材料以及采用先进的催化剂设计原则。

2. 在PDH过程中，二氧化碳（CO2）的存在通过逆水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦反应增强了反应。这些反应通过使平衡反应向产品侧移动来促进丙烷转化为丙烯。

3. β-Ga2O3型镓氧化物表现出最高的脱氢活性，无论是否有CO2。在CO2存在的条件下，它甚至比铬氧化物更活跃。

4. β-Ga2O3的高催化活性归因于表面大量中等强度酸性位点的存在。这些位点与配位不饱和Ga3+离子和质子与氧的共轭效应相关联。

5. 提高反应温度有助于β-Ga2O3上CO2的活化，增强脱氢反应。

6. β-Ga2O3催化剂活性的促进作用随着温度的升高而更加明显，特别是在550°C以上。

7. 建议的脱氢路径是丙烷的异裂，其通过存在特定反应途径而被CO2增强。

8. H2-TPR和XPS研究显示，镓氧化物催化剂在600°C以下不易被还原，表明在反应条件下催化剂结构稳定。

9. 研究涉及比较不同镓氧化物多晶形态在有无CO2的脱氢反应中的催化性能。
