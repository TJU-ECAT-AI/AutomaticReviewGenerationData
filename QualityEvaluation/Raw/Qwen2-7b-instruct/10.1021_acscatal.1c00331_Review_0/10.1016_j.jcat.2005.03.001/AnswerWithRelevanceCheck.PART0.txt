          [1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes."
          [2] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity."
          [4] "Since carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
          [5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on catalysts, such as silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and Ga2O3."

          [9] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

          The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into alkenes is increasingly important due to the rising demand for alkenes. High reaction temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions leading to coke and lighter alkanes, decreasing product yield and catalyst deactivation. Carbon dioxide, being a significant greenhouse gas, offers economic and ecological advantages when used as an oxidant in reactions like methane reforming and oxidative coupling. Its promotion in the reaction is noted on catalysts such as silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and Ga2O3. The presence of CO2 increases olefin yield significantly. Higher temperatures aid CO2 activation over β-Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic activity, which is associated with a rich surface of medium-strong acid sites on β-Ga2O3 related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.

          烷烃脱氢为烯烃的过程因其对烯烃需求的增加而变得越来越重要。高温有利于热裂解反应，导致焦炭和较轻烷烃的生成，从而降低产品收率和催化剂活性。二氧化碳作为重要的温室气体，在重整和甲烷氧化偶联等部分氧化反应中被用作氧化剂，具有经济和生态优势。它在如二氧化硅支持的Cr2O3、稀土钒酸盐和Ga2O3等催化剂上的促进作用已被观察到。二氧化碳的存在显著增加了烯烃的产率。提高反应温度有助于β-Ga2O3上CO2的活化，增强其催化活性。β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能与丰富表面的中等强度酸性位点有关，这些位点与配位不饱和Ga3+离子和质子与氧化物之间的共轭效应相关联。二氧化碳对β-Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用在550°C以上更为明显。

          The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, like chromium and iron oxides, with CO2 present, is often thought to follow an oxidation-reduction (redox) mechanism. However, according to experimental findings in this work, since gallium oxide does not readily reduce and does not undergo a reversible redox cycle under reaction temperatures, the redox mechanism may not be applicable to this reaction. Previous studies indicate that hydrogen molecules dissociatively adsorb onto gallium oxide, resulting in the formation of hydrogen (H) and hydrogen ion (H+) species. It has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, producing gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies on gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is likely due to the abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates CO2 activation over β-Ga2O3, and the promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst activity is more evident above 550°C.

          在存在二氧化碳的情况下，如铬和铁氧化物等可还原金属氧化物催化剂上的丙烷或乙烷脱氢，通常认为遵循氧化还原（红/氧化还原）机制。然而，根据本工作的实验结果，由于镓氧化物不易还原，并且在反应温度下不经历可逆的氧化还原循环，该红/氧化还原机制可能不适用于此反应。先前的研究表明，氢分子在镓氧化物上以离散吸附的方式吸附，导致形成氢（H）和氢离子（H+）物种。也有人提出，丙烷可以在镓氧化物上异裂，产生镓氢化物和镓醇类物种。氮三氟化物热重分析（NH3-TPD）研究表明，中等强度的酸性位点在这些催化剂的表面上非常丰富，特别是在β-Ga2O3中。镓氧化物和质子之间的共轭效应将慢步骤（2）替换为快平衡（4）。β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能是由于其表面中等强度酸性位点丰富，这些位点与配位不饱和Ga3+离子和质子与氧化物之间的共轭效应有关。提高反应温度有助于β-Ga2O3上CO2的活化，并且二氧化碳对β-Ga2O3催化剂活性的促进作用在550°C以上更为明显。

          The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, including chromium and iron oxides, with CO2 present, is typically thought to follow an oxidation-reduction (redox) mechanism. However, given the experimental results in this work, since gallium oxide is not easily reduced and does not undergo a reversible redox cycle under reaction temperatures, the redox mechanism may not be applicable to this reaction. Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies of gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). β-Ga2O3 is identified as the most active catalyst because it possesses the highest density of surface acid sites. Thermal programmable reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that approximately 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C; however, this portion of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after the reaction and oxygen regeneration.
