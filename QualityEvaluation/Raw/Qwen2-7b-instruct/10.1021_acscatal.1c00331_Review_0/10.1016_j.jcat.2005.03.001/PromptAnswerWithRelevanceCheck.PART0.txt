<quotes>
[1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity."
[4] "Since carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
[5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on catalysts, such as silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and Ga2O3."
[6] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[7] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[8] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[9] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."
[10] "Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[11] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by specific catalysts. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include maintaining a suitable temperature to balance the desired propene yield and the risk of coke formation, which can decrease catalyst efficiency and require costly regeneration processes. Catalyst types such as β-Ga2O3, Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and silica-supported Cr2O3 are used in PDH processes, and the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the catalytic activity, particularly above 550°C. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is associated with its surface medium-strong acid sites, which facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and oxide, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature can activate CO2, further improving the process efficiency. 

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst and requiring expensive regeneration processes. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using alternative catalyst materials that are less prone to coke deposition, optimizing the reaction conditions to reduce the risk of thermal cracking reactions, and employing advanced catalyst design techniques that enhance the selectivity towards propene and reduce by-product formation. Proper catalyst regeneration methods, such as using oxygen to burn off carbon deposits, can also be employed to restore catalyst activity and prolong the catalyst life.

The use of CO2 in PDH processes not only offers economic benefits due to its availability as a waste product but also contributes to environmental sustainability efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The incorporation of CO2 into the PDH process can help in the utilization of a major greenhouse gas, making the process more eco-friendly and economically viable.

催化脱氢化过程将丙烷转化为丙烯，以满足对烯烃需求的增长。丙烯是生产聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸和丙烯酸的重要原料。提高反应温度有利于丙烷裂解生成焦炭和轻烷烃，导致产品收率下降和催化剂活性降低。近年来，二氧化碳被用作重整和甲烷氧化耦合等部分氧化反应的氧化剂。丙烷的氧化脱氢通过二氧化碳产生的丙烯选择性较高。由于二氧化碳是主要温室气体之一，其在经济和生态上的利用具有吸引力。二氧化碳对反应的促进作用在如二氧化硅支持的Cr2O3、稀土钒酸盐和Ga2O3等催化剂上已被观察到。在存在二氧化碳的情况下，乙烯产量显著增加。提高反应温度有助于β-Ga2O3激活二氧化碳。β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能与丰富的表面中等强度酸性位点有关，这些酸性位点与Ga3+离子的配位不饱和状态和质子与氧化物之间的相互作用有关，促进了脱氢反应。提高反应温度可以激活二氧化碳，进一步提高过程效率。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为它会使催化剂失活并要求昂贵的再生过程。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用更少形成焦炭沉积的替代催化剂材料、优化反应条件以减少热裂解反应风险以及采用先进的催化剂设计技术，提高丙烯选择性并减少副产物生成。适当的催化剂再生方法，如使用氧气烧掉碳沉积物，也可以用来恢复催化剂活性并延长催化剂寿命。

在PDH过程中利用二氧化碳不仅提供了经济效益，因为它是可用的废物产品，而且有助于减少温室气体排放的环境可持续努力。二氧化碳的整合PDH过程有助于利用主要温室气体，使其过程更加环保和经济可行。

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene under certain conditions. Key considerations include selecting suitable reaction conditions, choosing the right catalyst type, and managing industrial applications. 

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts over time. Strategies to mitigate its formation include using catalyst supports, modifying catalyst composition, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

1. Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 is usually thought to follow a redox mechanism. However, experimental results show that gallium oxide, which is hardly reduced under reaction temperatures, does not undergo reversible redox cycles. Therefore, the redox mechanism may not apply to this reaction.

2. The presence of CO2 enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the dehydrogenation reaction. This is likely due to the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2, which transform H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O, shifting the reactions to the product side and improving the total reaction rate. Additionally, CO helps remove carbon deposits from the catalyst surface, improving catalyst stability.

3. Dehydrogenation of propane occurs on gallium oxide through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway. The conjugated effect of protons and oxide in β-Ga2O3 facilitates this pathway and promotes the reaction.

4. β-Ga2O3 is the most active catalyst because it has the highest density of medium-strength acid sites on its surface. These sites enable a faster reaction rate compared to other gallium oxide polymorphs.

5. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C. However, this reducible part of the oxide cannot be restored after the reaction and O2 regeneration. This suggests that the redox cycle between Ga3+ and Ga+ in the initial stages of the reaction might benefit the dehydrogenation reaction, but this observation needs further confirmation.

6. The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over β-Ga2O3 becomes more pronounced above 550°C. This makes β-Ga2O3 the most practical polymorphic form for this type of reaction under the tested conditions.

1. 烷烃如丙烷的直接脱氢化在二氧化碳存在的条件下，通常被认为遵循氧化还原机制。然而，实验结果表明，在反应温度下，几乎不被还原的镓氧化物不会经历可逆的氧化还原循环。因此，该反应可能不适合氧化还原机制。

2. 二氧化碳的存在可以增强脱氢反应的活性和稳定性。这可能归因于水气逆向转换反应和二氧化碳的布杜瓦反应，它们将H2与CO2转化为CO和H2O，使反应向产物侧移动，提高总反应速率。同时，CO有助于从催化剂表面去除碳沉积，改善催化剂稳定性。

3. 丙烷在镓氧化物上的脱氢通过异裂解反应途径发生。镓氧化物中质子和氧化物的共轭效应加速了这一过程，促进了反应。

4. 镓氧化物的β相是最活跃的催化剂，因为它具有最高的中等强度酸性位点密度。这些位点使得反应速率比其他镓氧化物聚合物更快。

5. 大约有15摩尔%的新鲜镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原。但是，反应后和氧气再生后这部分可还原的氧化物无法恢复。这表明反应初期的Ga3+和Ga+之间的氧化还原循环可能对脱氢反应有利，但这个观察结果需要进一步确认。

6. 在550°C以上，二氧化碳对β-Ga2O3上丙烷脱氢的促进作用变得更加明显。这使得β-Ga2O3成为在测试条件下这种类型反应最实用的聚合形式。
