[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism."
[2] "Since gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreversible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction."
[3] "Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of Hand H+ ions."
[4] "Hence it has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species."
[5] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3."
[6] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton is to replace the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4)."
[7] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."
[8] "Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[9] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions by converting propane into propene. Key considerations include choosing suitable catalysts, controlling reaction conditions, and ensuring efficient operation of the process. Catalysts like gallium oxide exhibit high activity in PDH, especially when CO2 is present.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can reduce process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and increasing energy consumption for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with higher resistance to coke deposition, employing catalytic reforming processes, and implementing advanced catalyst design features like support materials and promoter additives.

1. 烷烃脱氢反应（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来生产丙烯。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的催化剂、控制反应条件以及确保过程高效运行。如镓氧化物等催化剂在PDH中表现出高活性，尤其是在CO2存在的情况下。

2. 在铂基催化剂上形成的焦炭会降低过程效率，通过降低催化剂活性并增加再生过程的能量消耗。减少焦炭形成的方法包括使用更抗焦炭沉积的催化剂、采用催化重整过程以及实施先进的催化剂设计特性，例如支持材料和促进剂添加剂。
