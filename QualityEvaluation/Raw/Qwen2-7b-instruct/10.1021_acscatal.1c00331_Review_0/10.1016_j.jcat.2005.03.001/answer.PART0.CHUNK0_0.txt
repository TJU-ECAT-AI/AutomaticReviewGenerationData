[1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity."
[4] "Since carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
[5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on catalysts, such as silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and Ga2O3."

[7] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[8] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[9] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by specific catalysts. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include maintaining a suitable temperature to balance the desired propene yield and the risk of coke formation, which can decrease catalyst efficiency and require costly regeneration processes. Catalyst types such as β-Ga2O3, Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and silica-supported Cr2O3 are used in PDH processes, and the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the catalytic activity, particularly above 550°C. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is associated with its surface medium-strong acid sites, which facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and oxide, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature can activate CO2, further improving the process efficiency. 

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst and requiring expensive regeneration processes. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using alternative catalyst materials that are less prone to coke deposition, optimizing the reaction conditions to reduce the risk of thermal cracking reactions, and employing advanced catalyst design techniques that enhance the selectivity towards propene and reduce by-product formation. Proper catalyst regeneration methods, such as using oxygen to burn off carbon deposits, can also be employed to restore catalyst activity and prolong the catalyst life.

The use of CO2 in PDH processes not only offers economic benefits due to its availability as a waste product but also contributes to environmental sustainability efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The incorporation of CO2 into the PDH process can help in the utilization of a major greenhouse gas, making the process more eco-friendly and economically viable.

催化脱氢化过程将丙烷转化为丙烯，以满足对烯烃需求的增长。丙烯是生产聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸和丙烯酸的重要原料。提高反应温度有利于丙烷裂解生成焦炭和轻烷烃，导致产品收率下降和催化剂活性降低。近年来，二氧化碳被用作重整和甲烷氧化耦合等部分氧化反应的氧化剂。丙烷的氧化脱氢通过二氧化碳产生的丙烯选择性较高。由于二氧化碳是主要温室气体之一，其在经济和生态上的利用具有吸引力。二氧化碳对反应的促进作用在如二氧化硅支持的Cr2O3、稀土钒酸盐和Ga2O3等催化剂上已被观察到。在存在二氧化碳的情况下，乙烯产量显著增加。提高反应温度有助于β-Ga2O3激活二氧化碳。β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能与丰富的表面中等强度酸性位点有关，这些酸性位点与Ga3+离子的配位不饱和状态和质子与氧化物之间的相互作用有关，促进了脱氢反应。提高反应温度可以激活二氧化碳，进一步提高过程效率。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为它会使催化剂失活并要求昂贵的再生过程。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用更少形成焦炭沉积的替代催化剂材料、优化反应条件以减少热裂解反应风险以及采用先进的催化剂设计技术，提高丙烯选择性并减少副产物生成。适当的催化剂再生方法，如使用氧气烧掉碳沉积物，也可以用来恢复催化剂活性并延长催化剂寿命。

在PDH过程中利用二氧化碳不仅提供了经济效益，因为它是可用的废物产品，而且有助于减少温室气体排放的环境可持续努力。二氧化碳的整合PDH过程有助于利用主要温室气体，使其过程更加环保和经济可行。
