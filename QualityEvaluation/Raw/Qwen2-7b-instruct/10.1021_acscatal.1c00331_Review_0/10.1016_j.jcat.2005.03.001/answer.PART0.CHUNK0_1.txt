1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene under certain conditions. Key considerations include selecting suitable reaction conditions, choosing the right catalyst type, and managing industrial applications. 

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts over time. Strategies to mitigate its formation include using catalyst supports, modifying catalyst composition, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques.

3. The catalytic performance of different polymorphs of gallium oxide in propane dehydrogenation depends on their specific surface areas, acidity, and basicity. β-Ga2O3 is the most active catalyst, showing enhanced activity in the presence of CO2.

4. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway, where CO2 activation is facilitated by increasing the reaction temperature. This leads to improved olefin yield and catalyst stability.

5. The promoting effect of CO2 on the reaction is evident at temperatures above 550°C, enhancing the catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3. CO2 contributes to this by accelerating the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions.

6. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts decreases with increasing surface area, as observed in the case of β-Ga2O3.

7. The regeneration of β-Ga2O3 catalysts after reaction demonstrates the ability to recover some of the lost activity, albeit with limitations in fully restoring the initial performance.

1. 烷烃脱氢制丙烯（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过在特定条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯起作用。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、选择正确的催化剂类型以及管理工业应用。

2. 钯基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响了过程效率，因为它会随着时间的推移使催化剂失效。缓解其形成的策略包括使用催化剂支撑、修改催化剂组成以及实施高级再生技术。

3. 不同镓氧化物晶相在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能取决于它们的特定表面积、酸性和碱性。β-Ga2O3是活性最高的催化剂，在二氧化碳的存在下显示出增强的活性。

4. 脱氢反应通过异裂解途径进行，通过提高反应温度促进二氧化碳的激活。这导致了更高的烯烃产率和催化剂稳定性。

5. 在550°C以上的温度下，二氧化碳对反应的促进作用明显，增强了β-Ga2O3的催化活性。二氧化碳通过加速反向水煤气变换和布杜瓦反应来贡献这一点。

6. 催化剂上沉积的焦炭量随表面积增加而减少，如β-Ga2O3的情况所示。

7. β-Ga2O3催化剂的再生显示了恢复部分失去活性的能力，尽管无法完全恢复原始性能。
