1. Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 is usually thought to follow a redox mechanism. However, experimental results show that gallium oxide, which is hardly reduced under reaction temperatures, does not undergo reversible redox cycles. Therefore, the redox mechanism may not apply to this reaction.

2. The presence of CO2 enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the dehydrogenation reaction. This is likely due to the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2, which transform H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O, shifting the reactions to the product side and improving the total reaction rate. Additionally, CO helps remove carbon deposits from the catalyst surface, improving catalyst stability.

3. Dehydrogenation of propane occurs on gallium oxide through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway. The conjugated effect of protons and oxide in β-Ga2O3 facilitates this pathway and promotes the reaction.

4. β-Ga2O3 is the most active catalyst because it has the highest density of medium-strength acid sites on its surface. These sites enable a faster reaction rate compared to other gallium oxide polymorphs.

5. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C. However, this reducible part of the oxide cannot be restored after the reaction and O2 regeneration. This suggests that the redox cycle between Ga3+ and Ga+ in the initial stages of the reaction might benefit the dehydrogenation reaction, but this observation needs further confirmation.

6. The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over β-Ga2O3 becomes more pronounced above 550°C. This makes β-Ga2O3 the most practical polymorphic form for this type of reaction under the tested conditions.

1. 烷烃如丙烷的直接脱氢化在二氧化碳存在的条件下，通常被认为遵循氧化还原机制。然而，实验结果表明，在反应温度下，几乎不被还原的镓氧化物不会经历可逆的氧化还原循环。因此，该反应可能不适合氧化还原机制。

2. 二氧化碳的存在可以增强脱氢反应的活性和稳定性。这可能归因于水气逆向转换反应和二氧化碳的布杜瓦反应，它们将H2与CO2转化为CO和H2O，使反应向产物侧移动，提高总反应速率。同时，CO有助于从催化剂表面去除碳沉积，改善催化剂稳定性。

3. 丙烷在镓氧化物上的脱氢通过异裂解反应途径发生。镓氧化物中质子和氧化物的共轭效应加速了这一过程，促进了反应。

4. 镓氧化物的β相是最活跃的催化剂，因为它具有最高的中等强度酸性位点密度。这些位点使得反应速率比其他镓氧化物聚合物更快。

5. 大约有15摩尔%的新鲜镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原。但是，反应后和氧气再生后这部分可还原的氧化物无法恢复。这表明反应初期的Ga3+和Ga+之间的氧化还原循环可能对脱氢反应有利，但这个观察结果需要进一步确认。

6. 在550°C以上，二氧化碳对β-Ga2O3上丙烷脱氢的促进作用变得更加明显。这使得β-Ga2O3成为在测试条件下这种类型反应最实用的聚合形式。
