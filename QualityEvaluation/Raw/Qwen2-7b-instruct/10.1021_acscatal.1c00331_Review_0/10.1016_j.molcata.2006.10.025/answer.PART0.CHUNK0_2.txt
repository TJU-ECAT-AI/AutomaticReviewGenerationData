The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene through an endothermic reaction. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve operating at temperatures exceeding 550°C to achieve high conversions, while managing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Catalyst types, such as supported platinum, play a crucial role in the efficiency of this process. Industrial applications often require catalysts with high activity and selectivity to produce propene with minimal byproducts. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring costly regeneration procedures. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration typically involve modifying catalyst composition, such as adding zinc, to alter the properties of the platinum metal phase and reduce the size of surface Pt ensembles, weakening the Pt(C C) bond and repulsing coke precursors. This results in enhanced selectivity and stability, allowing for more efficient propene production and reduced operational costs.

The presence of zinc in Pt-based catalysts leads to several changes that improve PDH performance. Zinc increases the dispersion of platinum particles, reveals strong surface interactions over zinc-doped catalysts, and alters the electronic environment of the platinum metal, increasing its electronic density. This increased density weakens the strength of the Pt(C C) bond, promoting olefin desorption and suppressing the formation and polymerization of unsaturated coke precursors. As a result, the amount of coke can be significantly reduced, improving catalyst efficiency and longevity.

催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来实现，这是由于对轻质烯烃如丙烯和异丁烯的需求日益增长。在反应条件方面，需要在超过550°C的温度下操作以实现高转化率，同时管理氢解和结焦反应的速率。铂基催化剂是这一过程中效率的关键因素。工业应用通常要求具有高活性和选择性的催化剂以高效地生产丙烯，同时产生最少的副产品。丙烷脱氢过程中的焦炭形成会降低催化剂活性并导致昂贵的再生程序。减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂再生的策略通常涉及修改催化剂组成，例如添加锌，以改变铂金属相的性质并减小表面铂团簇的尺寸，减弱Pt(C C)键，并排斥焦炭前体。这导致更高的选择性和稳定性，允许更高效的丙烯生产并降低运营成本。

在铂基催化剂中存在锌导致了一系列改进PDH性能的变化。锌增加了铂颗粒的分散度，揭示了锌掺杂催化剂上强烈的表面相互作用，并改变了铂金属的电子环境，增加了其电子密度。这种增加的密度削弱了Pt(C C)键的强度，促进了单烯的脱附并抑制了不饱和焦炭前体的形成和聚合。因此，可以显著减少焦炭的量，提高催化剂的效率和使用寿命。
