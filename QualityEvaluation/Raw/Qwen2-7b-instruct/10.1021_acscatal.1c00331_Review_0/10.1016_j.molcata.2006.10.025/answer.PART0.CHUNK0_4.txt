[1] "The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies. The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/or electronic effect."
[2] "Over the ZnPt/Al catalyst, although the total amount of acidity (calculate from the total desorption peak area) is higher than that over Pt/Al, the strong acid sites of the alumina are poisoned by zinc."
[3] "The TPR profile of ZnSnPt/Al also indicates that strong interactions between zinc, tin, and platinum three components may take place."
[4] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."
[5] "It indicates that the capacity of zinc-doped PtSn catalysts to resist coke is different."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene through an endothermic reaction. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing suitable catalyst types, and managing industrial applications effectively. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing operating conditions, utilizing more robust catalysts, and improving catalyst design to reduce coke deposition.

2. The presence of zinc in Pt-based catalysts leads to a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance, resulting in high propene selectivity. Zinc doping can notably promote the stability and selectivity of the catalyst, partly attributed to the increased dispersion of platinum particles, changes in catalyst acidity, and alterations in the electronic environment of the platinum metal.

3. The TPR profiles of zinc-doped PtSn catalysts show that the presence of zinc can cause strong interactions between zinc, tin, and platinum components, potentially influencing the reduction properties of the catalysts.

4. Zinc can significantly reduce the amount of coke formed on catalysts, contributing to enhanced thermal stability and reduced coke deposition.

5. The capacity of zinc-doped PtSn catalysts to resist coke varies depending on the zinc deposition order and content. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing zinc deposition sequences and content levels, as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms that influence coke distribution across different catalyst types.

1. 丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来实现端热反应。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、选用合适的催化剂类型以及有效管理工业应用。丙烯酸在铂基催化剂上的形成影响了过程效率，导致催化剂活性降低，需要频繁再生催化剂。缓解丙烯酸形成的策略包括优化操作条件、使用更坚固的催化剂以及改进催化剂设计以减少丙烯酸沉积。

2. 锌在铂系催化剂中的存在导致了显著的脱氢性能提升，高丙烯选择性可以被获得。锌掺杂可明显促进催化剂的稳定性和选择性，部分归因于铂颗粒分散度的增加、催化剂酸性的变化以及铂金属电子环境的调整。

3. 锌掺杂铂锡催化剂的温度程序还原（TPR）谱图显示，锌的存在可能会导致锌、锡和铂成分之间的强烈相互作用，可能会影响催化剂的还原性质。

4. 锌可以显著减少催化剂上形成的焦炭量，有助于提高热稳定性并减少焦炭沉积。

5. 锌掺杂铂锡催化剂抵抗焦炭的能力取决于锌沉积顺序和含量。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括优化锌沉积序列和含量水平，以及理解影响焦炭分布的不同催化剂类型的基本机制。
