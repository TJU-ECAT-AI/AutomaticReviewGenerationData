[1] "The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies. The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/or electronic effect."
[2] "For example, the addition of Zn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can promote the selective reduction of NO and improve the resistance of these systems in waste gas treatment processes."
[3] "It has been reported that over Pt/ZnO catalysts high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity could be obtained."
[4] "The formation of PtZn alloy bimetallic phases may also responsible for the high selectivity to propylene over zinc-doped catalysts."
[5] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."
[6] "The analysis of NH3-TPD indicates that over the ZnPt/Al catalyst the strong acid sites are poisoned by zinc, which is beneficial to the reduction of coke formation."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through an endothermic reaction. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions involve operating at high temperatures typically above 550°C to achieve high conversions. Catalyst types, particularly those based on platinum (Pt), are crucial for efficient PDH. The addition of metals like tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) can enhance catalytic performance by promoting desired dehydrogenation reactions, inhibiting unwanted reactions, and improving stability and selectivity. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene, which is a vital feedstock for petrochemical industries.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts and necessitating costly regeneration processes. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include optimizing reaction conditions, modifying catalyst composition and structure, and employing advanced characterization techniques to understand coke deposition mechanisms. For instance, using non-acidic and thermal stable supports, controlling the deposition sequence of catalyst components, and adjusting the metal content can all contribute to better coke management.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产方法的功能是通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来实现脱氢反应。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括在高于550°C的高温下操作以实现高转化率。铂（Pt）基催化剂对于PDH效率至关重要。添加金属如锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）可以增强催化性能，通过促进所需脱氢反应、抑制不希望的反应并提高稳定性和选择性。工业应用包括丙烯的生产，它是石油化工行业的关键原料。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低过程效率，因为这会使催化剂失效，并需要成本高昂的再生过程。减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括优化反应条件、修改催化剂组成和结构以及采用高级表征技术来理解焦炭沉积机制。例如，使用非酸性和热稳定的支撑体、控制催化剂组分的沉积顺序和调整金属含量等方法都可以有助于更好的焦炭管理。
