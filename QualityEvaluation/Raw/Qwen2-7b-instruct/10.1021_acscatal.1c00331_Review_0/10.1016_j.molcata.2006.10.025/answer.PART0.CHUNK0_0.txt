1. Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are crucial for producing light olefins like propylene and isobutene due to increasing demand. The efficiency of these processes relies on factors such as the atomic ratio of tin to platinum (Sn/Pt) in PtSn catalysts, the preparation method, and the interactions between platinum and tin species.

2. The addition of zinc to Pt-based catalysts significantly alters their catalytic performance. This improvement includes better stability and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3. The effectiveness of PtSn catalysts is influenced by various parameters including the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, preparation techniques, and the interactions between platinum and tin components. 

4. Zinc incorporation into Pt catalysts results in enhanced catalytic properties. This is evidenced by improved stability and selectivity in the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. The ZnSnPt/Al catalyst demonstrates an overall enhancement in catalytic performance. 

6. Zinc's presence markedly reduces coke formation on the catalyst surface, improving the catalyst's efficiency and longevity.
