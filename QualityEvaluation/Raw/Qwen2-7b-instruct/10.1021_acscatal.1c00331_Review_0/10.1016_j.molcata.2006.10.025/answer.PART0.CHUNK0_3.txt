[1] "The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies [4-11]. The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/or electronic effect [12]."
[2] "Over the ZnPt/Al catalyst, although the total amount of acidity (calculate from the total desorption peak area) is higher than that over Pt/Al, the strong acid sites of the alumina are poisoned by zinc."
[3] "The amount of coke over zinc-doped PtSn catalysts is also determined by the zinc deposition order."
[4] "The formation of PtZn alloy results in an increase in the electronic density of surface Pt, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and promote desorption of olefin."
[5] "Coke quantitative and TPO tests also show that the amount of coke can be greatly reduced by zinc."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production. Key considerations involve selecting appropriate reaction conditions, employing suitable catalyst types, and optimizing industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency negatively by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include adjusting the reaction conditions, using specific catalyst formulations, and implementing effective catalyst regeneration techniques.

2. The catalytic PDH process utilizes Pt-based catalysts to convert propane into propene. Important factors to consider include the type of catalyst, reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, and the efficiency of the catalyst in maintaining activity and selectivity. Industrial applications often require efficient catalysts that can handle large volumes of feedstock and achieve high conversion rates.

3. The performance of zinc-doped PtSn catalysts is significantly influenced by the sequence in which zinc is deposited. High activity and selectivity are achieved with the Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al catalyst, indicating its potential for efficient PDH. The low amount of coke and high thermal stability of platinum particles contribute to its superior performance.

4. The electronic environment of platinum metal is altered by the presence of zinc. An increase in the electronic density of platinum metal leads to weakened Pt(C C) bond strength, promoting olefin desorption and reducing the formation of unsaturated coke precursors.

5. Coke formation significantly affects the efficiency of PDH processes. Implementing strategies to reduce coke formation, such as optimizing catalyst design, adjusting reaction conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods, can enhance process efficiency and prolong catalyst life.

1.PDH作为丙烯生产的手段，关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、采用适当的催化剂类型以及优化工业应用。焦炭在基于铂的催化剂上的形成会负面影响过程效率，通过催化剂失活降低。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的技术策略包括调整反应条件、使用特定的催化剂配方以及实施有效的催化剂再生技术。

2.PDH过程利用铂基催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。需要考虑的关键因素包括催化剂类型、反应条件如温度和压力，以及催化剂在保持活性和选择性方面的效率。工业应用通常要求能够处理大量原料并实现高转化率的高效催化剂。

3.锌掺杂的PtSn催化剂的性能显著受到锌沉积顺序的影响。Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性，显示其在PDH中的潜力。铂粒子数量少、热稳定性高的原因可能是低焦炭量和高催化剂寿命的贡献。

4.铂金属的电子环境由于锌的存在而发生变化。铂金属电子密度的增加导致Pt(C C)键强度减弱，促进烯烃脱附，减少不饱和焦炭前体的形成。

5.焦炭形成显著影响PDH过程的效率。通过优化催化剂设计、调整反应条件以及改进催化剂再生方法来减少焦炭形成的策略可以增强过程效率并延长催化剂寿命。
