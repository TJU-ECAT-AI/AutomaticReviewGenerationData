1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production through a series of surface reactions involving the adsorption of propane molecules onto a catalyst surface. Key considerations for this process include reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, catalyst type, and the efficiency of the catalyst in promoting the desired reaction pathways while minimizing side reactions. Industrial applications of PDH rely on the use of suitable catalysts to achieve high yields of propene and minimize the formation of coke, which can clog reactors and reduce catalyst activity over time. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using catalysts with high resistance to coking, operating the process under controlled conditions to prevent the accumulation of reactants that contribute to coke formation, and implementing regular catalyst regeneration processes to restore activity.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during the PDH process impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, increasing resistance to gas flow, and potentially altering the active sites on the catalyst that are responsible for the desired reactions. This leads to decreased propene yield and increased energy consumption. To mitigate the formation of coke, one strategy involves using catalyst supports that enhance dispersion of the Pt particles, thereby increasing their stability against sintering and coke deposition. Another approach is to incorporate additives into the catalyst formulation that can act as scavengers for coke precursors or inhibit the formation of coke structures. Additionally, maintaining optimal operating conditions, such as controlling the reaction temperature and pressure, and ensuring efficient gas mixing, can help prevent the accumulation of conditions conducive to coke formation. Regular catalyst regeneration through techniques such as thermal treatment or chemical regeneration can also help restore catalyst performance and extend the operational lifetime of the catalyst.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烷转化为丙烯的方法，通过在催化剂表面上的一系列表面反应实现。生产过程的关键考虑因素包括反应条件，如温度和压力、催化剂类型以及催化剂促进所需反应路径的同时减少副反应的能力。工业应用依赖于合适的催化剂以实现高丙烯产率并最小化焦炭的形成，焦炭可能导致反应器堵塞并降低催化剂活性。为减轻焦炭形成，可以采用策略，如使用具有高抗焦炭性能的催化剂、在控制条件下操作以防止形成导致焦炭积累的反应物，并定期进行催化剂再生以恢复其活性。

2. 在PDH过程中，Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会降低效率，因为这减少了可用于反应的催化剂表面积，增加了气体流动阻力，并可能改变负责所需反应的催化剂活性位点。这导致丙烯产率降低和能耗增加。为了减轻焦炭的形成，可以采用策略，例如使用增强Pt颗粒分散的催化剂支持，从而提高其对抗聚集和焦炭沉积的稳定性。另一种方法是在催化剂配方中加入添加剂，这些添加剂可以作为焦炭前体的清除剂或抑制焦炭结构的形成。此外，保持最佳操作条件，如控制反应温度和压力以及确保气体混合均匀，也可以帮助预防形成导致焦炭积累的条件。定期通过热处理或化学再生等技术进行催化剂再生也可以帮助恢复催化剂性能并延长催化剂的使用寿命。
