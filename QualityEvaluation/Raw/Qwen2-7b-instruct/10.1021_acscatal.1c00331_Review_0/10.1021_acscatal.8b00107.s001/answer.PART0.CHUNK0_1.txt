The scientific literature provides details on the calculations of pre-exponential factors for various surface reactions, including the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH). It outlines methods for calculating these factors for both non-activated and activated adsorption reactions. The literature also includes tables and figures that test surface models and computational setups, assess lateral interactions of co-adsorption species on Pt(111), count reactions under different pressures of H2, depict minimum energy pathways of C-H and C-C breaking, show coverage of adsorption species over time, and illustrate the flow direction of C species in PDH processes. These findings contribute to understanding the efficiency of PDH for propene production and the impact of coke formation on catalyst performance.

该科学文献提供了各种表面反应的预指数因子计算细节，包括丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）。它概述了为非活化吸附和活化吸附反应计算这些因子的方法。文献中还包含了测试表面模型和计算设置的表格、评估Pt(111)上共吸附物种的侧向相互作用、在不同H2压力下计数反应、描绘C-H和C-C断裂的最小能量路径、显示吸附物种随时间的覆盖率、以及说明PDH过程中C物种的流动方向的图表。这些发现有助于理解PDH用于丙烯生产的效果，并了解焦炭形成对催化剂性能的影响。
