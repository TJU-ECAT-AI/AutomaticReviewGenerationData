[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure."
[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for CH bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions."
[3] "In the commercial processes, platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used for catalytic propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The activation of tungsten oxide by hydrogen is attributed to reduction of the metal oxide and presence of multivalent oxidation states."
[5] "Comparison of the catalytic performance of partially reduced WO3x to other highly active metal oxides shows that WO3x exhibits superior catalytic activity and selectivity than Cr2O3 and Ga2O3."
[6] "Severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions."
[7] "The findings of this work provide the possibility for activation of metal oxides for catalytic reactions and the opportunity for the development of new type of catalytic systems utilizing partially reduced metal oxides."
[8] "The activation of tungsten oxide during the propane dehydrogenation as shown in Fig. 4 is attributed to the reduction of the catalyst by the gas mixtures of H2 and C3H8."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by breaking the carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations include achieving the necessary high temperatures, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing the formation of coke on catalyst surfaces, which reduces efficiency and necessitates frequent regeneration. Industrial applications aim to produce propene selectively with minimal byproducts and waste.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by deactivating the catalysts through deposition on their surfaces and sintering of active phases, requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using alternative catalyst materials, optimizing operating conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques.

1.PDH作为丙烷转化为丙烯的方法，通过断裂丙烷分子中的碳氢键来实现丙烯生产。关键考虑因素包括达到必要的高温、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理催化剂表面焦炭的形成，这会降低效率并需要频繁再生。工业应用目标是通过最小化副产品和废物产生，以选择性地生产丙烯。

2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会通过沉积在催化剂表面上和活性相的烧结降低过程效率。为了提高催化剂再生能力，可以采取的策略包括使用替代催化剂材料、优化操作条件以及开发先进的再生技术。
