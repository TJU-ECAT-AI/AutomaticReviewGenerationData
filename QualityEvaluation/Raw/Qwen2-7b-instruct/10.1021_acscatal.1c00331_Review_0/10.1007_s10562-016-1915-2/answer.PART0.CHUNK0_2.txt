[1] "Catalytic processes to produce value-added chemicals from light alkanes have attracted attention as a considerable amount of methane, ethane and propane is available from shale gas reservoirs in a cost-effective manner."
[2] "The fact that propene, a product of dehydrogenation of propane, is used as feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates and other chemical intermediates, motivates the study of propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "In the case of dehydrogenation over metal oxides, the loss of activity and selectivity also arises from the oxidation state change of metal oxides during the reaction because both propane and hydrogen can act as reducing agents at the high temperatures."
[4] "Fully oxidized bulk tungsten oxide, WO3, is inactive for propane dehydrogenation. However, tungsten oxide can be activated by H2 pretreatment and/or co-feeding of H2 during the reaction."
[5] "The reduction and oxidation state change of the tungsten oxide in the H2 environment were confirmed by HR-TEM, XRD and XPS."
[6] "The catalytic activity of the WO3x catalysts strongly depends on the H2 reduction conditions."
[7] "After the H2 pretreatment, the partially reduced WO3x shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity than those of other highly active metal oxides, Cr2O3 and Ga2O3."

1. Catalytic processes converting light alkanes, particularly methane, ethane, and propane, into value-added chemicals are gaining attention due to their economic feasibility from shale gas reservoirs. 

2. Propane dehydrogenation, leading to propene production, is a key process for manufacturing valuable chemicals such as polymers, oxygenates, and other intermediates.

3. During the dehydrogenation of metal oxides, loss of activity and selectivity can occur due to the oxidation state change of the metal oxides, as both propane and hydrogen can function as reducing agents at high temperatures.

4. Bulk tungsten oxide (WO3) is initially inactive for propane dehydrogenation but becomes active upon hydrogen pretreatment or co-feeding of hydrogen.

5. Reduction of tungsten oxide in a hydrogen environment, as determined through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirms its role in the catalytic process.

6. The activity of tungsten oxide catalysts is significantly influenced by the hydrogen reduction conditions.

7. After hydrogen pretreatment, partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3x) displays superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to highly active metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.
