[1] "Catalytic processes to produce value-added chemicals from light alkanes have attracted attention as a considerable amount of methane, ethane and propane is available from shale gas reservoirs in a cost-effective manner."
[2] "The fact that propene, a product of dehydrogenation of propane, is used as feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates and other chemical intermediates, motivates the study of propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Several catalytic dehydrogenation installations for the selective production of propene are under construction or planned."
[4] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species."
[5] "It has been reported that in addition to CrOx, various transition metal oxides, including GaOx, VOx, FeOx, InOx, ZrOx and ZnOx, are active for CH bond activation of propane."
[6] "The increasing worldwide demand for propene also spurs the development of techniques to convert propane to propene exclusively rather than the utilization of conventional processes, yielding propene with low selectivity."
[7] "Severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions."
[8] "It has been shown that the bulk and supported tungsten oxides are catalytically active for dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and isomerization of hydrocarbons."
[9] "To the best of our knowledge, however, the catalytic properties of tungsten oxide for propane dehydrogenation have not been explored despite the fact that it is group VI transition metal oxide along with CrOx, utilized as industrial catalysts."
[10] "Although fully oxidized bulk WO3 is inactive under propane feed condition, co-feeding of H2 and/or H2 pretreatment activates the tungsten oxide."
[11] "Comparison of the catalytic performance of partially reduced WO3x to other highly active metal oxides shows that WO3x exhibits superior catalytic activity and selectivity than Cr2O3 and Ga2O3."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) functions as a method for producing propene by breaking the C-H bonds in propane molecules. Key considerations for PDH include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, choosing effective catalysts, and addressing coke formation issues. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces their efficiency by depositing on the catalyst surface, leading to deactivation and decreased selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using pretreatment methods, such as hydrogen, to activate the catalyst, optimizing operating conditions to prevent excessive coke deposition, and developing new catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation. The document highlights the use of tungsten oxide as an alternative catalyst for PDH, which can be activated by hydrogen treatment and exhibits superior activity and selectivity compared to Pt and Cr-based catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产丙烯的方法，通过断裂丙烷分子中的C-H键来实现。PDH的关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件、有效催化剂的选择以及解决焦炭形成问题。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了其效率，因为它们会在催化剂表面沉积，导致失活和选择性降低。为减轻焦炭形成，可以采用预处理方法，如氢气，激活催化剂；优化操作条件以防止过量焦炭沉积；并开发具有更好焦炭形成抗性的新型催化剂。文献强调了钨氧化物作为PDH的替代催化剂的应用，该催化剂可以通过氢处理激活，并且与Pt和Cr基催化剂相比表现出更高的活性和选择性。
