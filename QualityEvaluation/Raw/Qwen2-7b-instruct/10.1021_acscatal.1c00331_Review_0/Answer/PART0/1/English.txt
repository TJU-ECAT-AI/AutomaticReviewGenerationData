However, severe catalyst deactivation occurs under such conditions, often due to coke deposition and sintering, necessitating the continuous or short-cycle regeneration of catalysts. Developing a catalyst capable of meeting these stringent requirements represents a significant challenge in both theoretical and applied chemistry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.

          Strategies to mitigate coke formation include designing catalysts that reduce side reactions and developing methods for efficient catalyst regeneration.

The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is increasingly utilized to meet the rising demand for propylene, thanks to its high efficiency. Noble platinum (Pt) is frequently employed as an active ingredient due to its superior activity. To tackle the issue of inadequate propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is typically added as a promoter for monometallic Pt catalysts, enhancing propylene selectivity in industrial processes. However, mixing Pt with Sn notably reduces the PDH reaction rate. The gradual catalyst deactivation due to coke formation poses an insurmountable obstacle. The main concerns in PDH are reducing the use of noble metals to cut costs, maintaining high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and boosting the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation. 

         PDH is a structure-sensitive reaction. As the particle size decreases within the range of 19 nm, the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles increases, while the propylene selectivity exhibits an opposing behavior. Smaller Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(211) facets feature a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, making them more reactive for propane conversion. Conversely, larger Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(111) facets display a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts offer innovative solutions for designing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst represents a groundbreaking catalyst with high atom efficiency, excellent dehydrogenation capability, selectivity, and stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, specifically targeting the conversion of propane into propene. This process is significant in contributing to the global propene supply, particularly after its commercial development in the 1980s. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles by controlling the rate of coke formation, thereby increasing propylene productivity. Researchers have studied coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, recognizing that the rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions, such as the pressures of propylene and hydrogen, as well as the concentration of propane. Coke can form on either the metal or the support of the catalyst, with different implications for catalyst deactivation. Controlling the rate of coke formation through adjustments to reaction conditions can minimize its negative impact on process efficiency.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by utilizing a high-yielding reaction pathway.

Key factors in PDH are reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Noble metals like Pt, CrOx, GaOx, and In2O3 are typical catalysts. Pt catalysts are active and selective but lose effectiveness due to coke buildup. Coke formation affects efficiency; mitigation strategies include using low-acidity supports, adding promoters, and adjusting conditions. Catalyst regeneration under oxidizing atmospheres aids in coke removal and activity restoration, requiring careful management to avoid permanent deactivation.
