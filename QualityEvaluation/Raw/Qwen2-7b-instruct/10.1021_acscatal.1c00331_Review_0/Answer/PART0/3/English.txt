The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, including chromium and iron oxides, with CO2 present, is typically thought to follow an oxidation-reduction (redox) mechanism. However, given the experimental results in this work, since gallium oxide is not easily reduced and does not undergo a reversible redox cycle under reaction temperatures, the redox mechanism may not be applicable to this reaction. Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies of gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). β-Ga2O3 is identified as the most active catalyst because it possesses the highest density of surface acid sites. Thermal programmable reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that approximately 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C; however, this portion of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after the reaction and oxygen regeneration.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for this process include the conditions under which the reaction takes place, the type of catalyst used, and the practical applications in industry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts affects the efficiency of the process because it leads to a reduction in the active surface area of the catalyst due to carbon deposition. Strategies to address this issue include operating at lower temperatures, using promoters, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through methods such as hydrogen treatment.

The escalating energy requirements, low selectivity for specific olefins, depletion of petroleum resources, and soaring oil prices are compelling the petrochemical industry to pursue more economical raw materials and more efficient conversion techniques. Recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing or fracking have enabled the cost-effective extraction of substantial volumes of shale gas. This has led to a dramatic decrease in gas prices, making shale gas a highly appealing energy source and feedstock for producing transportation fuels and chemicals, marking a significant shift in the industry's focus.

The study of dehydrogenation reactions spans nearly a century, especially since these reactions are catalyzed by a wide variety of materials, ranging from noble metals to transition metal oxides. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, introduced in 1934, is commonly used to elucidate catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Coke, referring to a family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules, forms on the catalyst surface during the reaction. Evaluating the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts involves plotting the yields of propylene and isobutene alongside the catalyst deactivation rate. Space velocity is regarded as a pivotal factor in comparing the efficiency of dehydrogenation catalysts.
