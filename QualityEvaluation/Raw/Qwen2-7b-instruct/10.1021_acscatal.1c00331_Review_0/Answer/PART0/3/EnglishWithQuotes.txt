Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies of gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). β-Ga2O3 is identified as the most active catalyst because it possesses the highest density of surface acid sites. Thermal programmable reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that approximately 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C; however, this portion of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after the reaction and oxygen regeneration.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001"},
