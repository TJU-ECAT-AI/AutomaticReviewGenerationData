The PDH reaction mechanism involves either the dissociative adsorption of alkane or the second CH bond cleavage, acting as the rate-determining step. Coke, defined as a collective term for highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules, tends to accumulate on the catalyst surface during the reaction, effectively obstructing reactant diffusion to the surface through pore and active site blockage. This leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. For both industrially used Pt and CrOx catalyst formulations, the removal of coke from spent catalyst surfaces might cause irreversible catalyst deactivation if regeneration conditions are not meticulously controlled.
