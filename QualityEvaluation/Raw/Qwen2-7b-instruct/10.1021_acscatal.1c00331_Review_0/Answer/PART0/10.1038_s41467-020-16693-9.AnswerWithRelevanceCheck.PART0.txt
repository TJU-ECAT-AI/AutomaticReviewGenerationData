          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
          [2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields."
          [3] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by leading to deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration of the catalyst."
          [6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the design of catalysts that minimize side reactions and the development of methods for catalyst regeneration."

          Propylene serves as a crucial component in the synthesis of various chemicals including polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. High temperatures (around 600°C) are necessary to achieve sufficient propylene yields due to the endothermic nature of the process. However, severe catalyst deactivation occurs under such conditions, often due to coke deposition and sintering, necessitating the continuous or short-cycle regeneration of catalysts. Developing a catalyst capable of meeting these stringent requirements represents a significant challenge in both theoretical and applied chemistry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.

          Strategies to mitigate coke formation include designing catalysts that reduce side reactions and developing methods for efficient catalyst regeneration.

          丙烯是生产各种化学品（如聚合物、树脂、表面活性剂、染料和药物）的重要基础。由于过程的吸热特性，需要高达600°C的高温以获得足够的丙烯产量。然而，在这种苛刻条件下，催化剂容易因焦炭沉积或熔融而失效，因此必须进行连续或短周期的催化剂再生。在理论和应用化学领域开发能够满足这些严格要求的催化剂是一个巨大的挑战。铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，导致催化剂失效，并需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

          减少焦炭形成的策略包括设计减少副反应的催化剂以及开发高效的催化剂再生方法。

          [1] "The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane."
          [2] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production13."
          [3] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity over time."
          [6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, enhancing the catalyst structure, and improving the reaction conditions."
          [7] "Regeneration methods involve treating the spent catalyst with oxidizing agents like oxygen or air to remove coke deposits."

          Due to the recent shift in steam cracker feedstock from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane, the supply of propylene has decreased. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts is a promising method to meet the growing global demand for propylene production. However, under such harsh conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and sintering is inevitable, necessitating continuous or short-cycle catalyst regeneration. Developing a catalyst capable of meeting these demanding tasks is a significant challenge in both pure and applied chemistry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts decreases their efficiency over time by reducing activity and selectivity. Strategies to combat coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, improving catalyst structure, and optimizing reaction conditions. Catalyst regeneration involves treating spent catalysts with oxidizing agents such as oxygen or air to remove coke deposits.

          由于蒸汽裂解装置的原料从石油基石脑油转向页岩气，丙烯的供应量已有所减少。使用铂或Cr2O3基催化剂进行的催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）是满足全球不断增长的丙烯生产需求的一种有前景的方法。然而，在这种苛刻条件下，催化剂因焦炭沉积和/或熔融而严重失效是不可避免的，因此必须进行连续或短周期的催化剂再生。在纯化学和应用化学领域开发能够满足这些挑战的催化剂是一个巨大的挑战。铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会随着时间的推移降低其效率，通过减少活性和选择性。克服焦炭形成的策略包括修改催化剂表面、改善催化剂结构以及优化反应条件。催化剂再生涉及用氧气或空气等氧化剂处理失效的催化剂，以去除焦炭沉积物。
