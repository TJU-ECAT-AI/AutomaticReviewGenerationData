          The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations for this process include the conditions under which the reaction takes place, the type of catalyst used, and the practical applications in industry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts affects the efficiency of the process because it leads to a reduction in the active surface area of the catalyst due to carbon deposition. Strategies to address this issue include operating at lower temperatures, using promoters, and periodically regenerating the catalyst through methods such as hydrogen treatment.
