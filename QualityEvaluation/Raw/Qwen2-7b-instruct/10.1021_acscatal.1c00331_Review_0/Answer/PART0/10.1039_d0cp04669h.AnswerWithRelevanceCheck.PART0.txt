          PDH catalysis is vital for propene production as demand for propylene rises and steam cracking yields decline with the shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks. Commercial PDH catalysts typically use Pt or Cr, which are costly or hazardous. Earth-abundant metals like iron, forming in situ carbide phases, offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative. Density functional theory (DFT) clarifies why Fe3C surfaces are highly selective in PDH reactions. Carbon-rich surfaces favor propylene production over competing reactions, showing superior selectivity compared to iron-rich surfaces. PDH involves converting propane to propene, with considerations for reaction conditions, catalyst type, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts decreases efficiency by lowering activity and necessitating expensive regeneration. Mitigation strategies involve altering catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and adopting more effective regeneration methods.

          PDH催化对于丙烯生产至关重要，因为随着我们转向更轻的烃类原料，对丙烯的需求增加，而蒸汽裂解的丙烯产量下降。商业化PDH催化剂通常基于铂（Pt）或铬（Cr），这些材料要么昂贵要么有毒。地球丰富的金属如铁，形成原位碳化物相，提供了低成本和环境友好的替代方案。密度泛函理论（DFT）帮助阐明了Fe3C表面在PDH反应中的高选择性。碳富集表面在丙烯生产方面显示出高于铁富集表面的高选择性，特别是在与竞争性裂解反应的竞争中。PDH通过将丙烷转化为丙烯，涉及反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用的关键因素。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成降低了效率，减少了催化剂活性并需要昂贵的再生过程。缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的方法包括改变催化剂组成、提高冷却速率并采用更高效的再生协议。

          [1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important."
          [2] "Recent experimental work has shown that iron-based catalysts can be highly selective for PDH."
          [3] "Earth-abundant and environmentally benign metals form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."
          [4] "Fe3C surfaces are more stable under carbon-rich conditions and show high selectivity for propylene due to a combined decrease in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts affects process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring costly regeneration."
          [6] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include modifying catalyst composition, enhancing cooling rates, and implementing more efficient regeneration protocols."

          Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly crucial. Recent studies have highlighted the high selectivity of iron-based catalysts in PDH processes. Earth-abundant metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that display excellent activity and high selectivity for PDH. Under carbon-rich conditions, Fe3C surfaces remain stable and exhibit high selectivity for propylene production, thanks to a reduction in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and necessitating costly regeneration. To address this, strategies involve adjusting catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and employing more efficient regeneration protocols.

          对非氧化性丙烷脱氢化催化剂的识别变得越来越重要。最近的研究强调了铁基催化剂在PDH过程中的高选择性。地球丰富的金属如铁，形成原位碳化物相，显示出了良好的活性和高选择性PDH。在碳富集条件下，Fe3C表面保持稳定，并且由于丙烯结合能的降低和深层脱氢障碍的增加，表现出对丙烯生产的高选择性。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响了过程效率，减少了催化剂活性并需要昂贵的再生。为解决这一问题，策略包括调整催化剂组成、提高冷却速率并采用更高效的再生协议。
