         The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is increasingly utilized to meet the rising demand for propylene, thanks to its high efficiency. Noble platinum (Pt) is frequently employed as an active ingredient due to its superior activity. To tackle the issue of inadequate propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is typically added as a promoter for monometallic Pt catalysts, enhancing propylene selectivity in industrial processes. However, mixing Pt with Sn notably reduces the PDH reaction rate. The gradual catalyst deactivation due to coke formation poses an insurmountable obstacle. The main concerns in PDH are reducing the use of noble metals to cut costs, maintaining high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and boosting the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation. 

         PDH is a structure-sensitive reaction. As the particle size decreases within the range of 19 nm, the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles increases, while the propylene selectivity exhibits an opposing behavior. Smaller Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(211) facets feature a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, making them more reactive for propane conversion. Conversely, larger Pt nanoparticles with dominant Pt(111) facets display a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts offer innovative solutions for designing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst represents a groundbreaking catalyst with high atom efficiency, excellent dehydrogenation capability, selectivity, and stability.

         丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程正在成为满足日益增长的丙烯需求的重要替代方法，得益于其高效率。由于铂（Pt）的优越活性，它常被用作活性成分。为解决丙烯选择性不足的问题，通常在单金属Pt催化剂中添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂，以提高工业过程中的丙烯选择性。然而，将Pt与Sn混合显著降低了PDH反应速率。由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂逐渐失效是一个不可逾越的难题。PDH的关键考量在于降低贵金属使用以降低成本、维持高丙烯选择性在高活性水平、并提升催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力。

         PDH是一种结构敏感反应。当颗粒尺寸在19 nm范围内减小时，Pt纳米颗粒的催化活性增加，而丙烯选择性表现出相反的行为。具有主导Pt(211)面的小Pt纳米颗粒显示较低的脱氢能垒，使其在丙烷转化方面更为活跃。相反，具有主导Pt(111)面的大Pt纳米颗粒则具有较高的CH键激活能垒和较弱的丙烯结合力。单原子催化剂为设计具有高活性和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂提供了创新途径。Al2O3支持的原子分散的Pt催化剂代表了一种新颖的催化剂，具有高原子效率、优秀的脱氢能力、选择性和稳定性。

         Formation of coke is an insurmountable challenge that gradually diminishes catalyst effectiveness. In propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the essential requirements include (1) minimizing the use of noble metals to reduce production costs, (2) maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels, and (3) enhancing the catalyst's anticoking capacity. PDH is a fully understood structure-sensitive reaction. The performance of catalysts is size-dependent and can be classified into three categories based on activity, selectivity, and stability. When the Pt loading decreases, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy shifts towards higher values, and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species increases. For Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles, CO adsorption bands at 1950 to 2100 cm1 are typically associated with linearly bonded CO on metallic nanoparticle surfaces at either well-coordinated (20802090 cm1) or under-coordinated (20302070 cm1) Pt sites.

         焦炭形成是一个不可克服的问题，逐渐削弱催化剂的有效性。在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中，关键要求包括（1）降低贵金属使用以降低成本；（2）在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；（3）提高催化剂的抗焦化能力。PDH是一种完全了解的结构敏感反应。催化剂性能基于活性、选择性和稳定性取决于尺寸，可以分类为三个类别。当铂负载量减少时，铂4d5/2结合能向更高值移动，氧化铂δ+物种的比例逐渐增加。对于Al2O3支持的Pt纳米颗粒，CO吸附带在1950至2100 cm1通常与金属纳米颗粒表面上协调良好（2080至2090 cm1）或协调不足（2030至2070 cm1）的Pt位点上的线性连接CO相关联。
