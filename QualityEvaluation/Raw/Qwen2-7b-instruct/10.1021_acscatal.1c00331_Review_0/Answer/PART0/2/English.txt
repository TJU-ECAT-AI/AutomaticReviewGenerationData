The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, like chromium and iron oxides, with CO2 present, is often thought to follow an oxidation-reduction (redox) mechanism. However, according to experimental findings in this work, since gallium oxide does not readily reduce and does not undergo a reversible redox cycle under reaction temperatures, the redox mechanism may not be applicable to this reaction. Previous studies indicate that hydrogen molecules dissociatively adsorb onto gallium oxide, resulting in the formation of hydrogen (H) and hydrogen ion (H+) species. It has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, producing gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies on gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is likely due to the abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates CO2 activation over β-Ga2O3, and the promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst activity is more evident above 550°C.

Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly crucial. Recent studies have highlighted the high selectivity of iron-based catalysts in PDH processes. Earth-abundant metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that display excellent activity and high selectivity for PDH. Under carbon-rich conditions, Fe3C surfaces remain stable and exhibit high selectivity for propylene production, thanks to a reduction in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and necessitating costly regeneration. To address this, strategies involve adjusting catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and employing more efficient regeneration protocols.

Due to the recent shift in steam cracker feedstock from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane, the supply of propylene has decreased. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts is a promising method to meet the growing global demand for propylene production. However, under such harsh conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and sintering is inevitable, necessitating continuous or short-cycle catalyst regeneration. Developing a catalyst capable of meeting these demanding tasks is a significant challenge in both pure and applied chemistry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts decreases their efficiency over time by reducing activity and selectivity. Strategies to combat coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, improving catalyst structure, and optimizing reaction conditions.

Formation of coke is an insurmountable challenge that gradually diminishes catalyst effectiveness. In propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the essential requirements include (1) minimizing the use of noble metals to reduce production costs, (2) maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels, and (3) enhancing the catalyst's anticoking capacity. PDH is a fully understood structure-sensitive reaction. The performance of catalysts is size-dependent and can be classified into three categories based on activity, selectivity, and stability. When the Pt loading decreases, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy shifts towards higher values, and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species increases.

A groundbreaking technology emerged in the 1960s for synthesizing the long-chain linear olefins essential for biodegradable detergent production, emphasizing the significance of active sites, thus favoring smaller particle sizes. Two primary mechanisms account for the inactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts: the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, leading to coke coverage and activity decline, and the exothermic nature of the reaction causing the catalyst bed's heat content to plummet swiftly, impacting the dehydrogenation step's duration.

Due to the recent shift in steam cracker feedstock from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane, the supply of propylene has decreased. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts is a promising method to meet the growing global demand for propylene production. However, under such harsh conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and sintering is inevitable, necessitating continuous or short-cycle catalyst regeneration. Developing a catalyst capable of meeting these demanding tasks is a significant challenge in both pure and applied chemistry. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts decreases their efficiency over time by reducing activity and selectivity. Strategies to combat coke formation include modifying the catalyst surface, improving catalyst structure, and optimizing reaction conditions. Catalyst regeneration involves treating spent catalysts with oxidizing agents such as oxygen or air to remove coke deposits.

Formation of coke is an insurmountable challenge that gradually diminishes catalyst effectiveness. In propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the essential requirements include (1) minimizing the use of noble metals to reduce production costs, (2) maintaining high propylene selectivity at high activity levels, and (3) enhancing the catalyst's anticoking capacity. PDH is a fully understood structure-sensitive reaction. The performance of catalysts is size-dependent and can be classified into three categories based on activity, selectivity, and stability. When the Pt loading decreases, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy shifts towards higher values, and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species increases. For Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles, CO adsorption bands at 1950 to 2100 cm1 are typically associated with linearly bonded CO on metallic nanoparticle surfaces at either well-coordinated (20802090 cm1) or under-coordinated (20302070 cm1) Pt sites.

A kinetic mechanism has been proposed to explain the process of coke formation. This mechanism identifies the dimerization of adsorbed propane (C3H6) as the key step leading to coke formation on the metal surface of the Pt catalyst. Propylene in the gas phase can also contribute to coke formation through polymerization, oligomerization, condensation, and cyclization reactions on the support.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by utilizing a high-yielding reaction pathway. Key considerations in PDH involve optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations to maximize propene yield. Catalyst types, especially those based on transition metals like platinum (Pt), are critical in PDH processes, impacting both reaction kinetics and product distribution. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively affects process efficiency, requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include fine-tuning operating conditions, incorporating promoters to enhance catalyst stability, and developing more efficient catalyst materials.

The high energy requirements, low selectivity for specific olefins, declining petroleum reserves, and increasing oil prices are pushing the petrochemical industry to find more economical raw materials and more efficient conversion techniques. Factors such as high energy demand, low olefin selectivity, dwindling oil resources, and rising prices are driving the industry to explore alternative feedstocks and conversion technologies. Coke, a collection of highly graphitized hydrocarbons, tends to accumulate on catalyst surfaces during reactions. Comparisons of propylene and isobutene yields along with catalyst deactivation rates help evaluate the performance of various dehydrogenation catalysts. Space velocity is also considered as a key metric in assessing the efficiency of different dehydrogenation catalysts.

Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, selecting appropriate catalyst types like well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, and understanding the practical applications in industry.

          Furthermore, how does coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impact the process efficiency, and what strategies can be implemented to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration?

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly affect the efficiency of the process and the life of the catalyst. Strategies to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst regeneration involve careful control of reaction conditions and the utilization of specific catalyst design features.

The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, like chromium and iron oxides, with CO2 present, is often thought to follow an oxidation-reduction (redox) mechanism. However, according to experimental findings in this work, since gallium oxide does not readily reduce and does not undergo a reversible redox cycle under reaction temperatures, the redox mechanism may not be applicable to this reaction. Previous studies indicate that hydrogen molecules dissociatively adsorb onto gallium oxide, resulting in the formation of hydrogen (H) and hydrogen ion (H+) species. It has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, producing gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. Nitrogen trifluoride thermogravimetric analysis (NH3-TPD) studies on gallium oxide polymorphs reveal that medium-strength acid sites are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly in β-Ga2O3. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton replaces the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4). The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is likely due to the abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates CO2 activation over β-Ga2O3, and the promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst activity is more evident above 550°C.

Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly crucial. Recent studies have highlighted the high selectivity of iron-based catalysts in PDH processes. Earth-abundant metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that display excellent activity and high selectivity for PDH. Under carbon-rich conditions, Fe3C surfaces remain stable and exhibit high selectivity for propylene production, thanks to a reduction in propylene binding energy and an increase in deep dehydrogenation barriers. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and necessitating costly regeneration. To address this, strategies involve adjusting catalyst composition, improving cooling rates, and employing more efficient regeneration protocols.
