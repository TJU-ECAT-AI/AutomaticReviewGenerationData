The petrochemical industry is being driven to look for more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies due to the high energy demands, low selectivity for specific olefins, diminishing petroleum resources, and escalating oil prices. Advances in fracking technology have made it possible to extract large quantities of shale gas at reasonable costs. Consequently, the significant reduction in gas prices has rendered shale gas a highly attractive alternative for both energy generation and as a feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals.

The high energy requirements, low selectivity for specific olefins, dwindling oil reserves, and rising oil prices are compelling the petrochemical industry to seek more cost-effective feedstocks and efficient conversion methods. Hydraulic fracturing technologies have advanced to enable the cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas. The increased supply of natural gas has led to a significant decrease in gas costs, making shale gas an attractive source of energy and raw material for transportation fuels or chemicals. The US currently obtains a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this figure is anticipated to grow further due to the emphasis on energy independence. As per Table 1, shale gas contains substantial amounts of natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas. This has transformed the US into the world's lowest-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as evidenced by the 126 investment projects totaling $84 billion by September 2013, according to the American Chemistry Council. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation hinges largely on the price difference between propane and propylene, which renders current market conditions highly favorable. Further increases in US shale gas production are expected due to a focus on energy independence. A technology for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents was developed in the 1960s. It was discovered that step sites are more reactive, with a lower energy barrier for propylene formation (2434 kJ/mol) compared to the flat surface (6372 kJ/mol). Calculating the turnover frequency (TOF) was not feasible due to the lack of Pt dispersion values in most of the references in Table 3. Dehydrogenation is a one-step process that converts light paraffins into corresponding olefins and hydrogen. These side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites not necessary for dehydrogenation, enabling high olefin yields through careful catalyst design. While this method is better suited for isobutene dehydrogenation, membrane permeability can withdraw hydrogen, favoring higher olefin yields. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined mainly by the price difference between propane and propylene. Coke deposition requires frequent catalyst regeneration through combustion. The high temperatures involved in both regeneration and dehydrogenation lead to the agglomeration or sintering of platinum nanoparticles, causing catalyst deactivation. Promoters can modify platinum properties and inhibit side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization, possibly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters. Adding CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances chromium dehydrogenation catalyst activity by removing evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards product formation.
