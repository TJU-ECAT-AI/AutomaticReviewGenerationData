The petrochemical industry is being pushed to find more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion methods due to the high energy requirements, low selectivity for specific olefins, depleting petroleum resources, and increasing oil prices. Fracking technologies have advanced, enabling the cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas. This has led to a substantial decrease in gas prices, making shale gas an attractive option for both energy and as a feedstock for transportation fuels or chemicals.

In the 1960s, a novel technology emerged for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins used in biodegradable detergents. Factors such as high energy demands, low olefin selectivity, diminishing oil reserves, and rising oil prices are prompting the petrochemical industry to seek more cost-effective raw materials and efficient conversion methods. Hydraulic fracturing technologies have advanced to enable the extraction of large volumes of shale gas at reasonable costs. The increased availability of natural gas has led to a significant decrease in gas prices, making shale gas an attractive energy source and raw material for producing transportation fuels or chemicals. Shale gas deposits contain substantial amounts of natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas. The US has become a low-cost chemical producer due to the growth in shale gas production, with investments totaling $84 billion by September 2013. Propane dehydrogenation profits from the price gap between propane and propylene. Further expansion of US shale gas production is anticipated due to the focus on energy independence. A new technology for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents was developed in the 1960s. It was observed that step sites are more reactive, with a lower energy barrier for propylene formation (2434 kJ/mol) compared to the flat surface (6372 kJ/mol). The turnover frequency (TOF) cannot be calculated due to missing Pt dispersion values in most references in Table 3. Dehydrogenation is a one-step process converting light paraffins into corresponding olefins and hydrogen. Side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites, enabling high olefin yields with precise catalyst design. Membrane permeability can withdraw hydrogen, favoring higher olefin yields, but is more applicable to dehydrogenating isobutene. Propane dehydrogenation profitability is largely influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene. Coke deposition requires frequent catalyst regeneration through combustion. High temperatures during regeneration and dehydrogenation lead to platinum nanoparticle aggregation, causing catalyst deactivation. Promoters can modify platinum properties and inhibit side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Adding CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances chromium dehydrogenation catalyst activity.
