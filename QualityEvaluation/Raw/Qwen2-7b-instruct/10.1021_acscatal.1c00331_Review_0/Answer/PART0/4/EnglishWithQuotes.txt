Factors such as high energy demands, low olefin selectivity, diminishing oil reserves, and rising oil prices are prompting the petrochemical industry to seek more cost-effective raw materials and efficient conversion methods. Hydraulic fracturing technologies have advanced to enable the extraction of large volumes of shale gas at reasonable costs. The increased availability of natural gas has led to a significant decrease in gas prices, making shale gas an attractive energy source and raw material for producing transportation fuels or chemicals. Shale gas deposits contain substantial amounts of natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas. The US has become a low-cost chemical producer due to the growth in shale gas production, with investments totaling $84 billion by September 2013. Propane dehydrogenation profits from the price gap between propane and propylene. Further expansion of US shale gas production is anticipated due to the focus on energy independence. A new technology for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents was developed in the 1960s. It was observed that step sites are more reactive, with a lower energy barrier for propylene formation (2434 kJ/mol) compared to the flat surface (6372 kJ/mol).
