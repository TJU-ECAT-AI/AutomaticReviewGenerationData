Despite the superior performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, concerns such as catalyst poisoning, high Pt cost, and environmental issues related to Cr usage have led to the exploration of alternatives. Vanadium oxides are active for numerous hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the species formed, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominating at higher loadings. When coke is removed via catalyst calcination, further deactivation occurs as vanadium oxide species coalesce, forming larger V2O5 crystals or mixed oxides like AlVO4, which are less active. Alumina is typically used as a vanadium oxide catalyst support, but Sokolov et al. found that doping alumina with silica enhances catalyst stability and activity. Molybdenum oxides are also utilized as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. Molybdenum oxide chemistry mirrors that of vanadium oxide, with Mo appearing as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, contingent on molybdenum loading, support type, and catalyst preparation conditions. Catalysts rapidly deactivate due to coke formation, typically offering low conversion and selectivity. Consistent with MoOxCy's role in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. demonstrated that MoO3 deposited on SiC exhibits significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains debatable. Testing silica-supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, for isobutane dehydrogenation revealed superior performance compared to their respective oxides. Indium shares many catalytic properties with gallium, notably in NOx reduction. Halasz et al. found that both Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts are active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is commonly employed to explain catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. While metal oxide catalysts can achieve comparable yields to Pt-based formulations, Pt catalysts can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts. Dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases ensures the catalyst remains in its most active state. UVvis spectroscopy allows for measurement of the relative amounts of active chromia and irreversibly deactivated chromium due to migration into the support, providing insight into when catalyst replacement is necessary.
