        The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a pivotal method for propene production, driven by the escalating demand for alkenes. High temperatures, while advantageous for propene generation, often lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation, thereby reducing product yield. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a significant greenhouse gas, has been recognized for its capability to enhance the PDH process by increasing olefin yield and promoting reactions on catalysts like silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and β-Ga2O3. Its utilization is economically and ecologically beneficial, particularly at temperatures exceeding 550°C, where it effectively activates β-Ga2O3, indicating its potential for improving catalyst performance and mitigating coke formation.

        The process of propane dehydrogenation to produce propene is crucial, with key considerations encompassing optimized reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The efficiency of PDH processes can be notably impacted by coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which reduces the surface area available for reactions, necessitating strategies to mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration. Promoters such as Sn can be employed to enhance catalyst activity and stability, addressing the critical challenge in PDH processes.

        Earth-abundant and environmentally benign metals, such as iron, have shown promise in forming in situ carbide phases that exhibit high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include modifying catalyst composition, enhancing cooling rates, and implementing more efficient regeneration protocols.

        In the face of the growing demand for propylene and the decline in propylene production from steam cracking, PDH catalysis emerges as an attractive method for propene production. Commercialized PDH catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are either expensive or toxic. Earth-abundant metals, particularly iron, form in situ carbide phases that offer a cost-effective, eco-friendly alternative. The high selectivity of Fe3C surfaces in PDH reactions, along with the strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, highlights the ongoing advancements in propene production technology.

        The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane functions as a method for propene production, influenced by the choice of catalysts and optimized reaction conditions. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency, necessitating strategies to mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration. The integration of emerging technologies and innovative methodologies promises to address the critical challenge of coke formation and enhance the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

        The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production, where propane molecules undergo a thermal decomposition to form propene and hydrogen. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the presence of a suitable catalyst. Catalysts play a critical role in the efficiency of the PDH process, with noble metals like platinum (Pt) being widely used due to their superior activity. However, coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve optimizing operating conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and using catalyst supports. Earth-abundant metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH, offering cost-effective and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional Pt or Cr catalysts. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on the reaction has been observed on catalysts like silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and β-Ga2O3, boosting olefin yield. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is likely associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxides, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and enhances olefin yield.

        coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure. Coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation. Carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, making its use not only economically but also ecologically attractive for catalyst promotion. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550°C, facilitating the activation of CO2 and enhancing olefin yield.

        The demand for propylene is increasingly being met by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to its high efficiency. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. To address the problem of unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, tin (Sn) is typically added as a promoter for monometallic Pt catalysts to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using supports with low Brnsted acidity, adding promoters, and controlling reaction conditions.

        coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact process efficiency by leading to deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration of the catalyst. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for cost reduction, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The catalytic activity on Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the particle size in the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves in an opposite manner. Smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and are more reactive for propane conversion, but large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces exhibit a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts are providing new approaches for designing desired propane dehydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity.

        PDH is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability. This demonstrates the potential of advanced catalyst design for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient and eco-friendly catalysts for PDH, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and improving catalyst regeneration techniques. Additionally, the integration of CO2 utilization and the exploration of single-atom catalysts could provide new pathways for enhancing the performance of PDH processes. These developments would not only address the critical challenges of coke formation and catalyst deactivation but also contribute to the broader goals of sustainable chemical production and environmental protection.

        The references provided offer a solid foundation for these discussions, highlighting the complexities and opportunities in PDH technology. As we continue to refine our understanding of the PDH process, the insights gained from these studies will inform and guide the next generation of catalyst designs and operational strategies, paving the way for more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally responsible propene production.

        The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) efficiently transforms propane into propene via a chemical reaction, influenced by optimal temperature, pressure, and catalyst choice. Key considerations for PDH include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Catalysts, particularly those based on transition metals like platinum (Pt), play a crucial role in the PDH process, affecting both the reaction kinetics and product distribution. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts hinders efficiency, necessitating strategies to mitigate its formation and improve catalyst regeneration.

        The demand for propylene is increasingly being met by PDH due to its high efficiency and selectivity. The use of noble Pt is widespread for its superior activity, often enhanced with tin (Sn) for improved selectivity in the industry process. However, the incorporation of Sn significantly reduces the reaction rate of PDH. The critical challenge of coke formation on Pt catalysts is a major concern, leading to a decrease in catalyst activity and selectivity, thus requiring frequent regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing operating conditions, using catalyst supports with low Brnsted acidity, and developing more efficient catalyst materials.

        The catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the particle size in the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves in an opposite manner. Smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and are more reactive for propane conversion, whereas larger Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces exhibit a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts provide new avenues for designing desired propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability.

        The process of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a crucial method for producing propene from propane, functioning by breaking the C-H bonds in propane, yielding propene and hydrogen as products. Catalysts play a critical role in the efficiency of the PDH process, with common catalysts including noble metals like platinum (Pt), chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium oxide (GaOx), and indium oxide (In2O3). Pt-based catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity but can deactivate quickly due to coke formation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using supports with low Brnsted acidity, adding promoters, and controlling reaction conditions.

        Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. Due to the endothermic nature of the process, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600°C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles. Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry.

        PDH functions by converting propane into propene, with key factors including reaction conditions, catalyst type, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the surface area available for reactions, necessitating strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration.

        In summary, the PDH process for propene production is characterized by its reliance on optimized reaction conditions, catalyst selection, and industrial applications. Pt catalysts, despite their high activity and selectivity, face challenges with coke formation, requiring strategies to mitigate its formation and enhance catalyst regeneration. Future research efforts might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to address these challenges and improve the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.

            The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) efficiently converts propane to propene through optimized conditions and transition metal catalysts, notably platinum (Pt). Critical factors include temperature, pressure, and reactant concentration for maximum propene yield. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts diminishes efficiency, necessitating periodic regeneration. Mitigation strategies involve tuning operational parameters, enhancing catalyst stability through promoters, and developing more effective catalyst materials.

            The demand for propylene is increasingly being met by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to its high efficiency. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. To address the problem of unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, Sn is typically added as a promoter for monometallic Pt catalysts to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. Coke formation is an insuperable issue that gradually deactivates the catalyst.

            PDH is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction. The catalytic activity on Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the particle size in the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves in an opposite manner. Smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) facets reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and are more reactive for propane conversion, but large Pt(111) facets exhibit a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. Single-atom catalysts are providing new approaches for designing desired propane dehydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity.

            The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability. The process of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a crucial method for producing propene from propane, functioning by breaking the C-H bonds in propane, yielding propene and hydrogen as products. Key considerations for PDH include optimized reaction conditions, selection of catalyst types, and industrial applications. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by leading to deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration of the catalyst.

            Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the design of catalysts that minimize side reactions and the development of methods for catalyst regeneration. 

            The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. High temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation. Carbon dioxide, a significant greenhouse gas, promotes reactions like methane reforming and oxidative coupling, increasing olefin yield on catalysts such as silica-supported Cr2O3, rare earth vanadates, and β-Ga2O3. The use of CO2 enhances β-Ga2O3's catalytic activity, attributed to its rich surface of medium-strong acid sites, boosting olefin production.

            Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide. Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550°C, making it an effective solution to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration.

            In summary, PDH is a versatile process for propene production, with a focus on optimizing conditions, selecting catalysts, and managing coke formation. The integration of emerging technologies and materials promises to further enhance efficiency and sustainability in the PDH process.

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of next-generation catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability, particularly those capable of operating under mild conditions to reduce coke formation and energy consumption. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in process control and optimization could also play a pivotal role in improving the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of multiple catalysts or the combination of PDH with other processes, such as carbon capture and utilization, presents a promising avenue for achieving a circular economy and reducing environmental impact.
            
            The future of PDH technology is likely to see a convergence of traditional catalytic methods with modern materials science, chemical engineering principles, and digital technologies. This interdisciplinary approach will not only enhance the economic viability of PDH but also contribute to the broader goals of sustainability and resource efficiency in the petrochemical industry.
