The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a significant process for the efficient conversion of propane into propene, an essential component in the petrochemical industry. This process involves the use of a catalyst to facilitate the reaction under controlled conditions, optimizing both yield and selectivity. Key process characteristics include high temperature and pressure, which are crucial for achieving the desired conversion rates and product purity. In terms of catalyst performance, platinum (Pt)-based catalysts have proven to be highly effective due to their ability to promote the dehydrogenation reaction with minimal side reactions. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of Pt-based catalysts is the formation of coke, a carbonaceous deposit that can accumulate over time, leading to a decrease in catalyst activity and efficiency. The coke formation not only reduces the overall productivity of the PDH process but also necessitates costly maintenance and regeneration procedures to restore the catalyst's performance. Ongoing research focuses on developing more robust catalysts that can mitigate coke formation or on improving process conditions to enhance catalyst longevity, aiming to optimize the PDH process for sustainable and economically viable propene production.
