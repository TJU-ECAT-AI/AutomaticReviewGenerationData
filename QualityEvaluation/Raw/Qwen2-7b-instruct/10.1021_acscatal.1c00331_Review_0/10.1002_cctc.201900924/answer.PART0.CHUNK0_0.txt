1. Cobalt-based catalysts on various forms of alumina are utilized in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Metal cobalt catalyzes the side reaction resulting in carbon formation. The primary reason for catalyst deactivation is coke deposition.

2. The selection of a catalyst is crucial for an economically viable and environmentally friendly dehydrogenation reaction. 

3. Wang et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of a Co/SiO2 catalyst in a membrane reactor for oxidative PDH. Their system exhibited the highest activity with stable performance for 50 hours of operation, showing minimal coke deposition compared to other reported systems in the literature.

1. 使用不同形态的氧化铝支持的钴基催化剂在非氧化性丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中被测试。金属钴催化了形成碳的副反应。催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积。

2. 选择一种经济可行且环保的催化剂对于脱氢反应至关重要。

3. Wang等人的研究表明，基于Co/SiO2的催化剂在膜反应器中具有氧化PDH的高效性。他们的系统在长达50小时的操作过程中表现出最高的活性和稳定的性能，并且显示出了比文献中报道的其他膜反应器PDH的焦炭沉积量要少。
