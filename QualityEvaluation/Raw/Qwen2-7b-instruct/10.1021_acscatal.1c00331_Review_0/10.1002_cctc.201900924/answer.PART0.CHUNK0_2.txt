1. Cobalt-supported catalysts on different morphologies of alumina were utilized for PDH reaction. Higher metal support interaction and tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 led to propylene formation. Strongly adsorbed propylene resulted in cracking to produce lower hydrocarbons and carbon. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation was coke deposition.

2. The development of an economically viable and environmentally friendly catalyst is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. Cobalt-based catalysts supported on silica and alumina are widely recognized for their promising performance in processes like the Fischer-Tropsch process.

3. Isolated cobalt oxide demonstrated high selectivity for propylene at 550°C, but selectivity decreased at higher temperatures (650°C).

4. Mesoporous cobalt aluminate spinel exhibited higher conversion and selectivity at 600°C, attributed to the well-dispersed Co+2 in the alumina matrix.

5. In-situ DRIFTS analysis unveiled the interaction of propane and propylene gases with the catalyst.

1. 不同形态的氧化铝支持的钴催化剂被用于丙烷脱氢反应。更高的金属负载和四面体配合的Co+2导致丙烯生成。强烈吸附的丙烯导致裂解产生较低的烃类和碳。催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积。

2. 开发经济可行且环境友好的催化剂对于脱氢反应至关重要。基于钴的催化剂在硅和氧化铝上广泛接受，其性能在费希尔-特罗普斯过程和其他重要反应中表现出色。

3. 分离的钴氧化物在550°C时显示出高选择性生成丙烯，但随着温度升高至650°C，选择性降低。

4. 纳米孔多孔钴铝酸盐表现出在600°C时较高的转化率和选择性，归因于铝酸盐矩阵中分散良好的Co+2。

5. 在线DRIFTS分析揭示了丙烷和丙烯气体与催化剂的相互作用。
