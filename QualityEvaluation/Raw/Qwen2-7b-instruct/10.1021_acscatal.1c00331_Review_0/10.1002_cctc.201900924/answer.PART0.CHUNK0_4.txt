The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane molecules into propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include selecting appropriate reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and choosing suitable catalyst types that facilitate the desired reaction pathways while minimizing side reactions. Industrial applications of PDH focus on efficiently producing propene for use in the petrochemical industry. 

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by covering active sites, reducing catalyst activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve modifying the catalyst composition to enhance stability, optimizing reaction conditions to reduce coke formation propensity, and developing effective regeneration processes that remove deposited coke without causing significant catalyst degradation.

In the context of the study, different morphologies of alumina (γ-Al2O3) were used as supports for cobalt-based catalysts. The support's surface properties, metal-support interaction, and presence of Lewis acidic centers were found to influence the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was identified as a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The interaction of propane and propylene with the catalyst was studied using in-situ DRIFTS analysis, providing insights into the sources of carbon deposition and potential mechanisms involved in the deactivation process.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过将丙烷分子转化为丙烯和氢气来实现丙烯生产。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的反应条件，如温度和压力，并选择适合促进所需反应路径同时减少副反应的催化剂类型。PDH在石化行业的工业应用侧重于高效生产丙烯。

焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会降低过程效率，因为覆盖活性位点，降低催化剂的活性和选择性。减轻焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生的策略包括修改催化剂组成以增强稳定性，优化反应条件以减少焦炭形成倾向，以及开发有效去除沉积焦炭而不造成催化剂显著降解的再生过程。

在此研究中，使用了不同形态的氧化铝（γ-Al2O3）作为钴基催化剂的支持体。支持体的表面性质、金属-支持相互作用和存在Lewis酸性中心被发现影响了丙烷脱氢的催化活性。焦炭沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因。使用原位DRIFTS分析研究了丙烷和丙烯与催化剂的相互作用，提供了有关碳沉积来源和可能涉及的失活机制的见解。
