[1] "In contrast, the Co/Al2O3NP showed the lowest selectivity towards propylene due to the presence of metallic cobalt as shown from XRD and XPS analysis."
[2] "This catalyst also contains a lower percentage of strong Lewis acidic center when compared to Co/Al2O3NS and Co/Al2O3NF, as shown in Table2."
[3] "The formation of filamentous carbon was severe in the case of Co/Al2O3NP due to the formation of metallic cobalt."
[4] "The presence of weakly interacting cobalt oxide on the surface of support leads reduction of CoO/Co3O4 to form metallic cobalt, which enhances the cracking reaction."
[5] "Carbon deposition on Co/Al2O3NS led to the deactivation of the catalyst with time."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Co/Al2O3NP catalyst showed the lowest selectivity for propylene production due to the formation of metallic cobalt, which promotes side reactions.
2. The Co/Al2O3NP catalyst had a lower percentage of strong Lewis acidic centers compared to the other catalysts.
3. The severe formation of filamentous carbon in the Co/Al2O3NP catalyst was attributed to the formation of metallic cobalt.
4. The reduction of weakly interacting cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt on the catalyst surface enhances the cracking reaction.
5. The deactivation of the Co/Al2O3NS catalyst over time was caused by carbon deposition on the catalyst.

1. Co/Al2O3NP催化剂因形成金属钴，表现出最低的丙烯选择性。
2. Co/Al2O3NP催化剂具有与其它催化剂相比更低比例的强Lewis酸中心。
3. Co/Al2O3NP催化剂中形成严重纤维状碳的原因是形成金属钴。
4. 催化剂表面弱相互作用的钴氧化物的还原为金属钴，增强裂解反应。
5. Co/Al2O3NS催化剂随时间失活是由催化剂上的碳沉积引起的。
