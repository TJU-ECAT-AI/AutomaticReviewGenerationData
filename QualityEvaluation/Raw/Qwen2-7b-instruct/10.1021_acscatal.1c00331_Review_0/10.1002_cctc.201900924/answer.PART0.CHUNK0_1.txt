The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene under specific reaction conditions. Key considerations include the use of suitable catalyst types, reaction conditions, and industrial applications. Catalysts such as cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of alumina (γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF), and nano-plate (Al2O3NP)) were synthesized and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Metal support interaction and Lewis acidic center play a crucial role in the reaction. A higher metal support interaction was observed in Co/Al2O3NS, leading to higher propylene selectivity. The presence of metallic cobalt promotes side reactions, leading to carbon formation. Strongly adsorbed propylene results in cracking to produce lower hydrocarbons and carbon, causing catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration are discussed in the study.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst and reducing selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using suitable catalyst types, optimizing reaction conditions, and implementing effective regeneration processes.

Answer: The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane serves as a method for propene production, focusing on the selection of appropriate catalyst types, reaction conditions, and industrial applications. Metal support interaction and Lewis acidic center play critical roles in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Cobalt-based catalysts supported on various morphologies of alumina were found to have higher metal support interaction, enhancing propylene selectivity. The presence of metallic cobalt in the catalyst promotes side reactions, leading to carbon formation and catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve careful selection of catalyst types, optimization of reaction conditions, and implementation of effective regeneration methods.

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts hinders the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process, reducing selectivity. To address this issue, various strategies can be employed, such as using alternative catalyst materials, optimizing operational conditions, and developing advanced regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity and prolong its useful life.
