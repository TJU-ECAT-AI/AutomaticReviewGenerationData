1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through an endothermic reaction. Key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. The process requires high temperatures and can be influenced by the partial pressure of propane and the catalyst used. Platinum-based catalysts are commonly employed due to their high selectivity and durability, although they face challenges such as coke formation which can degrade their performance and stability. Coke formation can be mitigated through various strategies such as cofeeding reductive gases, alloying Pt with second metals, modifying the nature of supports, and adjusting the size of the catalyst particles.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by covering the metal catalysts and blocking access to the active sites, leading to decreased reactivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include cofeeding reductive gases, alloying Pt with second metals like Sn, modifying the nature of supports to favor specific reactions, and adjusting the size of the catalyst particles. Additionally, computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) provide insights into the deactivation mechanism and help in understanding the complex reaction network of PDH.

1. 烷烃丙烷通过催化脱氢反应转化为丙烯，这一方法是丙烯生产的重要途径。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。该过程需要高温，并且受丙烷分压和所用催化剂的影响。铂基催化剂因其高选择性和耐用性而被广泛使用，但它们面临的问题是焦炭形成，这会严重损害其性能和稳定性。通过各种策略可以减少焦炭形成，例如共喂养还原性气体、将铂与第二种金属合金化、修改支撑材料以促进特定反应、调整催化剂颗粒尺寸等。

2. 在铂基催化剂上形成的焦炭会覆盖金属催化剂并阻塞活性位点，导致活性和稳定性下降，从而影响过程效率。减少焦炭形成的方法包括共喂养还原性气体、将铂与第二种金属（如锡）合金化、修改支撑材料以促进特定反应、调整催化剂颗粒尺寸等。此外，基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟提供了脱活机制的洞察，并帮助理解PDH的复杂反应网络。
