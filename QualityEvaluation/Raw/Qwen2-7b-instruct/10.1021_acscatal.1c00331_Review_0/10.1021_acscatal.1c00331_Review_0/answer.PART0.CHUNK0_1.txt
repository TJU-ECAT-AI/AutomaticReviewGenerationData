1. Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production, particularly through the use of platinum-based catalysts in the Oleflex process from the UOP company, which allows for the production of polymer-quality propylene. The conventional routes of obtaining propene involve stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are energy-intensive and selective. The abundance of light alkanes, including propane, following the discovery of shale gas worldwide, offers new opportunities for propene production.
2. Coke formation during the PDH reaction negatively impacts catalytic performance and stability. Various methods have been proposed in literature to reduce coke formation, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, and the use of second metals such as tin (Sn) as promoters. These promoters can constrain the platinum (Pt) in a small ensemble, reducing side reactions. Additionally, controlling the nature of the support material is crucial, as acid sites on the support may favor side reactions like polymerization. Different strategies, such as using small-sized Pt particles or single Pt atom catalysts, have been explored to mitigate coke formation. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) offer insights into the deactivation mechanisms of PDH catalysts.
3. The review aims to provide a comprehensive description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH, focusing on the origin and nature of coke, which has been inadequately discussed in previous reviews. The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, and the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated. Furthermore, the review discusses catalyst regeneration and outlines future improvements for enhancing the stability of metal catalysts in the conversion of short alkane molecules.

1. 催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，特别是通过UOP公司的Oleflex工艺中的铂基催化剂，允许生产聚合级丙烯。传统的丙烯获取途径涉及石油副产品的流体或催化裂解，这些过程能耗高且选择性低。随着全球页岩气发现的大规模增加，轻烷烃，如丙烷的丰富为丙烯生产提供了新机遇。
2. PDH反应中焦炭的形成严重削弱了催化剂的性能和稳定性。文献中提出了多种减少焦炭形成的方法，包括在丙烷中加入还原气体如氢气，以及使用第二金属如锡（Sn）作为促进剂。这些促进剂可以限制铂（Pt）在小团簇中，减少副反应。此外，控制支持材料的性质至关重要，因为支持材料上的酸性位点可能促进副反应，如聚合化。不同策略，如使用小尺寸的Pt颗粒或单个Pt原子催化剂，已被探索以减少焦炭形成。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟提供了关于PDH催化剂失活机制的重要见解。
3. 该综述旨在提供对PDH中铂催化剂上焦炭形成的全面描述，重点关注焦炭的起源和性质，这是之前综述中讨论不足的。还研究了焦炭形成的动力学方面，并详细阐述了抑制焦炭发展的不同方法的发展与比较。此外，综述讨论了催化剂再生以及增强短烷烃分子催化转化过程中金属催化剂稳定性的未来改进方案。
