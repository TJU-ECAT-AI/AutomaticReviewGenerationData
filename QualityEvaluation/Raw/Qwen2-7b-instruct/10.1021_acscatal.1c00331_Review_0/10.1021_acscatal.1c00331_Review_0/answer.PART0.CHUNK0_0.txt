[1] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."
[2] "With the large-scale Shale gas discovery worldwide, (24) the abundance of light alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane open new opportunities to propene production."
[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide."
[4] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
[5] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[6] "There are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[7] "It is indicated that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions."
[8] "The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature."
[9] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
[10] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through an endothermic reaction. Key considerations for this process include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate catalyst types, and managing the industrial applications. Industrial applications often involve the use of Pt-based catalysts due to their high selectivity and durability, although coke formation can significantly impact process efficiency.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts during PDH undermines the catalytic performance and stability by covering the metal catalysts and blocking access to the active site. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with second metals such as Sn, and modifying the nature of the support material to reduce side reactions.

3. The complex reaction network of PDH involves various intermediates and propylene, which can lead to coke formation at elevated temperatures. This deep reaction results in coke covering the metal catalysts, reducing their efficiency and potentially causing catalyst agglomeration during regeneration processes.

1. 烷基化直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种重要方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯进行放热反应。此过程的关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件、选择合适的催化剂类型以及管理工业应用。工业应用通常使用Pt基催化剂，由于其高选择性和耐用性，尽管焦炭形成会严重影响过程效率。

2. 在PDH过程中，Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会严重削弱催化性能和稳定性，因为它覆盖金属催化剂并阻断活性位点。减少焦炭形成的方法包括与还原性气体如氢气一起提供丙烷、用Sn等第二金属合金化Pt以及修改支撑材料的性质以减少副反应。

3. PDH的复杂反应网络涉及各种中间体和丙烯，这可能导致在高温下形成焦炭。这种深层反应导致焦炭覆盖金属催化剂，降低其效率，并可能导致再生过程中催化剂团聚。
