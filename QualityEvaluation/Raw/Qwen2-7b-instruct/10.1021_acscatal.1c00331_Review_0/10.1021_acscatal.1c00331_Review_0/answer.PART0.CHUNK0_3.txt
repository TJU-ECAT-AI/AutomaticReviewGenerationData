[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[2] "Although these catalyst candidates show excellent activity in a laboratory test, they are still not industrially implemented."
[3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[4] "The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature. Some studies indicated that they are very coke resistance, but the opposites were also reported."
[5] "It is revealed that the geometry of the active sites has a pivotal importance to side reactions."
[6] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a promising and efficient method for producing propylene, especially given the abundance of light alkanes following the discovery of Shale gas. This route competes with traditional methods that are energy-intensive and have low selectivity. Industrial implementation of PDH, however, faces challenges, particularly with the formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts, which impacts efficiency and stability.

2. Small-sized (approximately 3 nm) Pt particles exhibit varying degrees of coke resistance, as evidenced by both supportive and opposing research findings. The geometry of the active sites plays a critical role in side reactions during the PDH process.

3. The review aims to offer a comprehensive and unified explanation of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH, based on extensive literature surveys. This includes detailing the origins and characteristics of coke, an area that has received limited attention in previous studies. The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also explored, which has not been adequately covered in earlier reviews. Additionally, the development and comparison of various methods to inhibit coke formation are discussed, along with catalyst regeneration strategies and future improvement prospects.

1.PDH通过催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH，C3H8→C3H6+H2）是一种有前景且高效的大量生产丙烯的方法，尤其是在发现页岩气后，这种路线与传统方法竞争。传统方法既耗能又选择性低。尽管PDH工业应用面临挑战，特别是Pt基催化剂上焦炭的形成严重削弱了其催化性能和稳定性。

2.大约3nm的小尺寸Pt颗粒在焦炭抵抗性方面表现出不同的程度，这在支持的研究和反对的研究中都有证据。活性位点的几何形状在PDH过程中对副反应起着关键作用。

3.该综述旨在基于广泛文献调查提供PDH中Pt催化剂上焦炭形成的全面和统一描述。这包括详细说明焦炭的起源和特性，这是一个之前研究关注较少的领域。焦炭形成的动力学方面也被探索，这是先前评论中没有充分覆盖的内容。此外，讨论了各种抑制焦炭形成的方法的发展和比较，以及催化剂再生策略和未来改进前景。
