[1] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."
[2] "With the large-scale Shale gas discovery worldwide, (24) the abundance of light alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane open new opportunities to propene production."
[3] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
[4] "One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment."
[5] "There are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[6] "In our previous study, the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation based on DFT was performed to give a detailed description of coke precursor formation during PDH."
[7] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a highly endothermic reaction, typically conducted above 500°C. Key considerations include reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications. Catalyst types include metal-based catalysts such as platinum and metal oxide catalysts like chromium oxide. Industrial applications often involve processes like Oleflex and Catofin, where platinum-based catalysts are employed for their high selectivity and durability, although coke formation can undermine their performance and stability.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by covering the metal catalysts and blocking access to the active site, leading to reduced reactivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with second metals such as Sn, modifying the nature of the support, controlling the size of the Pt catalyst, and computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) to understand the deactivation mechanism.

1. 烷基化丙烷（PDH）作为丙烯生产的手段，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯进行高度吸热反应，通常在500°C以上进行。关键考虑因素包括反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用。催化剂类型包括基于金属的催化剂，如铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物。工业应用往往涉及如Oleflex和Catofin等过程，其中使用铂基催化剂因其高选择性和耐用性而被采用，尽管焦炭形成可能会损害其性能和稳定性。

2. 在Pt催化剂上形成的焦炭会降低过程效率，因为它们覆盖了金属催化剂并阻断了活性位点，导致活性和稳定性降低。缓解焦炭形成的方法包括与丙烷共喂养还原性气体如氢气，通过Sn等第二种金属合金Pt，修改支撑的性质，控制Pt催化剂的尺寸，以及基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟来了解失活机制。
