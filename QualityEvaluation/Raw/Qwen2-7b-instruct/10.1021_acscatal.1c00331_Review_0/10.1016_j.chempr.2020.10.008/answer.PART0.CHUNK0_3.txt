[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "Achieving the highest propylene productivity at the lowest deactivation rate."
[3] "Revealing active site structures under representative dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol−1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[5] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[6] "This paper describes a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) as a selective and ultrastable PDH catalyst."
[7] "Achieving more than 95% of propylene selectivity from 520°C to 620°C."
[8] "No obvious deactivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."
[9] "Based on in situ X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures."
[10] "This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through high-temperature reactions. Key considerations involve maintaining high propene selectivity, avoiding cracking and coke formation, and ensuring the stability of the catalyst over prolonged operation periods. Industrial applications require efficient catalysts that can operate at high temperatures while minimizing the formation of byproducts such as C1 and C2 molecules and coke.

2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include constructing selective and ultrastable single-site catalysts like [PtZn4], which inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions. By isolating the active metal components into single atoms, the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) can inhibit the formation of coke and other undesirable side products, thereby improving the stability and efficiency of the PDH process.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）作为一种商业丙烯生产技术，通过高温反应将丙烷转化为丙烯。关键考虑因素包括保持高丙烯选择性、避免裂解和焦炭形成以及确保催化剂在长时间运行过程中的稳定性。工业应用需要高效的催化剂，可以在高温下运行并同时最小化形成如C1和C2分子和焦炭等副产品的效率。

2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，因为它会降低催化剂的活性和选择性。为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采用构造选择性和超稳定的单原子催化剂（如[PtZn4]），以抑制结构敏感的副反应。通过将活性金属成分隔离成单原子，得到的单原子催化剂（SACs）可以抑制焦炭和其他不希望的副产物的形成，从而提高PDH过程的稳定性和效率。
