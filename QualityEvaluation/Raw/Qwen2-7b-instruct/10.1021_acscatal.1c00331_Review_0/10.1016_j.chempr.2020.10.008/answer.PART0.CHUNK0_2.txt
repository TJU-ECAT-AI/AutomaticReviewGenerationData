[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[3] "Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."
[4] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[5] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
[6] "The catalyst enables more than 95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deactivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."
[7] "Based on in situ X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures."
[8] "This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."
[9] "The formation of Single-Atom Pt1 Sites in PtZn IMAs By direct H2 temperature-programmed reduction strategy (see Experimental Procedures), we successfully constructed PtZn IMAs (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1) supported on SiO2."
[10] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
[11] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 97.2% after a 160-h test."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) serves as a method for propene production by breaking the hydrocarbon bonds in propane molecules at high temperatures. Key considerations involve optimizing reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates, selecting suitable catalyst types that can efficiently convert propane to propene with minimal byproducts, and managing coke formation to maintain process efficiency. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to decreased catalytic activity, reduced selectivity for propene production, and increased costs associated with catalyst regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include designing catalysts with isolated active sites that prevent the formation of coke precursors, using supports that reduce acid strength to minimize coke deposition, and employing advanced catalytic materials with enhanced stability and selectivity.

2. The impact of coke formation on the PDH process efficiency is significant. Coke formation leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity of the Pt-based catalysts, resulting in a reduced conversion rate of propane to propene. It also decreases the selectivity towards propene production, as coke formation often competes with propene production, leading to a shift in the product distribution away from propene. This can lead to lower yields of propene, higher production costs due to the need for additional processing steps to remove coke, and reduced overall economic viability of the PDH process. To mitigate coke formation, strategies include the use of catalysts with single-atom sites that inhibit the formation of coke precursors, the selection of catalyst supports that minimize coke deposition, and the implementation of catalyst regeneration techniques to restore activity and selectivity.

3. Strategies to improve catalyst regeneration and mitigate coke formation in PDH processes include:
   - **Designing Catalysts with Single-Atom Sites:** Using single-atom catalysts (SACs) can help isolate active sites and prevent the formation of coke precursors.
   - **Selecting Catalyst Supports:** Choosing catalyst supports with appropriate acidity and surface properties can reduce coke deposition.
   - **Advanced Catalytic Materials:** Developing catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, such as intermetallic alloys, can improve the longevity and efficiency of the catalysts.
   - **Catalyst Regeneration Techniques:** Implementing effective regeneration methods can restore the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, extending their operational life and reducing costs associated with catalyst replacement.
   - **Process Optimization:** Adjusting process parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates, can optimize the PDH process to reduce coke formation and enhance propene production efficiency.

1.PDH作为丙烯生产的一种商业技术，通过在高温下断裂丙烷分子中的碳氢键来实现丙烯的生成。关键考虑因素包括优化反应条件，如温度、压力和流速，选择能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯且副产品最少的催化剂类型，并管理焦炭形成以维持过程效率。焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成会导致催化活性降低，丙烯选择性减少，以及催化剂再生成本增加。缓解策略包括设计具有孤立活性位点的催化剂，防止焦炭前体的形成，使用减少焦炭沉积的支撑材料，并采用先进的催化材料以增强稳定性和选择性。

2. 焦炭形成对PDH过程效率的影响是重大的。焦炭形成导致基于Pt的催化剂活性下降，丙烷到丙烯转化率降低。它还减少了丙烯的选择性，因为焦炭形成通常与丙烯生产竞争，导致产品分布向丙烯偏移减少。这可能导致丙烯产量降低、额外处理步骤去除焦炭的成本增加，以及PDH过程的整体经济性降低。缓解策略包括：
   - **设计单原子催化剂（SACs）**：使用SACs有助于隔离活性位点，防止焦炭前体的形成。
   - **选择催化剂支撑材料**：选择适当的酸性和表面特性的催化剂支撑材料可以减少焦炭沉积。
   - **先进催化材料**：开发具有增强稳定性和选择性的催化剂，如互金属合金，可以提高催化剂的寿命和效率。
   - **催化剂再生技术**：实施有效的再生方法可以恢复催化剂的活性和选择性，延长其使用寿命并降低更换催化剂的成本。
   - **过程优化**：调整温度、压力和流速等过程参数，优化PDH过程以减少焦炭形成并提高丙烯生产效率。
