[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[3] "Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."
[4] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within the 160-h industrial PDH test. We reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a series of dehydrogenation reactions at elevated temperatures. Key considerations regarding reaction conditions include maintaining appropriate temperatures to prevent cracking and coke formation while ensuring sufficient propene yield. Catalyst types often focus on single-site intermetallic compounds, such as the [PtZn4] catalyst described in this paper, which enables high propene selectivity and stability over a wide temperature range. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and requiring costly regeneration processes. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration involve isolating active metal components into single-atom sites, as seen with the [PtZn4] catalyst, which serves as a stable active site structure and inhibits structure-sensitive side reactions, leading to improved selectivity and stability.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）作为一种丙烯生产技术，通过在较高温度下将丙烷转化为丙烯来实现丙烯生产。反应条件的关键考虑因素包括保持适当的温度以防止裂解和焦化，同时确保足够的丙烯产率。催化剂类型往往集中在单原子间金属化合物上，如本文中描述的[PtZn4]催化剂，它能够在广泛的温度范围内实现高丙烯选择性和稳定性。Pt基催化剂上的焦碳形成会影响过程效率，降低催化剂活性，并需要昂贵的再生过程。减少焦碳形成并改善催化剂再生的策略涉及将活性金属成分隔离到单原子位点中，如本文所述的[PtZn4]催化剂，它作为稳定的活性位点结构，抑制结构敏感的副反应，从而提高选择性和稳定性。
