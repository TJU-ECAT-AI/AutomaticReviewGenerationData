[1] "In the presence of CO2 propane makes significant amount of H2 and CO."
[2] "The results of the present study, however, showed that in the absence of CO2, the catalyst makes CO, H2 with small amount of propene only above 450 C."
[3] "For a stoichiometric composition of reacting gas mixture, C3H8/ CO2 = 1 : 3, corresponding to the eqn (7)."
[4] "It has been observed that Ru based catalyst are active for propane partial oxidation to syngas. However the coke formation and active metal sintering are expected to cause deactivation of Ru based catalysts."
[5] "The carbon on the catalyst surface was oxidized by introducing oxygen to the catalyst bed. The carbon was converted to mostly CO2 and partly CO detected by quadrupole mass spectrometer."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the catalyst's activity, leading to substantial production of H2 and CO. Without CO2, the catalyst generates CO and H2, with a minor amount of propene, particularly at temperatures above 450 C. A specific stoichiometric composition of gas mixture, C3H8/CO2 = 1:3, corresponds to the reaction mechanism. Ru-based catalysts are active for propane partial oxidation to syngas, yet they are prone to deactivation due to coke formation and active metal sintering. Oxygen introduces to the catalyst bed effectively oxidizes the carbon deposited on the surface, converting it primarily to CO2 and partly to CO, as detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。CO2的存在显著提高了催化剂的活性，导致大量产生H2和CO。没有CO2时，催化剂在450°C以上温度主要生成CO、H2及少量丙烯。特定的气体混合物组成，C3H8/CO2 = 1:3，对应于该反应机制。基于Ru的催化剂对丙烷部分氧化至合成气表现出活性，但它们容易因焦炭形成和活性金属烧结而失活。引入氧气到催化剂床中有效氧化沉积在表面的碳，将其主要转化为CO2，并部分转化为CO，这一过程通过四极质谱仪检测到。
