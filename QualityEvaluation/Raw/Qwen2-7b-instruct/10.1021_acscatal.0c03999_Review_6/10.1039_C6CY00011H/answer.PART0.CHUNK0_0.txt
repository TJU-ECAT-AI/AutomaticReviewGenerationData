[1] "Several catalysts have been reported for propane reforming, including nickel based2426 and noble metal based catalysts9,18,19,2730,36"
[2] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."
[3] "Catalytic properties Before evaluating the catalytic activity of Ru doped oxide catalyst, the undoped CeO2 and undoped ZrO2 were investigated as controls for partial oxidation of propane in the presence of CO2 as the oxidant."
[4] "As the temperature increases, the conversion of propane increases."
[5] "The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts."
[6] "In presence of CO2 propane makes significant amount of H2 and CO. Instead of dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming reaction takes place."
[7] "With regard to the mechanism of the dry reforming of C3H8 over Ru/Al2O3, Ross et al.34 assumed the fast and complete decomposition of C3H8 to carbon and its subsequent reaction with adsorbed O and OH formed in the dissociation of CO2."
[8] "CO2 has biggest role in the partial oxidation of propane. As the oxidant (CO2) to propane ratio increases, the catalytic activity increases and as well CO and H2 formation increased."
[9] "It must be noticed that CO2 can be converted to CO via reverse water-gas shift reaction by consuming H2 (eqn (5)) or via Boudouard reaction by consuming coke on the catalyst surface (eqn (6))."
[10] "Effects of O2 co-feed with CO2 on propane reactivity The data presented above for partial oxidation of propane was using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture increases the catalyst activity and stability."

The literature discusses various catalysts used for propane reforming, with a focus on the role of CO2 as an oxidant. It highlights that neither of the catalysts displayed selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, instead promoting the formation of CO and H2. The study also investigates the impact of temperature, CO2 to propane ratio, and oxygen co-feed on the catalytic activity and stability. The results suggest that CO2 plays a crucial role in the partial oxidation of propane, enhancing activity and stability when oxygen is introduced into the reaction mixture.

文献讨论了用于丙烷重整的各种催化剂，重点是二氧化碳作为氧化剂的作用。它强调，这两种催化剂都没有显示出对丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的选择性，而是促进了CO和H2的形成。研究还探讨了温度、二氧化碳与丙烷的比例以及氧气共饲喂对催化活性和稳定性的影响。结果表明，二氧化碳在促进丙烷部分氧化中起着关键作用，当将氧气引入反应混合物时，可以增强活性和稳定性。
