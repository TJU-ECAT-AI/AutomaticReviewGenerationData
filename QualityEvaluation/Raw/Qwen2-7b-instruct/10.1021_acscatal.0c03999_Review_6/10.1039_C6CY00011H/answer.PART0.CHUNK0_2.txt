[1] "The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant."
[2] "On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C."
[3] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."

The study examines the catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 in the partial oxidation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant. Both catalysts yield CO and H2 when CO2 is used, and they exhibit similar activity below 450 C. Neither catalyst demonstrates selective oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane to propylene with CO2 or CO. Coke formation restricts their practical use in propane dry reforming.

本研究考察了Ru掺杂CeO2和Ru掺杂ZrO2在使用CO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷部分氧化的催化活性和稳定性。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，两种催化剂均产生CO和H2，且它们在低于450°C时具有相似的活性。这两种催化剂都不具备选择性氧化脱氢作用于丙烷到丙烯的活性，与CO2或CO。焦炭形成限制了它们在丙烷干燥重整中的实际应用。

[1] "In the absence of CO2, very little propane conversion was observed for either catalyst, and propane was not converted at all below 450 C."
[2] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion)."
[3] "The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts."
[4] "Instead of dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming reaction takes place."

Without CO2, neither catalyst showed significant propane conversion, and propane was not converted below 450 C. Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 demonstrated higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion). Both catalysts produced CO and H2 as major products, with no propylene observed. Instead of a dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming occurred.

在缺乏CO2的情况下，两种催化剂都没有观察到显著的丙烷转化，并且在低于450°C时丙烷完全没有被转化。在氧化条件下，5% Ru掺杂CeO2的活性更高（53%转化），而5% Ru掺杂ZrO2为22%转化。这两种催化剂都产生了CO和H2作为主要产物，没有观察到丙烯。相反，发生了CO2重整反应，而不是脱氢反应。
