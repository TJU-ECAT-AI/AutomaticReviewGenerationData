[1] "Several catalysts have been reported for propane reforming, including nickel based2426 and noble metal based catalysts9,18,19,2730,36"
[2] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."
[3] "In the presence of even a small amount of CO2 to propane opened a new route of the reaction, namely the formation of H2 + CO (eqn (1))."
[4] "During propane partial oxidation, the more oxidized catalyst does not favor methane formation, which is consistent with the prior work showing the sensitivity of catalyst to the degree of reduction."
[5] "The addition of 25% O2 facilitated greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas yield."

1. Various catalysts, such as nickel-based and noble metal-based ones, have been reported for propane reforming.
2. Neither of the catalysts showed a measurable preference for converting propane to propylene through oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 or CO.
3. When a small amount of CO2 is added to propane, it opens a new reaction pathway leading to the formation of H2 and CO.
4. The more oxidized catalyst in the context of propane partial oxidation does not promote methane formation, indicating the catalyst's sensitivity to its level of reduction.
5. The inclusion of 25% oxygen in the feed enhanced propane conversion, reduced coke formation, and improved the yield of synthesis gas.

1. 已经报告了一些催化剂用于丙烷重整，包括镍基和贵金属基催化剂。
2. 这两种催化剂都没有显示出对丙烷转化为丙烯通过氧化脱氢与CO2或CO的明显选择性。
3. 当向丙烷中加入微量CO2时，会打开新的反应途径，形成H2和CO。
4. 在丙烷部分氧化过程中，更氧化状态的催化剂不促进甲烷的形成，这表明催化剂对自身还原程度的敏感性。
5. 在混合物中添加25%氧气可以增加丙烷转化率、减少焦炭生成，并提高合成气的产率。
