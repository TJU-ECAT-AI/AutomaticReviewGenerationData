[1] "Several catalysts have been reported for propane reforming, including nickel based2426 and noble metal based catalysts9,18,19,2730,36"
[2] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."
[3] "Catalytic properties Before evaluating the catalytic activity of Ru doped oxide catalyst, the undoped CeO2 and undoped ZrO2 were investigated as controls for partial oxidation of propane in the presence of CO2 as the oxidant."
[4] "As the temperature increases, the conversion of propane increases."
[5] "The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts."
[6] "In presence of CO2 propane makes significant amount of H2 and CO. Instead of dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming reaction takes place."
[7] "With regard to the mechanism of the dry reforming of C3H8 over Ru/Al2O3, Ross et al.34 assumed the fast and complete decomposition of C3H8 to carbon and its subsequent reaction with adsorbed O and OH formed in the dissociation of CO2."
[8] "CO2 has biggest role in the partial oxidation of propane. As the oxidant (CO2) to propane ratio increases, the catalytic activity increases and as well CO and H2 formation increased."
[9] "It must be noticed that CO2 can be converted to CO via reverse water-gas shift reaction by consuming H2 (eqn (5)) or via Boudouard reaction by consuming coke on the catalyst surface (eqn (6))."
[10] "Effects of O2 co-feed with CO2 on propane reactivity The data presented above for partial oxidation of propane was using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture increases the catalyst activity and stability."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses various catalysts used for propane reforming, with a focus on the role of CO2 as an oxidant. It highlights that neither of the catalysts displayed selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, instead promoting the formation of CO and H2. The study also investigates the impact of temperature, CO2 to propane ratio, and oxygen co-feed on the catalytic activity and stability. The results suggest that CO2 plays a crucial role in the partial oxidation of propane, enhancing activity and stability when oxygen is introduced into the reaction mixture.

文献讨论了用于丙烷重整的各种催化剂，重点是二氧化碳作为氧化剂的作用。它强调，这两种催化剂都没有显示出对丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的选择性，而是促进了CO和H2的形成。研究还探讨了温度、二氧化碳与丙烷的比例以及氧气共饲喂对催化活性和稳定性的影响。结果表明，二氧化碳在促进丙烷部分氧化中起着关键作用，当将氧气引入反应混合物时，可以增强活性和稳定性。

[1] "In the presence of CO2 propane makes significant amount of H2 and CO."
[2] "The results of the present study, however, showed that in the absence of CO2, the catalyst makes CO, H2 with small amount of propene only above 450 C."
[3] "For a stoichiometric composition of reacting gas mixture, C3H8/ CO2 = 1 : 3, corresponding to the eqn (7)."
[4] "It has been observed that Ru based catalyst are active for propane partial oxidation to syngas. However the coke formation and active metal sintering are expected to cause deactivation of Ru based catalysts."
[5] "The carbon on the catalyst surface was oxidized by introducing oxygen to the catalyst bed. The carbon was converted to mostly CO2 and partly CO detected by quadrupole mass spectrometer."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the catalyst's activity, leading to substantial production of H2 and CO. Without CO2, the catalyst generates CO and H2, with a minor amount of propene, particularly at temperatures above 450 C. A specific stoichiometric composition of gas mixture, C3H8/CO2 = 1:3, corresponds to the reaction mechanism. Ru-based catalysts are active for propane partial oxidation to syngas, yet they are prone to deactivation due to coke formation and active metal sintering. Oxygen introduces to the catalyst bed effectively oxidizes the carbon deposited on the surface, converting it primarily to CO2 and partly to CO, as detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。CO2的存在显著提高了催化剂的活性，导致大量产生H2和CO。没有CO2时，催化剂在450°C以上温度主要生成CO、H2及少量丙烯。特定的气体混合物组成，C3H8/CO2 = 1:3，对应于该反应机制。基于Ru的催化剂对丙烷部分氧化至合成气表现出活性，但它们容易因焦炭形成和活性金属烧结而失活。引入氧气到催化剂床中有效氧化沉积在表面的碳，将其主要转化为CO2，并部分转化为CO，这一过程通过四极质谱仪检测到。

[1] "The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant."
[2] "On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C."
[3] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."

The study examines the catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 in the partial oxidation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant. Both catalysts yield CO and H2 when CO2 is used, and they exhibit similar activity below 450 C. Neither catalyst demonstrates selective oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane to propylene with CO2 or CO. Coke formation restricts their practical use in propane dry reforming.

[1] "Several studies reported that cerium oxide have a very high oxygen storage capacity."
[2] "The presence of the Ru dopant makes the CeO2 surface more reducible (Table 4)."
[3] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Cerium oxide exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity, which is associated with its ability to act as an oxygen buffer by storing/releasing O2 due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. The addition of the Ru dopant makes the CeO2 surface more reducible.

2. The presence of the Ru dopant enhances the reducibility of the CeO2 surface, facilitating reactions with hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

3. The 5% Ru doped CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and conversion efficiency (53%) compared to the 5% Ru doped ZrO2 catalyst (22%) under oxidative conditions.

4. The catalytic activity of the doped oxide catalysts is influenced by the type of host material, the ratio of the oxidant to propane, and the space time.

5. The H2/CO ratio varies with the concentration of CO2, indicating that the catalyst's performance can be adjusted by controlling the reactant composition.

6. The predominant products identified during the reaction were CO and H2.

7. The majority of the carbon deposited on the catalyst surface was oxidized at temperatures below 300 C.
