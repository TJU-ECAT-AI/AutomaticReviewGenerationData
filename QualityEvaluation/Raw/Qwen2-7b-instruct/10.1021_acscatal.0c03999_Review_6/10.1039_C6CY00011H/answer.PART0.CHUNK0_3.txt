1. Cerium oxide exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity, which is associated with its ability to act as an oxygen buffer by storing/releasing O2 due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. The addition of the Ru dopant makes the CeO2 surface more reducible.

2. The presence of the Ru dopant enhances the reducibility of the CeO2 surface, facilitating reactions with hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

3. The 5% Ru doped CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and conversion efficiency (53%) compared to the 5% Ru doped ZrO2 catalyst (22%) under oxidative conditions.

4. The catalytic activity of the doped oxide catalysts is influenced by the type of host material, the ratio of the oxidant to propane, and the space time.

5. The H2/CO ratio varies with the concentration of CO2, indicating that the catalyst's performance can be adjusted by controlling the reactant composition.

6. The predominant products identified during the reaction were CO and H2.

7. The majority of the carbon deposited on the catalyst surface was oxidized at temperatures below 300 C.

1. 氧化铈具有很高的氧存储能力，这与它作为氧化剂和还原剂之间Ce4+/Ce3+电对的缓冲物的能力有关。添加Ru掺杂使得CeO2表面更具可还原性。

2.Ru掺杂增强了CeO2表面的还原性，有利于与氢气和一氧化碳反应。

3.在氧化条件下，5% Ru掺杂的CeO2催化剂的活性和转化效率（53%）高于5% Ru掺杂的ZrO2催化剂（22%）。

4.掺杂氧化物催化剂的活性受载体类型、丙烷与氧化剂的比例以及空间时间的影响。

5.H2/CO比率随CO2浓度变化，表明可以通过控制反应物组成来调整催化剂性能。

6.主要产物为CO和H2。

7.在低于300°C的温度下，催化剂表面沉积的大部分碳被氧化。
