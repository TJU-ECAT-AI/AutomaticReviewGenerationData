1. Our research examines the function of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The oxidative dehydrogenation process with N2O follows a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox pathway, while both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles are active with O2.
3. Oxygen from O2 is a more potent oxidizer than N2O.
4. Peroxovanadates are highly reactive in the oxidation of propene.
5. The lack of peroxovanadates might explain why N2O outperforms O2 in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

7. Reoxidation of VIII(d2) by O2 lacks an energy barrier, yet the vanadyl group is not directly restored.
8. Unlike reoxidation by N2O, reoxidation by O2 leads to the creation of peroxovanadate.

[1] "Independent of the oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O), C3H6 is formed by successive abstraction of two H atoms from C3H8 by VOx species, which are reduced in the process."
[2] "The significantly higher barriers demonstrate that N2O is a less-reactive oxidizing agent than O2."

1. Regardless of whether the oxidizing agent is O2 or N2O, C3H6 is produced by VOx species abstracting two H atoms from C3H8, leading to the reduction of the VOx species.
2. The notably greater barriers indicate that N2O is a less reactive oxidizing agent compared to O2.
3. N2O and O2 exhibit differences in the type of oxygen species they generate upon reoxidizing reduced VOx species.
4. Through reoxidation, only when using O2 can the vanadyl oxygen species be attained via a peroxovanadate intermediate.

[1] "According to our calculations, different oxidants in the ODP reaction on supported vanadium oxide catalysts not only influence the degree of reduction of the VOx species, but also may generate different concentrations of selective vanadyl and nonselective peroxo species, as illustrated in Fig. 9 for O2 and N2O. Propene is formed primarily from propane via oxidative dehydrogenation by lattice (vanadyl) oxygen of VOx species."
[2] "Vanadyl oxygen also is active for consecutive propene oxidation. Vanadyl groups can be restored via reoxidation by O2 and N2O. N2O is less active and can oxidize VIII sites only, whereas O2 can oxidize both VIII and VIV."
[3] "Only in the case of reoxidation by O2 is the vanadyl oxygen species reached via a peroxovanadate precursor. The latter is more reactive for propene oxidation (leading to COx) compared with vanadyl species."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do not directly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions as discussed in the provided literature. However, the document focuses on the differences between N2O and O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) on supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It explains how N2O and O2 impact the degree of reduction of vanadium oxide species (VOx) and the generation of vanadyl and peroxo species. N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen, while O2 can form peroxovanadates, which then decompose into vanadyl and oxygen. These peroxovanadates are more reactive for propene oxidation compared to vanadyl species. The reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2 and N2O influences the formation of COx species, with N2O reducing the catalyst's capability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx due to its inability to form peroxovanadates.

提供的文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受还原性及支撑材料影响的情况。然而，文献主要探讨了N2O和O2在支持型钨酸盐催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）反应时的影响。它解释了N2O和O2如何影响VOx物种的还原度以及选择性和非选择性过氧物种的生成。N2O仅选择性地恢复钨酸盐氧，而O2可以形成过氧钨酸盐，然后分解为钨酸盐和氧气。这些过氧钨酸盐对于丙烯氧化具有比钨酸盐更高的活性。通过O2和N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化影响COx物种的形成，由于N2O无法形成过氧钨酸盐，因此其减少了催化剂连续C3H6氧化到COx的能力。
