1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) was found to be a more efficient oxidizing agent compared to oxygen (O2).

2.On reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species, peroxovanadates were synthesized when using O2 as the oxidizing agent, but not when using N2O.

3.The nature of oxygen species produced during the reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxides by O2 might contribute to the observed differences in the reaction mechanism.

4.Nitrous oxide (N2O) does not form peroxovanadates, unlike oxygen (O2).

5.At the considered temperatures (600-800 K), propene oxidation is approximately 48 times slower than propane oxidation on vanadyl sites.

6.Theoretical findings closely align with experimental observations regarding the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 硝酸二氧化物（N2O）被发现是比氧气（O2）更有效的氧化剂。

2. 在还原的钒氧化物物种的重新氧化过程中，当使用O2作为氧化剂时，会合成过氧钒酸盐，但当使用N2O时不会。

3. 在使用O2重新氧化还原的钒氧化物时产生的氧物种的性质可能会影响反应机制。

4. 硝酸二氧化物（N2O）不能形成过氧钒酸盐，而与之相反的是氧气（O2）。

5. 在考虑的温度（600-800 K）下，在范德华位点上，丙烯氧化大约慢48倍于丙烷氧化。

6. 理论结果与实验观察的氧化脱氢过程紧密吻合。
