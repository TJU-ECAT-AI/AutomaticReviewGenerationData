[1] "Independent of the oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O), C3H6 is formed by successive abstraction of two H atoms from C3H8 by VOx species, which are reduced in the process."
[2] "The significantly higher barriers demonstrate that N2O is a less-reactive oxidizing agent than O2."
[3] "N2O and O2 also differ in terms of the nature of oxygen species formed on reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
[4] "Only in the case of reoxidation by O2 is the vanadyl oxygen species reached via a per- oxovanadate precursor."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Regardless of whether the oxidizing agent is O2 or N2O, C3H6 is produced by VOx species abstracting two H atoms from C3H8, leading to the reduction of the VOx species.
2. The notably greater barriers indicate that N2O is a less reactive oxidizing agent compared to O2.
3. N2O and O2 exhibit differences in the type of oxygen species they generate upon reoxidizing reduced VOx species.
4. Through reoxidation, only when using O2 can the vanadyl oxygen species be attained via a peroxovanadate intermediate.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 不论是使用O2还是N2O作为氧化剂，C3H6都是通过VOx物种从C3H8中依次提取两个H原子而产生的，并且伴随着VOx物种的还原。
2. 显著更高的壁垒表明，N2O是一种比O2更不活跃的氧化剂。
3. N2O和O2在重新氧化还原态VOx物种时产生的氧物种类型存在差异。
4. 只有当使用O2进行重新氧化时，才能通过过氧钒酸盐中间体获得vanadyl氧物种。
