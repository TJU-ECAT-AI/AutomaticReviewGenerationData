1. Our research examines the function of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The oxidative dehydrogenation process with N2O follows a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox pathway, while both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles are active with O2.
3. Oxygen from O2 is a more potent oxidizer than N2O.
4. Peroxovanadates are highly reactive in the oxidation of propene.
5. The lack of peroxovanadates might explain why N2O outperforms O2 in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
6. The bond between O2 and HOV(O)3 in the O2· HOV(O)3 complex is weak in both the high-spin (quartet) and low-spin (doublet) states.
7. Reoxidation of VIII(d2) by O2 lacks an energy barrier, yet the vanadyl group is not directly restored.
8. Unlike reoxidation by N2O, reoxidation by O2 leads to the creation of peroxovanadate.
9. Peroxovanadate and vanadyl species can both oxidize propene to propene oxide, but peroxovanadate accomplishes this with a significantly lower energy barrier.
10. The formation of propene oxide is highly exothermic, providing a pathway for the complete oxidation of hydrocarbons.

1. 我们的研究关注范德里夫特和过氧范德里夫特氧物种在丙烷氧化脱氢作用中的角色。
2. 丙烷氧化脱氢作用中，使用N2O遵循VV(d0)/VIII(d2)还原途径，而使用O2时，存在VV(d0)/VIV(d1)和VV(d0)/VIII(d2)两种还原循环。
3. 氧气的活性高于N2O。
4. 过氧范德里夫特物种在丙烯氧化中表现出高反应性。
5. 缺乏过氧范德里夫特可能解释了为什么N2O在高度分散的VOx物种上比O2具有更好的选择性氧化性能。
6. O2与HOV(O)3之间的结合在高自旋（四重态）和低自旋（双态）状态下都很弱。
7. 使用O2进行VIII(d2)的再氧化没有能量壁垒，但无法直接恢复范德里夫特物种。
8. 与N2O相比，使用O2进行VIII(d2)的再氧化会导致形成过氧范德里夫特。
9. 过氧范德里夫特和范德里夫特物种都能将丙烯氧化为丙烯氧化物，但过氧范德里夫特完成这一过程的能量壁垒要低得多。
10. 形成丙烯氧化物是一个高度放热的过程，为烃类的完全氧化提供了途径。
