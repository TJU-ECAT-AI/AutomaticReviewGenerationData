[1] "N2O was a less active oxidizing agent than O2."
[2] "Peroxovanadates as precursors of vanadyl species were formed on reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species with O2, but not with N2O."
[3] "O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O."
[4] "The absence of peroxovanadates may explain the superior performance of N2O compared with O2 in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species."

1.Nitrous oxide was less effective as an oxidizing agent compared to oxygen.
2.On reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species, peroxovanadates were produced with oxygen but not with nitrous oxide.
3.Oxygen was a more potent oxidizing agent than nitrous oxide.
4.The superior performance of nitrous oxide in selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) might be due to the lack of peroxovanadates formed during the reaction with nitrous oxide.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1.与氧气相比，N2O作为氧化剂的作用较弱。
2.在还原的钒氧化物物种的再氧化过程中，使用氧气可以产生过氧钒酸盐，但使用N2O则不能。
3.氧气比N2O更有效的氧化剂。
4.N2O在高度分散的VOx物种上的选择性ODP反应中表现出优越性能的原因可能是缺乏在反应过程中形成的过氧钒酸盐。
