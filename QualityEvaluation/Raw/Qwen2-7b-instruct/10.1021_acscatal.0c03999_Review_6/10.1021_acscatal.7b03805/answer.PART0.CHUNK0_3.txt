The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in influencing their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation activity of ceria-based catalysts, acting as an electron acceptor in the proposed reaction mechanism. Optimizing the catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process necessitates the careful selection of both reducibility and support materials for Fe oxide-based catalysts.
