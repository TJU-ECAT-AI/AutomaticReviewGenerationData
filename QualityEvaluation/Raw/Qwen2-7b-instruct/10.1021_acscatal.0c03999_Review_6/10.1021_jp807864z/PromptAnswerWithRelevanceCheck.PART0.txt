<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The reducibility affects the activity of the catalysts, while the choice of support materials like carbon, alumina, and titania can greatly influence the system's efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the formation of an active species on the catalyst surface. Optimization of these systems requires selecting both the right reducibility and appropriate support materials.
