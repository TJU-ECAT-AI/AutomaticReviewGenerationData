[1] "In the presence of carbon dioxide, the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst is enhanced."
[2] "After 0.2 h of reaction, periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively, while in the presence of argon only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity are achieved under the same condition."
[3] "The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane can be considered as follows: CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2 and H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O."
[4] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[5] "At 873 K at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92%, while in the presence of an inert gas only 75% conversion can be achieved under the same condition."
[6] "The catalytic performance of gallium oxide catalysts in conversion of propane to propene with CO2 have been examined."
[7] "The influence of modification of the gallium oxide acidity/basicity properties has also been investigated."
[8] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[9] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[10] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Carbon dioxide enhances the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene.
2. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity.
3. The role of carbon dioxide in the reaction is to consume hydrogen and shift the equilibrium towards products.
4. At a molar ratio of CO2 to propane of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of propane is significantly higher compared to when an inert gas is used.
5. Gallium oxide catalysts have been tested for their performance in converting propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide.
6. Modifying the acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide catalysts affects their performance.
7. Carbon dioxide promotes the reaction only in the initial stages and does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst.
8. Potassium promoted gallium oxide catalysts do not show high activity, suggesting that the reaction occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst.
