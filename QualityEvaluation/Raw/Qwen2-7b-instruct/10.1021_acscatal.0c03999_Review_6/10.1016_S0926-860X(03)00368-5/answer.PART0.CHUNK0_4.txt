[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a method to obtain unsaturated hydrocarbons from feedstocks of the corresponding paraffins."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking."
[3] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[4] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[5] "In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3%."
[6] "It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The Fe oxide catalysts' ability to reduce and regenerate under reaction conditions affects their efficiency and stability. The support material, typically a porous solid, can alter the catalyst's surface area, acidity, basicity, and redox properties, impacting the reaction kinetics and selectivity. The optimized combination of reducibility and support material allows for a more efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals, such as propene, with improved selectivity and yield. This provides valuable insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes. The specific effects depend on factors such as the catalyst's composition, preparation method, and interaction with the support material, which together determine the catalyst's overall performance in these reactions.
