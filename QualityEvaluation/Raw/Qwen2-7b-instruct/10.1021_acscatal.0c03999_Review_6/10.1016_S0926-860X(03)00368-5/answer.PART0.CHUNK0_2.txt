[1] "In the presence of carbon dioxide, the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst was enhanced."
[2] "After 0.2 h of reaction, periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively."
[3] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process can be derived from the behavior of Fe oxide catalysts. Specifically, the presence of potassium in gallium oxide catalysts diminishes their catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction likely occurs at acidic sites on the catalyst surface. This suggests that modifying the acidity/basicity properties of catalysts can potentially enhance their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。从Fe氧化物催化剂的行为中可以得出有关该过程的拟议反应机制和催化体系优化的见解。具体来说，钾的存在使镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性降低，这表明反应可能在催化剂表面的酸性位点上进行。这表明通过调整催化剂的酸碱性性质，可能增强其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。
