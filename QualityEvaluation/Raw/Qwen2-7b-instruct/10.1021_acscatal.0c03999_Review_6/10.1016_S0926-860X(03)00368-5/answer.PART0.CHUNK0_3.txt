[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide has been carried out over unpromoted and potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts."
[2] "It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst."
[3] "After 0.2 h of reaction periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively, while in the presence of argon only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity are achieved under the same condition."
[4] "In the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas."
[5] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."
[6] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[7] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that carbon dioxide enhances the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts, reducing the required temperature for dehydrogenation by 50 K compared to inert gases. This enhancement is only observed in the initial stages of the reaction, indicating a potential role for carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. However, the introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction might proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, which potassium promoted catalysts fail to maintain effectively.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中显著影响其性能。文献表明，二氧化碳可以提高镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性，将脱氢所需的温度降低50K与惰性气体相比。这种增强仅在反应的初期阶段观察到，暗示二氧化碳可能在脱氢过程中发挥作用。然而，向镓氧化物催化剂引入钾会导致催化活性的丧失，这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这是钾促进的催化剂无法有效保持的。
