<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:
CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2
(3)
H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O
(4)</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13], propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>Under carbon dioxide atmosphere after reaction period 0.2 h, the propene yield reached 30.6%, while under argon 23.0%.</p>
<p>These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst. However, as was shown by the pulse reaction (Section 3.5.) the role of CO2 could be to eliminate deposited carbon (reaction 5).</p>
<p>CO2 + C = 2CO
(5)</p>
<p>Pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the initial yield of hydrocarbon products during the reaction in a stream of carbon dioxide or argon. Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and the yield of hydrocarbon products as a function of pulse number. The propene yield and the total yield of hydrocarbons (C1C3) in the presence of carbon dioxide are higher than those in argon atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the absence of O2, the selectivity is the highest. Increase of O2 concentration up to 9.1% weakly decrease propane conversion and propene yield.</p>
<p>For this purpose potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalyst have been prepared and tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before (Fig. 7a) and after (Fig. 7b) the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow.</p>
<p>• Bulk Ga2O3 prepared by thermal decomposition of gallium nitrate is an effective catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane to propene.</p>

The document discusses the role of carbon dioxide in enhancing the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, particularly in the initial stages of the reaction. Carbon dioxide shifts the equilibrium towards products by consuming hydrogen produced in the reaction, thereby improving propane conversion. However, it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. Pulse reaction studies show that carbon dioxide can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. XRD analyses confirm that the phase of the catalyst remains stable after dehydrogenation, but the fresh catalyst is more amorphous than after reaction. Bulk gallium oxide is found to be an effective catalyst for dehydrogenating propane to propene.

文档讨论了二氧化碳在提高丙烷脱氢为丙烯中的作用，尤其是在反应初期。二氧化碳通过消耗反应中产生的氢气，推动平衡向产物方向移动，从而提高丙烷转化率。然而，它并不能抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物中引入钾会导致催化活性下降，这表明反应在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。脉冲反应研究表明，二氧化碳可以通过布杜尔反应去除碳沉积物。X射线衍射分析表明，在二氧化碳流动下，催化剂的相没有显著变化，但新鲜催化剂在反应后更非晶化。热分解镓硝酸盐制得的镓氧化物被证明是有效的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
