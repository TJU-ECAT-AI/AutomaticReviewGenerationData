Fe oxide-based catalysts play a pivotal role in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical products through the oxo process, specifically in the synthesis of oxo alcohols or oxo aldehydes, often referred to as the oxo alcohol pathway (ODHP). The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by their reducibility, reaction mechanism, and the properties of the support materials used. The reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts is critical for their activity, as it determines their ability to reduce CO2 to form the desired products under the reaction conditions. The reaction mechanism typically involves the adsorption of CO2 onto the catalyst surface followed by its reduction to CO, which then reacts with oxygen to produce the target product.

Support materials greatly affect the catalyst's properties and thus its catalytic activity. These materials can provide additional active sites, improve the dispersion of metal particles, and alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, thereby influencing its reactivity and stability. For instance, the use of appropriate support materials can enhance the reducibility of Fe oxides, leading to improved conversion rates and selectivity towards specific products in the ODHP.

The relationship between catalyst properties and catalytic activity is complex and multifaceted. It encompasses factors such as the particle size of the Fe oxide, the surface area, the presence of defects, and the electronic properties of both the metal and the support. These characteristics collectively determine how efficiently the catalyst can adsorb reactants, facilitate the desired chemical transformations, and regenerate after each reaction cycle. Optimizing these properties can lead to more efficient CO2 utilization, higher yields of target products, and enhanced sustainability in industrial processes that rely on the conversion of CO2. Therefore, the development of advanced Fe oxide-based catalysts requires a deep understanding of their performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanisms, alongside the careful selection and modification of support materials to achieve optimal catalytic activity.
