The study found that the optimal steaming temperature for the HZSM-5 support with a molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 degrees Celsius. The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst, which was steamed at this temperature, exhibited the highest catalytic performance. It achieved maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600 degrees Celsius. The catalyst's superior performance is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support. Additionally, the presence of CO2 in the feed gas enhances the catalyst's stability by suppressing coke formation, a process facilitated by the Boudouard reaction.

研究发现，对于Si/Al摩尔比为25的HZSM-5支持，最佳蒸气处理温度为650摄氏度。在该温度下蒸气化的5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650)催化剂表现出最佳催化性能。它在600摄氏度下进行丙烷脱氢化时，初始和稳定状态下分别达到最大丙烯产率29.7%和20.3%。催化剂的优越性能归因于ZnO的高分散性和HZSM-5(650)支持物的适当Brnsted酸性。此外，CO2在进料气体中的存在增强了催化剂的稳定性，通过Boudouard反应抑制了焦炭形成过程。
