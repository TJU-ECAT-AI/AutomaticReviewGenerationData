[1] "The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600."
[2] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is a consequence of high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support."
[3] "The improved stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 in comparison with in the absence of CO2 is due to the suppression of coke formation resulting from elimination of the coke by the Boudouard reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their ability to efficiently reduce CO2 to formates or methanol, depending on the catalyst's composition and structure. The insights gained from understanding these factors can guide the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2 reduction processes, aiming for higher efficiency and selectivity towards desired products. By tailoring the reducibility and support materials, researchers can enhance the catalyst's activity, stability, and product selectivity, making them more suitable for industrial-scale applications in CO2 utilization.
