<p>The highest catalytic performance can be achieved on the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst with the HZSM-5 support steaming at 650, which allows the maximum propyl- ene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of pro- pane at 600.</p>
<p>The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support.</p>
<p>The catalytic stability is enhanced by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation.</p>
<p>The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%).</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study demonstrates that steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts exhibit superior performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The optimal steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support is 650°C, leading to the highest propylene yields of 29.7% at the initial state and 20.3% at the steady state at 600°C. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas enhances the catalyst's stability by suppressing coke formation. In the presence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after 30 h of reaction is reduced to 1.0 wt% compared to 1.5 wt% in the absence of CO2. This reduction in coke formation leads to improved stability of the catalyst.

研究结果表明，经过蒸煮处理的HZSM-5支持的ZnO催化剂在二氧化碳存在下对丙烷脱氢制丙烯表现出优异性能。HZSM-5支持体的最优蒸煮温度为650°C，在600°C条件下，该催化剂能实现初始状态下最高丙烯产率为29.7%，稳态时为20.3%。催化剂性能得益于ZnO的高度分散和蒸煮处理后的HZSM-5支持体适当的Brnsted酸性。向反应气体中加入二氧化碳可以增强催化剂稳定性，通过消除焦炭形成来抑制其生成。与不含二氧化碳的情况相比，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，反应30小时后催化剂上沉积的焦炭量从1.5 wt%降低至1.0 wt%。这种焦炭形成的减少导致催化剂的稳定性得到提高。

The study found that the optimal steaming temperature for the HZSM-5 support with a molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 degrees Celsius. The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst, which was steamed at this temperature, exhibited the highest catalytic performance. It achieved maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600 degrees Celsius. The catalyst's superior performance is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support.

<p>Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction.</p>
<p>As to propane dehydrogenation, this new process has been reported to give rather high propylene selectivity due to the lack of deep oxidation of propane.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to extend our recent work on the applications of HZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Although the initial propane conversion over the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst is really high (99.9%), it decreases very fast with time on stream, being 7.1% after 30 h on-stream operation.</p>
<p>The steaming treatment on the HZSM-5 support has a distinct influence on the catalytic performance of the supported ZnO samples. The enhanced catalyst stability can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 30 h.</p>
<p>The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst.</p>
<p>The variation of the amount of CO in the reaction product with reaction time on 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst was measured, and the results are shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p>The amount of CO formed in the reaction is always higher than that of consumed CO2, but lower than twice of CO2 consumed in the reaction, suggesting that CO2 was converted into CO through both the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2H2  COH2O) and the Boudouard reaction (CO2C  2CO) during the dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>Therefore, in conjunction with the coke formation data of the spent catalyst, the enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to its low coking tendency as a function of time on stream.</p>
<p>This result also implies that the coke formation is responsible for the catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>In summary, dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 over steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts has been investigated.</p>
<p>The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600.</p>

The steaming temperature of HZSM-5 affects the Zn/Si ratio of supported ZnO catalysts. As the steaming temperature increases from 600 to 700, the Zn/Si ratio increases, indicating better ZnO dispersion on the HZSM-5 support. This leads to enhanced activity in propane dehydrogenation. However, the decrease in Brnsted acidity of HZSM-5 with steaming temperature diminishes the activity in propane dehydrogenation. A balance between these two aspects results in the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst showing the highest dehydrogenation activity and propylene yield among the steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO samples.
