The steaming temperature of HZSM-5 affects the Zn/Si ratio of supported ZnO catalysts. As the steaming temperature increases from 600 to 700, the Zn/Si ratio increases, indicating better ZnO dispersion on the HZSM-5 support. This leads to enhanced activity in propane dehydrogenation. However, the decrease in Brnsted acidity of HZSM-5 with steaming temperature diminishes the activity in propane dehydrogenation. A balance between these two aspects results in the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst showing the highest dehydrogenation activity and propylene yield among the steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO samples.

The steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support impacts the dispersion of ZnO on the support, enhancing the catalyst's activity for propane dehydrogenation. An optimal steaming temperature of 650°C provides the highest propylene yield by balancing the dispersion of ZnO and the acidity of the HZSM-5 support.
