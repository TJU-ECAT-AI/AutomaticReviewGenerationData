<p>The highest catalytic performance can be achieved on the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst with the HZSM-5 support steaming at 650, which allows the maximum propyl- ene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of pro- pane at 600.</p>
<p>The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support.</p>
<p>The catalytic stability is enhanced by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation.</p>
<p>The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%).</p>

The study demonstrates that steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts exhibit superior performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The optimal steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support is 650°C, leading to the highest propylene yields of 29.7% at the initial state and 20.3% at the steady state at 600°C. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas enhances the catalyst's stability by suppressing coke formation. In the presence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after 30 h of reaction is reduced to 1.0 wt% compared to 1.5 wt% in the absence of CO2. This reduction in coke formation leads to improved stability of the catalyst.

研究结果表明，经过蒸煮处理的HZSM-5支持的ZnO催化剂在二氧化碳存在下对丙烷脱氢制丙烯表现出优异性能。HZSM-5支持体的最优蒸煮温度为650°C，在600°C条件下，该催化剂能实现初始状态下最高丙烯产率为29.7%，稳态时为20.3%。催化剂性能得益于ZnO的高度分散和蒸煮处理后的HZSM-5支持体适当的Brnsted酸性。向反应气体中加入二氧化碳可以增强催化剂稳定性，通过消除焦炭形成来抑制其生成。与不含二氧化碳的情况相比，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，反应30小时后催化剂上沉积的焦炭量从1.5 wt%降低至1.0 wt%。这种焦炭形成的减少导致催化剂的稳定性得到提高。
