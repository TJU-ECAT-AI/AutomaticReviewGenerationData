<p>Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction.</p>
<p>As to propane dehydrogenation, this new process has been reported to give rather high propylene selectivity due to the lack of deep oxidation of propane.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to extend our recent work on the applications of HZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Although the initial propane conversion over the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst is really high (99.9%), it decreases very fast with time on stream, being 7.1% after 30 h on-stream operation.</p>
<p>The steaming treatment on the HZSM-5 support has a distinct influence on the catalytic performance of the supported ZnO samples. The enhanced catalyst stability can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 30 h.</p>
<p>The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst.</p>
<p>The variation of the amount of CO in the reaction product with reaction time on 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst was measured, and the results are shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p>The amount of CO formed in the reaction is always higher than that of consumed CO2, but lower than twice of CO2 consumed in the reaction, suggesting that CO2 was converted into CO through both the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2H2  COH2O) and the Boudouard reaction (CO2C  2CO) during the dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>Therefore, in conjunction with the coke formation data of the spent catalyst, the enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to its low coking tendency as a function of time on stream.</p>
<p>This result also implies that the coke formation is responsible for the catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>In summary, dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 over steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts has been investigated.</p>
<p>The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600.</p>

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts can influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the redox mechanism and reaction coupling between dehydrogenation of propane and reverse water-gas shift reactions. High propylene selectivity is achieved due to the lack of deep oxidation of propane. Reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit propylene oligomerization, enhancing propylene yield.

2. The steaming treatment on the HZSM-5 support has a distinct impact on the catalytic performance of the supported ZnO samples, improving stability and reducing coke formation.

3. The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst provides the highest propylene yield, demonstrating the importance of balance between ZnO dispersion and Brnsted acidity for optimal catalytic performance.

4. The presence of CO2 enhances catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation through the Boudouard reaction.

5. The enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to its low coking tendency over time, implying that coke formation is responsible for catalyst deactivation.

6. The study investigates the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 over steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts, finding the optimal steaming temperature to be 650°C, yielding 29.7% and 20.3% propylene at the initial and steady states, respectively, at 600°C.
