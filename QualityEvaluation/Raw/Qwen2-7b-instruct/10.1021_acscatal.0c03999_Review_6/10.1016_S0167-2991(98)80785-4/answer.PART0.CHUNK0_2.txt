The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, carbon dioxide (CO2) promotes the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts. This enhancing effect of CO2 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst leads to an increase in the yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation. Moreover, partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalysts demonstrate higher activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 is maintained in a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the catalyst's enhanced performance.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有着显著影响。具体而言，二氧化碳（CO2）仅在SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂上促进C3H8的脱氢作用以产生C3H6。CO2对该Cr203/SiO2催化剂的增强效果导致C3H6产率的提高和催化剂失活的抑制。此外，部分氧化的Cr203支持在SiO2上的催化剂在脱氢C3H8时表现出更高的活性。在CO2的存在下，Cr203/SiO2的表面被维持在部分氧化状态，这有助于催化剂性能的提升。
