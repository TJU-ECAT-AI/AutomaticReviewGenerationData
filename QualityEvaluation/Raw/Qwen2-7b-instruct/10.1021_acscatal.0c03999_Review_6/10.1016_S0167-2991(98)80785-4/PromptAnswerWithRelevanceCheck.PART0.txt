[1] "The effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The document highlights that carbon dioxide only exerts promoting effects on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. This suggests that the surface interaction and reactivity of the catalyst with CO2 are crucial, particularly when supported on SiO2. These findings provide insights into optimizing catalytic systems for the process by selecting appropriate support materials and considering the reducibility of the catalyst, as the partially oxidized state of the Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is found to be active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the extent of catalyst activation and deactivation. Specifically, the use of SiO2 as a support material enables CO2 to exert promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 over Cr203 catalysts. This indicates that the presence of CO2 can maintain the catalyst surface partially oxidized, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. Optimization of catalytic systems for this process can focus on incorporating SiO2 as a support material and utilizing Fe oxide catalysts that can maintain their active state in the presence of CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，这会影响催化剂的激活和失活程度。特别是，使用SiO2作为支撑材料可以使CO2在Cr203催化剂上对C3H8脱氢产生促进作用，以生产C3H6。这表明，CO2的存在可以保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态，从而增强C3H6的产率并抑制催化剂的失活。优化此过程的催化体系可以集中在采用SiO2作为支撑材料和利用能在CO2存在下保持活性状态的Fe氧化物催化剂。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, carbon dioxide (CO2) promotes the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts. This enhancing effect of CO2 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst leads to an increase in the yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation. Moreover, partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalysts demonstrate higher activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 is maintained in a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the catalyst's enhanced performance.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有着显著影响。具体而言，二氧化碳（CO2）仅在SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂上促进C3H8的脱氢作用以产生C3H6。CO2对该Cr203/SiO2催化剂的增强效果导致C3H6产率的提高和催化剂失活的抑制。此外，部分氧化的Cr203支持在SiO2上的催化剂在脱氢C3H8时表现出更高的活性。在CO2的存在下，Cr203/SiO2的表面被维持在部分氧化状态，这有助于催化剂性能的提升。

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the use of SiO2 as a support material enhances the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 in the presence of CO2. This indicates that the surface state of the catalyst, particularly its partial oxidation, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. 

2. The promotion of the dehydrogenation reaction by CO2 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst leads to an enhanced yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation. This suggests that CO2 affects the reactivity of the catalyst by maintaining its surface in a partially oxidized state, which is beneficial for the reaction.

3. A partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is highly active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. This highlights the importance of the catalyst's oxidation state for the reaction efficiency.

4. In the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst is kept in a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the catalyst's performance in the dehydrogenation reaction. This finding implies that maintaining a specific surface state of the catalyst is critical for optimizing its performance in CO2-ODHP processes.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their ability to maintain partial oxidation states during the reaction. The Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, when exposed to CO2, maintains a partially oxidized state on its surface, enhancing its activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. This indicates that maintaining a certain degree of oxidation on the catalyst's surface is crucial for efficient CO2-ODHP reactions. The support material, in this case, SiO2, plays a role in enabling the promoter CO2 to exert its effects on the catalyst, specifically enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
