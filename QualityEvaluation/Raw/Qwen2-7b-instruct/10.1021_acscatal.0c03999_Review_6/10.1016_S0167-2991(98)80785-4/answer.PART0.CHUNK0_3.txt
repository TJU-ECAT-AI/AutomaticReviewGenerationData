1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the use of SiO2 as a support material enhances the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 in the presence of CO2. This indicates that the surface state of the catalyst, particularly its partial oxidation, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. 

2. The promotion of the dehydrogenation reaction by CO2 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst leads to an enhanced yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation. This suggests that CO2 affects the reactivity of the catalyst by maintaining its surface in a partially oxidized state, which is beneficial for the reaction.

3. A partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is highly active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. This highlights the importance of the catalyst's oxidation state for the reaction efficiency.

4. In the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst is kept in a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the catalyst's performance in the dehydrogenation reaction. This finding implies that maintaining a specific surface state of the catalyst is critical for optimizing its performance in CO2-ODHP processes.
