[1] "The effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The document highlights that carbon dioxide only exerts promoting effects on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. This suggests that the surface interaction and reactivity of the catalyst with CO2 are crucial, particularly when supported on SiO2. These findings provide insights into optimizing catalytic systems for the process by selecting appropriate support materials and considering the reducibility of the catalyst, as the partially oxidized state of the Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is found to be active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。文献指出，仅SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂表现出促进效应，增强C3H6的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这表明催化剂表面与CO2的相互作用和反应性至关重要，特别是在SiO2上时。这些发现为优化此过程的催化系统提供了见解，通过选择合适的支撑材料和考虑催化剂的还原性，考虑到部分氧化状态的Cr203支持在SiO2催化剂对于C3H8脱氢是活性的。
