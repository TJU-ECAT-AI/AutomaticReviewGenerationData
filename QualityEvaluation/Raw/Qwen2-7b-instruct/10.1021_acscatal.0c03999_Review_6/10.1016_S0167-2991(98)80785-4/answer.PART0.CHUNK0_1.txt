The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the extent of catalyst activation and deactivation. Specifically, the use of SiO2 as a support material enables CO2 to exert promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 over Cr203 catalysts. This indicates that the presence of CO2 can maintain the catalyst surface partially oxidized, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. Optimization of catalytic systems for this process can focus on incorporating SiO2 as a support material and utilizing Fe oxide catalysts that can maintain their active state in the presence of CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，这会影响催化剂的激活和失活程度。特别是，使用SiO2作为支撑材料可以使CO2在Cr203催化剂上对C3H8脱氢产生促进作用，以生产C3H6。这表明，CO2的存在可以保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态，从而增强C3H6的产率并抑制催化剂的失活。优化此过程的催化体系可以集中在采用SiO2作为支撑材料和利用能在CO2存在下保持活性状态的Fe氧化物催化剂。
