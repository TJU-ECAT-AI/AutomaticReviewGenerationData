[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their ability to maintain partial oxidation states during the reaction. The Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, when exposed to CO2, maintains a partially oxidized state on its surface, enhancing its activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. This indicates that maintaining a certain degree of oxidation on the catalyst's surface is crucial for efficient CO2-ODHP reactions. The support material, in this case, SiO2, plays a role in enabling the promoter CO2 to exert its effects on the catalyst, specifically enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

Fe氧化基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，通过影响它们维持反应期间催化剂表面部分氧化状态的能力。Cr203/SiO2催化剂，在CO2存在下，保持其表面的部分氧化状态，增强其对C3H8脱氢的活性。这表明维持催化剂表面一定程度的氧化状态对于高效CO2-ODHP反应至关重要。在这种情况下，支持材料SiO2起着使促进剂CO2能够在催化剂上发挥效果的作用，特别是增强C3H6的产率并抑制催化剂失活。
