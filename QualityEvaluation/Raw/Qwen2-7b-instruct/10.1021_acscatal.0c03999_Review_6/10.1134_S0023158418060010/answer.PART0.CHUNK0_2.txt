[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[4] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

1. Using low-acidity silicate supports in catalyst preparation for dehydrogenation reduces coke formation and extends the operational effectiveness of chromium and gallium-containing systems.
2. Acid hydroxyls on these supports are crucial for creating a dispersed active surface.
3. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces during propane dehydrogenation.
4. CO2 prevents olefin polymerization and reduces propane conversion by inhibiting olefin adsorption.
5. In chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to CO2-induced coke and hydrogen oxidation outweighs the negative effects.

1. 使用低酸性硅酸盐支持物在脱氢催化剂制备中可以减少焦炭形成并延长铬和镓含量系统的有效运行时间。
2. 这些支持物上的酸羟基对于形成分散的活性表面至关重要。
3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，CO2作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，并且与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。
4. CO2通过抑制烯烃吸附来防止烯烃聚合并减少丙烷转化。
5. 对于铬系统，由于CO2引起的焦炭和氢氧化合物的氧化导致丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，这超过了负面效应的影响。
