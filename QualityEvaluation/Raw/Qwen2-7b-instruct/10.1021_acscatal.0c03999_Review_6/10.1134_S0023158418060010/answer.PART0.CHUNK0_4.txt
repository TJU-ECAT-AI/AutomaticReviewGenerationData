[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[4] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

The study reveals that using low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation significantly reduces coke formation and enhances the effective operational duration of catalysts containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga). The acid hydroxyls of these supports contribute to the formation of a dispersed active surface. To optimize the catalysts' activity and stability, it is crucial to ensure not just the dispersion of the active phase but also its strong adhesion to the silicate support surface, a task that is challenging with deposition methods. Carbon dioxide (CO2) functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, inhibiting olefin adsorption. In chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases propylene yield and operational stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing any negative effects.

研究发现，使用低酸性硅酸盐载体在脱氢催化剂的制备中显著减少了焦炭形成，并延长了含Cr或Ga系统的有效操作时间。这些载体上的酸羟基对分散活性表面的形成起着重要作用。为了优化催化剂的活性和稳定性，不仅需要实现活性组分的分散，还需要确保其牢固地吸附在硅酸盐载体表面上，这在沉积法中是具有挑战性的任务。二氧化碳（CO2）作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，抑制了烯烃的吸附。在Cr系统中，引入CO2通过氧化焦炭和氢提高了丙烯产量和操作稳定性，克服了任何负面影响。
