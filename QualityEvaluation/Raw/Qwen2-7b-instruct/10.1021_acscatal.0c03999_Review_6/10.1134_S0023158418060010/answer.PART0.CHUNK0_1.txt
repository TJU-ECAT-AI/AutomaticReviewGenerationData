[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[4] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

1. The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation systems improved the effectiveness of operation and reduced coke formation.
2. Acid hydroxyls of silicate supports are crucial for forming a dispersed active surface.
3. To enhance the activity and stability of catalysts, a strong attachment of dispersed active phase particles to the silicate support surface is essential, which is challenging to achieve through deposition methods.
4. Carbon dioxide inhibits the adsorption of olefins, thus preventing their polymerization and reducing propane conversion by stopping olefin adsorption.
5. In chromium-based catalysts, the introduction of CO2 increases propylene yield and operational stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing the negative effects.

1. 在脱氢催化剂的制备中使用低酸性硅酸盐支持体，可以提高操作的有效性和减少焦炭形成。
2. 硅酸盐支持体上的酸羟基对于形成分散活性表面至关重要。
3. 要增强催化剂的活性和稳定性，必须在硅酸盐支撑表面上牢固地附着分散的活性相颗粒，这通过沉积方法难以实现。
4. 二氧化碳抑制烯烃吸附，从而阻止它们的聚合，降低丙烷转化率并阻止烯烃吸附。
5. 对于铬基催化剂，引入CO2增加了丙烯产量和操作稳定性，通过氧化焦炭和氢气，其负面影响被丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高所抵消。
