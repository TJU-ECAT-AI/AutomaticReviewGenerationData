[1] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[2] "In the case of the gallium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[3] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

1. The use of CO2 as an additive in the dehydrogenation of propane avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur when oxygen is introduced, enabling efficient utilization of this greenhouse gas.
2. In the case of gallium catalysts, the introduction of CO2 leads to an increase in propylene yield and operation stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing the negative effects.
3. The introduction of CO2 during propane dehydrogenation affects the competition among CO2, propane, and propylene adsorption on the catalyst surface, indicating its dual role as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke while competing for adsorption sites with hydrocarbons.
