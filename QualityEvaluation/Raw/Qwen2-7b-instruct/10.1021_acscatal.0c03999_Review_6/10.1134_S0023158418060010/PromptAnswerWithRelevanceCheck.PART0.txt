[1] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[2] "In the case of the gallium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[3] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propyl- ene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

The introduction of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane affects the formation of propylene and the conversion of propane through competitive adsorption with hydrocarbons. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, inhibiting the adsorption of olefins and thus preventing their polymerization. In gallium-based systems, CO2 complicates propylene formation and decreases its yield, possibly due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species. In contrast, chromium systems benefit from the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction, leading to increased propylene yield and operational stability despite negative effects.

CO2在丙烷脱氢过程中的引入，通过与碳氢化合物的竞争性吸附影响丙烯的形成和丙烷的转化。CO2作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，抑制了烯烃的吸附并阻止了它们的聚合。在镓基系统中，CO2的引入使丙烯的形成变得复杂，并减少了其产量，这可能是因为还原镓氧化物种被CO2氧化的原因。相比之下，铬基系统受益于在CO2引入后焦炭和氢的氧化，导致丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，尽管存在负面影响。

The study reveals that using low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation significantly reduces coke formation and enhances the effective operational duration of catalysts containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga). The acid hydroxyls of these supports contribute to the formation of a dispersed active surface. To optimize the catalysts' activity and stability, it is crucial to ensure not just the dispersion of the active phase but also its strong adhesion to the silicate support surface, a task that is challenging with deposition methods. Carbon dioxide (CO2) functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, inhibiting olefin adsorption. In chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases propylene yield and operational stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing any negative effects.

研究发现，使用低酸性硅酸盐载体在脱氢催化剂的制备中显著减少了焦炭形成，并延长了含Cr或Ga系统的有效操作时间。这些载体上的酸羟基对分散活性表面的形成起着重要作用。为了优化催化剂的活性和稳定性，不仅需要实现活性组分的分散，还需要确保其牢固地吸附在硅酸盐载体表面上，这在沉积法中是具有挑战性的任务。二氧化碳（CO2）作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，抑制了烯烃的吸附。在Cr系统中，引入CO2通过氧化焦炭和氢提高了丙烯产量和操作稳定性，克服了任何负面影响。
