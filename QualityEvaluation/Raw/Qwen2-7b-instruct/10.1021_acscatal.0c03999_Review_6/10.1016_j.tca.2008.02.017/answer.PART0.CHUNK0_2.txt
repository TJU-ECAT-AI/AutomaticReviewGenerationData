<p>The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide.</p>
<p>The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R 3c.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]. An effect of temperature on the rate of homogeneous phase reaction (empty reactor) and the catalytic performance of the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is comparatively presented in Fig. 4A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream. The rate of activ- ity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6. It is observed that the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared to inert one.</p>
<p>The thermal analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant decrease in the detected total mass loss. It is clear that an amount of oxygen-containing surface species was drastically reduced during the catalytic reaction.</p>
<p>An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process. Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time- on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The interaction between CO2 and the active carbon- based samples was studied by TG. The resulting DTG profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It should be noticed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air.</p>

The document discusses how the addition of chromium to active carbon supports affects the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of CO2. The XRD analysis reveals that the addition of chromium leads to the formation of a crystalline phase of chromium oxide, which has a distinct rhombohedral structure. This is evident from the diffraction peaks at specific angles, indicating the presence of -Cr2O3. The study also highlights that the activity of the catalysts increases with the addition of chromium up to a certain point, after which it starts to decline due to the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface and the loss of active surface groups. The use of CO2 in the reaction medium has a protective effect against deactivation, as it reduces the amount of oxygen-containing surface species. The thermal analysis confirms the formation of carbonaceous deposits and the loss of active sites on the catalyst surface, which contributes to the deactivation over time. The study concludes that the presence of CO2 helps mitigate the deactivation process by reducing the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

文档讨论了向活性碳载体中添加铬对CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的影响。X射线衍射分析表明，添加铬导致形成铬氧化物的结晶相，该相具有特定的三斜晶系结构。从特定角度的衍射峰可以看出，存在- Cr2O3。研究还指出，在一定范围内，随着铬含量的增加，催化剂的活性会提高，但超过这个点后，活性开始下降，原因是催化剂表面形成了无活性的焦炭，并且活性表面组分流失。在反应介质中使用CO2有助于防止失活，因为它减少了表面含氧基团的数量。热分析证实了在催化剂表面上形成碳沉积物以及活性位点的损失，这是导致随时间退化的因素。研究得出结论，CO2的存在有助于减轻失活过程，通过减少催化剂表面的碳沉积物的形成。
