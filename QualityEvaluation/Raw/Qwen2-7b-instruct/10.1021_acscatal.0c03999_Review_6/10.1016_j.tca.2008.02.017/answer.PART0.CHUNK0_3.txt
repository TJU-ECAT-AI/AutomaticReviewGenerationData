[1] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[2] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[3] "This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10];(2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [11-14];(3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[4] "In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[5] "It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers."
[6] "Moreover, a formation of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed."

The document explains how the presence of CO2 in the process of propane dehydrogenation enhances the yield of propene compared to traditional methods. This is due to several factors: direct oxidation of propane to propene, consumption of hydrogen through a reverse water-gas shift reaction, and the slowing down of catalyst deactivation through coke gasification. Active carbon support is utilized in the process, which contributes to the catalytic efficiency of propane dehydrogenation. During the catalytic reaction, surface oxygen-containing groups decompose, and an inactive carbon deposit forms on the catalyst surface, affecting its performance over time.

文档解释了在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的存在可以提高丙烯的产率，与传统方法相比。这是由于几个因素：丙烷直接氧化为丙烯、氢消耗通过逆向水煤气变换反应以及通过焦炭气化减缓催化剂失活速率。活性碳支持被用于该过程，有助于丙烷脱氢的催化效率。在催化反应中，表面氧含量组分分解，并在催化剂表面上形成不活性碳沉积物，影响其随时间的性能。
