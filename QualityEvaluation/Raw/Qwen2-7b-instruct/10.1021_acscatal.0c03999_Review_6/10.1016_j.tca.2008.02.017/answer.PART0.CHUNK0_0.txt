1. Active carbons are cost-effective materials that can be synthesized through chemical or physical activation from various sources including wood, coal, lignite, coconut shells, peat, fruit pits, polymers, or petroleum processing residues.

2. Numerous active carbon-supported catalysts have already been commercialized, particularly for hydrogenation processes involving noble metals.

3. The promotion of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 leads to a higher yield of propene compared to traditional methods. CO2's role in this process is explained by its involvement in multiple reactions.

4. The effectiveness of CO2 in promoting propane dehydrogenation depends on the properties of the support material.

5. The fresh and used samples were evaluated under various temperatures (25-1000°C) within different atmospheres (inert gas, air, or CO2).

6. An inactive carbon deposit was observed forming on the catalyst surface during the reaction process.

7. The partial breakdown of surface oxygen-containing groups and the presence of CrOx species were identified as active components in the catalytic process.

8. The reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium by the carbonaceous support is responsible for the additional mass loss observed at approximately 920°C.

9. Chromium oxide (CrOx) is recognized as a catalytically active phase in the carbon gasification process.

10. The increased total mass loss observed in used catalysts compared to the fresh sample indicates the formation of a carbonaceous deposit during the dehydrogenation process.
