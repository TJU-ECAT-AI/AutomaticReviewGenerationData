[1] "The CrOx-containing active carbons appeared to be extremely active catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity. Unfortunately, the active carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation."
[2] "The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface. This effect was confirmed by TG measurements in the O2-rich atmosphere. Additionally, it was proved that CO2 was practically inert in a relation to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the catalytic process."

This study highlights the crucial role of chromium loading in the performance of active carbon-supported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The highest conversion rates were observed for catalysts with a chromium content around 5 wt.%, as these materials exhibited both high activity and selectivity. The introduction of higher amounts of chromium led to the formation of a crystalline Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked the micropores, resulting in a decline in catalytic efficiency. The researchers utilized thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the reasons behind the catalyst deactivation. They found that the active carbon support contained surface species resembling carbonyl and carboxyl groups, which were instrumental in the catalytic process. These surface groups' concentration gradually decreased post-catalytic run, indicating their contribution to the catalytic activity. Simultaneously, the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface was identified as another cause of deactivation. Moreover, the study confirmed that CO2 had minimal impact on the carbonaceous support under the conditions employed for the catalytic process.

这项研究强调了活性碳支持催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应时，铬负载量对催化剂性能的关键作用。在约5 wt.%的铬含量下观察到最高转化率，这些材料表现出高活性和选择性。随着铬含量的增加，形成了结晶态Cr2O3相，部分堵塞了微孔，导致催化效率下降。研究人员通过热重分析（TGA）来探究催化剂失活的原因。他们发现活性碳支持物包含类似于羰基和羧基的表面物种，在催化过程中起着关键作用。这些表面物种的浓度在催化运行后逐渐减少，表明它们对催化活性的贡献。同时，研究确定了催化剂表面形成无活性焦炭是催化剂失活的另一个原因。此外，研究证实了在催化过程中使用条件下，CO2对碳质支撑物的影响很小。
