The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions influence their performance through the formation of a specific phase of chromium oxide (-Cr2O3) on the active carbon support. This phase, characterized by its diffraction peaks at 33.5, 36.1, and 54.82 degrees, leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity due to partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the surface concentration of active sites like carbonyl- and carboxyl-like species. The formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation process further contributes to the catalyst deactivation. The thermal analysis reveals that the active carbon support exhibits the presence of these active surface species, and the decrease in their concentration after the catalytic run indicates the deactivation mechanism. The introduction of chromium oxide shifts the oxidation process towards lower temperatures, suggesting its catalytic role in carbon gasification. The gasification of the catalyst starts from 310 degrees Celsius under CO2 conditions, indicating the extent of carbonaceous deposit formation.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的可还原性和支持材料影响其性能，通过在活性碳支持上形成特定的铬氧化物相（-Cr2O3）。这种相由33.5、36.1和54.82度的衍射峰表征，导致催化活性下降，因为微孔部分被阻塞，表面活性位点如羰基和羧基等物种的浓度降低。催化剂表面形成不活性焦炭进一步导致催化剂失活。热分析显示，活性碳支持上存在这些活性表面物种，并且催化运行后其浓度的减少表明了失活机制。引入铬氧化物将氧化过程向更低温度移动，暗示其在碳气化中的催化作用。在二氧化碳条件下，催化剂的气化从310摄氏度开始，表明碳沉积物形成的程度。

<p>The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide.</p>
<p>The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R 3c.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]. An effect of temperature on the rate of homogeneous phase reaction (empty reactor) and the catalytic performance of the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is comparatively presented in Fig. 4A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream. The rate of activ- ity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6. It is observed that the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared to inert one.</p>
<p>The thermal analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant decrease in the detected total mass loss. It is clear that an amount of oxygen-containing surface species was drastically reduced during the catalytic reaction.</p>
<p>An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process. Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time- on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The interaction between CO2 and the active carbon- based samples was studied by TG. The resulting DTG profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It should be noticed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air.</p>

The document discusses how the addition of chromium to active carbon supports affects the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of CO2. The XRD analysis reveals that the addition of chromium leads to the formation of a crystalline phase of chromium oxide, which has a distinct rhombohedral structure. This is evident from the diffraction peaks at specific angles, indicating the presence of -Cr2O3. The study also highlights that the activity of the catalysts increases with the addition of chromium up to a certain point, after which it starts to decline due to the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface and the loss of active surface groups. The use of CO2 in the reaction medium has a protective effect against deactivation, as it reduces the amount of oxygen-containing surface species. The thermal analysis confirms the formation of carbonaceous deposits and the loss of active sites on the catalyst surface, which contributes to the deactivation over time. The study concludes that the presence of CO2 helps mitigate the deactivation process by reducing the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

文档讨论了向活性碳载体中添加铬对CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的影响。X射线衍射分析表明，添加铬导致形成铬氧化物的结晶相，该相具有特定的三斜晶系结构。从特定角度的衍射峰可以看出，存在- Cr2O3。研究还指出，在一定范围内，随着铬含量的增加，催化剂的活性会提高，但超过这个点后，活性开始下降，原因是催化剂表面形成了无活性的焦炭，并且活性表面组分流失。在反应介质中使用CO2有助于防止失活，因为它减少了表面含氧基团的数量。热分析证实了在催化剂表面上形成碳沉积物以及活性位点的损失，这是导致随时间退化的因素。研究得出结论，CO2的存在有助于减轻失活过程，通过减少催化剂表面的碳沉积物的形成。

[1] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[2] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[3] "This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10];(2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [11-14];(3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[4] "In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."

The document explains how the presence of CO2 in the process of propane dehydrogenation enhances the yield of propene compared to traditional methods. This is due to several factors: direct oxidation of propane to propene, consumption of hydrogen through a reverse water-gas shift reaction, and the slowing down of catalyst deactivation through coke gasification. Active carbon support is utilized in the process, which contributes to the catalytic efficiency of propane dehydrogenation. During the catalytic reaction, surface oxygen-containing groups decompose, and an inactive carbon deposit forms on the catalyst surface, affecting its performance over time.

[1] "The CrOx-containing active carbons appeared to be extremely active catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity. Unfortunately, the active carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation."
[2] "The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface. This effect was confirmed by TG measurements in the O2-rich atmosphere. Additionally, it was proved that CO2 was practically inert in a relation to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the catalytic process."

This study highlights the crucial role of chromium loading in the performance of active carbon-supported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The highest conversion rates were observed for catalysts with a chromium content around 5 wt.%, as these materials exhibited both high activity and selectivity. The introduction of higher amounts of chromium led to the formation of a crystalline Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked the micropores, resulting in a decline in catalytic efficiency. The researchers utilized thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the reasons behind the catalyst deactivation. They found that the active carbon support contained surface species resembling carbonyl and carboxyl groups, which were instrumental in the catalytic process. These surface groups' concentration gradually decreased post-catalytic run, indicating their contribution to the catalytic activity. Simultaneously, the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface was identified as another cause of deactivation. Moreover, the study confirmed that CO2 had minimal impact on the carbonaceous support under the conditions employed for the catalytic process.

这项研究强调了活性碳支持催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应时，铬负载量对催化剂性能的关键作用。在约5 wt.%的铬含量下观察到最高转化率，这些材料表现出高活性和选择性。随着铬含量的增加，形成了结晶态Cr2O3相，部分堵塞了微孔，导致催化效率下降。研究人员通过热重分析（TGA）来探究催化剂失活的原因。他们发现活性碳支持物包含类似于羰基和羧基的表面物种，在催化过程中起着关键作用。这些表面物种的浓度在催化运行后逐渐减少，表明它们对催化活性的贡献。同时，研究确定了催化剂表面形成无活性焦炭是催化剂失活的另一个原因。此外，研究证实了在催化过程中使用条件下，CO2对碳质支撑物的影响很小。
