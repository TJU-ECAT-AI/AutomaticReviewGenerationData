[1] "Active carbon appeared to be a very promising candidate for a support of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts as well."
[2] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R 3c."
[3] "It should be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support."
[4] "The rate of activ- ity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6."
[5] "The thermal analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant decrease in the detected total mass loss."
[6] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[7] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions influence their performance through the formation of a specific phase of chromium oxide (-Cr2O3) on the active carbon support. This phase, characterized by its diffraction peaks at 33.5, 36.1, and 54.82 degrees, leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity due to partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the surface concentration of active sites like carbonyl- and carboxyl-like species. The formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation process further contributes to the catalyst deactivation. The thermal analysis reveals that the active carbon support exhibits the presence of these active surface species, and the decrease in their concentration after the catalytic run indicates the deactivation mechanism. The introduction of chromium oxide shifts the oxidation process towards lower temperatures, suggesting its catalytic role in carbon gasification. The gasification of the catalyst starts from 310 degrees Celsius under CO2 conditions, indicating the extent of carbonaceous deposit formation.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的可还原性和支持材料影响其性能，通过在活性碳支持上形成特定的铬氧化物相（-Cr2O3）。这种相由33.5、36.1和54.82度的衍射峰表征，导致催化活性下降，因为微孔部分被阻塞，表面活性位点如羰基和羧基等物种的浓度降低。催化剂表面形成不活性焦炭进一步导致催化剂失活。热分析显示，活性碳支持上存在这些活性表面物种，并且催化运行后其浓度的减少表明了失活机制。引入铬氧化物将氧化过程向更低温度移动，暗示其在碳气化中的催化作用。在二氧化碳条件下，催化剂的气化从310摄氏度开始，表明碳沉积物形成的程度。
