1. The reducibility of the iron oxide catalyst significantly affects its activity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. Using support materials like Al2O3 modifies the surface properties of the catalyst. The reaction mechanism includes activation of CO2, deprotonation, and hydrogenation. Optimization of the catalytic system necessitates a careful selection of both the reducibility of the catalyst and the support material.
