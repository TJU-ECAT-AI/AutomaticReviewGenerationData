The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is greatly affected by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation. Support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and boost its activity. Optimizing these factors could result in more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
