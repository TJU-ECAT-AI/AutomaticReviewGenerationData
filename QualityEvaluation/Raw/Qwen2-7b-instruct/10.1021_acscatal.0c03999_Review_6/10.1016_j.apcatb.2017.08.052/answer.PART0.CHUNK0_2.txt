The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Reducing Fe oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 leads to an increase in propylene yield compared to reduction without CO2. Using SiO2 as a support material enhances the catalyst's stability and activity under CO2-ODHP conditions. The reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP involves CO2 activation by the catalyst, followed by propane dehydrogenation. Optimizing the catalytic system for the CO2-ODHP process entails choosing suitable reducibility and support materials for the Fe oxide catalyst.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有很大影响。在CO2存在的条件下，减少Fe氧化物催化剂可以提高丙烯产率，与不使用CO2的减少相比。使用SiO2作为支持材料可以增强催化剂在CO2-ODHP条件下的稳定性和活性。CO2-ODHP过程的反应机制涉及催化剂激活CO2，随后是丙烷脱氢。优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化体系包括为Fe氧化物催化剂选择合适的可还原性和支持材料。
