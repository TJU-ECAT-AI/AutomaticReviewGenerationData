[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

1. The addition of Fe oxide to the catalyst decreased its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions regardless of the preparation method.
2. The presence of water significantly increased the activity of two types of Fe oxide-doped catalysts, one prepared by the sol-gel method and the other by impregnation.
3. The coexistence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with GaOAl bonding was deemed crucial for the enhancement effect of water.
4. The most effective SnO2 loading for improving NO reduction activity in the presence of water was found to be 5 wt%.
5. Water was found to facilitate the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, contributing to the enhanced performance.
6. Water selectively inhibits specific reaction pathways, notably preventing the formation of NO and COx from NO2 and propene on the SnO2 site, thus avoiding propene oxidation without reducing NO.

1. 添加Fe氧化物使催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能降低，无论制备方法如何。
2. 水的存在显著提高了两种Fe氧化物掺杂催化剂的活性，一种通过溶胶法制备，另一种通过浸渍制备。
3. 存在于SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种中的GaOAl键合被认为是水增强效果的关键。
4. 在水存在的条件下提高NO还原活性的最佳SnO2负载被发现为5 wt%。
5. 水被发现有助于去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物，从而提高了性能。
6. 水选择性抑制特定反应途径，特别是阻止NO2和丙烯之间的反应形成NO和COx在SnO2位点上，从而避免丙烯氧化而不减少NO。
