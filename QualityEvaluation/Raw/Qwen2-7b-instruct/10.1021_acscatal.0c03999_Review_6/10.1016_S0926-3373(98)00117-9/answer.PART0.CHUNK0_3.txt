[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The rst one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[3] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with GaOAl bonding is crucial for enhancing the catalyst's performance when hydrogen is present. Hydrogen aids in removing carbon deposits on the catalyst surface and selectively inhibits certain reaction pathways, leading to improved activity.
