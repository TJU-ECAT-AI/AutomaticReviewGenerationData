[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The rst one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[3] "The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of intimate GaOAl bonding between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for the enhancing effect of H2O on the catalytic activity. H2O promotes the catalytic process in two ways: by removing carbon deposits from the catalyst surface and selectively inhibiting the steps leading to propene oxidation without reducing NO.

SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种之间紧密的GaOAl键是促进水蒸气效果的关键。水通过两种方式促进了催化过程：去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物，并选择性地抑制导致丙烯氧化而不减少NO的步骤。

[1] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[2] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[3] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[4] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxida- tion to COx without reducing NO."

1. The presence of water significantly enhanced the activity of two types of catalysts: one prepared by sol-gel method and the other obtained by impregnating SnO2 onto Ga2O3Al2O3 produced via sol-gel process.
2. The optimal loading percentage of SnO2, relative to NO reduction activity in the presence of water, was identified as 5% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 prepared by the sol-gel method.
3. Transient response experiments suggested that one reason for the promotional effect of water is the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface by water.
4. Another reason attributed to the promotional effect of water involves selective inhibition of specific reaction steps. Water was found to hinder the reaction of NO2 with propene to produce NO and COx on the SnO2 site, thereby preventing propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO.

1. 水的存在显著提高了两种催化剂的活性：一种通过溶胶方法制备，另一种是通过将SnO2浸渍到由溶胶过程制得的Ga2O3Al2O3上。
2. 在水存在的条件下，对于通过溶胶法制备的SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3，确定最佳的SnO2负载百分比为5%，以实现NO还原活性的最大化。
3. 瞬态响应实验表明，促进效果的一个原因是水通过去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物。
4. 另一个促进效果的原因与特定反应步骤的选择性抑制有关。发现水阻碍了NO2与丙烯反应生成NO和COx在SnO2位点上的过程，从而防止了丙烯氧化为COx而不减少NO。
