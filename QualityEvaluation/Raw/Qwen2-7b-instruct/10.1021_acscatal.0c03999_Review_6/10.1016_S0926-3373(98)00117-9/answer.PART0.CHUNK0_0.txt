[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The rst one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[3] "The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of intimate GaOAl bonding between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for the enhancing effect of H2O on the catalytic activity. H2O promotes the catalytic process in two ways: by removing carbon deposits from the catalyst surface and selectively inhibiting the steps leading to propene oxidation without reducing NO.

SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种之间紧密的GaOAl键是促进水蒸气效果的关键。水通过两种方式促进了催化过程：去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物，并选择性地抑制导致丙烯氧化而不减少NO的步骤。
