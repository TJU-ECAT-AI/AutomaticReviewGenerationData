[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[3] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O."
[4] "It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

1. The presence of intimate GaOAl bonding between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for enhancing the catalyst's performance in the presence of H2O.
2. H2O promotes the removal of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface, contributing to its enhanced performance.
3. H2O selectively inhibits specific reaction pathways, further enhancing the catalyst's activity.
4. H2O prevents the reaction of NO2 with propene on the SnO2 site, leading to propene oxidation and not NO reduction.

1. SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3之间紧密的GaOAl键是H2O增强催化剂性能的关键。
2. H2O促进了催化剂表面碳质材料的去除，对催化剂性能的提升有贡献。
3. H2O选择性地抑制了某些反应步骤，进一步提高了催化剂的活性。
4. H2O阻止了NO2与propene在SnO2上的反应，导致propene氧化而不是NO还原。
