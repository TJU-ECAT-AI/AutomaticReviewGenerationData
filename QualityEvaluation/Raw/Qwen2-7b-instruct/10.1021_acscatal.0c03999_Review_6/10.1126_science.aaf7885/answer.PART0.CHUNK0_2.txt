[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3)."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[4] "The reaction parameters such as temperature, catalyst mass, total gas flow-rate, and partial pressures of propane (PC3H8) and oxygen (PO2) were varied to observe changes to product distributions by sampling the reactor exhaust stream via online gas chromatography and mass spectrometry."
[5] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[6] "Starting from our modeled active site (viz., >B-O-O-N<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >B-O-O- N< sites, breaking the O-O bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl-radical (Fig. 3C)."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reaction mechanism and the efficiency of the process. Higher reducibility can lead to better interaction between the catalyst and reactants, potentially enhancing the conversion rates and selectivities. Different support materials can alter the physical properties of the catalyst, such as surface area, porosity, and electronic structure, which in turn can affect the catalytic activity and stability. Optimizing these factors can lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, improving the overall process economics and environmental impact.
