[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[4] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[5] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity [kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1]."
[6] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points towards a novel, fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared to other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[7] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do not seem to significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions according to the provided literature. The focus is on the development of boron nitride catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane to propene conversions. The literature discusses the potential for boron nitride (BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials capable of catalyzing the ODHP reaction, highlighting their unique properties and high selectivity to olefins, such as propene and ethene. The active site proposed for these reactions is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 根据提供的文献，铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料似乎并未显著影响其在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能。文献的重点在于开发用于氧化脱氢过程（尤其是丙烷转化为丙烯）的硼氮化物（BN）和硼氮化碳纳米管（BNNT）催化剂的发展。文献讨论了作为催化材料的BN和BNNT的独特性质以及它们在醇类氧化反应中极高的选择性，如丙烯和乙烯。提出作为这些反应活性中心的是BN的氧终止的臂向边缘，这有助于氧化脱氢过程。
