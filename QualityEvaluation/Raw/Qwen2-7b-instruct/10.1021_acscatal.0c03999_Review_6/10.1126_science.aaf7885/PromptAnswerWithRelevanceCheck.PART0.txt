[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption."
[3] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation."
[4] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[5] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[6] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts currently show the most promising activity for ODHP, thanks to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge, even at moderate propane conversion levels. The key scientific hurdle involves preventing facile over-oxidation of propene into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx).

2. The potential energy savings from transitioning to ODHP technology are estimated to be approximately 45% of the current energy consumption. This efficiency gain, combined with the high demand for propene and its production energy requirements, underscores the potential impact of ODHP on a large scale.

3. There is a recognized need for the development of alternative materials capable of better controlling the partial oxidation process in ODHP, emphasizing the importance of kinetic control in enhancing the selectivity of propene production.

4. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit exceptional selectivity for propene in ODHP reactions, offering among the highest reported selectivities under ODHP conditions. This makes them promising candidates for improving propene yield in the process.

5. Despite variations in impurities across different boron nitride samples, these materials demonstrate almost identical catalytic performance, suggesting that the metal impurities are not significant factors affecting their effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

6. The authors propose that an oxygen molecule attached to a boron and a nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, represented as >B-O-O-N<) serves as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This site shares similarities with the active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidation processes, as well as with work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN.

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3)."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A)."
[4] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The shift towards using shale gas as feedstock for steam crackers has increased the availability of ethene but has also led to a gap in the supply of propene and other higher olefins, making the development of more efficient propene production methods, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), increasingly important.
2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages over traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to its exothermic nature and lower operating temperatures, as well as enhanced catalyst stability, which prevents the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface.
3. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits exceptional selectivity for propene production during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving 79% propene selectivity at 14% propane conversion.
4. The proposed reaction mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom, specifically an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of boron nitride (BN), acting as the active site. This site facilitates the reaction through the abstraction of hydrogen atoms and the formation of radicals, leading to the selective production of propene.

We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >B-O-O- N< sites, breaking the O-O bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl-radical (Fig. 3C)."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reaction mechanism and the efficiency of the process. Higher reducibility can lead to better interaction between the catalyst and reactants, potentially enhancing the conversion rates and selectivities. Different support materials can alter the physical properties of the catalyst, such as surface area, porosity, and electronic structure, which in turn can affect the catalytic activity and stability. Optimizing these factors can lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, improving the overall process economics and environmental impact.

For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."
[4] "Further kinetic insights were obtained by studying the influence of reactant concentrations (PO2, PC3H8) on the reaction rate. The inclusion of oxygen as a reactant is required for propane conversion using BN materials. The rate of propane consumption using h-BN indicates oxygen activation on the BN surface (Fig. 2A) and second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 (Fig. 2B)."
[5] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The high selectivity observed with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests that the presence of oxygen on the BN surface, particularly at an oxygen-terminated armchair edge, acts as an active site for the reaction. This finding provides insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The high activity and selectivity of BN materials compared to traditional catalysts indicate that they can significantly enhance the efficiency of the ODHP reaction, potentially addressing the gap in demand for propene and other olefins. Moreover, the stability of these materials under reaction conditions and their ability to maintain consistent performance over prolonged periods suggests they might offer a robust solution for industrial-scale applications.

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do not seem to significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions according to the provided literature. The focus is on the development of boron nitride catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane to propene conversions. The literature discusses the potential for boron nitride (BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials capable of catalyzing the ODHP reaction, highlighting their unique properties and high selectivity to olefins, such as propene and ethene. The active site proposed for these reactions is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
