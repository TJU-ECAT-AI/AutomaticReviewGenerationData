[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption."
[3] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation."
[4] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[5] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[6] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts currently show the most promising activity for ODHP, thanks to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge, even at moderate propane conversion levels. The key scientific hurdle involves preventing facile over-oxidation of propene into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx).

2. The potential energy savings from transitioning to ODHP technology are estimated to be approximately 45% of the current energy consumption. This efficiency gain, combined with the high demand for propene and its production energy requirements, underscores the potential impact of ODHP on a large scale.

3. There is a recognized need for the development of alternative materials capable of better controlling the partial oxidation process in ODHP, emphasizing the importance of kinetic control in enhancing the selectivity of propene production.

4. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit exceptional selectivity for propene in ODHP reactions, offering among the highest reported selectivities under ODHP conditions. This makes them promising candidates for improving propene yield in the process.

5. Despite variations in impurities across different boron nitride samples, these materials demonstrate almost identical catalytic performance, suggesting that the metal impurities are not significant factors affecting their effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

6. The authors propose that an oxygen molecule attached to a boron and a nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, represented as >B-O-O-N<) serves as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This site shares similarities with the active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidation processes, as well as with work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN.

1. 支持的钒氧化物催化剂目前在部分脱氢反应中显示出最有前景的活性，得益于活性钒位点的有利氧化还原性质。然而，在适度丙烷转化率下实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。科学的关键障碍在于防止容易过氧化，将丙烯转化为更热力学上稳定的CO和CO2（COx）。

2. 转向ODHP技术的潜在能源节省估计约为当前能源消耗的45%。这种效率提升，结合对丙烯的高需求及其生产所需能量的要求，强调了大规模实施ODHP的潜力。

3. 对于ODHP过程中的部分氧化，存在对提高丙烯选择性的需求，强调了控制动力学的重要性，以增强丙烯生产的选择性。

4. 六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）在ODHP反应中表现出对丙烯的极佳选择性，提供了在ODHP条件下最高报告的选择性。这使得它们成为提高丙烯产率的有希望的候选者。

5. 不同的氮化硼样品之间尽管存在杂质差异，但这些材料的催化性能几乎相同，表明金属杂质不是影响其在ODHP反应中有效性的重要因素。
