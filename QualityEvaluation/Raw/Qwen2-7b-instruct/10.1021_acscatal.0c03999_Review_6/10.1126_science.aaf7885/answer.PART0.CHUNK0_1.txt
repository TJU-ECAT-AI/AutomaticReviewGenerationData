[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3)."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A)."
[4] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The shift towards using shale gas as feedstock for steam crackers has increased the availability of ethene but has also led to a gap in the supply of propene and other higher olefins, making the development of more efficient propene production methods, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), increasingly important.
2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages over traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to its exothermic nature and lower operating temperatures, as well as enhanced catalyst stability, which prevents the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface.
3. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits exceptional selectivity for propene production during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving 79% propene selectivity at 14% propane conversion.
4. The proposed reaction mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom, specifically an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of boron nitride (BN), acting as the active site. This site facilitates the reaction through the abstraction of hydrogen atoms and the formation of radicals, leading to the selective production of propene.

1. 使用页岩气作为蒸汽裂解装置的原料，大大提高了廉价乙烷的可用性，同时也导致丙烯和其他更高烯烃的需求与供应之间存在差距，这使得提高丙烯生产效率的方法，如丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），变得越来越重要。
2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）相对于传统的非氧化脱氢过程具有优势，由于其放热性质和较低的操作温度，以及催化剂表面焦炭沉积的减少，从而提高了反应效率和催化剂稳定性。
3. 六方氮化硼（h-BN）在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出极高的丙烯选择性，在14%丙烷转化率下实现了79%的丙烯选择性。
4. 提议的反应机制表明，一个氧分子连接到一个硼和一个氮原子上，即氮化硼（BN）中的氧终止的臂椅边缘，充当了丙烷氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。通过氢原子的抽象和自由基的形成，该位点促进了丙烯的选择性生产。
