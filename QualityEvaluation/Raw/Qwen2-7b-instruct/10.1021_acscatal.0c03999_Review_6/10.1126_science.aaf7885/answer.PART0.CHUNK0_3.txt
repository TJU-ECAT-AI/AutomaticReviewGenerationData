[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3)."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."
[4] "Further kinetic insights were obtained by studying the influence of reactant concentrations (PO2, PC3H8) on the reaction rate. The inclusion of oxygen as a reactant is required for propane conversion using BN materials. The rate of propane consumption using h-BN indicates oxygen activation on the BN surface (Fig. 2A) and second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 (Fig. 2B)."
[5] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The high selectivity observed with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests that the presence of oxygen on the BN surface, particularly at an oxygen-terminated armchair edge, acts as an active site for the reaction. This finding provides insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The high activity and selectivity of BN materials compared to traditional catalysts indicate that they can significantly enhance the efficiency of the ODHP reaction, potentially addressing the gap in demand for propene and other olefins. Moreover, the stability of these materials under reaction conditions and their ability to maintain consistent performance over prolonged periods suggests they might offer a robust solution for industrial-scale applications.
