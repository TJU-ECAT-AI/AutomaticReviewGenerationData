<p>The performance of steam-activated iron-containing MFI zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the composition of the matrix. The Al- and Ga-containing zeolites showed a higher initial activity than the Ge-containing and purely silicious matrixes, and particularly an improved resistance toward deactivation.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields and a slower deactivation than FeMFI and FeGeMFI. For identical steam-activation conditions, the presence of aluminum and gallium leads to a higher concentration of iron oxo-clusters stabilized in the zeolite pores. These species appear to be more efficient sites for the ODHP with N2O than the more isolated nature of the iron species in FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites, for which the extraction of (inactive) framework iron is less facilitated.</p>
<p>No correlation was found between the density and strength of the acidic centers and the deactivation rate. The Al- and Ga-containing samples have a 23 higher density of total acid sites, with ca. 2 and 5 times higher density of Brnsted and Lewis acidity than FeGeMFI and FeMFI, respectively. Despite this, the former samples were considerably less susceptible for deactivation.</p>

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Aluminum (Al) and gallium (Ga) in the zeolite matrix lead to higher initial activity and improved resistance against deactivation compared to germanium (Ge) and pure silica matrixes. The presence of Al and Ga facilitates the extraction of framework iron, creating more efficient iron oxo-clusters within the zeolite pores. This results in better performance in the ODHP reaction with N2O. Moreover, the Al- and Ga-containing samples exhibit a higher density of total acid sites with enhanced Brnsted and Lewis acidity. Despite this, they are less prone to deactivation, indicating that the acidic center density and strength do not directly correlate with deactivation rates in this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料在CO2-ODHP反应中对其性能产生显著影响。铝（Al）和镓（Ga）在沸石晶格中的存在导致更高的初始活性和对失活的改进抵抗力，与锗（Ge）和纯硅酸盐晶格相比。Al和Ga的存在促进了框架铁的提取，在沸石孔中形成了更多高效的铁氧簇。这在N2O介导的ODHP反应中产生了更好的性能。此外，Al-和Ga含样品表现出更高密度的总酸中心，具有增强的Brnsted和Lewis酸性。尽管如此，它们的失活倾向较小，表明酸中心密度和强度与此过程中失活率之间没有直接相关性。
