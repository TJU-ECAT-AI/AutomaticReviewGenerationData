[1] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites."
[2] "The higher density and strength of acid sites in the former samples did not induce a faster catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The distinct performance of both groups of zeolites is likely related to the different iron speciation, which is influenced by the composition of the framework."
[4] "FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites were a very pale tonality, nearly white, suggesting the more isolated nature of the iron species in these catalysts."
[5] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI require milder steaming conditions for achieving the same degree of iron extraction and clustering as compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI materials show enhanced propylene yields and slower deactivation rates compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites. The higher density and strength of acid sites in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI do not lead to faster catalyst deactivation, implying a more efficient use of iron species. The distinct performance of the catalysts is attributed to differences in iron speciation influenced by the framework composition. The lighter color of FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites suggests a more isolated nature of iron species, which might affect their reactivity. Additionally, FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI require gentler steaming conditions to achieve the same level of iron extraction and clustering compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI材料的丙烯产率更高，且由于焦炭沉积导致的失活速率更慢，与FeGeMFI和FeMFI沸石相比。FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中较高的酸位密度和强度并未导致催化剂更快的失活，表明铁物种的高效利用。催化剂的不同表现归因于框架组成对铁物种的影响。FeGeMFI和FeMFI沸石较浅的颜色暗示着铁物种的更孤立状态，这可能会影响它们的活性。此外，FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI需要更温和的蒸气条件来达到与FeGeMFI和FeMFI相同水平的铁提取和聚集体化。
