<p>The catalysts, which were characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, N2 adsorption, NH3-TPD, and FTIR of pyridine adsorbed, have a very similar iron content (0.60.7 wt %).</p>
<p>A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied to simultaneously monitor activity and mass changes during the ODHP reaction.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI zeolites display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites.</p>
<p>The higher density and strength of acid sites in the former samples did not induce a faster catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>In general, catalyst deactivation was accelerated upon decreasing the reaction temperature.</p>
<p>The total amount of coke formed in the samples during 400 min on stream ranged from 6 to 23 wt %, increasing linearly with the amount of propylene produced.</p>
<p>The distinct performance of both groups of zeolites is likely related to the different iron speciation, which is influenced by the composition of the framework.</p>
<p>The smaller primary crystallites of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the presence of mesopores in these samples, which are created by dislodgement of aluminum and gallium to extraframework positions, appear to be also beneficial for higher catalyst effectiveness and a reduced deactivation.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI present a high degree of iron clustering in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and even iron oxide nanoparticles, while the degree of clustering in FeGeMFI and FeMFI is much less extended and a main fraction of iron is stabilized in isolated extraframework positions.</p>
<p>FeGeMFI is considerably less active than FeMFI even if the forms of iron as well as other (textural and acidic) properties are very similar in both materials.</p>
<p>The TEOM technique conclusively shows that deactivation of zeolites in ODHP is due to coke formation.</p>
<p>The more acidic FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes did not lead to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by coking as compared to the more neutral FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes.</p>
<p>The presence of mesopores in steamed FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the small size of the resulting primary crystallites in these samples, can be also responsible for their improved ODHP performance.</p>

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the iron speciation, crystallite size, and presence of mesopores within the catalyst. FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI zeolites show higher propylene yields and slower deactivation due to coking, likely because of their higher density of acid sites, clustering of iron species, and the presence of mesopores. The similarity in iron content among the samples, despite differences in catalytic performance, indicates that the framework composition plays a critical role in determining the reaction mechanism and optimizing the catalytic system for CO2-ODHP. The TEOM technique confirms that coke formation is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in this process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料会影响CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，这影响铁物种、晶粒大小和催化剂内的介孔的存在。FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI沸石显示出更高的丙烯产率和更慢的结焦导致的失活，可能是因为它们酸中心密度更高、铁物种聚集体化以及存在介孔。样品中铁含量的相似性，尽管催化性能不同，表明框架组成在确定反应机制和优化此过程的催化系统方面起着关键作用。TEOM技术证实了结焦是催化剂失活的主要原因。
