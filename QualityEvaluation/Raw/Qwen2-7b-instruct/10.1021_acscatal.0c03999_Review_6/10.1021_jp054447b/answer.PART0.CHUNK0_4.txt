<p>The catalysts, which were characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, N2 adsorption, NH3-TPD, and FTIR of pyridine adsorbed, have a very similar iron content (0.60.7 wt %).</p>
<p>A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied to simultaneously monitor activity and mass changes during the ODHP reaction.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI zeolites display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites.</p>
<p>In general, catalyst deactivation was accelerated upon decreasing the reaction temperature.</p>
<p>The total amount of coke formed in the samples during 400 min on stream ranged from 6 to 23 wt %, increasing linearly with the amount of propylene produced.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI zeolites have a high degree of iron clustering in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and even iron oxide nanoparticles, while the degree of clustering in FeGeMFI and FeMFI is much less extended and a main fraction of iron is stabilized in isolated extraframework positions.</p>
<p>No correlation was found between the density and strength of the acidic centers and the deactivation rate.</p>
<p>FeGeMFI is considerably less active than FeMFI even if the forms of iron as well as other (textural and acidic) properties are very similar in both materials.</p>
