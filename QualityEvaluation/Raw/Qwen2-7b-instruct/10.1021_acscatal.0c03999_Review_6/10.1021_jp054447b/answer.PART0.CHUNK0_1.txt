[1] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites."
[2] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI require milder steaming conditions for achieving the same degree of iron extraction and clustering as compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI."
[3] "FeGeMFI and FeMFI displayed significantly lower initial C3H8 and N2O conversions and C3H6 yield."
[4] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI present a high degree of iron clustering in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and even iron oxide nanoparticles."
[5] "The more acidic FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes did not lead to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by coking as compared to the more neutral FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes."
[6] "Propylene is the main coke precursor, and a linear relation between the amount of propylene produced by the catalysts and the coke content was obtained."

1. FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI zeolites show higher propylene yields and slower deactivation due to coking compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites. 
2. FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI require gentler steaming conditions to achieve the same level of iron extraction and clustering compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI.
3. FeGeMFI and FeMFI had notably lower initial conversions of C3H8 and N2O and propylene yield.
4. FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI feature a high concentration of iron clusters in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and nanoparticles.
5. More acidic FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI matrixes do not accelerate catalyst deactivation by coking compared to less acidic ones.
6. Propylene is the main precursor for coke formation, and a linear correlation exists between propylene production and coke content in the catalysts.
