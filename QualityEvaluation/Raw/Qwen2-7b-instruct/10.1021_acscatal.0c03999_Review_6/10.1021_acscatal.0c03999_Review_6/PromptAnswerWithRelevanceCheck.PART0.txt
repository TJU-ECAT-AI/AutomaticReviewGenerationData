[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 when loaded onto an active carbon support (AC) leads to superior catalytic activity compared to other supports like γ-Al2O3. This enhanced reducibility is attributed to the reduced interaction between Fe oxide and the support, which facilitates the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The reaction mechanism likely involves the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 through lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. This elucidates how the choice of support material and the reducibility of the catalyst can be optimized to enhance the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中对催化剂性能产生了显著影响。具体而言，当Fe2O3负载到活性碳（AC）上时，其可显著提高还原性，导致与其它支持材料相比，表现出更优的催化活性。这种增强的还原性归因于Fe氧化物与支持材料之间的相互作用减弱，从而促进了Fe氧化物的红ox循环。反应机制可能涉及通过Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧氧化C3H8至C3H6，随后通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原的Fe氧化物。这揭示了如何通过选择支持材料和优化催化剂的还原性来增强Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。

Answer: The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Catalysts with improved reducibility, like Fe2O3/AC, exhibit better performance due to their ability to efficiently convert C3H8 into C3H6. The formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 when Fe2O3 is loaded onto γ-Al2O3 leads to a reduction in the catalyst's reducibility, which affects its catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial for the CO2-ODHP process, playing a key role in the reaction mechanism. This highlights the importance of optimizing the reducibility and support materials to enhance catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

1. 铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中具有潜在的应用价值，因为它们已知可以催化烃类物质的氧化脱氢反应，如乙苯和异丁烷。
2. 其中，Fe2O3/AC在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现出色，与裸露的Fe2O3相比，其C3H6选择性相当（表7）。
3. 将Fe2O3负载到γ-Al2O3上会形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3，Fe3+离子被强烈稳定在MgO矩阵中，这降低了Fe2O3的还原性。
4. 显然，Fe2O3在AC上的改善还原性是测试的催化剂中获得高催化性能的关键因素，铁氧化物的还原循环对CO2-ODHP过程至关重要。
5. 这些观察结果表明，反应通过以下途径进行：（i）C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上氧化为C3H6，（ii）还原Fe氧化物由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化。这些结果强调了优化还原性和支持材料以增强CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的重要性。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3/AC catalysts, with improved reducibility, outperform other Fe2O3-based catalysts in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield. The reduction process of Fe2O3 follows a specific sequence (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe). Loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 results in the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3, which is hardly reduced, and the Fe3+ cations are stabilized in the MgO matrix. These insights suggest that enhancing reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials are critical for optimizing catalytic systems in CO2-ODHP processes.

3.4.1.1. Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane. (150153) Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived MgFe oxides. (154) Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP. Noteworthily, the absence of H2 from the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.

The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts is influenced by their interaction with support materials. The catalysts with improved reducibility, like Fe2O3/AC, exhibit better performance in CO2-ODHP reactions compared to those with reduced reducibility, such as Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived MgFe oxides. This is attributed to the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which plays a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP process. The absence of H2 in the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. The improved performance of Fe2O3/AC catalysts is due to its enhanced reducibility, which is essential for the activation of the catalyst surface and the subsequent reaction steps.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性受到支持材料相互作用的影响。具有改善可还原性的催化剂，如Fe2O3/AC，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中表现出更好的性能，与那些具有降低可还原性的催化剂（如Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3和镁铁氧化物）形成对比。这归因于铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中起着关键作用。反应气体中没有H2排除了快速加氢反应的可能性。提出的反应机制包括C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化生成C3H6，随后是还原了的Fe氧化物通过二氧化碳软氧化剂的再氧化。Fe2O3/AC催化剂的性能提升是由于其增强的可还原性，这对于激活催化剂表面并进行后续反应步骤至关重要。
