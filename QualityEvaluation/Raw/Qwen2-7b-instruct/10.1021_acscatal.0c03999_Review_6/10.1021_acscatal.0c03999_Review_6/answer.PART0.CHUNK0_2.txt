3.4.1.1. Fe2O3 Catalysts
"Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
"Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived MgFe oxides."
"Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
"H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
"For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3/AC catalysts, with improved reducibility, outperform other Fe2O3-based catalysts in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield. The reduction process of Fe2O3 follows a specific sequence (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe). Loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 results in the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3, which is hardly reduced, and the Fe3+ cations are stabilized in the MgO matrix. These insights suggest that enhancing reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials are critical for optimizing catalytic systems in CO2-ODHP processes.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受还原性和支持材料的影响显著。Fe2O3/AC催化剂表现出改进的可还原性，在C3H8转化和C3H6产率方面均优于其他Fe2O3基催化剂。Fe2O3的还原过程遵循特定的顺序（Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe）。将Fe2O3负载到γ-Al2O3上会导致形成难还原的FeAl2O3相，Fe3+离子在MgO矩阵中被强烈稳定。这些见解表明，增强可还原性和选择合适的支撑材料对于优化CO2-ODHP过程中的催化系统至关重要。
