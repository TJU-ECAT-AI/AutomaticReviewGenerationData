[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[4] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 when loaded onto an active carbon support (AC) leads to superior catalytic activity compared to other supports like γ-Al2O3. This enhanced reducibility is attributed to the reduced interaction between Fe oxide and the support, which facilitates the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The reaction mechanism likely involves the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 through lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. This elucidates how the choice of support material and the reducibility of the catalyst can be optimized to enhance the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中对催化剂性能产生了显著影响。具体而言，当Fe2O3负载到活性碳（AC）上时，其可显著提高还原性，导致与其它支持材料相比，表现出更优的催化活性。这种增强的还原性归因于Fe氧化物与支持材料之间的相互作用减弱，从而促进了Fe氧化物的红ox循环。反应机制可能涉及通过Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧氧化C3H8至C3H6，随后通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原的Fe氧化物。这揭示了如何通过选择支持材料和优化催化剂的还原性来增强Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。
