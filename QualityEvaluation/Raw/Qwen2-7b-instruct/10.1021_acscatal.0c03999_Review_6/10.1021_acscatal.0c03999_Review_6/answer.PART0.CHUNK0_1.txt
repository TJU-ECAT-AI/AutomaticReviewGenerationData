[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[4] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Answer: The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Catalysts with improved reducibility, like Fe2O3/AC, exhibit better performance due to their ability to efficiently convert C3H8 into C3H6. The formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 when Fe2O3 is loaded onto γ-Al2O3 leads to a reduction in the catalyst's reducibility, which affects its catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial for the CO2-ODHP process, playing a key role in the reaction mechanism. This highlights the importance of optimizing the reducibility and support materials to enhance catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

1. 铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中具有潜在的应用价值，因为它们已知可以催化烃类物质的氧化脱氢反应，如乙苯和异丁烷。
2. 其中，Fe2O3/AC在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现出色，与裸露的Fe2O3相比，其C3H6选择性相当（表7）。
3. 将Fe2O3负载到γ-Al2O3上会形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3，Fe3+离子被强烈稳定在MgO矩阵中，这降低了Fe2O3的还原性。
4. 显然，Fe2O3在AC上的改善还原性是测试的催化剂中获得高催化性能的关键因素，铁氧化物的还原循环对CO2-ODHP过程至关重要。
5. 这些观察结果表明，反应通过以下途径进行：（i）C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上氧化为C3H6，（ii）还原Fe氧化物由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化。这些结果强调了优化还原性和支持材料以增强CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的重要性。
