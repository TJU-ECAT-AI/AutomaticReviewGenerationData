[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3."
[3] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[4] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, Fe2O3/AC outperforms other Fe oxide-based catalysts in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3. This is attributed to the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, which accounts for the high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested. The strong interaction between Fe oxide and support materials, such as γ-Al2O3, retards the reducibility of the catalyst, leading to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced. The reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant is postulated to play a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP process.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。特别是，Fe2O3/AC在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现出色，同时保持与裸Fe2O3相当的C3H6选择性。这是由于Fe2O3在AC上的改善还原性，这解释了在测试的催化剂中获得的高催化性能。Fe氧化物与支撑材料（如γ-Al2O3）之间的强烈相互作用减缓了催化剂的还原性，导致形成难以还原的FeAl2O3相。通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原Fe氧化物被认为是CO2-ODHP过程中的关键作用。
