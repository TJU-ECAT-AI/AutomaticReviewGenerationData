[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorstein-son et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]."
[2] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[3] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions [38,39]."
[4] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."

1. The early work on ethane oxydehydrogenation involved a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst, and this research led to numerous publications and patents from Union Carbide Corp. and other institutions.
2. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to produce surface ethoxide, which then undergoes a beta-elimination process to generate ethylene.
3. Later studies revealed that catalysts can be tailored to produce either ethylene or acetic acid by altering the catalyst's composition and optimizing reaction conditions.
4. These catalysts exhibit a selectivity for ethylene around 70% when converting ethane to 70%.

1. 早期的研究使用了范德蒙钼铌氧化物催化剂，并由此产生了来自Union Carbide公司和其他实验室的大量论文和专利。
2. 乙烷与催化剂中的钼或钒反应生成表面乙氧基，然后通过β消除过程形成乙烯。
3. 后来的研究发现，可以通过改变催化剂的组成和调整反应条件来使催化剂选择性地产生乙醇或乙酸。
4. 这些催化剂在将乙烷转化为70%时，对乙烷的选择性约为70%。
