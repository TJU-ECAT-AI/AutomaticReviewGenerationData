[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorstein-son et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]. Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
[2] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions [38,39]. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
[3] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
[4] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water. At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%. Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."

To understand how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, we can examine the role of catalyst modifications and reaction conditions. Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories have developed catalysts that can selectively produce ethylene or acetic acid by altering the elemental composition and adjusting the reaction parameters. These catalysts can achieve ethylene selectivity around 70% at a 70% ethane conversion. Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, when appropriately modified, offer a 78% ethylene selectivity at a 20% ethane conversion. Iron-containing solid solution catalysts, when stabilized with a metal oxide and supplemented with hydrogen chloride and water, can achieve 90% ethane conversion at 550°C. The products from these catalysts include ethylene (selectivity 80-93%) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity).

为了理解铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，我们可以研究催化剂的修改和反应条件的作用。Union Carbide公司和其他实验室已经开发出可以将催化剂调整为仅生产乙烯或乙酸的催化剂，通过改变元素组成并调整反应参数。这些催化剂在70%的乙烷转化率下可以实现约70%的乙烯选择性。磷酸盐/钼/锑氧化物催化剂，在适当修改后，可以在20%乙烷转化率时实现78%的乙烯选择性。含铁固体溶液催化剂，在镧氧化物稳定并补充氢氯酸和水的情况下，可以在550°C时实现90%的乙烷转化率。这些催化剂的产物包括乙烯（选择性80%-93%）和乙烯基氯（14%选择性）。
