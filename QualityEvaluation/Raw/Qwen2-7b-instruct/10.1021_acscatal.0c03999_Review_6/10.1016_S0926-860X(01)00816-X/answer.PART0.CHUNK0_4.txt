[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorstein-son et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]."
[2] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethy- lene."
[3] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the cat- alyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions [38,39]."
[4] "Phosphorous/ molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modi- fied with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
[5] "Iron- containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydro- gen chloride and water in addition to ethane and wa- ter."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their reducibility and support materials. Reducibility affects how well the catalyst can reduce CO2 to CO, while the support material influences the dispersion of the active sites and the overall stability of the catalyst. Insights from these effects can guide the optimization of catalytic systems by selecting appropriate reducibility and support materials that maximize selectivity towards ethylene while minimizing unwanted reactions like the formation of acetic acid or other undesired products. For instance, catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid through modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Using a combination of phosphorous, molybdenum, and antimony oxides, along with other elements, can give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane. Additionally, iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water. These insights suggest that careful selection and tuning of catalyst components and reaction conditions are crucial for achieving high selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。可还原性影响催化剂减少二氧化碳为一氧化碳的能力，而支撑材料影响活性位点的分散和催化剂的整体稳定性。这些影响提供了指导催化系统优化的见解，通过选择合适的可还原性和支撑材料来最大化乙烯的选择性，同时最小化形成乙酸或其他不期望产物等反应。例如，可以通过修改催化剂成分和调整反应条件来使催化剂选择性地生成乙烯或乙酸。使用磷酸、钼、锑氧化物以及其它元素的组合，可以得到大约在70%的乙烷转化率时约70%的选择性到乙烯。此外，含铁的固体溶液催化剂通过金属氧化物稳定化，在乙烷、水、氯化氢和水的流体中最佳使用。这些见解表明，仔细选择催化剂成分和反应条件对于实现二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的高选择性至关重要。
