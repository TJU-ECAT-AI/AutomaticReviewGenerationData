[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes."
[2] "Other companies soon followed these pioneering efforts. For example, Phillips Petroleum built a multi-tubular dehydrogenation reactor near Borger, TX, in 1943."
[3] "This process, which came on stream toward the end of World War II, was also used for the production of butenes."
[4] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S u d-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."
[5] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."
[6] "The Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[7] "This process avoids the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries."
[8] "Typical cycle time is reported to be at least 8 h, with 7 h of process time and 1 h of regeneration time."
[9] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable."
[10] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[11] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[12] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[13] "The Oleflex process is known for its ability to produce light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[14] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[15] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[16] "The choice of reactor design plays a very important role in the success of catalytic processes."
[17] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[18] "The catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[19] "The heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[20] "The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1."

The historical developments of catalytic dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation for olefin production include their initial commercialization during World War II. Companies like Union Carbide & UOP LLC, Phillips Petroleum, and Houdry played pivotal roles in advancing the technology. The Oleflex process, which uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR), enables efficient production of light olefins like propylene and isobutylene at high selectivities and superatmospheric pressures. Catalysts and supports play crucial roles in controlling reaction pathways, enhancing selectivity, and enabling high productivity. Reactor design choices are critical for the success of these processes. The heat of reaction for dehydrogenation is moderate, allowing the catalyst to maintain longevity even at high space velocities. Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include safety, process upsets, and achieving high selectivity to olefins while minimizing dangerous mixtures. Catalysts must be optimized to suppress undesired reactions, and reactor design must balance heat transfer and pressure drop to achieve optimal performance. Carbon dioxide as an oxidant presents opportunities for reducing the negative impact of dangerous oxidant-paraffin mixtures, but challenges include catalyst selectivity and process economics.
