[4] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S u d-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."
[5] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."

[12] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[13] "The Oleflex process is known for its ability to produce light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."

The historical developments of catalytic dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation for olefin production include their initial commercialization during World War II. Companies like Union Carbide & UOP LLC, Phillips Petroleum, and Houdry played pivotal roles in advancing the technology. The Oleflex process, which uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR), enables efficient production of light olefins like propylene and isobutylene at high selectivities and superatmospheric pressures. Catalysts and supports play crucial roles in controlling reaction pathways, enhancing selectivity, and enabling high productivity. Reactor design choices are critical for the success of these processes. The heat of reaction for dehydrogenation is moderate, allowing the catalyst to maintain longevity even at high space velocities. Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include safety, process upsets, and achieving high selectivity to olefins while minimizing dangerous mixtures. Catalysts must be optimized to suppress undesired reactions, and reactor design must balance heat transfer and pressure drop to achieve optimal performance. Carbon dioxide as an oxidant presents opportunities for reducing the negative impact of dangerous oxidant-paraffin mixtures, but challenges include catalyst selectivity and process economics.

To understand how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, we can examine the role of catalyst modifications and reaction conditions. Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories have developed catalysts that can selectively produce ethylene or acetic acid by altering the elemental composition and adjusting the reaction parameters. These catalysts can achieve ethylene selectivity around 70% at a 70% ethane conversion. Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, when appropriately modified, offer a 78% ethylene selectivity at a 20% ethane conversion. Iron-containing solid solution catalysts, when stabilized with a metal oxide and supplemented with hydrogen chloride and water, can achieve 90% ethane conversion at 550°C. The products from these catalysts include ethylene (selectivity 80-93%) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity).

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their reducibility and support materials. Reducibility affects how well the catalyst can reduce CO2 to CO, while the support material influences the dispersion of the active sites and the overall stability of the catalyst. Insights from these effects can guide the optimization of catalytic systems by selecting appropriate reducibility and support materials that maximize selectivity towards ethylene while minimizing unwanted reactions like the formation of acetic acid or other undesired products. For instance, catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid through modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Using a combination of phosphorous, molybdenum, and antimony oxides, along with other elements, can give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane. Additionally, iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water. These insights suggest that careful selection and tuning of catalyst components and reaction conditions are crucial for achieving high selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。可还原性影响催化剂减少二氧化碳为一氧化碳的能力，而支撑材料影响活性位点的分散和催化剂的整体稳定性。这些影响提供了指导催化系统优化的见解，通过选择合适的可还原性和支撑材料来最大化乙烯的选择性，同时最小化形成乙酸或其他不期望产物等反应。例如，可以通过修改催化剂成分和调整反应条件来使催化剂选择性地生成乙烯或乙酸。使用磷酸、钼、锑氧化物以及其它元素的组合，可以得到大约在70%的乙烷转化率时约70%的选择性到乙烯。此外，含铁的固体溶液催化剂通过金属氧化物稳定化，在乙烷、水、氯化氢和水的流体中最佳使用。这些见解表明，仔细选择催化剂成分和反应条件对于实现二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的高选择性至关重要。
