[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorstein-son et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]."
[2] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[3] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
[4] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."

1. Early work on ethane oxydehydrogenation was done by Thorsteinson et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst, and Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories have issued papers and patents based on this work.
2. Ethane is believed to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene.
3. The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, leading to the formation of acetic acid upon hydrolysis. At pressures greater than one atmosphere, acetic acid is co-produced with ethylene.
4. These catalysts exhibit a selectivity to ethylene of around 70% at a conversion of ethane around 70%.

1. 早期关于乙烷氧化脱氢的工作由Thorsteinson等人完成，使用的是钒钼铌氧化物催化剂，Union Carbide公司和其他实验室基于这项工作发表了多篇论文和专利。
2. 乙烷被认为与催化剂中的钼或钒反应形成表面乙氧基，然后通过β消除过程转化为乙烯。
3. 表面乙氧基可以进一步被氧化成表面乙酸酯，导致在大于一个大气压下水解形成乙酸。在大于一个大气压下，乙酸与乙烯共生产。
4. 这些催化剂在乙烷转化率约为70%时表现出约70%的乙烯选择性。
