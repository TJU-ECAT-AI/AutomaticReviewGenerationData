The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the presence of n-type semiconducting oxides like ZnO, when supporting Au nanoparticles, leads to an electronic interaction between Au and ZnO. This interaction activates CO2, significantly enhancing the catalytic activity of the Au/ZnO system. The high activity of Au/ZnO in the dehydrogenation of propane and its improved performance upon CO2 addition provides insights into the optimized catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions. The electronic interaction between Au and ZnO facilitates the activation of CO2, making it more reactive and thus accelerating the reaction kinetics, which is essential for efficient CO2 utilization in these processes.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中对其性能产生重要影响。具体来说，当使用n型半导体氧化物（如ZnO）支持Au纳米颗粒时，Au与ZnO之间会发生电子相互作用。这种相互作用激活了CO2，显著提高了Au/ZnO系统的催化活性。Au/ZnO在丙烷脱氢和丙烷与CO2反应中的高活性以及CO2添加后的进一步增加表明，这些因素对于优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化剂系统至关重要。Au与ZnO之间的电子相互作用促进了CO2的活化，使其更具有反应性，从而加速了反应动力学，这对于有效利用CO2在这些过程中是必不可少的。
