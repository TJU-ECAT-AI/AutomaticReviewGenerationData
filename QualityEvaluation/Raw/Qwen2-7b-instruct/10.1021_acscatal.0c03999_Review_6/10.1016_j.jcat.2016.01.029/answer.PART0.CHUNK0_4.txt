The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The electronic interaction between Au nanoparticles and the n-type semiconducting oxide ZnO is the key factor that enhances the catalytic activity of Au/ZnO in the dehydrogenation of propane. This mechanism explains why Au/ZnO is much more active than Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 in this process. Moreover, the presence of CO2 greatly accelerates the reaction of propane on Au/ZnO, whereas its effect is minimal on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. The high activity of Au/ZnO in the CO2-ODHP reaction is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au and ZnO, which activates CO2, facilitating the formation of reactive species that drive the reaction forward.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。Au与n型半导体氧化锌之间的电子相互作用是Au/ZnO在丙烷脱氢反应中活性增高的关键因素。这一机制解释了为什么Au/ZnO相对于Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3在这过程中更为活跃。此外，CO2极大地加速了丙烷在Au/ZnO上的反应，而在Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3上其效果微乎其微。Au/ZnO在CO2-ODHP反应中的高活性归因于Au和ZnO之间的电子相互作用，该相互作用激活了CO2，促进了驱动反应向前进行的活性物种的形成。
