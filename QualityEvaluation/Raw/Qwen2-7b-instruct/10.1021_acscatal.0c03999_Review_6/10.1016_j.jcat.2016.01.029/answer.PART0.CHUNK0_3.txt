[1] "The decomposition of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 have been investigated on Au deposited on ZnO, MgO and Al2O3."
[2] "Au nanoparticles supported by n-type semiconducting oxides are very effective catalysts in the reaction of C2H6 with CO2."
[3] "Au/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further increased the conversion."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2."

(i) Propane interacts with Au/ZnO even below 300 K yielding adsorbed propylene and propylidene.
(ii) Dehydrogenation of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 are limited on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3.
(iii) In contrast, Au/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further increased the conversion.
(iv) The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2.

(i) 烷丙与Au/ZnO在低于300K下发生反应，产生吸附的丙烯和丙基二烯。
(ii) 丙烷脱氢和与CO2的反应在Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3上受限。
(iii) 相比之下，Au/ZnO在丙烷脱氢方面表现出更高的活性。向丙烷中添加CO2进一步提高了转化率。
(iv) Au/ZnO的催化性能通过Au和n型ZnO之间发生的电子相互作用得到解释，这导致了CO2的激活。
