[1] "In the study of the reactions of CxHy fragments over metal single crystals in UHV it was found that a fraction of CxHy species is dimerized beside their decomposition."
[2] "The amount of carbon-containing deposit formed in the CO2 + C3H8 reaction on Au/ZnO catalyst and its reactivity have been determined by TPR measurements."
[3] "In the explanation of much greater activity of Au/ZnO compared to Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO we should take into account that ZnO is an n-type semiconductor, while Al2O3 and MgO are insulating oxides."

(iii) The enhanced catalytic performance of Au/ZnO catalysts in the CO2 + C3H8 reaction is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au and the n-type ZnO support. This interaction activates CO2, enhancing its reactivity towards propane, leading to a higher conversion and product selectivity compared to catalysts with insulating oxide supports like Al2O3 and MgO.

(iii) Au/ZnO催化剂在CO2 + C3H8反应中表现出增强的催化性能，归因于Au与n型ZnO支持材料之间的电子相互作用。这种相互作用激活了CO2，增强了其对丙烷的活性，导致与绝缘氧化物支持（如Al2O3和MgO）相比，更高的转化率和产物选择性。
