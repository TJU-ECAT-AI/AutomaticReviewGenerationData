3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
The main size of the Au particles in the Au/ZnO is small, 23 nm, and uniform. This value for Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 falls in the range of 210 nm. BET surface area of the catalysts used is as follows: 50 m2/g for Au/ZnO, 170 m2/g for Au/MgO, and 100 m2/g for Au/Al2O3.

3.3. TPD measurements
The interaction of propane with Au/ZnO catalysts and ZnO support was also examined by means of TPD measurements. The sample was kept in the propane flow for 15 min at 300 K, and then it was washed with pure Ar until it contained propane (15–20 min). TPD spectra are displayed in Fig. 1C and D. No weakly adsorbed C3H8 was detected, it desorbed very likely when washing the catalysts with Ar before TPD measurements. From pure ZnO the desorption of larger amount of CH4 with Tp = 773 K, and the release of smaller amounts of C2H4 and C2H6 also above 700 K were registered. In the case of Au/ZnO catalyst almost twice as much CH4 desorbed also with Tp = 773 K.

3.4. Dehydrogenation of C3H8
Conversion of propane on various Au samples as a function of reaction temperature is given in Fig. 2A. Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO exhibited a very slight catalytic effect even at 873 K. A much higher activity was found on Au/ZnO. The reaction started above 725–750 K and the conversion of propane reached 17% at 873 K. The catalyst exhibited a remarkable stability.

3.5. Reaction of CO2 + C3H8
Adding CO2 to propane caused only a slight increase in the extent of the reaction of C3H8 on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. CO2 enhanced only moderately the extent of the reaction of propane on pure ZnO used for the preparation of Au/ZnO: the conversion of C3H8 reached only 13% at 873 K. A dramatic increase occurred, however, on Au/ZnO catalyst. The reaction started even at 650 K. The conversion of C3H8 approached 50% at 873 K (Fig. 2B).

4. Discussion
4.1. IR spectroscopic studies
The interaction of propane with supported Rh [8], Re [9] and Mo2C [10] catalysts has been investigated before by means of FTIR spectroscopy. Adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO at 200–215 K caused the appearance of intense absorption bands at 2981, 2967, 2960, 2901, 2875 cm−1 in the CH stretching region and 1472, 1457, 1387, 1375 cm−1 in the low frequency range. The spectrum shows a good agreement with those obtained on other catalysts at low temperature [20–25]. These absorption bands are characteristic for molecularly adsorbed propane, and their assignments are presented in Table 2.

4.2. Catalytic studies
The dehydrogenation of propane is strongly endothermic and also equilibrium limited. Higher conversion will require either higher temperature or lower pressures. In the case where the feed gas is only propane, the equilibrium propane conversion is given by the formula Kp = Px2/(1 − x2) with Kp the equilibrium constant, x the equilibrium conversion, and P the total pressure.

The situation is different when CO2 was added to C3H8. While CO2 only slightly increased the conversion of C3H8 on pure ZnO (see Fig. 2), it exerted a drastic enhancement in the conversion of C3H8 on Au/ZnO. The amounts of all products found in the dehydorgenation of C3H6 considerably increased. The fact that a large amount of CO formed clearly indicates the involvement of the CO2 in the reaction of propane.

In the explanation of much greater activity of Au/ZnO compared to Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO we should take into account that ZnO is an n-type semiconductor, while Al2O3 and MgO are insulating oxides. Based on the work function of ZnO (3.95–4.25 eV) and Au (5.3 eV), we expect an electronic interaction between Au and ZnO, e.g., an electron transfer from ZnO to Au particles at the Au/ZnO interface [27].

In light of this consideration we describe the CO2 + C3H8 reactions with following elementary steps. We assume that the partially negatively charged CO2 enters reaction with the stable hydrocarbons, C3H8 and C3H6, producing more reactive CxHy fragments C3H8 + COd2 → C3H7a + CO + OHd, C3H7a + C3H6a + Ha → C3H6a + COd2 + OHd, C3H6a + COd2 → C3H5a + CO + OHd, C3H5a → CH4g + 2Cs + Ha, 2OHd → H2O + O2, 2Ha → H2g. Accordingly, CH4 can be formed in the decomposition of C3H7 radical (Eq. (11)).

We may compare the catalytic performance of supported Au in the CO2 + C3H8 reaction with other catalysts examined under exactly the same experimental conditions. A general feature is that CO2 markedly accelerated the reaction of C3H8 on all catalysts.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance in CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Paraffins) reactions. The electronic interaction between the Fe oxide and the support material influences the activation of CO2, enhancing its reactivity towards the hydrocarbon substrates. This insight provides guidance for optimizing catalytic systems by selecting appropriate support materials that facilitate electron transfer and enhance CO2 activation.

Fe oxide-based catalysts exhibit different activities and selectivities in CO2-ODHP reactions depending on the reducibility and support materials. For instance, in the context of this study, Au/ZnO showed significantly higher activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation and CO2 reactions compared to Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. This is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO, which activates CO2 and enhances its reactivity towards propane.

Optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions involves considering the properties of the support materials and their ability to facilitate electron transfer between the metal catalyst and the support. In this study, ZnO as an n-type semiconductor support was found to be highly effective in activating CO2 for reactions with propane. This suggests that choosing support materials with suitable electronic properties, such as semiconductors with an n-type band structure, can significantly improve the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

In summary, the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions through their influence on CO2 activation. Selecting support materials that facilitate electron transfer and enhance CO2 reactivity can optimize catalytic systems for more efficient and selective CO2 utilization in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.
