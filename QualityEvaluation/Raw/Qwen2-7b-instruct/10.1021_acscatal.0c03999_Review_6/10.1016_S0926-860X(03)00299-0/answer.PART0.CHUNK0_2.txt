[1] "The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane."
[2] "It was proposed that the highly dispersed Ga-species following H2O2 treatments are GaO+ species in ion-exchange position."
[3] "The interaction of Ga species,e.g. GaO+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position,interacting with the zeolite framework are expected to reduce the OAl bond strength [20] and this proposal is in line with the XPS results reported above."
[4] "The effect of a H2O2 redox cycle on calcined Ga/(0.5) was further investigated by TG/DSC. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Reduction again occurs in two steps (a shoulder at ca. 675 K and a peak at 840 K; both peaks are shifted by ca. 60 K to lower temperature due to the different operating conditions) confirming the H2-TPR results."
[5] "The higher selectivities to ethylene, C5+, and aromatic compounds after H2 treatment should be attributed to the lower acidity (Brnsted and Lewis) and higher dehydrogenation efficiency of the catalyst due the higher dispersion of gallium as GaI species."

1. The study aims to explore how treatments affect gallium's state and dispersion in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and its influence on propane aromatization performance.
2. The highly dispersed gallium species after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatments are suggested to be GaO+ species in ion-exchange position.
3. The interaction between gallium species and the zeolite framework is expected to weaken the O-Al bond, aligning with the XPS findings.
4. The hydrogen peroxide redox cycle on the calcined Ga/(0.5) catalyst was studied using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC). The results showed two reduction steps, confirming the hydrogen treatment results.
5. The enhanced selectivity towards ethylene, C5+, and aromatic compounds after hydrogen treatment is attributed to the reduced acidity and improved dehydrogenation efficiency of the catalyst due to the dispersed gallium as GaI species.

1. 研究旨在探讨此类处理对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中镓的状态和分散性的影响，以及它们对丙烷芳构化性能的影响。
2. 高分散的镓物种在氢过氧化物（H2O2）处理后被认为是离子交换位置的GaO+物种。
3. 镓物种与沸石框架的相互作用预期会削弱O-Al键，这与XPS结果一致。
4. 对于煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)催化剂，通过热重分析结合差示扫描量热法（TG/DSC）进一步研究了氢过氧化物还原循环。结果显示两个还原步骤，确认了氢处理的结果。
5. 在氢处理后，乙烯、C5+和芳香化合物选择性的提高归因于由于分散的镓作为GaI物种导致的降低酸性和增强的脱氢效率。
