[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 following Ga ion-exchange and drying at 293 K contains mostly GaO(OH) small particles (diameter = 45 nm) located on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites, a few Ga cationic species in ion-exchange position and some large crystallites of gallium oxide."
[2] "Upon calcination, GaO(OH) small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles of comparable size also located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites."
[3] "Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species."
[4] "Evidence for the interaction of the latter species with the zeolite framework, and their probable synergistic action, was obtained from FT-IR, XPS and 27Al MAS-NMR studies as well as HRTEMEDX results showing a correlation between the distribution of Ga and Al in the zeolite, following various treatments."
[5] "From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance."
[6] "Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity."

The state and dispersion of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were significantly influenced by various treatments including calcination, reductionoxidation cycles, and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Ga species were initially present as GaO(OH) particles on the surface of the zeolite crystals, with some Ga in ion-exchange positions and larger Ga2O3 crystallites. Upon calcination, these small GaO(OH) particles transformed into comparable-sized Ga2O3 particles still located on the surface. Reducingoxidation cycles facilitated the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, stabilizing them as Ga+, GaO+, and possibly Ga(OH)2+ species in ion-exchange positions. The interactions of these species with the zeolite framework and their synergistic action were confirmed through FT-IR, XPS, 27Al MAS-NMR, and HRTEMEDX studies. High performance in catalytic reactions was attributed to the presence of highly dispersed gallium species within the zeolite framework, acting in tandem with the zeolite's acidic sites. Maintaining gallium in a reduced state was found to enhance the selectivity towards aromatic compounds.

在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，镓物种的状态和分散性在包括煅烧、还原氧化循环和过氧化氢处理在内的各种处理后显著受到影响。初始状态，镓物种主要以直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒形式存在于沸石晶体表面，还有一些处于离子交换位置的镓以及较大的Ga2O3结晶体。在煅烧后，这些小的GaO(OH)颗粒转变为大小相似的Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体表面。还原氧化循环促进了镓元素向沸石通道内的迁移，并在离子交换位置稳定了以Ga+、GaO+和不太可能的Ga(OH)2+形式存在的高度分散的镓物种。通过傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、27Al MAS核磁共振（MAS-NMR）和高分辨率透射电子显微镜能量色散X射线光谱（HRTEMEDX）研究证实了这些物种与沸石框架之间的相互作用及其可能的协同作用。从催化观点来看，沸石框架内高度分散的镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用是实现高性能的关键。保持镓在还原态可以增强芳烃的选择性。

Applied Catalysis A: General 251 (2003) 107120 Effect of H2O2 pre-treatments on the state of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 propane aromatisation catalysts Izabela Nowak1, Juliette Quartararo, Eric G. Derouane, Jacques C. Vdrine Leverhulme Centre for Innovative Catalysis, Department of Chemistry, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZD, UK Received 14 February 2003; received in revised form 9 April 2003; accepted 9 April 2003 Abstract The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely. Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Upon calcination at 823 K, small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) transform into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Large needles of Ga2O3 disappear almost completely after calcination. Reducing-oxidising cycles at 823 K allow the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. These enhanced the bifunctional catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for propane aromatisation and maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.

1. 在823 K的煅烧下，直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒转化为直径同样为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体的外表面。大型Ga2O3针状物几乎完全消失。在823 K的还原氧化周期中，允许镓物种迁移到沸石中，最有可能作为离子交换的镓物种。这些增强了改性沸石的双功能催化性能，用于丙烷芳构化，并且维持镓在GaI氧化态可能增强芳香产量。

[1] "The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane."
[2] "It was proposed that the highly dispersed Ga-species following H2O2 treatments are GaO+ species in ion-exchange position."
[3] "The interaction of Ga species,e.g. GaO+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position,interacting with the zeolite framework are expected to reduce the OAl bond strength [20] and this proposal is in line with the XPS results reported above."
[4] "The effect of a H2O2 redox cycle on calcined Ga/(0.5) was further investigated by TG/DSC. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Reduction again occurs in two steps (a shoulder at ca. 675 K and a peak at 840 K; both peaks are shifted by ca. 60 K to lower temperature due to the different operating conditions) confirming the H2-TPR results."
[5] "The higher selectivities to ethylene, C5+, and aromatic compounds after H2 treatment should be attributed to the lower acidity (Brnsted and Lewis) and higher dehydrogenation efficiency of the catalyst due the higher dispersion of gallium as GaI species."

1. The study aims to explore how treatments affect gallium's state and dispersion in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and its influence on propane aromatization performance.
2. The highly dispersed gallium species after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatments are suggested to be GaO+ species in ion-exchange position.
3. The interaction between gallium species and the zeolite framework is expected to weaken the O-Al bond, aligning with the XPS findings.
4. The hydrogen peroxide redox cycle on the calcined Ga/(0.5) catalyst was studied using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC). The results showed two reduction steps, confirming the hydrogen treatment results.
5. The enhanced selectivity towards ethylene, C5+, and aromatic compounds after hydrogen treatment is attributed to the reduced acidity and improved dehydrogenation efficiency of the catalyst due to the dispersed gallium as GaI species.

2. 高分散的镓物种在氢过氧化物（H2O2）处理后被认为是离子交换位置的GaO+物种。
3. 镓物种与沸石框架的相互作用预期会削弱O-Al键，这与XPS结果一致。
4. 对于煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)催化剂，通过热重分析结合差示扫描量热法（TG/DSC）进一步研究了氢过氧化物还原循环。结果显示两个还原步骤，确认了氢处理的结果。
5. 在氢处理后，乙烯、C5+和芳香化合物选择性的提高归因于由于分散的镓作为GaI物种导致的降低酸性和增强的脱氢效率。
