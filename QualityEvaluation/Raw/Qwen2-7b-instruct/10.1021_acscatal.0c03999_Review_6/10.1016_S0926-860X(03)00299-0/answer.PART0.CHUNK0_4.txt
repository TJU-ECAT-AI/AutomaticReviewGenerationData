The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.

在离子交换后，Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中镓物种的状态和局部环境已被多种技术识别。合成后，在沸石晶体表面存在直径为45纳米的小GaO(OH)颗粒，以及一些长0.5至1.5微米、宽0.1至0.2微米的大颗粒Ga2O3。在823 K下煅烧后，两者都转化为直径为45纳米的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体表面，而针状物几乎完全消失。
