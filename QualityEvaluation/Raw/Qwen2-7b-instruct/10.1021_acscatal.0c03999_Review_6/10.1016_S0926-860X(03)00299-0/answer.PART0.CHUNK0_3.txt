[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 following Ga ion-exchange and drying at 293 K contains mostly GaO(OH) small particles (diameter = 45 nm) located on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites, a few Ga cationic species in ion-exchange position and some large crystallites of gallium oxide."
[2] "Upon calcination, GaO(OH) small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles of comparable size also located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites."
[3] "Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species."
[4] "Evidence for the interaction of the latter species with the zeolite framework, and their probable synergistic action, was obtained from FT-IR, XPS and 27Al MAS-NMR studies as well as HRTEMEDX results showing a correlation between the distribution of Ga and Al in the zeolite, following various treatments."
[5] "From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity."

2. Upon calcination, GaO(OH) small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles of comparable size, also located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites.
3. Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K facilitate the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels, stabilizing highly dispersed cationic Ga species in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species.
4. Interactions between these species and the zeolite framework, along with their probable synergistic action, were confirmed through FT-IR, XPS, 27Al MAS-NMR studies, and HRTEMEDX results, showing a correlation between the distribution of Ga and Al in the zeolite following various treatments.

1. 在293 K下进行Ga离子交换和干燥后，H-ZSM-5沸石包含主要的直径为45nm的GaO(OH)小颗粒，位于沸石晶粒表面，少量的Ga正电荷物种处于离子交换位置，以及一些大的镓氧化物结晶体。
2. 焙烧后，GaO(OH)小颗粒转化为与外表面的沸石晶粒大小相当的Ga2O3颗粒。
3. 在823 K下的还原氧化周期促进了镓在沸石通道中的迁移，在沸石框架中稳定了高度分散的Ga+、GaO+和不太可能的Ga(OH)2+物种。
4. 通过FT-IR、XPS、27Al MAS-NMR研究和HRTEMEDX结果，证实了这些物种与沸石框架之间的相互作用及其可能的协同作用，显示了沸石中Ga和Al分布之间的相关性，根据不同的处理方式。
5. 镓在沸石框架中的高度分散物种，与沸石酸性位点协同作用，对于实现高性能至关重要。保持镓物种在还原状态可以提高芳香族选择性。
