Applied Catalysis A: General 251 (2003) 107120 Effect of H2O2 pre-treatments on the state of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 propane aromatisation catalysts Izabela Nowak1, Juliette Quartararo, Eric G. Derouane, Jacques C. Vdrine Leverhulme Centre for Innovative Catalysis, Department of Chemistry, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZD, UK Received 14 February 2003; received in revised form 9 April 2003; accepted 9 April 2003 Abstract The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely. Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Upon calcination at 823 K, small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) transform into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Large needles of Ga2O3 disappear almost completely after calcination. Reducing-oxidising cycles at 823 K allow the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. These enhanced the bifunctional catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for propane aromatisation and maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.

1. 在823 K的煅烧下，直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒转化为直径同样为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体的外表面。大型Ga2O3针状物几乎完全消失。在823 K的还原氧化周期中，允许镓物种迁移到沸石中，最有可能作为离子交换的镓物种。这些增强了改性沸石的双功能催化性能，用于丙烷芳构化，并且维持镓在GaI氧化态可能增强芳香产量。

2. The presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.

2. 沸石骨架中高度分散的镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用是实现高性能的关键。保持镓物种在还原状态可以提高芳烃选择性。
