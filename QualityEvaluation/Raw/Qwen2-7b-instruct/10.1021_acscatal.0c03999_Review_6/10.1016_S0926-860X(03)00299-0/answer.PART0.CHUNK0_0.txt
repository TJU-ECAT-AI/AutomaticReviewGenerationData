[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 following Ga ion-exchange and drying at 293 K contains mostly GaO(OH) small particles (diameter = 45 nm) located on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites, a few Ga cationic species in ion-exchange position and some large crystallites of gallium oxide."
[2] "Upon calcination, GaO(OH) small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles of comparable size also located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites."
[3] "Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species."
[4] "Evidence for the interaction of the latter species with the zeolite framework, and their probable synergistic action, was obtained from FT-IR, XPS and 27Al MAS-NMR studies as well as HRTEMEDX results showing a correlation between the distribution of Ga and Al in the zeolite, following various treatments."
[5] "From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance."
[6] "Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity."

The state and dispersion of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were significantly influenced by various treatments including calcination, reductionoxidation cycles, and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Ga species were initially present as GaO(OH) particles on the surface of the zeolite crystals, with some Ga in ion-exchange positions and larger Ga2O3 crystallites. Upon calcination, these small GaO(OH) particles transformed into comparable-sized Ga2O3 particles still located on the surface. Reducingoxidation cycles facilitated the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, stabilizing them as Ga+, GaO+, and possibly Ga(OH)2+ species in ion-exchange positions. The interactions of these species with the zeolite framework and their synergistic action were confirmed through FT-IR, XPS, 27Al MAS-NMR, and HRTEMEDX studies. High performance in catalytic reactions was attributed to the presence of highly dispersed gallium species within the zeolite framework, acting in tandem with the zeolite's acidic sites. Maintaining gallium in a reduced state was found to enhance the selectivity towards aromatic compounds.

在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，镓物种的状态和分散性在包括煅烧、还原氧化循环和过氧化氢处理在内的各种处理后显著受到影响。初始状态，镓物种主要以直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒形式存在于沸石晶体表面，还有一些处于离子交换位置的镓以及较大的Ga2O3结晶体。在煅烧后，这些小的GaO(OH)颗粒转变为大小相似的Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体表面。还原氧化循环促进了镓元素向沸石通道内的迁移，并在离子交换位置稳定了以Ga+、GaO+和不太可能的Ga(OH)2+形式存在的高度分散的镓物种。通过傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、27Al MAS核磁共振（MAS-NMR）和高分辨率透射电子显微镜能量色散X射线光谱（HRTEMEDX）研究证实了这些物种与沸石框架之间的相互作用及其可能的协同作用。从催化观点来看，沸石框架内高度分散的镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用是实现高性能的关键。保持镓在还原态可以增强芳烃的选择性。
