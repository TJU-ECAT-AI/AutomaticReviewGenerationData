The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. By examining how these factors influence the catalysts, researchers can gain insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and optimize catalytic systems for this process. Specifically, the amount of grafted Fe61 species on the catalyst surface is directly proportional to the surface area of the support material. Additionally, understanding the distribution and nature of Fe species (such as Fe31 and Fe61) within the catalyst can provide clues about the reaction pathways and help in refining the catalyst design for improved efficiency and selectivity.
