[1] "An approximate estimate of an industrial-like catalyst have not yet been reported."
[2] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by the means of a computer-controlled Philips goniometer, using Ni-filtered CuKa radiation."
[3] "The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3, as detected by XRD, was the following (expressed as wt% CrO3): 0% at 4.6 wt% total CrO3, traces at 7.4 wt% total CrO3, 2.9 ± 0.2 wt% at 10.7 wt% total CrO3, and 5.4 ± 0.4 wt% at 15.3 wt% total CrO3."
[4] "The amount of grafted Cr61 determined at 600°C was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The document does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, nor does it offer insights into the proposed reaction mechanism or optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The text focuses on the characterization of alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, detailing their chemical and physical properties, and their activity in the specific reaction. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions about Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions based on the provided information.

文档没有提供足够的信息来回答关于Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的问题，也没有提供关于该过程的假设反应机制或催化系统的优化的见解。文本主要关注于用于异丁烷脱氢的氧化铝支持铬氧化物催化剂的表征，详细描述了它们的化学和物理性质以及在特定反应中的活性。因此，基于提供的信息，不可能根据所提供的信息得出关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应的结论。
