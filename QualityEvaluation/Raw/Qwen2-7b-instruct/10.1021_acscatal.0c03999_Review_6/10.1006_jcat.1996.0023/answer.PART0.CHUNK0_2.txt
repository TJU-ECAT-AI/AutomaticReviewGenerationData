[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene."
[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, and also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications."
[3] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potassium as the dopant."
[4] "Characterization by chemical analysis and XRD."
[5] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 600°C: a Cr31 species; a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and before for a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."
[6] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[7] "Finally, for overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."
[8] "The amount of soluble Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which correspondingly decreased by a similar amount."
[9] "The amount of grafted Cr61 determined at 600°C was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The study aimed to investigate the chemical and physical characteristics and catalytic performance of catalysts made by adding increasing amounts of chromium oxide to commercial alumina, both in the presence and absence of potassium as a dopant. The research focused on dehydrogenation of isobutane. The catalysts were characterized using chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical analysis revealed the presence of three types of chromium species: a Cr31 species, a Cr61 species that could be removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and a grafted Cr61 species chemically bound to the support. The amount of soluble Cr61 increased with the total chromium oxide content, up to 2 wt%. For higher chromium oxide loadings, Cr31 was also detected, increasing linearly with the chromium oxide loading. The grafted Cr61 species covered about 50% of the surface area, and its amount was proportional to the surface area, being less than the theoretical amount needed to cover the entire alumina surface. The treatment with water restored the amount of soluble Cr61 at the expense of the Cr31 species.

研究旨在研究通过向商用氧化铝中添加不同量的氧化铬制备催化剂的化学和物理特性和催化性能，同时考虑钾作为掺杂剂的情况。研究重点是异丁烷脱氢。催化剂通过化学分析和X射线衍射(XRD)进行了表征。化学分析发现存在三种类型的铬物种：Cr31物种、可以通过冷水处理去除的Cr61物种，以及与支持物化学结合的附着Cr61物种。可溶性Cr61的含量随总铬氧化物含量增加，达到2 wt%。对于更高的铬氧化物负载，检测到Cr31，其含量线性增加与铬氧化物负载。附着的Cr61物种覆盖约50%的表面面积，并且其含量与表面面积成正比，小于理论上需要完全覆盖整个氧化铝表面的量。用冷水处理恢复了可溶性Cr61的含量，以牺牲Cr31物种为代价。
