1. The experimental error of the technique used for analysis has been evaluated through repeated analysis and corresponds to approximately 10% of the average value.

2. The amount of soluble Cr61 increased steadily for CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt% until reaching 2 wt% for a total CrO3 content of 4 wt%.

3. In the calcined catalysts, the amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and undetected Cr31 oxide varies with the overall chromium oxide content. The undetected Cr31 oxide is present in forms other than crystalline a-Cr2O3.

1. 该分析技术的实验误差通过重复分析进行了评估，并且对应于平均值的大约10%。

2. 对于CrO3含量高于2 wt%的部分，可溶性Cr61的量稳步增加，直到达到2 wt%，这是对于总CrO3含量为4 wt%的情况。

3. 在煅烧催化剂中，结晶a-Cr2O3和未检测到的Cr31氧化物的量随着总体铬氧化物含量的变化。未检测到的Cr31氧化物以非结晶a-Cr2O3的形式存在。
