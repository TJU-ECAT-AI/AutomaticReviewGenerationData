[4] "In the dehydrogenation of alkane, carbon deposition is one of the serious problems. In the dehydrogenation of alkane over the oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, carbon deposition was observed. Notably, the carbon deposition in the presence of CO2 was less than that in the absence of CO2."
[5] "In order to understand the role that CO2 plays in relation to the catalyst surface or oxidation states of catalysts in the dehydrogenation reactions, UV-Vis measurements were carried out."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The presence of CO2 promoted the dehydrogenation of propane over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, leading to higher propylene yields compared to reactions in the absence of CO2.
2. CO2 significantly increased the ethylene yield on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, with an ethylene yield of 22.5% and an ethylene selectivity of 86.7% at 923 K.
3. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst produced a propylene yield of 13.2%, while the V2O5 catalyst produced a yield of 10.8% at 898 K during propane dehydrogenation.
4. The carbon deposition issue was less pronounced in the presence of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of alkane over the oxidized diamond-supported catalysts compared to reactions without CO2.
5. UV-Vis measurements were conducted to investigate how CO2 affects the catalyst surface or oxidation states in the dehydrogenation reactions.
