[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 afforded nearly twofold higher activities than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[3] "Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[4] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes under a CO2 atmosphere was small compared with that in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

1. The presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the catalytic activities of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane, achieving nearly twice the activity compared to its absence.
2. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst increased with higher reaction temperatures during the dehydrogenation of propane.
3. Carbon dioxide exhibited a modest enhancing effect on butane conversion and butene yields in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane using oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts.
4. Compared to ethane, the promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes was relatively minor.
5. Maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species on the catalyst surface was identified as a crucial factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation processes in the presence of CO2.

3. 碳二酸在丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢过程中对丁烷转化率和丁烯产率的促进作用相对较小，但仍然存在。
4. 相比于乙烷，二氧化碳在C3和C4烷烃的脱氢过程中对烷烃的促进作用相对较小。
5. 维持铬和钒物种在催化剂表面的更高氧化状态被确认为在CO2存在下高活性烷烃脱氢反应的关键因素。
