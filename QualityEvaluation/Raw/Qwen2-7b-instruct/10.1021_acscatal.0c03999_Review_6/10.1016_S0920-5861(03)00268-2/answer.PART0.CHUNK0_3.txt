[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[3] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increases with rising reaction temperatures.
2. A modest enhancing effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butene yields was observed in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane using the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts.
3. The presence of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts may contribute to maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species.

1. 氧化金刚石支持的V2O5催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性随反应温度升高而增加。
2. 在用氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂进行正丁烷和异丁烷脱氢时，二氧化碳对碳链长度为4的烷烃转化率和顺-2-丁烯产率的促进作用较小但存在。
3. 二氧化碳在用氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂进行低碳烷脱氢时的作用可能是维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态。
