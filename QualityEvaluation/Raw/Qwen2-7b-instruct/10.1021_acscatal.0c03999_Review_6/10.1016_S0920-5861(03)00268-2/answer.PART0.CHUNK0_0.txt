[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "A support effect of oxidized diamond for Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts was observed in the presence of CO2."
[3] "Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature."
[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts are not directly discussed in the document. However, the performance of Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their ability to maintain high oxidation states of the active metal species. The oxidized diamond support facilitates this process by providing a suitable environment for the catalysts to operate at lower temperatures while maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species, thus enhancing their activity in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在文档中没有直接讨论。然而，Fe氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到其维持活性金属物种高氧化状态的能力的影响。氧化金刚石支持可以促进这一过程，在较低温度下运行的同时保持铬和钒物种的更高氧化状态，从而增强它们在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性。
