[1] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."
[2] "UV-Vis measurements were carried out to understand the role that CO2 plays in relation to the catalyst surface or oxidation states of catalysts in the dehydrogenation reactions."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the maintenance of higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species. UV-Vis measurements provide insights into how CO2 might play a role in maintaining these higher oxidation states on the catalyst surface, which is crucial for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane reactions in the presence of CO2.
