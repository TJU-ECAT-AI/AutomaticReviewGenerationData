          [1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
          [2] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
          [3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
          [4] "Furthermore, pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the reaction in a stream of CO2 and in a stream of He."

          The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism.

          [1] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
          [2] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
          [3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."
          [4] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 on the SiO2 surface is advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane, and maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction with CO2 could optimize the catalytic system for this process.
