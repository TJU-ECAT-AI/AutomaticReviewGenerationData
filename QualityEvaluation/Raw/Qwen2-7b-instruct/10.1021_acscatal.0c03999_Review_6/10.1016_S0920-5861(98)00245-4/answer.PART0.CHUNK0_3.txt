[1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Furthermore, pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the reaction in a stream of CO2 and in a stream of He. The C3H6 yield at the rst pulse and the second pulse in the presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in the absence of CO2."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. This insight allows for the optimization of catalytic systems by considering the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface, particularly at the boundaries between metal oxide and support materials.
