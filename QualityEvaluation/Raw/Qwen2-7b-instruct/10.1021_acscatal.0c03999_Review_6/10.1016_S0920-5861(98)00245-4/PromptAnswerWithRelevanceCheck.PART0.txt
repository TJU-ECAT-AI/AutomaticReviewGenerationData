[1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Silica-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency, specifically when exposed to CO2. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and mitigating catalyst degradation. Moreover, partially oxidized Cr2O3 on silica supports demonstrates superior activity for propane dehydrogenation compared to reduced catalysts. In CO2-rich environments, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts tends to maintain a partially oxidized state, which likely contributes to their improved performance in this process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。SiO2支持的催化剂在CO2作用下表现出增强的脱氢性能。CO2的存在促进了丙烷的脱氢，提高了丙烯的产率，并抑制了催化剂的降解。此外，Cr2O3部分氧化后在SiO2上的活性高于还原状态的催化剂，对于丙烷脱氢具有优越性。在CO2丰富的环境中，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂表面倾向于保持部分氧化状态，这可能对其在该过程中的性能产生积极影响。

[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the study indicates that carbon dioxide promotes the dehydrogenation of propane only on SiO2-supported catalysts. This enhancement leads to an increased yield of propylene and reduced catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Fe oxide on SiO2 catalyst surfaces appears to be advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane. Moreover, in the presence of CO2, the surface of the catalyst is kept partially oxidized, which might contribute to the improved stability and activity of the catalyst during the reaction.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料对其在二氧化碳-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。具体来说，研究表明，仅在SiO2负载的催化剂上观察到二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢的促进作用。这种增强导致丙烯产量增加和催化剂降解减少。Fe氧化物在SiO2表面的部分氧化状态似乎有利于丙烷的脱氢。此外，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，催化剂表面可能保持部分氧化状态，这可能有助于催化剂在反应过程中的稳定性和活性提高。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation of propane. When using a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the presence of CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppresses catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 on the SiO2 surface appears to be advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane. This suggests that maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction with CO2 could optimize the catalytic system for this process.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. This insight allows for the optimization of catalytic systems by considering the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface, particularly at the boundaries between metal oxide and support materials.
