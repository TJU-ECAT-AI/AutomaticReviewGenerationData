[1] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."
[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their ability to maintain a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which enhances the yield of C3H6 and suppresses catalyst deactivation. This provides insights into optimizing catalytic systems for this process by selecting materials that can maintain a suitable oxidation state, particularly in the context of SiO2-supported catalysts.
