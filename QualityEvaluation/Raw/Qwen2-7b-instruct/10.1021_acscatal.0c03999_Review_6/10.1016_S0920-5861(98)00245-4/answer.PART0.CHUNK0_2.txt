[1] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation of propane. When using a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the presence of CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppresses catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 on the SiO2 surface appears to be advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane. This suggests that maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction with CO2 could optimize the catalytic system for this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料影响其在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能，这会影响催化剂促进丙烷脱氢的能力。使用Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂时，二氧化碳的存在可以提高丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。Cr2O3在SiO2表面的部分氧化状态似乎对丙烷脱氢有利。这表明，在使用二氧化碳进行反应时，保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态可以优化此过程的催化系统。
