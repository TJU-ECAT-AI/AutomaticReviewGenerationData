[1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Silica-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency, specifically when exposed to CO2. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and mitigating catalyst degradation. Moreover, partially oxidized Cr2O3 on silica supports demonstrates superior activity for propane dehydrogenation compared to reduced catalysts. In CO2-rich environments, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts tends to maintain a partially oxidized state, which likely contributes to their improved performance in this process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。SiO2支持的催化剂在CO2作用下表现出增强的脱氢性能。CO2的存在促进了丙烷的脱氢，提高了丙烯的产率，并抑制了催化剂的降解。此外，Cr2O3部分氧化后在SiO2上的活性高于还原状态的催化剂，对于丙烷脱氢具有优越性。在CO2丰富的环境中，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂表面倾向于保持部分氧化状态，这可能对其在该过程中的性能产生积极影响。
