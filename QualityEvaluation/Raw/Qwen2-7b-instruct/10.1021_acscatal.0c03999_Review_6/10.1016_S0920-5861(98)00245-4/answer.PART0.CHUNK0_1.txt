The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the study indicates that carbon dioxide promotes the dehydrogenation of propane only on SiO2-supported catalysts. This enhancement leads to an increased yield of propylene and reduced catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Fe oxide on SiO2 catalyst surfaces appears to be advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane. Moreover, in the presence of CO2, the surface of the catalyst is kept partially oxidized, which might contribute to the improved stability and activity of the catalyst during the reaction.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料对其在二氧化碳-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。具体来说，研究表明，仅在SiO2负载的催化剂上观察到二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢的促进作用。这种增强导致丙烯产量增加和催化剂降解减少。Fe氧化物在SiO2表面的部分氧化状态似乎有利于丙烷的脱氢。此外，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，催化剂表面可能保持部分氧化状态，这可能有助于催化剂在反应过程中的稳定性和活性提高。
