Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], [10.1021/jp807864z], [10.1021/ja070908q], [10.1021/acscatal.7b03805], [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015], and [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x]. The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support materials used. Reducibility impacts their reactivity towards CO2 and propane during the oxidation process. Support materials such as carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and enhance its activity. Insights from these studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
