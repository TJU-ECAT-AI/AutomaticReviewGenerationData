[1] "The first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane."
[3] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."

The ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts involves both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways. Propene is exclusively formed from the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both channels. The use of online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) provides the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface through the activation of propane's CH bonds. These findings offer new insights into the reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and suggest potential for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH.

[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[3] "The formation of oxidized B sites (for example, BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x) act as the active centers under ODHP reaction conditions."
[4] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction."
[5] "Wang et al. have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[6] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[7] "The product distributions of BN catalysts were quite different from the traditional metal oxide catalysts, where the main by-product is C2H4, and its selectivity increased with C3H8 conversion especially at high temperatures."
[8] "The integrated peak intensity of signals of various gas-phase components in the SVUV-PIMS spectra of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BN-T-high sample was plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Figure2B."
[9] "As shown in Figure3, the first step in ODHP is the CH activation of propane, which we find to most likely occur via a heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active site."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High reducibility allows the catalysts to effectively reduce CO2, enhancing the efficiency of the reaction. Support materials can alter the surface properties and electronic structure of the catalysts, affecting their selectivity and stability. Insights into these factors can guide the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, aiming to improve conversion rates and selectivities, and minimize byproduct formation. The proposed reaction mechanism typically involves the activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, followed by hydrogenation and further transformations to produce desired products.
