[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."
[5] "Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of high reducibility and appropriate support materials can lead to enhanced activity and selectivity, optimizing the catalytic system for this process. The influence of these factors can dictate the reaction pathways, product distribution, and overall efficiency of CO2-ODHP reactions.
