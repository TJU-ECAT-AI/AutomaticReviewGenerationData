[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[3] "The formation of oxidized B sites (for example, BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x) act as the active centers under ODHP reaction conditions."
[4] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction."
[5] "Wang et al. have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[6] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[7] "The product distributions of BN catalysts were quite different from the traditional metal oxide catalysts, where the main by-product is C2H4, and its selectivity increased with C3H8 conversion especially at high temperatures."
[8] "The integrated peak intensity of signals of various gas-phase components in the SVUV-PIMS spectra of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BN-T-high sample was plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Figure2B."
[9] "As shown in Figure3, the first step in ODHP is the CH activation of propane, which we find to most likely occur via a heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active site."
[10] "We have also explored the formation of C1 and C2 products which start to form in larger proportions at higher temperatures (Figure1)."

1. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to produce olefins with minimal carbon oxides. It exhibits lower selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to vanadium-based catalysts.
2. Under ODH reaction conditions, oxidized B sites such as BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x serve as the active centers on the h-BN catalyst surface.
3. Recent studies suggest that gas-phase radical chemistry might play a role in the ODH reaction over h-BN catalysts.
4. Wang et al. propose that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface through cleavage of CC bonds, leading to various secondary reaction pathways during ODH.
5. The complete reaction pathways and mechanisms for ODH reactions over h-BN catalysts have been elucidated through a combination of kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations.
6. The product distributions for BN catalysts differ significantly from traditional metal oxide catalysts, showing increased selectivity for ethylene as the by-product, especially at high temperatures.
7. The integrated ion intensities of various gas-phase components in the ODH reaction catalyzed by h-BN were plotted against temperature, revealing distinct patterns for different products.
8. The first step in the ODH process involves heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond of propane over a BO pair in a BO3 active site on the h-BN surface.
9. At higher temperatures, the formation of C1 and C2 products starts to increase, contributing to the overall reaction pathway.
