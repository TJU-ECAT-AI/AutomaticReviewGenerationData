[1] "The ODHP reaction catalyzed by both h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts involves the gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways with unambiguously identified gas-phase methyl radicals by using the SVUV-PIMS."
[2] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."
[3] "Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane."

The ODHP reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts follows gas-phase radical mechanisms, with the identification of gas-phase methyl radicals through SVUV-PIMS. Detailed reaction pathways are elucidated through a combination of kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations. Propene is predominantly formed through the surface reaction by cleaving the CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products.

ODHP反应在六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氧化物支持催化剂上遵循气体相自由基机制，通过SVUV-PIMS明确识别出气体相甲基自由基。通过结合动力学研究、SVUV-PIMS测量和DFT计算，提出了各种产品的详细反应途径。丙烯主要通过表面反应由丙烷的CH键断裂形成。表面介导和气体相途径都对C1和C2产物的形成做出贡献。
