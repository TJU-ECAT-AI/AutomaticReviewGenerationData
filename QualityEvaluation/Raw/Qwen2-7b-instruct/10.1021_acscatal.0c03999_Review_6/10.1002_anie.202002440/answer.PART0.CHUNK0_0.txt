The ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts involves both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways. Propene is exclusively formed from the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both channels. The use of online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) provides the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface through the activation of propane's CH bonds. These findings offer new insights into the reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and suggest potential for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH.

硼基催化剂上的氧化脱氢反应涉及表面介导和气相自由基途径。丙烯仅从表面反应形成，而C1和C2产物通过两种通道形成。在线使用同步辐射真空紫外光离子质谱（SVUV-PIMS）首次直接证实了硼基催化剂上氧化脱氢反应中的气相甲基自由基（CH3.）。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，丙烯主要在催化剂表面上通过丙烷的CH键激活生成。这些发现为理解硼基催化剂上的反应机制提供了新见解，并暗示可能开发出高度选择性的烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂。
