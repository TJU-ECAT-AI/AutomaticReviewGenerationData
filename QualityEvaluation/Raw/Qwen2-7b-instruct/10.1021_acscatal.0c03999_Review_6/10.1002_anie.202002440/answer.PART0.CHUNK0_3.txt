[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High reducibility allows the catalysts to effectively reduce CO2, enhancing the efficiency of the reaction. Support materials can alter the surface properties and electronic structure of the catalysts, affecting their selectivity and stability. Insights into these factors can guide the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, aiming to improve conversion rates and selectivities, and minimize byproduct formation. The proposed reaction mechanism typically involves the activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, followed by hydrogenation and further transformations to produce desired products.
