[1] "The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na- ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "Taking into account the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer- ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom- plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215)."

The main goal of the research was to understand the active surface site responsible for converting methane into benzene using MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. It was expected that the transformation of ethylene into benzene occurs on the surface of the ZSM-5 component due to its high efficiency in oligomerization and cyclization reactions.
