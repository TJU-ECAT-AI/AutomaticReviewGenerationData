[1] "The above features of the reaction of methane and the initial product formation clearly indicated that methane strongly interacted with MoO3 at the reaction temperature."
[2] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K produced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydrogen to give methane above 800 K."
[3] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K pro- duced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydro- gen to give methane above 800 K. No other products of the hydrogenation of this carbon were identified."
[4] "The selectivity to benzene was 8085% at a conversion of 6.07.0%."
[5] "In this case we cannot count on the presence of Mo oxides, although if the reactive OH groups of the support are not removed completely, 2σOMo2+ species can be transitorily formed during the preparation in the reaction 2σOH + Mo(CO)3 2σOMo2+ + 3CO + H2, (12) as it was postulated for alumina (17)."

[1] "The results of the present study clearly show that methane reacts readily with unsupported MoO3 and MoO2 at high temperature to give H2O and CO2."
[2] "When Mo oxides were mixed with ZSM-5, or particularly when they were dispersed on the ZSM-5 support, at the very beginning of the contact of methane with the catalyst we observed similar features. In the latter stages, however, the production of hydrocarbons, particularly benzene, with a selectivity of 60-80%, came into prominence."
[3] "Accordingly, we may assume that the dramatic change in the product distribution following the strong interaction of methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the formation of Mo2C."
[4] "In these cases, in addition to H2, we detected all the hydrocarbons (ethylene, ethane, benzene, and small amounts of propane and toluene), the formation of which was observed on the highly active 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst."
[5] "Accordingly, we may conclude that Mo2C on the ZSM-5, produced by the transformation of highly dispersed MoO3, is the active site for the cleavage of the CH bond in the methane molecule, but it is far less active for the further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced."

[1] "In the case of the Mo metal, the dominant process is the decomposition of methane to carbon and hydrogen, similarly as on supported Pt metals (19); only about 78% of decomposed methane is transfomed into ethane and ethylene."
[2] "When Mo2C was prepared by decarbonylation and carburization of Mo(CO)6 deposited on ZSM-5 we also obtained an active and selective catalyst."
[3] "In this case, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high temperature treatment with H2 removes not only the excess carbon, but also a frac- tion of surface carbon of Mo2C, creating very active centers for the subsequent decomposition of CH4."
[4] "Accordingly, we may conclude that Mo2C on the ZSM-5,produced by the transformation of highly dispersed MoO3,is the active site for the cleavage of the CH bond in the methane molecule, but it is far less active for the further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced."

[1] "The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na- ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "Taking into account the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer- ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom- plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main goal of the research was to understand the active surface site responsible for converting methane into benzene using MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. It was expected that the transformation of ethylene into benzene occurs on the surface of the ZSM-5 component due to its high efficiency in oligomerization and cyclization reactions.

1. When methane interacts with the Mo metal, it predominantly decomposes to carbon and hydrogen, similar to how it behaves on supported Pt metals. Only around 78% of the decomposed methane is transformed into ethane and ethylene.

2. The notable shift in catalytic performance observed after the initial interaction of methane with the catalyst at high temperatures can be attributed to the formation of a novel compound during the reaction.

3. We can assume that the significant alteration in product distribution following the robust interaction of methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the creation of Mo2C.

4. When Mo2C is combined with ZSM-5 or deposited on its surface, in addition to hydrogen, all hydrocarbons (ethane, ethylene, benzene, and small amounts of propane and toluene) are detected, akin to the formation seen on the highly active 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst.

5. We cannot rule out the possibility that the high-temperature treatment with hydrogen removes not just the excess carbon, but also a portion of the surface carbon of Mo2C, generating highly active sites for the subsequent decomposition of methane.

1. 当甲烷与钼金属相互作用时，它主要分解为碳和氢，这与在支持的铂金属上观察到的行为相似。分解的甲烷中只有大约78%被转化为乙烷和乙烯。

2. 在高温度反应过程中催化剂性能发生显著变化的原因可以归咎于催化剂形成的新化合物。

3. 我们可以假设，在与支持的钼氧化物强烈相互作用后，产品分布的显著改变是由于Mo2C的形成。

4. 将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合或沉积在其表面时，在氢之外，检测到了所有烃（乙烷、乙烯、苯、以及少量丙烷和甲苯），这类似于在高度活性的2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5催化剂上观察到的形成。

5. 我们不能排除高温氢处理不仅移除多余碳，也可能去除Mo2C表面的一部分碳，产生非常活跃的位点进行后续的甲烷分解。
