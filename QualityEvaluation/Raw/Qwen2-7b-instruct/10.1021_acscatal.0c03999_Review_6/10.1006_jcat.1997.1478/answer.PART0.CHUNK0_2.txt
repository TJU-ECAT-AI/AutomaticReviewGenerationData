[1] "In the case of the Mo metal, the dominant process is the decomposition of methane to carbon and hydrogen, similarly as on supported Pt metals (19); only about 78% of decomposed methane is transfomed into ethane and ethylene."
[2] "When Mo2C was prepared by decarbonylation and carburization of Mo(CO)6 deposited on ZSM-5 we also obtained an active and selective catalyst."
[3] "In this case, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high temperature treatment with H2 removes not only the excess carbon, but also a frac- tion of surface carbon of Mo2C, creating very active centers for the subsequent decomposition of CH4."
[4] "Accordingly, we may conclude that Mo2C on the ZSM-5,produced by the transformation of highly dispersed MoO3,is the active site for the cleavage of the CH bond in the methane molecule, but it is far less active for the further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced."

1. The dominant process when methane interacts with the metallic Mo is its decomposition into carbon and hydrogen, similar to the process observed with supported Pt metals. About 78% of decomposed methane is transformed into ethane and ethylene.
2. An active and selective catalyst was obtained when Mo2C was prepared through decarbonylation and carburization of Mo(CO)6 deposited on ZSM-5.
3. The high temperature treatment with H2 might not only remove excess carbon but also a portion of the surface carbon of Mo2C, creating highly active sites for subsequent methane decomposition.
4. Mo2C on the ZSM-5, produced by transforming highly dispersed MoO3, acts as the active site for cleaving the CH bond in the methane molecule. However, it is less active for the further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced.

1. 金属Mo与甲烷相互作用的主要过程是其分解成碳和氢，这与支持的Pt金属观察到的过程相似。大约78%分解的甲烷转化为乙烷和乙烯。
2. 当通过脱羰基化和碳化Mo(CO)6在ZSM-5上沉积的Mo2C时，我们得到了一个活性和选择性的催化剂。
3. 高温处理H2可能不仅去除多余的碳，也可能去除Mo2C表面的一部分碳，形成高活性位点进行后续的甲烷分解。
4. 在ZSM-5上由高度分散的MoO3转变得到的Mo2C作为断裂甲烷分子中的CH键的活性位点。然而，它对进一步分解产生的CH3和CH2物种的分解作用较弱。
