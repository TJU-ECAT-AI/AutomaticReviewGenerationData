[1] "The above features of the reaction of methane and the initial product formation clearly indicated that methane strongly interacted with MoO3 at the reaction temperature."
[2] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K produced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydrogen to give methane above 800 K."
[3] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K pro- duced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydro- gen to give methane above 800 K. No other products of the hydrogenation of this carbon were identified."
[4] "The selectivity to benzene was 8085% at a conversion of 6.07.0%."
[5] "In this case we cannot count on the presence of Mo oxides, although if the reactive OH groups of the support are not removed completely, 2σOMo2+ species can be transitorily formed during the preparation in the reaction 2σOH + Mo(CO)3 2σOMo2+ + 3CO + H2, (12) as it was postulated for alumina (17)."

1. Methane interacted strongly with MoO3 at the reaction temperature.
2. Additional surface carbon was produced when methane was decomposed on Mo2C at 973 K, which reacted with hydrogen to produce methane above 800 K.
3. No other products were identified when methane was decomposed on Mo2C at 973 K, except for the additional surface carbon reacting with hydrogen to produce methane.
4. The selectivity to benzene was 80-85% at a methane conversion of 6.0-7.0%.
5. In the preparation of Mo2C/ZSM-5, 2σOMo2+ species can be temporarily formed if the reactive OH groups of the support are not completely removed, as was hypothesized for alumina (17).

1. 在反应温度下，甲烷与MoO3强烈相互作用。
2. 当甲烷在973 K上被Mo2C分解时，产生了额外的表面碳，这些碳与氢反应生成甲烷，高于800 K。
3. 当甲烷在973 K上被Mo2C分解时，除了产生额外的表面碳并与氢反应生成甲烷之外，没有其他产物被识别。
4. 在6.0-7.0%的甲烷转化率下，苯的选择性为80%-85%。
5. 在Mo2C/ZSM-5的制备中，如果支持物上的活性OH基团未完全去除，则可以暂时形成2σOMo2+物种，正如对于氧化铝（17）提出的那样。
