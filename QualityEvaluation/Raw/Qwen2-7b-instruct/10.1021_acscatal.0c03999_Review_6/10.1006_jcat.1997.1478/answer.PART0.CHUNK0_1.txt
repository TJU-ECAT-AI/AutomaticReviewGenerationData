[1] "The results of the present study clearly show that methane reacts readily with unsupported MoO3 and MoO2 at high temperature to give H2O and CO2."
[2] "When Mo oxides were mixed with ZSM-5, or particularly when they were dispersed on the ZSM-5 support, at the very beginning of the contact of methane with the catalyst we observed similar features. In the latter stages, however, the production of hydrocarbons, particularly benzene, with a selectivity of 60-80%, came into prominence."
[3] "Accordingly, we may assume that the dramatic change in the product distribution following the strong interaction of methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the formation of Mo2C."
[4] "In these cases, in addition to H2, we detected all the hydrocarbons (ethylene, ethane, benzene, and small amounts of propane and toluene), the formation of which was observed on the highly active 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst."
[5] "Accordingly, we may conclude that Mo2C on the ZSM-5, produced by the transformation of highly dispersed MoO3, is the active site for the cleavage of the CH bond in the methane molecule, but it is far less active for the further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced."

1. Methane reacts with unsupported MoO3 and MoO2 at high temperature to produce H2O and CO2.
2. Dispersing Mo oxides on ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, with the formation of hydrocarbons, especially benzene, becoming prominent.
3. The transformation of Mo oxides into Mo2C explains the dramatic change in product distribution during methane interaction.
4. Adding Mo2C to ZSM-5 leads to the detection of various hydrocarbons, including benzene.
5. Mo2C on ZSM-5 serves as the active site for cleaving the CH bond in methane, with limited further decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species.

1. 在高温下，甲烷与未支持的MoO3和MoO2反应产生H2O和CO2。
2. 将Mo氧化物分散在ZSM-5上会改变产物分布，尤其是苯的生成变得突出。
3. Mo氧化物转化为Mo2C解释了强相互作用期间产物分布的显著变化。
4. 将Mo2C添加到ZSM-5中会导致检测到各种碳氢化合物，包括苯。
5. ZSM-5上的Mo2C作为断裂甲烷分子中的CH键的活性位点，对进一步分解CH3和CH2物种的活性较低。
