[1] "The microwave irradiation reduced the synthesis time and the resulting Cr-TUD-1 catalysts exhibited a high specific surface area of more than 600 m2 g1."
[2] "The presence of CO2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."

The document discusses the synthesis of chromium-containing TUD-1 catalysts using microwave irradiation. These catalysts exhibit a high specific surface area, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The presence of CO2 can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, negatively impacting the selectivity. The Ti-TUD-1 catalyst, obtained through microwave irradiation, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity for the oxidation of cyclic olefins. Among the chromium-containing TUD-1 catalysts, the 7 wt% catalyst shows the highest propane conversion (45%) and propylene product selectivity (75%). The chromium species in these catalysts are expected to be in the Cr6+ state due to the preparation and calcination processes. Notably, the 7 wt% catalyst maintains its catalytic activity for an extended period, showing reasonable stability over 8 hours of operation. The proposed mechanism involves a weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen, cleavage of CH via H-abstraction, desorption of propylene by hydride elimination, recombination of OH groups to form water, and re-oxidation of reduced metal centers via dissociative chemisorption of CO2.

文档讨论了使用微波辐射合成含铬TUD-1催化剂。这些催化剂具有较高的比表面积，能够促进丙烷在CO2作为软氧化剂的情况下转化为丙烯。CO2的存在可能导致工艺可燃性增加和过氧化，从而降低选择性。通过微波辐射制备的Ti-TUD-1催化剂显示出对环烯烃氧化的出色催化活性。在含铬TUD-1催化剂中，7 wt%催化剂表现出最高的丙烷转化率（45%）和丙烯产品选择性（75%）。由于准备和煅烧过程，这些催化剂中的铬物种预计处于Cr6+状态。值得注意的是，7 wt%催化剂在其操作长达8小时后仍保持其催化活性，显示出良好的稳定性。提出的机制涉及丙烷与晶格氧的弱关联吸附、CH的裂解以及通过H抽象，丙烯通过氢消除脱附，OH团的重新组合形成水，以及通过CO2的离散化学吸附还原金属中心来氧化还原金属中心。
