[1] "As can be noted from this figure, the presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures."
[2] "In the 2θ range of 570, the broad diffraction lines corresponding to the crystalline phase of the α-Cr2O3 were detected."
[3] "Interestingly, the 7 wt% catalyst did not shown much drop in the catalytic activity even after 8 h of reaction time."
[4] "The decrease in the surface area as well as pore volume is more in case of higher Cr loading samples (7 and 9%) where the pores are assumed to have coke deposits on the metal surfaces which are trapped in the pores."

1. The presence of Cr6+ ions is anticipated from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination processes.
2. Broad diffraction lines corresponding to the α-Cr2O3 crystalline phase were observed in the 2θ range of 570.
3. Surprisingly, the 7 wt% catalyst maintained a considerable level of catalytic activity even after an 8-hour reaction period.
4. In catalysts with higher Cr loadings (7 and 9%), there was a notable decrease in surface area and pore volume, suggesting the presence of coke deposits on the metal surfaces within the pores.

1. Cr6+离子的出现预计是从Cr3+在准备和煅烧过程中的氧化。
2. 在2θ范围为570的角度范围内，检测到了对应α-Cr2O3结晶相的宽衍射线。
3. 令人惊讶的是，7 wt%催化剂在反应持续8小时后仍保持了显著的催化活性。
4. 对于负载量较高的Cr催化剂（7和9%），表面面积和孔体积的下降更为明显，这表明金属表面存在焦炭沉积物，并被困在孔隙中。
