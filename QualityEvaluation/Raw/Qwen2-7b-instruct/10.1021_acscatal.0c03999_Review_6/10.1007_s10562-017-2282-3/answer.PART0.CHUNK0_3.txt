[1] "As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry."
[2] "The better catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 originates from both high accessibility of the substrate to the catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system, and from the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls."
[3] "In the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the particle size ranged between 4 and 7 nm and at the highest Cr loading of 9 wt% the particle sizes were as large as 2530 nm."
[4] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures."
[5] "The UVvis DRS studies of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions."
[6] "The amount of coke in the case of 7% used catalyst where helium was used as the carrier gas has a higher amount of coke than in case of CO2 as the carrier gas."
[7] "The reasons for deactivation could be either the agglomeration of Cr species or reduction of the active species or coke formation."

1. The issue of CO2 emission has become a major concern in environmental chemistry.
2. The improved catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 is attributed to its three-dimensional mesopore system, which enhances substrate access to active sites and the creation of a titanium-enriched surface layer.
3. Particle sizes for the lower loading sample ranged from 4 to 7 nm, while the highest loading reached up to 2530 nm.
4. The presence of Cr6+ species is anticipated from the oxidation of Cr3+ during preparation and calcination.
5. The UVvis DRS analysis of the synthesized samples was conducted under ambient conditions.
6. Using helium as a carrier gas led to a higher coke formation in the 7% catalyst compared to when CO2 was used.
7. The catalyst deactivation mechanisms include agglomeration of Cr species, reduction of active species, or coke formation.

1. CO2排放问题已成为环境化学的主要议题。
2. Ti-TUD-1的改进催化活性归因于其三维微孔系统，该系统提高了基质对活性位点的访问，并在微孔壁上形成了富含钛的表面层。
3. 低负载样品的颗粒尺寸范围为4至7纳米，而最高负载达到了2530纳米。
4. 预期Cr6+物种从Cr3+的氧化产生，这发生在制备和煅烧过程中。
5. 合成样品的UVvis DRS分析是在大气条件下进行的。
6. 使用氦气作为载气导致7%催化剂中的焦炭形成量高于使用二氧化碳时。
7. 催化剂失活机制包括Cr物种的聚集、活性物种的还原或焦炭形成。
