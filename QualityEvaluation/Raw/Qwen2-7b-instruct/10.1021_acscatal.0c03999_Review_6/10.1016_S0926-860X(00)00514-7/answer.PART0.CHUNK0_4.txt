The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Active carbons, specifically those with low ash content like D-90, serve as the best supports. Iron oxide catalysts exhibit superior activity compared to chromium and copper oxides, and they show slower deactivation. The optimal iron content is 5 wt.%, and the addition of alkaline metal oxides enhances catalyst activity, with a 0.1 atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron being the most effective. The observed changes in catalyst mass after reaction suggest either carbon deposit formation or support gasification, aligning with the proposed oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism involving potassium ferrite as the active phase.

在CO2-ODHP反应中，Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料对其性能产生显著影响。活性碳，尤其是含低灰分的D-90，作为最佳支持材料。铁氧化物催化剂在活性和稳定性方面优于铬和铜氧化物，且显示出较慢的失活速率。最优的铁含量为5 wt.%，添加碱金属氧化物可以提高催化剂活性，0.1的碱金属与铁原子比被认为是最佳比例。观察到的催化剂质量变化表明可能是碳沉积形成或支持材料气化，这与Sugino等人提出的通过形成钾铁酸盐作为活性相的氧化脱氢机制一致。
