[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "Among the used transition metal oxides the best activity was observed for iron containing catalysts."
[3] "Additionally it showed slower deactivation than the chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon."
[4] "The catalytic behavior was influenced significantly by both the type of active carbon used and the iron content."
[5] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[6] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."
[7] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."
[8] "After all catalytic tests, a change in the mass of the catalysts was observed. As revealed by TPO experiments this can be either attributed to the formation of carbon deposits or to a gasification of the support."

1. Only active carbons were suitable for supporting the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. Iron oxide-based catalysts showed the best performance, with slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides on active carbon supports.

2. The type of active carbon and the iron content significantly influenced the catalytic behavior of the catalysts. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 having the least ash content and an iron concentration of 5 wt.%.

3. Alkaline metal oxides improved the activity of iron oxide-supported catalysts. The optimal ratio of alkali metal to iron was 0.1.

4. The observed mass change in the catalysts after the reaction could be attributed to the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support material.

5. The findings aligned with the mechanism proposed by Sugino et al., suggesting the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide, based on the correlation between the potassium surface concentration and catalyst activity.

6. The reduction in specific surface area and pore volume after catalysis indicated the formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support material.

1. 只有活性碳可以作为在二氧化碳存在的条件下乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的催化剂支撑。铁氧化物基催化剂表现出最佳性能，其脱活速度比铬和铜氧化物在活性碳上的催化剂慢。

2. 活性碳的类型和铁含量显著影响催化剂的行为。最好的结果是在具有最少灰分的活性碳D-90上实现的，且铁浓度为5 wt.%。

3. 添加碱金属氧化物提高了铁氧化物支持的催化剂的活性。碱金属与铁的最佳比例为0.1。

4. 反应后催化剂质量的变化可以归因于碳沉积的形成或支持材料的气化。

5. 观察到的结果与Sugino等人提出的机制相一致，即在二氧化碳存在下进行乙苯氧化脱氢时，钾铁氧体作为活性相形成，基于钾表面浓度与催化剂活性之间的相关性。

6. 反应后特定表面积和孔体积的减少表明形成了碳沉积或支持材料的气化。
