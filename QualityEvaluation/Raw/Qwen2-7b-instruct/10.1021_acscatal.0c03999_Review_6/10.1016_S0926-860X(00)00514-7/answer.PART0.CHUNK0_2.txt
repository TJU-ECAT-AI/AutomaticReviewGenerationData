[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "The introduction of Fe, Cr or Cu oxides on the active carbon support by impregnation method led to active catalysts. Ni and Co oxide on the active carbon were more active in the gasification of the support than in the dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Among the used transition metal oxides the best activity was observed for iron containing catalysts."
[4] "Additionally it showed slower deactivation than the chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon."
[5] "The catalytic behavior was influenced significantly by both the type of active carbon used and the iron content. The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[6] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."
[7] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mech- anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation be- tween the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."
[8] "After all catalytic tests, a change in the mass of the catalysts was observed. As revealed by TPO experiments this can be either attributed to the formation of carbon deposits or to a gasification of the support."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by the reducibility and support materials. Active carbons enable the efficient dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, whereas other carbon-based materials and inorganic compounds result in inactive catalysts. Iron oxide shows superior activity compared to chromium and copper oxides, with slower deactivation. The best active carbon support is one with the lowest ash content, specifically active carbon D-90, which optimizes performance when combined with 5 wt.% iron. The addition of alkaline metal oxides enhances catalyst activity, with a 0.1 ratio of alkali metal to iron yielding the best results. These findings support the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism proposed by Sugino et al., correlating surface potassium concentration with catalyst efficiency. The observed mass change in catalysts after reactions indicates the formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support, contributing to the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能受到还原性和支撑材料的影响。仅活性碳能够作为支持剂，实现乙苯到苯乙烯的高效脱氢。其他基于碳的材料和无机化合物导致催化剂失活。铁氧化物的活性优于铬和铜氧化物，在活性碳上的活性更高，且具有较慢的失活速率。最佳的活性碳支持是含最低灰分的活性碳D-90，结合5 wt.%的铁时优化了性能。添加碱金属氧化物提高了催化剂活性，0.1的碱金属与铁的比例产生了最佳效果。这些发现支持Sugino等人的氧化脱氢机制，表面钾浓度与催化剂效率之间存在相关性。催化剂反应后质量的变化表明形成了碳沉积物或支持物的气化，这为优化此过程中的催化体系提供了见解。
