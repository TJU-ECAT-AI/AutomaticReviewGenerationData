[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "Among the used transition metal oxides the best activity was observed for iron containing catalysts."
[3] "Additionally it showed slower deactivation than the chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon."
[4] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash."
[5] "The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[6] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."
[7] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mech-anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."
[8] "This fact can also be connected with the observed considerable decrease in specific surface area and the porous volume after catalysis."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by the reducibility and support materials. Active carbons notably enhance the catalysts' performance in the CO2-ODHP process. Iron oxide catalysts exhibit superior activity compared to chromium and copper oxide catalysts. The best catalyst support material is identified as active carbon D-90 with the least ash content, and the optimal iron content is 5 wt.%. Adding alkali metal oxides increases the catalyst's activity, with the most effective ratio being 0.1 for alkali metal to iron. The results align with Sugino et al.'s proposed mechanism, which involves the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. This mechanism is supported by the observed correlation between the surface concentration of potassium and catalyst activity. The reduction in specific surface area and porous volume after catalysis further validates the mechanism's accuracy.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能受到可还原性和支撑材料的影响。活性碳显著提高了催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的性能。与铬和铜氧化物催化剂相比，铁氧化物催化剂表现出更好的活性。最佳催化剂支撑材料被确定为具有最少灰分的活性碳D-90，最优的铁含量为5 wt.%。添加碱金属氧化物可以提高铁氧化物在活性碳上的活性，最有效的碱金属与铁的比例为0.1。结果与Sugino等人提出的机制相吻合，该机制涉及在乙苯与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中钾铁酸盐作为活性位点的形成。这一机制得到了表面钾浓度与催化剂活性之间观察到的相关性的支持。催化后特定表面积和孔体积的减少进一步验证了机制的准确性。
