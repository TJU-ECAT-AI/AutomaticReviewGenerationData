[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "The introduction of Fe, Cr or Cu oxides on the active carbon support by impregnation method led to active catalysts."
[3] "Among the used transition metal oxides the best activity was observed for iron containing catalysts."
[4] "The catalytic behavior was influenced significantly by both the type of active carbon used and the iron content."
[5] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[6] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."
[7] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mech- anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation be- tween the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."
[8] "After all catalytic tests, a change in the mass of the catalysts was observed. As revealed by TPO experiments this can be either attributed to the formation of carbon deposits or to a gasification of the support."

1. Only active carbons were suitable for supporting the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. 
2. Impregnating iron, chromium, or copper oxides onto an active carbon support generated active catalysts.
3. Among the tested transition metal oxides, iron-containing catalysts demonstrated the highest activity.
4. The type of active carbon and the iron content significantly influenced the catalytic behavior.
5. Active carbon D-90 with the least ash content was the most effective support, with an optimal iron concentration of 5 wt.%.
6. Adding alkaline metal oxides increased the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with a 0.1 atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron being the most effective.
7. The findings align with Sugino et al.'s proposed mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, involving potassium ferrite as the active phase, based on the surface concentration of potassium and catalyst activity.
8. Changes in catalyst mass observed post-catalytic tests can be attributed to the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support, as determined by TPO experiments.
