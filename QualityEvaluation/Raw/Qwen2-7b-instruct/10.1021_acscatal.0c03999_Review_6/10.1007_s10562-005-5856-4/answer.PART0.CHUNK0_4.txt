The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was studied at 823 K in the presence or absence of CO2. The yield of propene and its selectivity were greater in the presence of CO2 compared to their absence. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and its selectivity were significantly higher in the absence of CO2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced within the temperature range of 723 to 873 K, and part of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K. Pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen led to an increase in the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduced the number of these sites. The vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation without CO2, whereas it became V5+ in the presence of CO2 due to the oxidizing effect of CO2.

在823 K下，通过二氧化硅支持的五氧化二钒催化剂对丙烷进行脱氢反应的研究在二氧化碳的存在或不存在下进行了。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烯的产率和其选择性高于其不存在时的情况。相反，在没有二氧化碳的情况下，芳烃的产率及其选择性要高得多。催化剂中的五氧化二钒可以在723至873 K的温度范围内被还原，并且催化剂中还原的五氧化二钒的一部分可以在823 K下被二氧化碳重新氧化。将五氧化二钒催化剂预处理为氢可以增加催化剂表面的酸性位点数量，而二氧化碳则减少了这些位点的数量。催化剂中表面的五氧化二钒在氢气和无二氧化碳的脱氢过程中是V4+/V3+，而在存在二氧化碳的情况下，由于二氧化碳的氧化作用，它变成了V5+。
