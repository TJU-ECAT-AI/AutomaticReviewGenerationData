2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K.
3. NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst.
4. UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. The findings in the document suggest that the vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced within a specific temperature range (723-873 K), and part of the reduced vanadium oxide can be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. The NH3 desorption studies indicate that pre-treating the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 has the opposite effect. UVvis studies reveal that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide behaves as V4+/V3+ ions in the presence of hydrogen or during the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas it becomes V5+ ions during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 due to the oxidizing action of CO2. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能起着关键作用。研究结果表明，催化剂中的钒氧化物可以在特定温度范围内（723-873 K）被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的钒氧化物可以在823 K下通过CO2进行再氧化。NH3脱附研究表明，通过氢对钒氧化物催化剂进行预处理可以增加催化剂上的酸性位点数量，而CO2则具有相反的效果。紫外可见光谱研究表明，在氢存在或在没有CO2的情况下进行脱氢化时，钒氧化物表面的钒表现为V4+/V3+离子，而在有CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢化时，由于CO2的氧化作用，它会变成V5+离子。这些见解为优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统提供了宝贵指导。
