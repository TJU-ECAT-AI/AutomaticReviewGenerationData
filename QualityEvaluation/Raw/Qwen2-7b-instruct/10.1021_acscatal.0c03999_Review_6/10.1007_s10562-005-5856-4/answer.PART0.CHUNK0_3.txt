[1] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[2] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[3] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane over bulk V2O5 in the presence/absence of CO2 was also carried out. The initial yield of aromatics in the dehy- drogenation in the absence of CO2 was three times higher than that in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "These findings suggest that the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst should be almost the same as that of bulk V2O5, and that the acid sites should be formed on vanadium oxide in the catalyst."
[5] "Accordingly, the characterization of the vanadium oxide in the catalyst in the presence/absence of CO2 must be necessary."

The study found that when propane undergoes dehydrogenation over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2, the yield of propene and its selectivity are higher compared to when CO2 is absent. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and their selectivity are much higher in the absence of CO2. The presence of CO2 slightly inhibits the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher yield of propene and a higher selectivity to propene. Pre-treating the catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing the aromatization of propene in the absence of CO2. However, in the presence of CO2, hydrogen pre-treatment hardly alters the yields of aromatics and propene or their selectivities. CO2 seems to reduce the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface. The catalytic properties of vanadium oxide in the silica-supported catalyst are nearly identical to those of bulk V2O5, and acid sites form on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst. Characterizing the vanadium oxide in the presence and absence of CO2 is crucial for understanding the dehydrogenation process.

研究发现，在二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应时，当存在二氧化碳时，丙烯的产率和其选择性高于不存在二氧化碳的情况。相反，当没有二氧化碳时，芳烃的产率和其选择性要高得多。二氧化碳的存在略微抑制了脱氢过程，导致更高的丙烯产率和更高的丙烯选择性。在没有二氧化碳的情况下，通过氢气预处理催化剂可以增加催化剂表面的酸性位点，从而增强丙烯的芳构化。然而，在存在二氧化碳的情况下，氢气预处理几乎不会改变芳烃和丙烯的产率或它们的选择性。二氧化碳似乎减少了催化剂表面的酸性位点数量。二氧化钒在二氧化硅支持的催化剂中的催化性质与纯块状V2O5相似，并且酸性位点在催化剂中形成。在存在和不存在二氧化碳的情况下，表征二氧化钒对于理解脱氢过程是必要的。
