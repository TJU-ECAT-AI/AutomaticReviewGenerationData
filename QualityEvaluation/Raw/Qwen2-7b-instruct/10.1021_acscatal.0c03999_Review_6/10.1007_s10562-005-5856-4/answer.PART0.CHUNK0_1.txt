2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K.
3. NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst.
4. UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The provided literature focuses on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, which demonstrates enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency in the presence of CO2 due to its ability to reduce vanadium to V4+/V3+ states, facilitating acid site formation. This leads to a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits compared to reactions in the absence of CO2. The use of H2 increases the number of acid sites, while CO2 reduces these sites, impacting the catalyst's selectivity and product distribution. The UVvis studies further highlight the role of CO2 in oxidizing vanadium to V5+, preventing acid site formation and promoting propene production.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料显著影响其在二氧化碳-氧化脱氢反应中的性能。提供的文献关注了一种以二氧化硅为载体的钒氧化物催化剂，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，由于能够将钒还原至V4+/V3+状态，从而促进了酸性位点的形成，这导致了丙烯产量的提高和碳沉积物量的减少，相比于无二氧化碳存在的条件。使用氢气可以增加酸性位点的数量，而二氧化碳则减少了这些位点的数量，影响催化剂的选择性和产品分布。紫外可见研究表明，二氧化碳通过氧化作用将钒氧化至V5+状态，防止酸性位点的形成，并促进丙烯的产生。
