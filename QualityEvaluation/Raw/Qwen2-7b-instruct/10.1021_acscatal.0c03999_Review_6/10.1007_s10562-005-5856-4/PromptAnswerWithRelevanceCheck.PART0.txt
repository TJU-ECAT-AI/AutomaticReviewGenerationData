2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K.
3. NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst.
4. UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. The findings in the document suggest that the vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced within a specific temperature range (723-873 K), and part of the reduced vanadium oxide can be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. The NH3 desorption studies indicate that pre-treating the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 has the opposite effect. UVvis studies reveal that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide behaves as V4+/V3+ ions in the presence of hydrogen or during the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas it becomes V5+ ions during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 due to the oxidizing action of CO2. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能起着关键作用。研究结果表明，催化剂中的钒氧化物可以在特定温度范围内（723-873 K）被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的钒氧化物可以在823 K下通过CO2进行再氧化。NH3脱附研究表明，通过氢对钒氧化物催化剂进行预处理可以增加催化剂上的酸性位点数量，而CO2则具有相反的效果。紫外可见光谱研究表明，在氢存在或在没有CO2的情况下进行脱氢化时，钒氧化物表面的钒表现为V4+/V3+离子，而在有CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢化时，由于CO2的氧化作用，它会变成V5+离子。这些见解为优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统提供了宝贵指导。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The provided literature focuses on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, which demonstrates enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency in the presence of CO2 due to its ability to reduce vanadium to V4+/V3+ states, facilitating acid site formation. This leads to a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits compared to reactions in the absence of CO2. The use of H2 increases the number of acid sites, while CO2 reduces these sites, impacting the catalyst's selectivity and product distribution. The UVvis studies further highlight the role of CO2 in oxidizing vanadium to V5+, preventing acid site formation and promoting propene production.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料显著影响其在二氧化碳-氧化脱氢反应中的性能。提供的文献关注了一种以二氧化硅为载体的钒氧化物催化剂，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，由于能够将钒还原至V4+/V3+状态，从而促进了酸性位点的形成，这导致了丙烯产量的提高和碳沉积物量的减少，相比于无二氧化碳存在的条件。使用氢气可以增加酸性位点的数量，而二氧化碳则减少了这些位点的数量，影响催化剂的选择性和产品分布。紫外可见研究表明，二氧化碳通过氧化作用将钒氧化至V5+状态，防止酸性位点的形成，并促进丙烯的产生。

The reducibility and support materials of vanadium oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reactions. The presence of CO2 inhibits the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher yield of propene and a higher selectivity towards propene compared to reactions conducted in the absence of CO2. Conversely, without CO2, the catalyst exhibits a higher yield of aromatics. The vanadium oxide within the catalyst can be reduced at temperatures between 723 and 873 K, and a portion of this reduced vanadium oxide can be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. Pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduces the number of these acid sites. The vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the presence of CO2 transforms into V5+, preventing the formation of acid sites and resulting in a higher yield of propene and fewer carbonaceous deposits. These findings suggest that optimizing the reducibility and support materials of the vanadium oxide catalyst can enhance its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

范德华氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其性能。CO2的存在抑制了脱氢过程，导致丙烯的更高产率和更高的选择性相比在没有CO2的情况下进行的反应。相反，在没有CO2的情况下，催化剂表现出更高的芳香族化合物产率。催化剂中的范德华氧化物可以在723至873 K之间的温度下被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的范德华氧化物可以在823 K时通过CO2被重新氧化。通过氢预处理增加催化剂上酸性位点的数量，而CO2减少了这些酸性位点的数量。在存在CO2的情况下，催化剂表面的范德华氧化物中的范德华转变为V5+，防止酸性位点的形成，从而导致更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积物。这些发现表明，优化范德华氧化物催化剂的可还原性和支持材料可以提高CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。

The study found that when propane undergoes dehydrogenation over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2, the yield of propene and its selectivity are higher compared to when CO2 is absent. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and their selectivity are much higher in the absence of CO2. The presence of CO2 slightly inhibits the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher yield of propene and a higher selectivity to propene. Pre-treating the catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing the aromatization of propene in the absence of CO2. However, in the presence of CO2, hydrogen pre-treatment hardly alters the yields of aromatics and propene or their selectivities. CO2 seems to reduce the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface. The catalytic properties of vanadium oxide in the silica-supported catalyst are nearly identical to those of bulk V2O5, and acid sites form on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst. Characterizing the vanadium oxide in the presence and absence of CO2 is crucial for understanding the dehydrogenation process.

研究发现，在二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应时，当存在二氧化碳时，丙烯的产率和其选择性高于不存在二氧化碳的情况。相反，当没有二氧化碳时，芳烃的产率和其选择性要高得多。二氧化碳的存在略微抑制了脱氢过程，导致更高的丙烯产率和更高的丙烯选择性。在没有二氧化碳的情况下，通过氢气预处理催化剂可以增加催化剂表面的酸性位点，从而增强丙烯的芳构化。然而，在存在二氧化碳的情况下，氢气预处理几乎不会改变芳烃和丙烯的产率或它们的选择性。二氧化碳似乎减少了催化剂表面的酸性位点数量。二氧化钒在二氧化硅支持的催化剂中的催化性质与纯块状V2O5相似，并且酸性位点在催化剂中形成。在存在和不存在二氧化碳的情况下，表征二氧化钒对于理解脱氢过程是必要的。

The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was studied at 823 K in the presence or absence of CO2. The yield of propene and its selectivity were greater in the presence of CO2 compared to their absence. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and its selectivity were significantly higher in the absence of CO2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced within the temperature range of 723 to 873 K, and part of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K. Pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen led to an increase in the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduced the number of these sites. The vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation without CO2, whereas it became V5+ in the presence of CO2 due to the oxidizing effect of CO2.

在823 K下，通过二氧化硅支持的五氧化二钒催化剂对丙烷进行脱氢反应的研究在二氧化碳的存在或不存在下进行了。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烯的产率和其选择性高于其不存在时的情况。相反，在没有二氧化碳的情况下，芳烃的产率及其选择性要高得多。催化剂中的五氧化二钒可以在723至873 K的温度范围内被还原，并且催化剂中还原的五氧化二钒的一部分可以在823 K下被二氧化碳重新氧化。将五氧化二钒催化剂预处理为氢可以增加催化剂表面的酸性位点数量，而二氧化碳则减少了这些位点的数量。催化剂中表面的五氧化二钒在氢气和无二氧化碳的脱氢过程中是V4+/V3+，而在存在二氧化碳的情况下，由于二氧化碳的氧化作用，它变成了V5+。
