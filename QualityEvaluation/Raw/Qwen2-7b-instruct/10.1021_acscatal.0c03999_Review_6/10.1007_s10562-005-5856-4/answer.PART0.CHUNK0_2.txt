[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2. The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[2] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[3] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[4] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[5] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The reducibility and support materials of vanadium oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reactions. The presence of CO2 inhibits the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher yield of propene and a higher selectivity towards propene compared to reactions conducted in the absence of CO2. Conversely, without CO2, the catalyst exhibits a higher yield of aromatics. The vanadium oxide within the catalyst can be reduced at temperatures between 723 and 873 K, and a portion of this reduced vanadium oxide can be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. Pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with hydrogen increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduces the number of these acid sites. The vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the presence of CO2 transforms into V5+, preventing the formation of acid sites and resulting in a higher yield of propene and fewer carbonaceous deposits. These findings suggest that optimizing the reducibility and support materials of the vanadium oxide catalyst can enhance its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

范德华氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其性能。CO2的存在抑制了脱氢过程，导致丙烯的更高产率和更高的选择性相比在没有CO2的情况下进行的反应。相反，在没有CO2的情况下，催化剂表现出更高的芳香族化合物产率。催化剂中的范德华氧化物可以在723至873 K之间的温度下被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的范德华氧化物可以在823 K时通过CO2被重新氧化。通过氢预处理增加催化剂上酸性位点的数量，而CO2减少了这些酸性位点的数量。在存在CO2的情况下，催化剂表面的范德华氧化物中的范德华转变为V5+，防止酸性位点的形成，从而导致更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积物。这些发现表明，优化范德华氧化物催化剂的可还原性和支持材料可以提高CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。
