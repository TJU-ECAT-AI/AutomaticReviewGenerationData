[1] "The strong interaction of propane with Rh was noticed above 273 K. By means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, π-bonded propylene, di-σ-bonded propylene, and propylidyne have been identified."
[2] "Propane underwent dehydrogenation and cracking on supported Rh at 824923 K. Propylene formed with a selectivity of 5060%."
[3] "The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from the Rh onto the support."
[4] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that the CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."
[5] "Over Rh/TiO2 we found only a small amount of carbon,which reacted with H2 above 800 K."
[6] "The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reaction pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into prominence."
[7] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalyst, as well as the reaction orders, we come to the conclusion that CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."

(i) Propane interacts with Rh catalysts above 273 K, forming π-bonded propylene, di-σ-bonded propylene, and propylidyne through dehydrogenation and cracking at temperatures between 824K to 923K. The selectivity of propylene formation ranges from 50% to 60%.

(ii) Carbon deposition occurs on Rh catalysts, being significantly higher than the surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from Rh onto the support.

(iii) CO2 influences the reaction pathway of propane, shifting the formation of H2 and CO from dehydrogenation and cracking. 

(iv) The CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane based on the reaction rates of propane and CO2 decomposition on Rh catalysts.

(v) Over Rh/TiO2 catalysts, only a small amount of carbon forms, reacting with hydrogen above 800K.

(vi) In the presence of CO2, the formation of H2 and CO becomes prominent over Rh catalysts, changing the reaction pathway of propane compared to dehydrogenation and cracking.

(vii) Considering the reaction rates of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, CO2 is concluded to play a role in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane.

(i) 在273K以上，丙烷与铑催化剂相互作用，形成π-键丙烯、di-σ-键丙烯和丙基炔，通过脱氢化和裂解在824K至923K之间发生。丙烯的生成选择性范围为50％至60％。

(ii) 在铑催化剂上，碳沉积比表面铑原子高一个数量级，这表明它从铑扩散到支撑物上。

(iii) 二氧化碳改变了丙烷的反应途径，将氢气和二氧化碳的形成从脱氢化和裂解转移到显眼位置。

(iv) 根据丙烷和二氧化碳在铑催化剂上的分解速率，二氧化碳参与了丙烷干重整的决定性步骤。

(v) 在铑/二氧化钛催化剂上，仅形成少量碳，高于800K时与氢反应。

(vi) 在二氧化碳的存在下，氢气和二氧化碳的形成成为突出特征，改变了丙烷的反应途径，相对于脱氢化和裂解。

(vii) 考虑丙烷和二氧化碳在铑催化剂上的反应速率，二氧化碳被确定为参与丙烷干重整的决定性步骤。
