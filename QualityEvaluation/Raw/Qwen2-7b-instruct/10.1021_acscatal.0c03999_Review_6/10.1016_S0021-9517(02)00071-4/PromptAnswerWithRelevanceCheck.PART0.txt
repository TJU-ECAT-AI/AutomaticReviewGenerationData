[1] "The strong interaction of propane with Rh was noticed above 273 K. By means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, π-bonded propylene, di-σ-bonded propylene, and propylidyne have been identified."
[2] "Propane underwent dehydrogenation and cracking on supported Rh at 824923 K. Propylene formed with a selectivity of 5060%."
[3] "The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from the Rh onto the support."
[4] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that the CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."
[5] "Over Rh/TiO2 we found only a small amount of carbon,which reacted with H2 above 800 K."
[6] "The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reaction pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into prominence."
[7] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalyst, as well as the reaction orders, we come to the conclusion that CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."

(iv) The CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane based on the reaction rates of propane and CO2 decomposition on Rh catalysts.

(v) Over Rh/TiO2 catalysts, only a small amount of carbon forms, reacting with hydrogen above 800K.

(vi) In the presence of CO2, the formation of H2 and CO becomes prominent over Rh catalysts, changing the reaction pathway of propane compared to dehydrogenation and cracking.

3. The amount of carbon formed is significantly higher than the surface Rh atoms, indicating its diffusion from Rh onto the support. 
4. Rh/TiO2 catalysts exhibit the highest specific rates for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide, attributed to the enhanced dissociation of carbon dioxide due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2.
