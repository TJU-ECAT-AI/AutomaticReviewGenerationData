[1] "The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reaction pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into prominence."

[4] "Propylene formed with a selectivity of 5060%."
[5] "The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from the Rh onto the support."
[6] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that the CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."
[7] "The highest specific rates for the production of H2 and CO were measured for Rh/TiO2; this was explained by the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2."

(i) The strong interaction of propane with Rh was observed above 273 K, leading to its dehydrogenation and cracking at temperatures ranging from 824 to 923 K, with propylene being the major product formed with a selectivity of 50-60%. Carbon deposition was noted to be more than an order of magnitude higher than the surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from Rh onto the support.

(ii) In the presence of CO2, the reaction pathway of propane was altered, with the formation of H2 and CO becoming prominent, indicating the involvement of CO2 in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane.

(iii) Rh/TiO2 catalysts showed the highest specific rates for producing H2 and CO, attributed to the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

(i) 在273 K以上，丙烷与铑的强烈相互作用被注意到，导致在824至923 K的温度范围内进行脱氢和裂解，主要产物是丙烯，其选择性为50-60%。碳沉积比表面铑原子高一个数量级，表明它从铑扩散到支持物上。

(ii) 在二氧化碳的存在下，丙烷的反应途径发生变化，形成了氢气和一氧化碳，表明二氧化碳参与了丙烷干重整的速率决定步骤。

(iii) 硒/二氧化钛催化剂显示出生产氢气和一氧化碳的最高特定速率，归因于硒和二氧化钛之间的电子相互作用导致二氧化碳的扩展解离，提高了催化效率。
