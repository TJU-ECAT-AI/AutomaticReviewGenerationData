[1] "The strong interaction of propane with Rh was noticed above 273 K."
[2] "By means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, π-bonded propylene, di-σ-bonded propylene, and propylidyne have been identified."
[3] "Propane underwent dehydrogenation and cracking on supported Rh at 824923 K."
[4] "Propylene formed with a selectivity of 5060%."
[5] "The deposition of carbonaceous species was also observed, the hydrogenation of which occurred only above 700750 K."
[6] "The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms."
[7] "The presence of CO2 basically altered the reaction pathway of propane, and the formation of H2 and CO with a ratio of 0.420.59 came into prominence."
[8] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that the CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."
[9] "The highest specific rates for the production of H2 and CO were measured for Rh/TiO2; this was explained by the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2."

(i) Propane interacts with Rh catalysts to produce propylene and propylidyne at temperatures above 273 K.
(ii) The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurs with selectivities of 50-60% on Rh catalysts.
(iii) Carbon deposits form on Rh catalysts, which can only be hydrogenated above 700-750 K.
(iv) The presence of CO2 significantly changes the reaction pathway of propane, leading to the formation of H2 and CO in a ratio of 0.42-0.59.
(v) The CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane.
(vi) Rh/TiO2 catalysts show the highest specific rates for producing H2 and CO, attributed to the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2.

(i) 丙烷与铑催化剂在高于273 K的温度下相互作用，产生丙烯和丙基二烯。
(ii) 在铑催化剂上，丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯的转化率在50-60%之间。
(iii) 在铑催化剂上形成碳沉积物，只能在700-750 K以上的温度下进行氢化。
(iv) CO2的存在显著改变了丙烷的反应途径，导致生成H2和CO的比例为0.42-0.59。
(v) CO2参与了丙烷干重整的速率决定步骤。
(vi) 铑/二氧化钛催化剂表现出生成H2和CO的最大特定速率，归因于铑与二氧化钛之间的电子相互作用导致CO2的扩展分解。
