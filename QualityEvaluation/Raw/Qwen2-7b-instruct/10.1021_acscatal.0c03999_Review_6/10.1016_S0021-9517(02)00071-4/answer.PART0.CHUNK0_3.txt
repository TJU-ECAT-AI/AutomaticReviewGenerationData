(i) "Propane interacted with supported Rh to give propylene and propylidyene even at 253300 K."
(ii) "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurred with selectivities of 4055% over supported Rh catalysts."
(iii) "In the presence of CO2 the reaction pathway of propane is changed, and the formation of CO and H2 came into prominence."
(iv) "It was shown that propylene, the product of the dehydrogenation of propane, reacted rapidly with CO2 to give CO and H2."

(i) Supported Rh catalysts allow for the interaction of propane to yield propylene and propylidyne even at temperatures as low as 253 to 300 K.
(ii) The selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurs on supported Rh catalysts with a selectivity of 40% to 55%.
(iii) The presence of CO2 alters the reaction pathway of propane, leading to the prominent formation of CO and H2.
(iv) Propylene, the product of propane's dehydrogenation, reacts swiftly with CO2 to produce CO and H2.
