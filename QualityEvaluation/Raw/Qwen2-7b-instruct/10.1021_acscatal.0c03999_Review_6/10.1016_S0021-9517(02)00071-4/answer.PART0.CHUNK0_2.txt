[1] "The strong interaction of propane with Rh was noticed above 273 K."
[2] "Propane underwent dehydrogenation and cracking on supported Rh at 824923 K."
[3] "The other major products were ethylene and methane."
[4] "The deposition of carbonaceous species was also observed, the hydrogenation of which occurred only above 700750 K, with a peak temperature of 900 950 K."
[5] "The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from the Rh onto the support."
[6] "The highest specific rates for the production of H2 and CO were measured for Rh/TiO2; this was explained by the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2."
[7] "The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reaction pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into prominence."
[8] "The formation of C6 compounds on some supported Rh catalysts also took place. Accordingly, under the present experimental conditions, the reductive coupling of C3H7 into C6 compounds also occurred."
[9] "Taking into account the rates of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that CO2 is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane."

1. The interaction of propane with Rh is strong above 273 K, leading to dehydrogenation and cracking at temperatures ranging from 824 to 923 K. Major products include propylene, ethylene, and methane. 
2. Carbon deposition occurs during the reaction, which can only be hydrogenated above 700 to 750 K, reaching a peak temperature of 900 to 950 K. 
3. The amount of carbon formed is significantly higher than the surface Rh atoms, indicating its diffusion from Rh onto the support. 
4. Rh/TiO2 catalysts exhibit the highest specific rates for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide, attributed to the enhanced dissociation of carbon dioxide due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2.
5. The presence of CO2 alters the reaction pathway of propane, emphasizing the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide over dehydrogenation and cracking.
6. The reductive coupling of C3H7 into C6 compounds takes place under current experimental conditions, contributing to the formation of complex hydrocarbons.
7. The reaction order and the rate of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts indicate that CO2 plays a critical role in determining the rate of the dry reforming of propane.

1. 在273 K以上，丙烷与铑的相互作用很强，导致在824至923 K的温度下发生脱氢和裂解。主要产物包括丙烯、乙烯和甲烷。
2. 在反应中观察到碳沉积，其氢化只能在700至750 K以上的温度下进行，达到900至950 K的峰值温度。
3. 形成的碳量远高于表面铑原子的数量，表明它从铑扩散到支持物上。
4. 铑/二氧化钛催化剂表现出生产氢气和一氧化碳的最高特定速率，这是由于铑和二氧化钛之间的电子相互作用导致二氧化碳的扩展分解所致。
5. 二氧化碳的存在改变了丙烷的反应途径，优先形成氢气和一氧化碳而不是脱氢和裂解。
6. 当前实验条件下，通过重新耦合C3H7产生C6化合物，形成复杂烃类。
7. 根据反应顺序和丙烷及二氧化碳在铑催化剂上的分解速率，二氧化碳参与了干重整丙烷的速率决定步骤。
