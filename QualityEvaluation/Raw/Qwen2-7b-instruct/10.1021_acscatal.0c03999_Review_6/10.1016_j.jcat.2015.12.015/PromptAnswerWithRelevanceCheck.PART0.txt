[2] "The catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide."

[3] "XRD shows no significant diffractions attributed to bulk V2O5 for any sample, although the presence of crystalline clusters, smaller than 3 nm, cannot be excluded based on XRD."

[4] "When the loading of tungsten oxide increases, two distinct diffraction lines arise at 2h = 24 and 2h = 34 which is a strong indication that crystalline monoclinic WO3 was formed."

[5] "The catalysts contain approximately the same amount of vanadium (ca. 3.5 wt. % V) and are denoted based on their weight percentage of tungsten as 0WV (0 wt.% W), 1.5WV (1.5 wt.% W), 4.5WV (4.5 wt.% W),and 6.8WV (6.8 wt.% W)."

[6] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."

[7] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state. Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."

[8] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."

[9] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane,while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

[10] "Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

[11] "The rate-determining step of both direct (ODH) and consecutive (DH + RWGS) pathways is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of tungsten oxide (WOx) in the catalysts plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane. It helps to hinder the clustering of vanadium oxide (VOx) species during the reaction, thereby preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen. This reduces the likelihood of carbon dioxide (CO2) formation and total oxidation of propane. 

Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts as an oxidant in the reaction, but it cannot fully re-oxidize the catalyst to its original V2O5 state. Instead, it can only oxidize the catalyst to V2O4. This results in a higher selectivity towards propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation.

Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary carbon-hydrogen (CAH) bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.

在催化剂中，钨氧化物（WOx）的存在对丙烷脱氢起着关键作用。它有助于防止VOx物种的聚集，从而阻止非选择性氧的形成。这减少了二氧化碳（CO2）的形成和丙烷的完全氧化的可能性。

二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂参与反应，但不能完全将催化剂氧化回其原始的V2O5状态。相反，它可以将催化剂氧化为V2O4。这导致了丙烯选择性更高且碳生成减少的结果。

基于密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，当存在二氧化碳时，丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢后跟随逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应进行。丙烷上二级碳-氢（CAH）键的活化被确定为两个途径中的决定性步骤。

Marin b a Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Center for Ordered Materials, Organometallics and Catalysis (COMOC), Ghent University, Krijgslaan 281-S3, 9000 Ghent, Belgium b Laboratory for Chemical Technology, Ghent University, Technologiepark 914, 9052 Ghent, Belgium c Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ghent University, Technologiepark 903, 9052 Ghent, Belgium a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 5 November 2015 Revised 18 December 2015 Accepted 19 December 2015 Keywords: Propylene Oxidative dehydrogenation Reverse water gas shift Supported metal oxides
CO2 Reaction mechanism DFT a b s t r a c t A series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica, with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6, are examined for propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2 from 500 C to 600 C and at atmospheric pressure. Catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction.
CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene. When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reac- tion follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon. A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed. This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster.
The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selec- tivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6. In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127  11 kJ/mol to 147  12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6. 2015 Elsevier Inc.
