[1] "The catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide."
[2] "The presence of multiple peaks is attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3 through the intermediate formation of oxide species with different oxidation states."
[3] "The amount of hydrogen produced by all promoted WOx catalysts was less than the amount of propylene produced during the initial 90 s of the experiments."
[4] "Clearly, CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 during oxidative dehydrogenation via a redox mechanism."
[5] "Interestingly enough, the oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process."
[6] "Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

1. The catalysts vary primarily in the amount of tungsten oxide they contain, despite having a similar loading of vanadium.
2. The reduction process of vanadium pentoxide involves the formation of multiple oxide species with varying oxidation states.
3. In the initial phase of the experiment, the amount of hydrogen generated was less than that of propylene for all tungsten-promoted catalysts.
4. Carbon monoxide and water are produced from carbon dioxide and propane through a redox process during oxidative dehydrogenation.
5. Oxygen abstraction from carbon dioxide in the process regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site spontaneously.
6. Based on the largest energy barrier across the studied catalytic cycles, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift reaction.
