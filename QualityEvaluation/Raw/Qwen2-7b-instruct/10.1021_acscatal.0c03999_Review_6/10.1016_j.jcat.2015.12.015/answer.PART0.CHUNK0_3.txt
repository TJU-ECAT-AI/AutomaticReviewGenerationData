1. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and plays a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. When the reaction uses D2, C3H8, and CO2 in a 1:1:1 ratio, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O.
3. A partially reduced vanadia dimer represents the active site for the reaction, and DFT calculations were carried out.
4. At 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in the reaction, as indicated by the DFT calculations.
5. The catalyst with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency, but higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6.
6. The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were determined through Arrhenius plot analysis, which was based on experiments conducted between 500 C and 600 C.

1.CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，并参与丙烷的氧化脱氢反应生成丙烯。
2. 当使用D2、C3H8和CO2以1:1:1的比例作为反应物时，生成的水中只有45%含有D2O。
3. 部分还原的钒二聚体被用作活性位点的代表，并进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。
4. 在600℃下，丙烷上二级CAH键的活化是反应的限速步骤，这是由DFT计算得出的。
5. W/V比为0.1 M的催化剂具有最高的C3H6平均周转频率，但W/V比为0.6的催化剂显示出更高的选择性。
6. 通过Arrhenius图分析确定了催化剂的表观活化能，该分析基于在500℃到600℃之间的实验数据。
