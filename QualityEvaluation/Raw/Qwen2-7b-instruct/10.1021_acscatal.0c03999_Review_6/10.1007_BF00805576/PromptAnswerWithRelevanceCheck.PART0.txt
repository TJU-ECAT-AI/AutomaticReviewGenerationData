The document discusses the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidizing conditions. Unsupported Mo2C shows very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support enhances its catalytic activity but does not change the products of the reaction. On partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, a dramatic change in the product formation occurs, with benzene being produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Carburization of MoO3 on ZSM-5 leads to a very active catalyst with a steady-state methane conversion of 5-6% and a benzene selectivity of 85%. The document also mentions that the reaction starts with the highest rate on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst and that the conversion of methane on MOEC mixed with ZSM-5 is as high as measured for MoO3/ZSM-5.

文档讨论了在非氧化条件下Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂对甲烷的转化。在973K时，孤立的Mo2C显示出非常低的甲烷分解活性。将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合可以增强其催化活性，但不会改变反应产物。在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，产品形成发生了显著变化，苯以70%-80%的选择性在5%-7%的转化率下产生。将MoO3碳化到ZSM-5中导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，其稳定的甲烷转化率为5%-6%，苯选择性为85%。文档还提到，在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，反应以最高速率开始，并且在Mo2C与ZSM-5混合的催化剂上甲烷的转化率与MoO3/ZSM-5相同。

The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts affects their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by determining their ability to reduce CO2 into hydrocarbons and other products. Fe oxides that are more easily reduced typically exhibit higher activity in this process. The support materials, such as zeolites, can influence the dispersion of the active metal, affecting the reaction pathways and product yields. By optimizing the reducibility and support, one can enhance the efficiency of CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals, such as hydrocarbons. This understanding helps in designing better catalysts that can efficiently convert CO2 into useful products with high selectivity and yield.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能产生影响，决定了它们将CO2还原为烃类和其他产物的能力。更容易还原的Fe氧化物通常在这一过程中表现出更高的活性。支撑材料，如沸石，可以影响活性金属的分散度，从而影响反应路径和产物产率。通过优化还原性和支撑材料，可以增强CO2向有价值化学品的转化效率，例如生成高选择性和产率的烃类。这种理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂，能够有效地将CO2转化为有用的产物。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. This study demonstrates that under non-oxidizing conditions, unsupported Mo2C shows minimal activity in methane decomposition, primarily yielding hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane. Incorporating ZSM-5 as a support slightly boosts the catalytic activity but does not alter the reaction pathway. Notably, partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit a substantial shift in product formation, with the capability to produce benzene with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Moreover, the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 results in an exceptionally active catalyst, capable of converting methane at a steady state of 5-6% with an 85% selectivity for benzene formation. These findings underscore the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials in optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

Fe氧化基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。研究表明，在非氧化条件下，未支持的Mo2C显示出对甲烷分解的极低活性，主要途径是甲烷分解产生氢气、碳和少量乙烷。将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合略微提高了催化活性，但没有改变反应产物。值得注意的是，部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂的产品形成发生了显著变化，能够以70-80%的选择性生产苯，转化率为5-7%。此外，高度分散的MoO3在ZSM-5上的碳化导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，能够在稳定状态下以5-6%的转化率实现85%的苯选择性生成。这些发现强调了催化剂可还原性和支撑材料在优化CO2-ODHP过程中的催化系统的必要性。

The document discusses the catalytic conversion of methane to benzene using various catalysts, such as unsupported and supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), molybdenum oxide supported on ZSM-5 (MoO3/ZSM-5), and partially oxidized Mo2C. The studies show that unsupported Mo2C exhibits very limited activity in methane decomposition, with the main reaction pathway being the decomposition of methane to hydrogen and carbon, accompanied by a minor amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support enhances its catalytic activity slightly but does not change the product distribution. In contrast, partially oxidized Mo2C leads to a significant change in product formation, with benzene being produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. The carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also results in an active catalyst, enabling the conversion of methane at the steady state of 5-6% with an 85% selectivity for benzene formation. The document highlights the importance of the reducibility and support materials in determining the catalytic performance of Mo2C and MoO3-based catalysts in methane conversion processes.

文档讨论了在不同催化剂上，如未经支持的钼碳化物（Mo2C）、钼氧化物负载于ZSM-5（MoO3/ZSM-5）以及部分氧化的Mo2C，对甲烷进行催化转化以生成苯的研究。研究表明，未经支持的Mo2C在甲烷分解过程中的活性非常有限，主要反应路径是甲烷分解为氢气和碳，伴有少量乙烷的生成。将Mo2C与ZSM-5支持混合可以稍微增强其催化活性，但不会改变产物分布。相比之下，部分氧化的Mo2C导致了产品形成的重要变化，苯的生成选择性在5-7%的转化率下达到70-80%。高度分散的钼氧化物在ZSM-5上的碳化也产生了一种活性催化剂，使甲烷在稳态下被转化为5-6%，苯的生成选择性为85%。文档强调了可还原性和支撑材料在确定Mo2C和MoO3基催化剂在甲烷转化过程中的催化性能方面的重要性。
