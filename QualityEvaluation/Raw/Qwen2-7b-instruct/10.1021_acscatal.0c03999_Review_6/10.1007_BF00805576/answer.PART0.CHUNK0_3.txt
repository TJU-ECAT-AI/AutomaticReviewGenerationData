The research investigates the activation and dehydrogenation of methane on Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidizing conditions. Unsupported Mo2C shows minimal activity in methane decomposition at 973 K. Incorporating ZSM-5 into Mo2C slightly boosts its catalytic efficiency without altering the products. On partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5, there's a significant shift in product formation, producing benzene with a selectivity of 70-80% at a 5-7% conversion rate. Carburizing highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 results in a highly active catalyst, achieving a 5-6% methane conversion rate and an 85% benzene selectivity.

研究在非氧化条件下探讨了Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂对甲烷的活化和脱氢作用。未支持的Mo2C在973 K时表现出微弱的甲烷分解活性。将ZSM-5与Mo2C混合可以略微提高其催化效率，但不会改变产物。在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5上，产品形成发生了显著变化，产生了苯，选择性为70-80%，转化率为5-7%。将高度分散的MoO3碳化到ZSM-5上导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，实现了5-6%的甲烷转换率和85%的苯选择性。
