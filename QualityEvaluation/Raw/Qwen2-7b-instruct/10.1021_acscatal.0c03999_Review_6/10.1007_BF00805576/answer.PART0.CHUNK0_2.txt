[1] "The activation and dehydrogenation of CH4 on Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 have been investigated under non-oxidizing condi- tions."
[2] "Unsupported Mo2C exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K. The main reaction pathway was the decomposition of methane to give hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane."
[3] "Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhanced its catalytic activity, but did not change the products of the reaction."
[4] "A dramatic change in the product forma- tion occurred on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons benzene was produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%."
[5] "Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also led to a very active catalyst: the conver- sion of methane at the steady state was 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation was 85%."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. This study demonstrates that under non-oxidizing conditions, unsupported Mo2C shows minimal activity in methane decomposition, primarily yielding hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane. Incorporating ZSM-5 as a support slightly boosts the catalytic activity but does not alter the reaction pathway. Notably, partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit a substantial shift in product formation, with the capability to produce benzene with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Moreover, the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 results in an exceptionally active catalyst, capable of converting methane at a steady state of 5-6% with an 85% selectivity for benzene formation. These findings underscore the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials in optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

Fe氧化基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。研究表明，在非氧化条件下，未支持的Mo2C显示出对甲烷分解的极低活性，主要途径是甲烷分解产生氢气、碳和少量乙烷。将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合略微提高了催化活性，但没有改变反应产物。值得注意的是，部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂的产品形成发生了显著变化，能够以70-80%的选择性生产苯，转化率为5-7%。此外，高度分散的MoO3在ZSM-5上的碳化导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，能够在稳定状态下以5-6%的转化率实现85%的苯选择性生成。这些发现强调了催化剂可还原性和支撑材料在优化CO2-ODHP过程中的催化系统的必要性。
