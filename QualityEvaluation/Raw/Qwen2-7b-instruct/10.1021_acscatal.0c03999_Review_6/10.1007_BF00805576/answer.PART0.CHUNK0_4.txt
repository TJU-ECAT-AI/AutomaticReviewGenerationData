The document discusses the catalytic conversion of methane to benzene using various catalysts, such as unsupported and supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), molybdenum oxide supported on ZSM-5 (MoO3/ZSM-5), and partially oxidized Mo2C. The studies show that unsupported Mo2C exhibits very limited activity in methane decomposition, with the main reaction pathway being the decomposition of methane to hydrogen and carbon, accompanied by a minor amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support enhances its catalytic activity slightly but does not change the product distribution. In contrast, partially oxidized Mo2C leads to a significant change in product formation, with benzene being produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. The carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also results in an active catalyst, enabling the conversion of methane at the steady state of 5-6% with an 85% selectivity for benzene formation. The document highlights the importance of the reducibility and support materials in determining the catalytic performance of Mo2C and MoO3-based catalysts in methane conversion processes.

文档讨论了在不同催化剂上，如未经支持的钼碳化物（Mo2C）、钼氧化物负载于ZSM-5（MoO3/ZSM-5）以及部分氧化的Mo2C，对甲烷进行催化转化以生成苯的研究。研究表明，未经支持的Mo2C在甲烷分解过程中的活性非常有限，主要反应路径是甲烷分解为氢气和碳，伴有少量乙烷的生成。将Mo2C与ZSM-5支持混合可以稍微增强其催化活性，但不会改变产物分布。相比之下，部分氧化的Mo2C导致了产品形成的重要变化，苯的生成选择性在5-7%的转化率下达到70-80%。高度分散的钼氧化物在ZSM-5上的碳化也产生了一种活性催化剂，使甲烷在稳态下被转化为5-6%，苯的生成选择性为85%。文档强调了可还原性和支撑材料在确定Mo2C和MoO3基催化剂在甲烷转化过程中的催化性能方面的重要性。
