The document discusses the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidizing conditions. Unsupported Mo2C shows very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support enhances its catalytic activity but does not change the products of the reaction. On partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, a dramatic change in the product formation occurs, with benzene being produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Carburization of MoO3 on ZSM-5 leads to a very active catalyst with a steady-state methane conversion of 5-6% and a benzene selectivity of 85%. The document also mentions that the reaction starts with the highest rate on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst and that the conversion of methane on MOEC mixed with ZSM-5 is as high as measured for MoO3/ZSM-5.

文档讨论了在非氧化条件下Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂对甲烷的转化。在973K时，孤立的Mo2C显示出非常低的甲烷分解活性。将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合可以增强其催化活性，但不会改变反应产物。在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，产品形成发生了显著变化，苯以70%-80%的选择性在5%-7%的转化率下产生。将MoO3碳化到ZSM-5中导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，其稳定的甲烷转化率为5%-6%，苯选择性为85%。文档还提到，在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，反应以最高速率开始，并且在Mo2C与ZSM-5混合的催化剂上甲烷的转化率与MoO3/ZSM-5相同。
