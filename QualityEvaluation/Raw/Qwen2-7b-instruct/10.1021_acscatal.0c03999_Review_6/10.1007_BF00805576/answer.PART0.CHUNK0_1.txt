[1] "In the case of supported Pt metal catalysts the dehydrogenation of methane occurred readily yielding a small amount of ethane in addition to the main products, H2 and surface carbon [ 1-9]."
[2] "The main reaction pathway was the decomposition of methane to give hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane."
[3] "Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhanced its catalytic activity, but did not change the products of the reaction."
[4] "A dramatic change in the product formation occurred on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons benzene was produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%."
[5] "Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also led to a very active catalyst: the conversion of methane at the steady state was 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation was 85%."

The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts affects their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by determining their ability to reduce CO2 into hydrocarbons and other products. Fe oxides that are more easily reduced typically exhibit higher activity in this process. The support materials, such as zeolites, can influence the dispersion of the active metal, affecting the reaction pathways and product yields. By optimizing the reducibility and support, one can enhance the efficiency of CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals, such as hydrocarbons. This understanding helps in designing better catalysts that can efficiently convert CO2 into useful products with high selectivity and yield.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能产生影响，决定了它们将CO2还原为烃类和其他产物的能力。更容易还原的Fe氧化物通常在这一过程中表现出更高的活性。支撑材料，如沸石，可以影响活性金属的分散度，从而影响反应路径和产物产率。通过优化还原性和支撑材料，可以增强CO2向有价值化学品的转化效率，例如生成高选择性和产率的烃类。这种理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂，能够有效地将CO2转化为有用的产物。
