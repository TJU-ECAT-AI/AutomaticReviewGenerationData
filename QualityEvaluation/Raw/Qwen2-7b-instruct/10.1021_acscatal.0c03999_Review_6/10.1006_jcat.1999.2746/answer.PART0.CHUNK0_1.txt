The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a crucial role in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The findings suggest that the ability of zirconia to be reduced and then re-oxidized under mild conditions is surprising, indicating a more dynamic interaction than initially thought. This has implications for understanding the reaction mechanism and optimizing catalytic systems for this process. The efficiency of O2 in comparison to CO2 is noted, with the pulse reactor data highlighting the significant extent of re-oxidation by CO2. This insight contributes to the ongoing research and development of more effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
