[1] "Clearly, O2 is more efficient than CO2; still, the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of re-oxidation by CO2 is significant."
[2] "The observation that zirconia can be reduced and re-oxidized under the relatively mild conditions used in this study is surprising."
[3] "Also, the fact that zirconia-supported metals are active for reactions like CO2 reforming, while silica- and alumina-supported metals are not, strongly suggests that zirconia plays more than a simple, passive role in the reaction."
[4] "While it is possible that this role is simply to po- larize molecules adsorbed at the metalzirconia interface, the simplicity of the redox mechanism, along with the fact that both the oxidation and reduction steps are observed directly in the pulse measurements, strongly argues for the redox mechanism."
[5] "While we have not definitively proven that the reduced Pd/ceria can adsorb CO2 and release it upon re-oxidation, the concept is reminiscent of what is observed with sulfur."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play significant roles in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Zirconia's ability to be reduced and re-oxidized under mild conditions, which contrasts with silica and alumina, indicates its active participation beyond a passive role. This finding supports the redox mechanism in the reaction, as evidenced by direct observations in pulse measurements. The ability of reduced Pd/ceria to adsorb CO2 and release it upon re-oxidation shares similarities with sulfur's behavior, suggesting a potential correlation between adsorption abilities and tolerance towards pollutants. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的性能表现出了显著的影响。锆的可还原和再氧化能力，在温和条件下进行，与二氧化硅和氧化铝的对比下，表明它在反应中扮演着超过被动角色的作用。这些发现支持了反应的氧化还原机制，因为直接在脉冲测量中观察到了氧化和还原步骤。减少的Pd/ceria吸附二氧化碳并在再氧化时释放的能力与硫的行为相似，这暗示了吸附能力和对污染物的耐受性之间可能存在关联。这些见解为优化CO2-ODHP过程中的催化系统提供了宝贵的指导。
