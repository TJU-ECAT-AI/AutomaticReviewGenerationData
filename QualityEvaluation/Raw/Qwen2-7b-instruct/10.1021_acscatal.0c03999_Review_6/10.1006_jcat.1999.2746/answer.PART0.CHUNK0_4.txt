[3] "The observation that zirconia can be reduced and reoxidized under the relatively mild conditions used in this study is surprising."
[4] "While it is possible that this role is simply to polarize molecules adsorbed at the metalzirconia interface, the simplicity of the redox mechanism, along with the fact that both the oxidation and reduction steps are observed directly in the pulse measurements, strongly argues for the redox mechanism."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Zirconia's ability to be reduced and reoxidized under mild conditions suggests it plays a more active role than a passive one. The redox mechanism, where both the oxidation and reduction steps are directly observed in pulse measurements, indicates a strong involvement of redox processes. This insight implies that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions might benefit from considering catalysts that allow reversible redox reactions, particularly on supports that can undergo reduction and reoxidation.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中对其性能有显著影响。锆的可还原和可再氧化能力表明，它在反应中扮演着比被动角色更积极的角色。直接在脉冲测量中观察到的氧化和还原步骤表明，还原机制起着重要作用。这暗示，优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化系统可能从考虑允许可逆还原反应的催化剂及其支持体的角度受益，特别是那些可以被还原和再氧化的支持体。
