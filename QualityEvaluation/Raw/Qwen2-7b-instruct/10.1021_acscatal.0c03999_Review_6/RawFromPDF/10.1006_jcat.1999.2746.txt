The oxidation and reduction of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia cata-
lysts were investigated using pulse-reactor studies in which prod-
ucts were monitored following step changes in the reactant compo-
sition. The results demonstrate that both ceria and zirconia can be
partially reduced by CO and partially reoxidized by CO2. Steady-
state rates for methane reforming by CO2 were also measured
on Pd/ceria, Pd/zirconia, and Pd/silica. The Pd/ceria catalyst was
slightly more active than Pd/zirconia and ∼104 times as active as
Pd/silica. The high activities of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia are ex-
plained as resulting from oxidation and reduction of the supports.

INTRODUCTION
Ceria plays a crucial role in three-way, emissions-control
catalysts by providing oxygen storage capacity (OSC). OSC
is important for controlling the oxygen stoichiometry in the
exhaust since the simultaneous oxidation of CO and hydro-
carbons and reduction of NOx can only be accomplished
over a very narrow range of reactant compositions (1–6). It
is generally agreed that reduction of ceria does not occur
via release of oxygen directly to the gas phase but rather
through reaction of a reductant (CO, H2, or a hydrocarbon)
over a precious-metal catalyst in contact with the ceria
(7, 8). It is not known whether this reduction process oc-
curs at the metal–ceria interface or exclusively on the metal
after it has been oxidized by ceria.
Two interesting observations have recently been added
to this picture. First, the concept that oxygen from ceria
can be used to oxidize species adsorbed on a metal which
is supported on ceria has been used successfully to explain
several reactions which are observed on these catalysts, in-
cluding a second ceria-mediated process for CO oxidation

(9), water–gas shift (10), and steam reforming (11). The
mechanistic picture for each of these reactions is similar to
that for the steam-reforming reaction, shown below (11):
CH4 + σ = CHx,ads + (4 −x)Hads,
[1]
H2O + Ce2O3 = 2CeO2 + H2,
[2]
2Had = H2 + σ,
[3a]
CHx,ads + 2CeO2 = CO + x/2H2 + Ce2O3 + σ.
[3b]
In this mechanism, σ represents an adsorption site on the
metal. The key step is reaction [3b], which involves reduc-
tion of the ceria. This mechanism suggests that water should
be treated as an oxidant (reaction [2]) and that the oxida-
tion state of ceria will depend on the partial pressure of
water.
Second, the redox properties of ceria are structure sen-
sitive (7, 12–14). In measurements performed on model
catalysts formed by vapor deposition of catalytic metals
onto ceria ﬁlms heated to different temperatures, it was
found that oxygen from the ceria could not be utilized by
reductants on the metal if the ceria had previously been
calcined to high temperatures (7, 12). SEM and XRD stud-
ies showed that the primary effect of annealing the ceria at
high temperature was to increase the particle size. Further-
more, ultra-high vacuum TPD studies of O2 from ceria ﬁlms
showed that the active form of oxygen in ceria desorbs at
lower temperatures, between 800 and 1100 K, compared to
that found for O2 desorption from inactive forms of ceria,
where desorption occurs above 1300 K (13, 14) as would be
expected based on bulk thermodynamics. The amount of
oxygen which desorbs at the lower temperatures correlates
with catalytic activity. These observations suggest that the
active form of oxygen is more loosely bound in the ceria
and that bulk thermodynamic data may not be applicable
for predicting redox properties for reactants on ceria.
These results suggest that the presence of H2O in the au-
tomotive exhaust stream may inﬂuence the oxidation state
of ceria under operating conditions. One might expect CO2
to have a similar effect. Indeed, even thermodynamic data

for bulk compounds indicate that the following reaction,
Ce2O3 + CO2 →2CeO2 + CO,
[4]
is favorable at 298 K, since 1G◦is −85.8 kJ/mol and 1H◦is
−96.8 kJ/mol. To investigate this possibility, we examined
the redox properties of Pd/ceria catalysts using CO2 as the
oxidant. From reaction [4] and by analogy to the proposed
mechanism for steam reforming, we anticipated that CO2
could oxidize a reduced, Pd/ceria catalyst and that Pd/ceria
would be a good catalyst for CO2 reforming of methane.
Using both transient and steady-state rate measurements,
we will demonstrate that this is indeed the case.
EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES
Steady-state rates for CO2 reforming of methane were
measured by placing 100-mg catalyst samples into a 1
4-inch
quartz, tubular reactor which has been described in pre-
vious publications (11). The total pressure in the reactor
was maintained at one atmosphere, but the partial pres-
sures of CH4, CO2, and He could be controlled by the ﬂow
rates to the reactor. In this study, the partial pressures of
CO2 and CH4 were each held at 15 Torr. Differential con-
versions were maintained for all measurements. Product
analysis (CO2, CO, and CH4) was performed with an on-
line Hewlett-Packard 5730A gas chromatograph equipped
with a methanator and FID detector. All rates have been
normalized to the weight of the catalyst.
The transient pulse experiments were performed on a
system for which the product gases could be analyzed by
an on-line quadrupole mass spectrometer. Reactant gases
were passed over a 100-mg sample in a 1
4-inch quartz tube.
Computer-controlled switching valves allowed the compo-
sition of the gases to undergo step changes. In all cases,
He was the major component of the gas phase, with a ﬂow
rate of 30 cm3/min, and the active component (CO, O2, and
CO2) was chosen to be 10% of the total ﬂow rate. This
ensured that the step changes in composition did not dra-
matically change the ﬂow rate. The pulse reactor data were
used primarily to determine the amount of oxygen that was
added or removed from the catalyst during each oxidation
and reduction cycle. Integration of the partial pressure as a
function of time allowed accurate determination of the
amounts of CO2 formed during a CO pulse. Prior to tak-
ing the pulse data, we ﬁrst calcined the samples in ﬂowing
air at 673 K for 1 h, which were reduced with 10% CO in
He at that temperature for 1 h and then reoxidized in 10%
O2 for an additional 1 h. The areas under the peaks were
reproducible within about 10%.
For all of the catalysts, Pd was added by aqueous wet im-
pregnation of Pd(NH4)4(NO3)2. After impregnation, each
catalyst was dried, calcined in ﬂowing air for 2 h at 673 K,
and then pressed into wafers. Prior to the steady-state rate
experiments, the wafers were reduced in a stream of 10%
CO in He for 1 h at 673 K and then cooled in ﬂowing He.
A 1% wt loading of Pd was used for all of the catalysts in
the pulse experiments, while a 10% wt loading was used
for the steady-state reaction measurements. The four sup-
ports came from various sources. Ceria was used as received
from Johnson Matthey. BET analysis indicated that the sur-
face area was 33 m2/g. The γ -Al2O3 and silica supports were
commercial materials obtained from Alfa Aesar and Sigma.
Zirconia was prepared by drying an aqueous solution of
ZrO(NO3)2, then calcining the solid to 673 K in air for 1 h.
The BET surface area of this catalyst was 9 m2/g.
RESULTS
The results for the pulse measurement with CO and O2
on Pd/ceria at 623 K are shown in Fig. 1. In this experi-
ment, the oxidized sample was exposed to two pulses of CO
(m/e = 28), followed by two pulses of O2 (m/e = 32) and a
pulse of CO. For the ﬁrst CO pulse, a signiﬁcant amount,
470 µmol/g, of CO2 (m/e = 44) was formed at the leading
edge of the pulse. Essentially no CO2 was formed in the sec-
ond CO pulse, showing that the initial pulse had removed
all of the kinetically accessible oxygen from the catalyst.
The amount of oxygen removed from this catalyst is simi-
lar to that reported in an earlier study of Pd/ceria catalysts
(3). For comparison purposes, complete reduction of PdO
would result in the production of ∼94 µmol/g of CO2 and
complete reduction of ceria from CeO2 to Ce2O3 would pro-
vide an additional 2900 µmol/g. Therefore, the majority of
the oxygen from this catalyst must originate from the ceria
support.
The exposure of the reduced sample to O2 led to a very
sharp CO2 spike corresponding to 400–500 µmol/g. (Note
that the small peak at m/e = 28 is part of the fragmentation
pattern of CO2 in the mass spectrometer.) One possible ex-
planation for the CO2 spike is that CO2 formed during the
initial CO pulse adsorbs on Ce3+ sites on the reduced ceria
support. This CO2 is then displaced when the ceria is reox-
idized during the O2 pulse. Using the BET surface area of
the catalyst and 400 µmol/g for the amount of CO2 formed,
the surface coverage of CO2 was estimated to be 6 × 1018
molecules/m2, which is close to the coverage expected for
one monolayer of CO2 on ceria. On the basis of this inter-
pretation, the total amount of CO2 formed in the CO pulse
is the sum of the CO2 formed in both events, i.e., more than
850 µmol/g.
Another possible explanation for the sharp CO2 spike
upon the introduction of O2 is that CO or carbon adsorbed
on either the Pd or ceria is being oxidized in this process;
however, two important observations argue against this as-
signment. First, the amount is too large for the carbon to
be only on the Pd since it would require approximately
four carbons per metal atom. The carbon would have to be
present in signiﬁcant amounts on the ceria. This possibility

has been suggested in the literature (15), and a signiﬁcant
number of other papers have reported the dissociation of
CO (16) and CO2 (17–19) on ceria-supported metals. How-
ever, because the amount of CO2 is large, one cannot ex-
plain the data based on the metal–ceria perimeter. Further-
more, it would be surprising that carbonaceous species on
ceria could be oxidized as rapidly as the sharpness of the
CO2 spike would suggest. Second, the CO2 formation dur-
ing the O2 pulse is only observed with ceria and not with

the other supports. For example, the analogous experiment
on Pd/zirconia, shown in Fig. 2, shows no evidence for CO2
formation at the same point in the pulse sequence.
The last CO pulse in Fig. 1 demonstrates the reversibil-
ity of the redox process on Pd/ceria. The amount of CO2
produced by this pulse was ∼530 µmol/g. The difference
between this and the initial pulse can be explained by the
10% uncertainty in our ability to measure the areas under
the CO2 peak.

SHARMA ET AL.
The data for alternating CO and O2 pulses on Pd/zirconia
at623KinFig.2arequalitativelysimilartothatforPd/ceria,
with the exception that no CO2 is formed during the O2
pulse. What is most interesting about this data is that the
amount of CO2 formed after both the ﬁrst and last CO
pulses is ∼170 µmol/g. Again, this amount is too large to
be explained by oxidation and reduction of Pd alone. The
data for Pd/γ -Al2O3 and Pd/silica are qualitatively similar
to Fig. 2, but the amounts of CO2 observed at 673 K were
53 and 26 µmol/g, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of
the Pd alone can easily explain the CO2 formed on both
Pd/γ -Al2O3 and Pd/silica. While zirconia is not normally
considered to be reducible under normal catalytic condi-
tions, there is mounting evidence that the surface of zirco-
nia powders may nonetheless be reducible (20). Given that
the amount of oxygen removed from Pd/zirconia is almost
double that which could originate from the Pd alone, at
least 100 µmol/g of oxygen must come from zirconia. Based
on the BET surface area, this corresponds to ∼6 × 1018/m2,
a reasonable value for complete reduction of the surface.
Note that the interfacial perimeter between Pd and zirco-
nia is still not sufﬁcient to explain the amount of oxygen
removed from this catalyst.
Equation [4] suggests that reduced ceria can be oxidized
by CO2, which has also been suggested earlier [17]. Addi-
tional evidence for this is given in Fig. 3, which gives results
for alternating CO and CO2 pulses at 623 K. Prior to this
measurement, the oxidized sample was exposed to a series
of CO and CO2 pulses identical to those shown here. Both
CO and CO2 contribute an m/e = 28 signal in the mass spec-
trum, so that one must consider the ratio of the peaks at 28
and 44 in order to unambiguously interpret the data. The

and 28) and another of CO.
catalyst is clearly reduced following two CO pulses. What is
most interesting is that the ﬁrst CO2 pulse exhibits a leading
peak at m/e = 28, which is not observed for the second CO2
pulse, implying that some CO is formed. Obviously, forma-
tion of CO from CO2 requires oxidation of the catalyst. Ev-
idence for oxidation of the catalyst by CO2 is also obtained
from the ﬁnal CO pulse. Here, CO2 is again formed by ox-
idation of CO. The extent of oxidation is signiﬁcantly less
than that following oxidation by O2, with only 100 µmol/g
of CO2 being formed in the last CO pulse. (It was not possi-
ble for us to accurately determine the amount of CO which
evolved during the CO2 pulse, but it appeared to be essen-
tially equal to the amount of CO2 formed in the last CO
pulse. The catalyst did not change with continued pulsing
of CO and CO2.) It should be noted that oxidation of ce-
ria by CO2 was negligible in measurements using Pd/ceria
at 473 K, implying that there are kinetic limitations to the
oxidation of ceria by CO2. The results for Pd/zirconia were
essentially identical, although only 70 µmol/g of oxygen was
transferred. Finally, we found no evidence for oxidation of
either Pd/γ -Al2O3 or Pd/silica by CO2 at temperatures up
to 723 K.
Based on the mechanism for steam reforming of methane
discussed in the Introduction and the observation that CO2
can oxidize ceria, one might expect that the role of water
could be replaced by CO2 for reaction on Pd/ceria cata-
lysts. We therefore measured the steady-state rates of the
reaction of CH4 with CO2 on Pd/ceria, Pd/zirconia, and
Pd/silica catalysts. The rates for all three catalysts are shown
in Fig. 4 for CO2 and CH4 partial pressures of 15 Torr. As ex-
pected, the Pd/silica catalyst had essentially no activity and
it was not possible to measure rates in the same temperature

region used for the other two catalysts. Extrapolating the
data for Pd/ceria to the same temperature as that used for
Pd/silica, the Pd/ceria catalyst was estimated to be a factor
of ∼104 times more active.
Previous reports have already indicated that zirconia-
supported metals are very active catalysts for this reaction
(21–23). The results presented here agree well with these
earlier observations, but show that Pd/ceria is even more
active than Pd/zirconia. The activation energies calculated
from the data in Fig. 4 are 185 kJ/mol for Pd/zirconia and
160 kJ/mol for Pd/ceria. The difference in the activation en-
ergies between the two catalysts is within in the uncertainty
of the measurement. The fact that the rates are so simi-
lar on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia, strongly suggests that the
mechanisms must also be similar. Based on the data from
the pulse experiments, especially that in Fig. 3, the mech-
anism on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia must involve oxidation
and reduction of the oxide.
DISCUSSION
The major conclusion which can be drawn from the re-
sults of this work is that CO2 is able to oxidize reduced ce-
ria or zirconia. Clearly, O2 is more efﬁcient than CO2; still,
the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of re-
oxidation by CO2 is signiﬁcant. These results have obvious
implications for the mechanism of methane reforming by
CO2. They also have important implications for three-way,
automotive-exhaust catalysis since the presence of CO2 and
H2O in the exhaust environment may affect the equilibrium
oxidation state of the ceria component, limiting the extent
to which oxygen can be removed. This point requires addi-
tional consideration.
The observation that zirconia can be reduced and re-
oxidized under the relatively mild conditions used in this
study is surprising. It is important to note, however, that
others have also reported evidence for surface reduction
of zirconia (23). Also, the fact that zirconia-supported met-
als are active for reactions like CO2 reforming, while silica-
and alumina-supported metals are not, strongly suggests
that zirconia plays more than a simple, passive role in the
reaction. While it is possible that this role is simply to po-
larize molecules adsorbed at the metal–zirconia interface,
the simplicity of the redox mechanism, along with the fact
that both the oxidation and reduction steps are observed
directly in the pulse measurements, strongly argues for the
redox mechanism.
While we have not deﬁnitively proven that the reduced
Pd/ceria can adsorb CO2 and release it upon re-oxidation,
the concept is reminiscent of what is observed with sulfur.
It is known that SO2 poisons ceria by formation of a sulfate.
Under oxidizing conditions, SO2 is oxidized to the sulfate,
with Ce likely in the +3 state as Ce2(SO4)3 (24). Reducing
conditionsallowthereleaseofthesulfurasH2S.Whilethere
is probably no relationship between SO2 adsorption and
CO2 adsorption, the ability of the material to form a sulfate
or a carbonate may be related. It would be interesting to
determine whether materials which do not adsorb CO2 are
also more tolerant of SO2.
