[1] "The presence of CO2 exerted very little influence on the formation of these surface species."
[2] "The selectivity to propylene at 773-873 K is 85-90 %"
[3] "Other hydrocarbon products are ethylene, methane and butane."
[4] "The selectivities of ethylene and methane gradually increased with the rise of the temperature."
[5] "Qualitatively, we obtained similar results for Mo2C/AI203 arid Mo2C/Ti02. Basically different behavior was observed for Mo2C deposited on ZSM-5."
