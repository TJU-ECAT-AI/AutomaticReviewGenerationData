The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert CO2 and facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation process depends on their reducibility, which affects how easily they can react with reactants and intermediates. Different support materials can alter the catalyst's surface properties, such as acidity and porosity, which in turn affect the reaction pathways and product selectivities. This provides insights into the proposed reaction mechanism by highlighting the importance of the catalyst's structure and composition in determining the efficiency of CO2 utilization and the selectivity towards desired products. Optimizing these factors could lead to more effective and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP processes, enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of chemical production from CO2.

In the context of the document, Fe oxide-based catalysts, when supported on materials like ZSM-5, SiO2, and Al2O3, exhibit varying activities and product distributions in reactions involving CO2 and hydrocarbons. ZSM-5 supports enable aromatization of hydrocarbons, while SiO2 and Al2O3 supports facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, leading to the formation of propylene, ethylene, and methane. The specific support material can significantly impact the reaction pathway and the selectivity towards certain products. Understanding these relationships allows for the rational design of catalysts that can optimize the use of CO2 in chemical synthesis, contributing to more sustainable industrial processes.
