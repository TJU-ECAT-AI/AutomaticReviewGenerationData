The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The formation of Mo oxycarbide through the reaction between CO2 and Mo2C plays a crucial role in activating propane. This indicates that the choice of support material affects the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired chemical transformation efficiently. Moreover, qualitative results suggest that the catalyst's performance is consistent across different support materials, which implies that the core functionality of the catalyst remains robust regardless of the support used. This understanding provides insights into optimizing catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process by selecting appropriate reducibility conditions and support materials that enhance the catalyst's performance.
