The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the presence of CO2 influences the reaction pathway, leading to the formation of various hydrocarbon products including propylene, ethylene, methane, and butane. The key role of the Mo oxycarbide, formed through the reaction between CO2 and Mo2C, is crucial for activating propane. This process highlights the importance of the catalyst's structure and composition in optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions.
