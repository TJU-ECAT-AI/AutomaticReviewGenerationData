        The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support materials used. Reducibility plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of the catalysts towards CO2 and propane, impacting the oxidation process. Support materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, stabilize the catalyst structure and enhance its activity, offering valuable insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and guiding the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

        Insights from these studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and carefully selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism.

        The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, indicating that both the reducibility and the type of support material are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile suggests that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.

        The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Understanding these factors offers insights into the reaction mechanism and guides the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

The integration of machine learning algorithms might also facilitate the discovery of optimal catalyst compositions and operating conditions, paving the way for sustainable and efficient CO2-ODHP processes.

Fe oxide-based catalysts play a pivotal role in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical products through the oxo process, specifically in the synthesis of oxo alcohols or oxo aldehydes, often referred to as the oxo alcohol pathway (ODHP). The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by their reducibility, reaction mechanism, and the properties of the support materials used. The reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts is critical for their activity, as it determines their ability to reduce CO2 to form the desired products under the reaction conditions. The reaction mechanism typically involves the adsorption of CO2 onto the catalyst surface followed by its reduction to CO, which then reacts with oxygen to produce the target product.

Support materials greatly affect the catalyst's properties and thus its catalytic activity. These materials can provide additional active sites, improve the dispersion of metal particles, and alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, thereby influencing its reactivity and stability. For instance, the use of appropriate support materials can enhance the reducibility of Fe oxides, leading to improved conversion rates and selectivity towards specific products in the ODHP.

The relationship between catalyst properties and catalytic activity is complex and multifaceted. It encompasses factors such as the particle size of the Fe oxide, the surface area, the presence of defects, and the electronic properties of both the metal and the support. These characteristics collectively determine how efficiently the catalyst can adsorb reactants, facilitate the desired chemical transformations, and regenerate after each reaction cycle. Optimizing these properties can lead to more efficient CO2 utilization, higher yields of target products, and enhanced sustainability in industrial processes that rely on the conversion of CO2. Therefore, the development of advanced Fe oxide-based catalysts requires a deep understanding of their performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanisms, alongside the careful selection and modification of support materials to achieve optimal catalytic activity.
