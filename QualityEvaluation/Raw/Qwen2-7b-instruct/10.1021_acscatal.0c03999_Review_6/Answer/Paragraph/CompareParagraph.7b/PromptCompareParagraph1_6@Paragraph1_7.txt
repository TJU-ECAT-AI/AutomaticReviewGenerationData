Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x], synthesizing insights from [10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], [10.1021/jp807864z], [10.1021/ja070908q], [10.1021/acscatal.7b03805], [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015], and other relevant sources. The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation, while support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and enhance its activity. Insights suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, indicating that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

        Based on the provided literature, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is greatly affected by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation. Support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and boost its activity. Optimizing these factors could result in more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

        The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Understanding these factors offers insights into the reaction mechanism and guides the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The presence of tungsten oxide in the catalysts acts as a physical barrier, hindering the clustering of vanadium oxide species, which reduces the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and decreases carbon dioxide formation. Carbon dioxide, as an oxidant, can only partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, leading to higher propylene production and reduced carbon formation. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile indicates that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalyst compositions, the utilization of alternative support materials, and the optimization of reaction conditions to further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], [10.1021/jp807864z], [10.1021/ja070908q], [10.1021/acscatal.7b03805], [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015], and [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x]. The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support material used and the reducibility of the catalysts. High reducibility and appropriate support materials can enhance the catalysts' activity, selectivity, and stability, thereby improving their overall performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process are provided by the aforementioned references.
