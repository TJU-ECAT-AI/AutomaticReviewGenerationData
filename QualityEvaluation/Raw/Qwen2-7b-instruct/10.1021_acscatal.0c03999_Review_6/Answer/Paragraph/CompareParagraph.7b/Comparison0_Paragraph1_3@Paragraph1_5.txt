However, neither excels in innovation and contribution or critical thinking, lacking depth in analysis, new research directions, and multi-angle problem-solving. Their writing quality is also comparable, maintaining fluency and appropriate terminology usage. The slight edge goes to Review A in clarity of research method description and conciseness of expression."
