    "Summary": "Both review articles excel in covering the topic comprehensively, presenting accurate information, and integrating interdisciplinary perspectives. They both offer critical analyses, propose new research directions, and contribute significantly to the field. However, they share some minor shortcomings, such as average clarity of research methods, slight inconsistency in language expression, and a lack of rigorous research design. Both articles provide practical insights and feasible suggestions, but their contributions to critical thinking, particularly in terms of identifying and discussing research limitations, are similar. In terms of overall evaluation, both reviews are of high quality, but neither outperforms the other in any significant way."
