    "Summary": "Both review articles effectively cover the topic of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, presenting comprehensive and accurate information. They demonstrate reasonable structure and organization, and adhere to academic standards in terms of citations and references. However, neither review introduces groundbreaking insights or proposes novel research questions, and their methodology descriptions are somewhat lacking in detail. The practical application value and the feasibility of their suggestions are generally strong. The logical argumentation and multi-angle analysis are present, but not exceptionally deep. Both articles could benefit from more nuanced critical thinking regarding the limitations of their analysis."
