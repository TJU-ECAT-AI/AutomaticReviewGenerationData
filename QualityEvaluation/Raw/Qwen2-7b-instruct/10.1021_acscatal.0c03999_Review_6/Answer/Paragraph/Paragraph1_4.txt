        The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, offering insights into the reaction mechanism and guiding the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. As evidenced by studies such as \[10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x\], \[10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4\], and \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\], the reducibility of Fe oxides affects their reactivity towards CO2 and propane during the oxidation process, while support materials such as carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and enhance its activity. Insights from these studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. For instance, the presence of CO2 can promote the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, particularly on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, highlighting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. 

        The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions, as seen in the use of ceria as a support material to enhance stability and selectivity. Both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes, as detailed in \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03805\].

        The provided literature discusses the influence of reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The reducibility and support materials play a crucial role in determining the performance during CO2-ODHP reactions, offering valuable insights into understanding the reaction mechanism and suggesting ways to optimize catalytic systems for this process, as highlighted in \[10.1021/jp807864z\] and \[10.1021/ja070908q\].

        Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways, as reported in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
        
        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with improved reducibility and incorporating novel support materials to further enhance catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions. This could include the development of catalysts with enhanced stability, lower energy requirements, and improved product yields, contributing to more sustainable and efficient processes for CO2 utilization.
