        The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Understanding these factors offers insights into the reaction mechanism and guides the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is greatly affected by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation. Support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and boost its activity. Optimizing these factors could result in more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The provided literature discusses the influence of reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.
