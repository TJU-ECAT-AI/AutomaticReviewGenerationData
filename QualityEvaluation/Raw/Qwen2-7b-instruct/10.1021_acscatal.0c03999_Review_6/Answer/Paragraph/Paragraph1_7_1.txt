        The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation, affecting their overall efficiency. Support materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and enhancing its activity. Insights from these studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their effectiveness in CO2-ODHP reactions, offering valuable insights into understanding the reaction mechanism and guiding the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

        Based on the provided literature, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is greatly affected by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation, influencing its overall efficiency. Support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and boost its activity. Optimizing these factors could result in more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These findings indicate that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.
