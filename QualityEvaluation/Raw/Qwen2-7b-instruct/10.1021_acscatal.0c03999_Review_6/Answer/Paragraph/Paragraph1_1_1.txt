        The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support materials used. The reducibility of Fe oxides affects their reactivity towards CO2 and propane during the oxidation process, and support materials such as carbon and metal oxides play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and enhancing its activity. Insights from these studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism.
        
        The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions, and the use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These findings indicate that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.
        
        The provided literature discusses the influence of reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.
        
        The periodic density functional theory study was conducted on propane dehydrogenation over a perfect Ga2O3(100) surface, revealing that Fe oxide-based catalysts have been widely used in CO2-ODHP reactions due to their high efficiency. The reducibility of Fe oxides plays a crucial role in determining the activity of the catalysts, and support materials such as carbon, alumina, and titania can significantly influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts.
        
        Ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls were synthesized, demonstrating that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors provide valuable insights into understanding the reaction mechanism and suggest ways to optimize catalytic systems for this process.
        
        Elucidating the role of CO2 in the soft oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ceria-based catalysts provides insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The study focuses on the role of CO2 in the soft oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane over ceria-based catalysts, highlighting the significant influence of reducibility and support materials on the catalyst's performance.
        
        Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.
        
        Optimization of catalytic systems requires careful selection of both the reducibility and support materials, ensuring efficient CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel support materials that could further enhance the activity and selectivity of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, as well as the investigation of alternative reaction mechanisms that could improve the efficiency of these processes.
