        The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Understanding these factors offers insights into the reaction mechanism and guides the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism.
        
        The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is greatly affected by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during oxidation. Support materials like carbon and metal oxides stabilize the catalyst structure and boost its activity. Optimizing these factors could result in more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights from these studies suggest that selecting appropriate support materials and optimizing the reducibility could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        The provided literature discusses the influence of reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors provide valuable insights into understanding the reaction mechanism and suggest ways to optimize catalytic systems for this process.
        
        Elucidating the role of CO2 in the soft oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ceria-based catalysts highlights the importance of both the reducibility and support materials in influencing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These findings indicate that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.
        
        The catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide. The presence of tungsten oxide in the catalysts acts as a physical barrier, hindering the clustering of vanadium oxide species, which reduces the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and decreases carbon dioxide formation. Carbon dioxide, as an oxidant, can only partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, leading to higher propylene production and reduced carbon formation. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile indicates that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.
        
        The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These findings indicate that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

Additionally, exploring the role of dopants and modifying the synthesis routes for support materials might lead to the discovery of novel catalyst architectures that exhibit improved catalytic behavior under CO2-ODHP conditions. This would not only enhance the efficiency of the process but also contribute to the broader goal of sustainable chemical production, particularly in the realm of CO2 utilization and conversion technologies.
