        The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support materials used. The reducibility of Fe oxides affects their reactivity towards CO2 and propane during the oxidation process, impacting the efficiency of the catalysts. Support materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and enhancing its activity. Insights from studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and selecting appropriate support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, especially on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, suggesting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, indicating that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

        The proposed reaction mechanism involves the formation of an active species on the catalyst surface, and optimization of catalytic systems requires careful selection of both the reducibility and support materials. This understanding provides a basis for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
