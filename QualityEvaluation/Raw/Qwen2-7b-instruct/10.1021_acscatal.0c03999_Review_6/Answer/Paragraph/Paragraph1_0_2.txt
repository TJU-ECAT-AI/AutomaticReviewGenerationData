        The performance of iron oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the type of support material used. Reducibility impacts the catalyst's reactivity towards CO2 and propane during the oxidation process, affecting their overall effectiveness in these reactions. Support materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and enhancing its activity. Insights from various studies suggest that optimizing the reducibility and carefully selecting the support materials could lead to more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation, particularly on silica-supported catalysts. Pulse reaction studies further indicate that CO2 accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over iron oxide catalysts, highlighting its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. The study elucidates how the reducibility and support materials of iron oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Higher reducibility in catalysts leads to better activity in these reactions, and the use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These findings underscore the importance of both factors in optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

        The provided literature discusses the influence of reducibility and support materials of iron oxide-based catalysts on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, offering valuable insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The reducibility and support materials play a crucial role in determining the performance during CO2-ODHP reactions, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and guiding the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.

        The study on propane dehydrogenation over ceria-based catalysts focuses on the role of CO2 in the soft oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) process, revealing that the reducibility and support materials of iron oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, indicating that both aspects are essential for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

        Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally through direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.

        The catalytic systems require careful selection of both the reducibility and support materials to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The reducibility and support materials of iron oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their effectiveness in these reactions, offering insights into the reaction mechanism and guiding the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes.

        铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到还原性和支持材料类型的显著影响。还原性影响催化剂对CO2和丙烷的氧化过程活性，从而影响其在这些反应中的整体有效性。碳和金属氧化物等支持材料在稳定催化剂结构并增强其活性方面起着关键作用。各种研究的见解表明，通过优化还原性和精心选择支持材料可以实现更高效的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂。

        CO2的存在促进了丙烷的脱氢，提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活，尤其是在二氧化硅支持的催化剂上观察到了这一点。脉冲反应研究表明，CO2加速了铁氧化物催化剂的脱氢速率，突显了其在反应机制中的有益作用。研究揭示了铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受其还原性和支持材料的影响。高还原性的催化剂在这些反应中表现出更好的活性，而使用铈作为支持材料增强了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。这些发现强调了这两个因素在优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统时的重要性。

        关于丙烷在以铈为基础的催化剂上的软氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程的研究集中在CO2的作用上，表明铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。使用铈作为支持材料增强了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，表明这两个方面对于优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统至关重要。

        根据所调查的催化循环中最大的吉布斯自由能壁垒，可以得出结论，在CO2存在下，丙烷可以通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢随后的逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应进行等效反应。丙烷的次级CAH键的激活被识别为两种途径中的决定性步骤。

        在CO2-ODHP反应中，需要精心选择还原性和支持材料以实现最佳性能的催化系统。铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料对其有效性有显著影响，提供了关于反应机制的见解，并指导了CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统优化。
