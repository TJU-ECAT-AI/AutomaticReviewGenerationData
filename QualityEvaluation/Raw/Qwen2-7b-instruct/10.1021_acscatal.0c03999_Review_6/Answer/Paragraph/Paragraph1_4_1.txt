        The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions are profoundly influenced by the choice of support materials. Studies demonstrate that higher reducibility in catalysts leads to enhanced activity, particularly on silica-supported catalysts where CO2 has a promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation. Insights from these investigations suggest that optimizing the reducibility and carefully selecting the support material can significantly enhance the efficiency of catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The role of CO2 as an oxidant accelerates the dehydrogenation rate over Fe oxide catalysts, underscoring its beneficial role in the reaction mechanism. 

        The study elucidates that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, with higher reducibility leading to improved activity. The use of ceria as a support material enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, indicating that both aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of an active species on the catalyst surface, and optimization of the system requires a careful selection of both the reducibility and support materials.
