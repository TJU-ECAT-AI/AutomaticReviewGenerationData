The presence of tungsten oxide in the catalysts acts as a physical barrier, hindering the clustering of vanadium oxide species, which reduces the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and decreases carbon dioxide formation. Carbon dioxide, as an oxidant, can only partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, leading to higher propylene production and reduced carbon formation. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile indicates that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015"},
