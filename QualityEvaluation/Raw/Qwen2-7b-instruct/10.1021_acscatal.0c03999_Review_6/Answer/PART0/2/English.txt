The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in influencing their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation activity of ceria-based catalysts, acting as an electron acceptor in the proposed reaction mechanism. Optimizing the catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process necessitates the careful selection of both reducibility and support materials for Fe oxide-based catalysts.

The study focuses on understanding the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane using a series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica. The reactions are analyzed within the temperature range of 500 to 600 degrees Celsius and at atmospheric pressure. The increasing demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is expected in the near future, with steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) being primary methods for olefin production. The presence of bulk V2O5 reduces selectivity and promotes complete oxidation. Adding WOx can improve the yield, and CO2 has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over catalysts based on chromium and vanadium oxide.
