          [1] "The catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide."
          [2] "The presence of multiple peaks is attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3 through the intermediate formation of oxide species with different oxidation states."
          [3] "The amount of hydrogen produced by all promoted WOx catalysts was less than the amount of propylene produced during the initial 90 s of the experiments."
          [4] "Clearly, CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 during oxidative dehydrogenation via a redox mechanism."
          [5] "Interestingly enough, the oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process."
          [6] "Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of tungsten oxide in the catalysts acts as a physical barrier, hindering the clustering of vanadium oxide species, which reduces the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and decreases carbon dioxide formation. Carbon dioxide, as an oxidant, can only partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, leading to higher propylene production and reduced carbon formation. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile indicates that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-determining step in both pathways.

          铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对其在二氧化碳-脱氢醇化反应中的性能有显著影响。钨氧化物在催化剂中的存在充当物理屏障，阻碍了钒氧化物种的聚集，降低了非选择性氧的形成概率，减少了二氧化碳的生成。二氧化碳作为氧化剂，只能部分将其氧化回V2O4，导致丙烯产量增加并减少碳生成。基于密度泛函数理论（DFT）计算的吉布斯自由能图表明，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢后紧接着逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应进行。丙烷上二级CAH键的活化被确定为两个途径中的决定性步骤。

          [1] "The study investigates the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over a series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica, focusing on the reactions taking place from 500 C to 600 C and at atmospheric pressure."
          [2] "The growing demand for olefins, especially propylene, is anticipated in the coming years. Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the main methods for olefin production."
          [3] "The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."
          [4] "Improving the yield is feasible with the addition of WOx."
          [5] "Moreover, CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts."

          The study focuses on understanding the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane using a series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica. The reactions are analyzed within the temperature range of 500 to 600 degrees Celsius and at atmospheric pressure. The increasing demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is expected in the near future, with steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) being primary methods for olefin production. The presence of bulk V2O5 reduces selectivity and promotes complete oxidation. Adding WOx can improve the yield, and CO2 has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over catalysts based on chromium and vanadium oxide.

          本研究专注于理解二氧化碳在使用多孔二氧化硅支持的WOxVOx催化剂上丙烷脱氢的作用。分析的反应温度范围为500至600摄氏度，并在大气压力下进行。未来几年对烯烃，特别是丙烯的需求预计将显著增长，蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）是主要的烯烃生产方法。大量V2O5的存在降低了选择性并促进了完全氧化。添加WOx可以提高产量，并发现在基于铬和二氧化钒的催化剂上，二氧化碳可以增强对较低烷烃和乙基苯的脱氢作用。
