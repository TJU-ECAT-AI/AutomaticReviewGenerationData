[1] "Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported chromium catalysts1315 as a result of their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17. Ni is mainly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is still a problem1820. To alleviate coke formation, precious metal catalysts (e.g., Rh, Re, Ru) have also been investigated on high surface area Al2O321,22."
[2] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression9,2325."
[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3."
[4] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 10) to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria (CeO2) is identified as a suitable support material due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which aids in direct CO bond scission of CO2 and coke suppression. Precious metals like Rh, Re, and Ru on Al2O3 have also been explored to alleviate coke formation, although they suffer from short lifecycles and high toxicity. The in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements provide insights into the local environment of metals under reaction conditions, contributing to a better understanding of the catalytic process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on specific surfaces offer a deeper understanding of the potential reaction pathways, revealing that the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative CH bond cleavage, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface prefers the CC bond cleavage. The research suggests ongoing efforts aimed at discovering more stable and selective catalytic materials to enhance propylene yield.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。氧化铈（CeO2）因其能够储存和释放氧，有助于直接CO键断裂的CO2和抑制焦炭形成，被确定为合适的支持材料。Rh、Re和Ru等贵金属在Al2O3上的应用也得到了探索，以减轻焦炭形成，但它们存在寿命短和毒性高的问题。原位X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）测量提供了有关金属在反应条件下的局部环境的信息，有助于更好地理解催化过程。密度泛函理论（DFT）对特定表面的计算揭示了潜在的反应途径，显示了Fe3Ni(111)表面的氧化性CH键断裂倾向，而Ni3Pt(111)表面倾向于CC键断裂。研究建议持续努力寻找更稳定和选择性的催化剂材料，以提高丙烯产量。
