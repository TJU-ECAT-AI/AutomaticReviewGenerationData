The reducibility and support material of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria (CeO2) is highlighted as a suitable support due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which can induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, and provide available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The Fe3Ni catalyst, composed of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, is particularly promising for the CO2-ODHP pathway, showing selective propylene production. In contrast, the Ni3Pt catalyst, active for the DRP, demonstrates high selectivity towards CO production. The proposed reaction mechanism and optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP benefit from understanding the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions, as revealed by in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能至关重要。CeO2因其能够储存和释放氧的能力而被选为合适的支撑材料，这可以促进CO2中CO键的直接断裂，并提供表面碳的抑制。Fe3Ni催化剂由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成，特别适用于CO2-ODHP途径，显示出选择性丙烯生成的潜力。相比之下，Ni3Pt催化剂对DRP具有活性，显示出对CO的高选择性。通过原位X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）测量了解金属在反应条件下的局部环境，对于优化CO2-ODHP催化系统的反应机制和设计具有重要意义。
