The reducibility and support material of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria (CeO2) is chosen as a support due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, and also provide available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the local environments of metals under reaction conditions and help identify the most favorable reaction pathways. The bimetallic catalysts, specifically Fe3Ni, demonstrate promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt shows high selectivity towards CO production through the DRP. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni catalysts leads to higher dehydrogenation activity compared to monometallic catalysts. The optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes involves the discovery of more stable and selective catalysts that can enhance propylene yield.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）的性能有显著影响。铈（CeO2）被选作支持材料，因为它能够储存和释放氧，可能促进CO2中CO键的直接断裂，并提供用于抑制结焦的表面氧。原位X射线吸收光谱测量和密度泛函理论计算为金属在反应条件下的局部环境提供了见解，并帮助确定最有利的反应途径。双金属催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni，显示出对丙烯生产具有良好的选择性通过CO2-ODHP途径，而Ni3Pt则显示出通过DRP对CO的良好选择性。Fe和Ni之间的协同作用导致Fe3Ni催化剂的脱氢活性高于单金属催化剂。优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统涉及发现更稳定、选择性更高的催化剂，以提高丙烯产量。
