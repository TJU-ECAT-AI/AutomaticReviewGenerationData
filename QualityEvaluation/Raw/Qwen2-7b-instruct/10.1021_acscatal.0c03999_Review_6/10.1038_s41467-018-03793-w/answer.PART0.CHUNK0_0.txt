The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria (CeO2) is highlighted as a suitable oxide support because it can store and release oxygen, facilitating direct CO bond scission in CO2 and providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. This supports the identification of catalysts capable of selectively breaking CH or CC bonds to produce propylene or synthesis gas, respectively. The synergy in the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst contributes to higher dehydrogenation activity and propylene production, indicating a promising catalyst for CO2-ODHP reactions.

The insights gained from the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts can guide the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes. The selection of ceria as a support material and the incorporation of bimetallic compositions enhance the efficiency of the reactions, particularly by enabling selective bond cleavage for propylene production or synthesis gas generation. This knowledge is crucial for developing cost-effective, selective, and coking-resistant catalytic systems for large-scale conversion of CO2 into valuable products.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。由于铈氧化物（CeO2）能够存储和释放氧，因此它被用作合适的氧化物支持材料，这有助于直接在CO2中进行CO键断裂，并提供表面碳的抑制。这支持了识别能够选择性地断开CH或CC键以产生丙烯或合成气的催化剂，分别用于生产丙烯或合成气。

从Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料中获得的见解可以指导CO2-ODHP过程催化剂系统的优化。选择铈氧化物作为支撑材料以及引入二元合金组成，可以提高反应效率，特别是通过促进选择性的键断裂来生产丙烯或合成气。这些知识对于开发成本效益高、选择性强且抗结焦的催化系统以大规模转化CO2为有价值的产品至关重要。
