[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."
[4] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[5] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly affect their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe oxide catalysts on supports like silica, especially those with ordered mesoporous structures, show high activity and selectivity. Conversely, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon as supports limit the catalyst's application in CO2-ODHP due to CO2 poisoning and regeneration issues, respectively. This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate support materials for optimized catalytic systems in CO2-ODHP processes.

铁氧化物催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中对催化性能有很大影响。在硅酸盐，尤其是具有有序介孔结构的支持材料上，铁氧化物催化剂显示出高活性和选择性。γ-Al2O3和活性碳作为支持材料限制了CO2-ODHP过程中的催化剂应用，分别由于CO2中毒和再生问题。这强调了在CO2-ODHP过程中选择合适支持材料对于优化催化剂系统的重要性。
