The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions significantly. Fe oxide catalysts require a support that ensures high dispersion of Fe oxide species, which is typically provided by silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, due to its large specific surface area. This high dispersion facilitates the formation of active sites for the desired reaction. However, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon are less effective as supports for Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP because CO2 addition can poison γ-Al2O3-based catalysts, and active carbon requires periodic regeneration with air, limiting its practical application. 

Beta zeolite was chosen for CO2-PDH reactions due to its unique structure, including large pores larger than those of ZSM-5, with dimensions of 0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels, high thermal and acid stability, and a large specific surface area that is essential for the high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The dealumination of Beta and subsequent chromium dispersion through a simple impregnation procedure resulted in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。铁氧化物催化剂需要一种确保铁氧化物物种高分散的支持，通常由具有较大比表面积的硅提供，特别是有序介孔结构的硅，因为其大的比表面积有利于形成所需反应所需的活性位点。然而，γ-Al2O3和活性碳在CO2-ODHP中作为铁氧化物催化剂的支持效果较差，因为CO2添加会毒化γ-Al2O3基催化剂，并且活性碳的周期性用空气再生受到限制，这限制了其实际应用。

选择Beta沸石进行CO2-PDH反应，是由于其独特的结构，包括比ZSM-5大得多的孔径，线性孔径尺寸为0.75 by 0.57 nm，弯曲通道孔径尺寸为0.65 by 0.56 nm，高温和酸稳定性以及用于高铬氧化物物种分散和浓度的大比表面积，这是CO2-PDH所需的关键。Beta沸石的去铝化和随后通过简单的浸渍程序实现的铬分散产生了出色的CO2-PDH催化剂。
