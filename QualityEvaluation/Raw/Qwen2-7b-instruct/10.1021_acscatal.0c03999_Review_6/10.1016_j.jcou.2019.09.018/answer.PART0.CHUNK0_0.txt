The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High dispersion and presence of redox Fe species are crucial for achieving high catalytic performance. Silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, provides an excellent support for Fe dispersion. However, over γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, CO2 addition causes poisoning. In contrast, Cr-containing Beta zeolites exhibit excellent performance in CO2-PDH, thanks to their three-dimensional structure and large 12-membered ring openings. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by a simple impregnation procedure results in outstanding catalysts for CO2-PDH.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。高分散性和红氧化合物的存在对于实现CO2-PDH的高催化性能至关重要。特别是有序介孔结构的二氧化硅提供了Fe分散的优秀支持。然而，在γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂中，CO2添加导致中毒。相比之下，Cr含量的Beta沸石在CO2-PDH中表现出优异的性能，得益于其三维结构和较大的12元环开口。对Beta沸石进行脱铝化并随后通过简单的浸渍过程，结果产生出色的CO2-PDH催化剂。
