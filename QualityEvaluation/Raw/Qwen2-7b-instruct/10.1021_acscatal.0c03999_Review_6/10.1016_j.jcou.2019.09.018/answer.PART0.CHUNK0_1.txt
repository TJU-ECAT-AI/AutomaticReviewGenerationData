[1] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High reducibility allows for better interaction between Fe species and CO2, potentially enhancing the formation of propene. Different support materials like SiBeta and AlBeta offer distinct properties, such as acidity and dispersion of Fe species, which can either promote or hinder the desired reaction pathways. The optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP involves selecting materials that maximize the desired redox cycles, ensuring high dispersion of Fe species, and maintaining appropriate acidity levels to achieve high propene yields.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到可还原性和支持材料的影响，这影响了氧化脱氢途径的效率。高可还原性允许Fe物种与CO2更好地相互作用，可能增强丙烯的形成。不同支持材料如SiBeta和AlBeta提供不同的特性，如酸性和Fe物种的分散，这可以促进或阻碍所需反应路径。优化CO2-ODHP催化系统的策略涉及选择能够最大化期望的还原循环、确保Fe物种高度分散以及维持适当酸度水平以实现高丙烯产率的材料。
