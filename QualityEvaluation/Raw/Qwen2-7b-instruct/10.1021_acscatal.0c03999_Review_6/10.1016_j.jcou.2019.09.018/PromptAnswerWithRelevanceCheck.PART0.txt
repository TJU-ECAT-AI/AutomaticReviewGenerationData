The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High dispersion and presence of redox Fe species are crucial for achieving high catalytic performance. Silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, provides an excellent support for Fe dispersion. However, over γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, CO2 addition causes poisoning. In contrast, Cr-containing Beta zeolites exhibit excellent performance in CO2-PDH, thanks to their three-dimensional structure and large 12-membered ring openings. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by a simple impregnation procedure results in outstanding catalysts for CO2-PDH.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。高分散性和红氧化合物的存在对于实现CO2-PDH的高催化性能至关重要。特别是有序介孔结构的二氧化硅提供了Fe分散的优秀支持。然而，在γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂中，CO2添加导致中毒。相比之下，Cr含量的Beta沸石在CO2-PDH中表现出优异的性能，得益于其三维结构和较大的12元环开口。对Beta沸石进行脱铝化并随后通过简单的浸渍过程，结果产生出色的CO2-PDH催化剂。

[1] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High reducibility allows for better interaction between Fe species and CO2, potentially enhancing the formation of propene. Different support materials like SiBeta and AlBeta offer distinct properties, such as acidity and dispersion of Fe species, which can either promote or hinder the desired reaction pathways. The optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP involves selecting materials that maximize the desired redox cycles, ensuring high dispersion of Fe species, and maintaining appropriate acidity levels to achieve high propene yields.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能受到可还原性和支持材料的影响，这影响了氧化脱氢途径的效率。高可还原性允许Fe物种与CO2更好地相互作用，可能增强丙烯的形成。不同支持材料如SiBeta和AlBeta提供不同的特性，如酸性和Fe物种的分散，这可以促进或阻碍所需反应路径。优化CO2-ODHP催化系统的策略涉及选择能够最大化期望的还原循环、确保Fe物种高度分散以及维持适当酸度水平以实现高丙烯产率的材料。

[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[3] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."
[5] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. High dispersion and the presence of redox Fe species are essential for achieving high catalytic performance. However, γ-Al2O3-supported Fe oxide catalysts experience poisoning effects when CO2 is added, limiting their use in CO2-PDH. On the other hand, the study demonstrates that Cr-containing Beta zeolites serve as effective catalysts for CO2-PDH reactions, showing enhanced activity and selectivity. This suggests that the choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's performance and that dealumination enhances the catalytic properties for CO2-PDH reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中对其性能产生了重要影响。高度分散和存在可逆铁物种对于实现高催化性能至关重要。然而，γ-Al2O3支持的铁氧化物催化剂在添加二氧化碳时会表现出中毒效应，限制了其在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的应用。另一方面，研究表明，含铬的贝塔沸石可用于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应，显示出增强的活性和选择性。这表明选择支撑材料对催化剂的性能具有重大影响，并且脱铝化可以增强CO2-PDH反应的催化性质。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions significantly. Fe oxide catalysts require a support that ensures high dispersion of Fe oxide species, which is typically provided by silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, due to its large specific surface area. This high dispersion facilitates the formation of active sites for the desired reaction. However, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon are less effective as supports for Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP because CO2 addition can poison γ-Al2O3-based catalysts, and active carbon requires periodic regeneration with air, limiting its practical application. 

Beta zeolite was chosen for CO2-PDH reactions due to its unique structure, including large pores larger than those of ZSM-5, with dimensions of 0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels, high thermal and acid stability, and a large specific surface area that is essential for the high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The dealumination of Beta and subsequent chromium dispersion through a simple impregnation procedure resulted in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。铁氧化物催化剂需要一种确保铁氧化物物种高分散的支持，通常由具有较大比表面积的硅提供，特别是有序介孔结构的硅，因为其大的比表面积有利于形成所需反应所需的活性位点。然而，γ-Al2O3和活性碳在CO2-ODHP中作为铁氧化物催化剂的支持效果较差，因为CO2添加会毒化γ-Al2O3基催化剂，并且活性碳的周期性用空气再生受到限制，这限制了其实际应用。

选择Beta沸石进行CO2-PDH反应，是由于其独特的结构，包括比ZSM-5大得多的孔径，线性孔径尺寸为0.75 by 0.57 nm，弯曲通道孔径尺寸为0.65 by 0.56 nm，高温和酸稳定性以及用于高铬氧化物物种分散和浓度的大比表面积，这是CO2-PDH所需的关键。Beta沸石的去铝化和随后通过简单的浸渍程序实现的铬分散产生了出色的CO2-PDH催化剂。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly affect their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe oxide catalysts on supports like silica, especially those with ordered mesoporous structures, show high activity and selectivity. Conversely, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon as supports limit the catalyst's application in CO2-ODHP due to CO2 poisoning and regeneration issues, respectively. This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate support materials for optimized catalytic systems in CO2-ODHP processes.
