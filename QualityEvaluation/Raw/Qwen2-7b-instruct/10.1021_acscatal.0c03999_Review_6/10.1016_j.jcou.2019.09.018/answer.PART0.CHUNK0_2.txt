[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[3] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."
[5] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[6] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance during CO2-ODHP reactions. High dispersion and the presence of redox Fe species are essential for achieving high catalytic performance. However, γ-Al2O3-supported Fe oxide catalysts experience poisoning effects when CO2 is added, limiting their use in CO2-PDH. On the other hand, the study demonstrates that Cr-containing Beta zeolites serve as effective catalysts for CO2-PDH reactions, showing enhanced activity and selectivity. This suggests that the choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's performance and that dealumination enhances the catalytic properties for CO2-PDH reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中对其性能产生了重要影响。高度分散和存在可逆铁物种对于实现高催化性能至关重要。然而，γ-Al2O3支持的铁氧化物催化剂在添加二氧化碳时会表现出中毒效应，限制了其在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的应用。另一方面，研究表明，含铬的贝塔沸石可用于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应，显示出增强的活性和选择性。这表明选择支撑材料对催化剂的性能具有重大影响，并且脱铝化可以增强CO2-PDH反应的催化性质。
