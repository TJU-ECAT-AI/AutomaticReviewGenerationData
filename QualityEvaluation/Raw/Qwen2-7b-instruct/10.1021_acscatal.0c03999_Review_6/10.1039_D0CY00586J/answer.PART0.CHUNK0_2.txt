[1] "In recent years, a large variety of metal oxide catalysts have been explored in propane ODH with CO2 with dispersed chromium oxide species to show great potential as active sites towards high conversion and selectivity."
[2] "Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."
[3] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[4] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites."
[5] "Fe-doped ceria from the same synthesis batch were calcined at different temperatures and characterized by BET, Raman and XRD."
[6] "Calcination at 600°C is beneficial in the following aspects: higher specific surface area and formation of Fe-Ce solid solution rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases is achieved."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria supports offer high oxygen mobility and storage capacity, which are crucial for the formation of stable surface active sites. Calcination at 600°C enhances the formation of a Fe-Ce solid solution, providing a higher specific surface area and improved stability against deactivation. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in these reactions helps avoid deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and promotes propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This combination of factors leads to enhanced catalytic performance and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料在CO2-ODHP反应中对其性能有着显著的影响。铈基支持材料提供高氧流动性和存储能力，这对于形成稳定的表面活性位点至关重要。在600°C下煅烧有助于形成Fe-Ce固溶体，提供更高的比表面积和增强的稳定性，防止失活。使用CO2作为软氧化剂在这些反应中帮助避免深度氧化、减少焦炭形成，并通过逆水煤气变换反应促进丙烷转化。这种组合因素导致CO2-ODHP反应中增强的催化性能和稳定性。
