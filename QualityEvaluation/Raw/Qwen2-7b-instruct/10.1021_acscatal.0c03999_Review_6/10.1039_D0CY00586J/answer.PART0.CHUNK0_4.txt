The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The introduction of Fe3+ into ceria lattice enhances the oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), facilitating the formation of stable surface active sites. High Fe/Ce ratios improve the propane oxidative dehydrogenation pathway while suppressing propane cracking. Moderate Fe loading ensures stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. However, deactivation occurs due to coke deposition on the surface for low Fe loading catalysts, and CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals for high Fe loading catalysts.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料影响CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。向氧化铈晶格中引入Fe3+增强了氧的流动性以及氧存储能力（OSC），促进了稳定表面活性位点的形成。高Fe/Ce比例提高了丙烷氧化脱氢途径，同时抑制了丙烷裂解。适度的Fe负载确保了长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性。然而，低Fe负载催化剂上的焦炭沉积导致活性下降，而高Fe负载催化剂则由于CeO2团聚和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体导致活性下降。
