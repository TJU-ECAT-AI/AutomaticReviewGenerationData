The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study reveals that the incorporation of iron (Fe) into ceria (CeO2) lattice, forming a solid solution, enhances the stability and catalytic performance of the system. This is attributed to the improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity of ceria, which facilitates efficient propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the soft oxidant. The optimized calcination temperature ensures the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with Fe ions substituting Ce ions, avoiding the formation of the less desirable hematite phase. The catalysts demonstrate stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity over a prolonged period, indicating their potential for commercial applications in propylene production. The insights gained from this study suggest that the strategic modification of catalyst structure, specifically through the addition of Fe to CeO2, could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。研究表明，将铁（Fe）引入铈（CeO2）晶格中，形成固溶体，可以增强系统的稳定性和催化性能。这归因于铈的改进氧移动性和氧储存能力，这促进了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）与二氧化碳（CO2）作为软氧化剂的有效性。优化的煅烧温度确保了单相铈亚铁晶相的形成，Fe离子取代Ce离子，避免了形成不太理想的磁铁矿相。催化剂显示出稳定的丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性，持续时间长，表明其在丙烯生产方面的潜在商业应用可能性。从这项研究中获得的见解表明，通过向CeO2中添加Fe策略性地修改催化剂结构，可以导致开发更高效和稳定的CO2-ODHP反应催化系统。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Cerium oxide materials, known for their improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), serve as the foundation for synthesizing stable catalytic systems when combined with iron. The synthesis involves creating a solid solution of iron-cerium oxide catalysts, with iron doping levels ranging from 1% to 15%. Characterization techniques confirm the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with iron ions substituting cerium ions, indicating a stable structure without the presence of hematite. 

In terms of performance, the catalysts demonstrate enhanced propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways at higher iron-to-cerium (Fe/Ce) ratios, with a suppression of propane cracking. Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity are achieved over a period of up to 20 hours with catalysts having moderate iron loading. Post-reaction analysis reveals that deactivation mechanisms differ depending on the iron content. Low iron catalysts deactivate due to surface coke deposition, whereas high iron loading leads to catalyst deactivation through CeO2 sintering and iron migration, resulting in the formation of nanocrystals.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能影响中起着重要作用。铈氧化物材料因其改善的氧流动性与氧存储容量（OSC）而作为合成稳定催化系统的基石，当与铁结合时。合成涉及创建铁-铈氧化物固溶体催化剂，铁掺杂水平从1%到15%。通过表征技术确认单个铈亚硝酸盐结晶相的形成，其中铁离子取代铈离子，表明稳定的结构没有赤铁矿的存在。

在性能方面，催化剂在较高铁/铈（Fe/Ce）比率下显示出增强的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）途径，并抑制了丙烷裂解。具有适度铁负载的催化剂实现了长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和丙烯选择性。后反应分析显示，根据铁含量不同，脱活机制也有所不同。低铁催化剂由于表面焦炭沉积而失效，而高铁负载导致催化剂通过铈氧化物烧结和铁迁移而失效，从而形成纳米晶体。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ceria supports offer high oxygen mobility and storage capacity, which are crucial for the formation of stable surface active sites. Calcination at 600°C enhances the formation of a Fe-Ce solid solution, providing a higher specific surface area and improved stability against deactivation. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in these reactions helps avoid deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and promotes propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This combination of factors leads to enhanced catalytic performance and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions.
