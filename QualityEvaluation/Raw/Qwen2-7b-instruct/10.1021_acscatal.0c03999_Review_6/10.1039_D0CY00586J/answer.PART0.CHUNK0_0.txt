The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study reveals that the incorporation of iron (Fe) into ceria (CeO2) lattice, forming a solid solution, enhances the stability and catalytic performance of the system. This is attributed to the improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity of ceria, which facilitates efficient propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the soft oxidant. The optimized calcination temperature ensures the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with Fe ions substituting Ce ions, avoiding the formation of the less desirable hematite phase. The catalysts demonstrate stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity over a prolonged period, indicating their potential for commercial applications in propylene production. The insights gained from this study suggest that the strategic modification of catalyst structure, specifically through the addition of Fe to CeO2, could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。研究表明，将铁（Fe）引入铈（CeO2）晶格中，形成固溶体，可以增强系统的稳定性和催化性能。这归因于铈的改进氧移动性和氧储存能力，这促进了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）与二氧化碳（CO2）作为软氧化剂的有效性。优化的煅烧温度确保了单相铈亚铁晶相的形成，Fe离子取代Ce离子，避免了形成不太理想的磁铁矿相。催化剂显示出稳定的丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性，持续时间长，表明其在丙烯生产方面的潜在商业应用可能性。从这项研究中获得的见解表明，通过向CeO2中添加Fe策略性地修改催化剂结构，可以导致开发更高效和稳定的CO2-ODHP反应催化系统。
