The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in influencing their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Cerium oxide materials, known for their improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), serve as the foundation for synthesizing stable catalytic systems when combined with iron. The synthesis involves creating a solid solution of iron-cerium oxide catalysts, with iron doping levels ranging from 1% to 15%. Characterization techniques confirm the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with iron ions substituting cerium ions, indicating a stable structure without the presence of hematite. 

In terms of performance, the catalysts demonstrate enhanced propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways at higher iron-to-cerium (Fe/Ce) ratios, with a suppression of propane cracking. Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity are achieved over a period of up to 20 hours with catalysts having moderate iron loading. Post-reaction analysis reveals that deactivation mechanisms differ depending on the iron content. Low iron catalysts deactivate due to surface coke deposition, whereas high iron loading leads to catalyst deactivation through CeO2 sintering and iron migration, resulting in the formation of nanocrystals.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能影响中起着重要作用。铈氧化物材料因其改善的氧流动性与氧存储容量（OSC）而作为合成稳定催化系统的基石，当与铁结合时。合成涉及创建铁-铈氧化物固溶体催化剂，铁掺杂水平从1%到15%。通过表征技术确认单个铈亚硝酸盐结晶相的形成，其中铁离子取代铈离子，表明稳定的结构没有赤铁矿的存在。

在性能方面，催化剂在较高铁/铈（Fe/Ce）比率下显示出增强的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）途径，并抑制了丙烷裂解。具有适度铁负载的催化剂实现了长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和丙烯选择性。后反应分析显示，根据铁含量不同，脱活机制也有所不同。低铁催化剂由于表面焦炭沉积而失效，而高铁负载导致催化剂通过铈氧化物烧结和铁迁移而失效，从而形成纳米晶体。
