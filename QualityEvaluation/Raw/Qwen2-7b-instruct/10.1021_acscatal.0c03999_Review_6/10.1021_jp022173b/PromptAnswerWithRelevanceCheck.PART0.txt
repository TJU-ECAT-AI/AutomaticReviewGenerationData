[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "The order of the activity of various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at the reaction temperature of 923 K was as follows: Cr2O3 > V2O5 > MoO3 > Ga2O3 > CeO2 > Mn3O4 > Fe2O3 > Sm2O3 > CaO > Tb4O6 > Y2O3 > SnO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > Pr6O11."
[3] "The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts (Table 1)."
[4] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[5] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4)."
[6] "Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[7] "The roles of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be considered as follows: in the Ga2O3 catalyst, a visible amount of carbon was deposited;25 however, visible carbon deposition was not observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[8] "Maintaining a higher-oxidation state of the chromium species might be an important factor indicating high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do not seem to be discussed in the provided document. The document focuses on the performance of Cr2O3-supported catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and optimization of catalytic systems for this process are provided through the discussion of Cr2O3 and other metal oxide catalysts' activity in the presence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3-supported catalyst in the presence of CO2 is notably higher than in its absence. The catalysts' activity varies depending on the metal oxide type, with Cr2O3 being the most active. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane, and it maintains the higher oxidation state of the chromium species, contributing to the catalyst's efficiency. The roles of CO2 in the reaction include eliminating deposited carbon and modifying the surface acidity of the catalyst. Maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are crucial for achieving high C2H4 yields. The XRD and XPS analyses suggest that the oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen on the diamond surface play important roles in the dehydrogenation process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料并未在提供的文献中提及。文献主要关注Cr2O3负载型催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。对于此过程的反应机制和催化体系优化，通过讨论不同金属氧化物催化剂在CO2存在的条件下活性提供了一些见解。Cr2O3负载催化剂在CO2存在下的活性明显高于其不存在时。根据金属氧化物类型的不同，催化剂活性有所变化，其中Cr2O3活性最高。CO2的存在促进了乙烷的脱氢，并维持了铬物种的高氧化状态，这有助于催化剂的效率。CO2的作用包括去除催化剂表面沉积的碳以及改变催化剂表面的酸性。保持铬物种的高氧化状态和钻石表面的氧气存在对实现高C2H4产率至关重要。XRD和XPS分析表明，铬物种的氧化状态和钻石表面的氧气的存在在脱氢过程中扮演着重要角色。

[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8, some reports 14,15 have pointed out that thermal noncatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8 proceeded to give alkene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which were operated at higher temperatures than those in noncatalyzed runs."
[2] "In this work, we dealt with the performance of oxidized diamond as a new support material for the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 and found that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2."

[4] "In the case of Ga2O3/TiO2, the conversion of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 increased twice that in the presence of Ar; however, a secondary reaction such as the decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 occurred to give CH4 decreasing C2H4 selectivity."

1. The presence of CO2 significantly enhances the activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, making it about three times more active than in its absence. This enhancement is observed across multiple catalysts, including Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts supported on oxidized diamond surfaces.

2. The introduction of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts supported on oxidized diamond surfaces. In contrast, the use of Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts in CO2 atmosphere results in a doubled conversion of C2H6 compared to Ar atmosphere, but secondary reactions like decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 occur, leading to a decrease in C2H4 selectivity.

3. Among various metal oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, Cr2O3 shows the highest catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 at 923 K, followed by V2O5, MoO3, Ga2O3, CeO2, Mn3O4, Fe2O3, Sm2O3, CaO, Tb4O6, Y2O3, SnO2, ZnO, La2O3, and Pr6O11.

4. The elimination of deposited carbon on the catalyst surface might be a key factor in the enhanced dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. 

5. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure leads to a marked increase in C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield. This effect is observed even with a small amount of CO2, and the yield continues to increase with further increases in CO2 pressure.

1. 在氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂存在下，CO2显著提高了催化剂的活性，使其活动性大约是其不存在时的三倍。这种增强在Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂上都能观察到，这些催化剂都支持在氧化金刚石表面上。

2. CO2的引入促进了C2H6在Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂上氧化金刚石表面的脱氢反应。相比之下，在使用Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的情况下，尽管在CO2气氛中C2H6的转化率增加了两倍，但出现了C2H6或C2H4的分解等次级反应，导致C2H4的选择性降低。

3. 在氧化金刚石上支持的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr2O3在923 K时显示了最高的催化活性，其次是V2O5、MoO3、Ga2O3、CeO2、Mn3O4、Fe2O3、Sm2O3、CaO、Tb4O6、Y2O3、SnO2、ZnO、La2O3和Pr6O11。

4. 催化剂表面沉积碳的消除可能是C2H6在CO2存在的条件下增强脱氢作用的关键因素。

5. 随着CO2分压的增加，C2H6转化率和C2H4产率明显提高。即使只有少量的CO2，这一效果也会出现，并且随着CO2压力的进一步增加，产率继续增加。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their reducibility and support materials. The presence of CO2 significantly enhances the activity of these catalysts, leading to improved performance in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. This is because CO2 helps to eliminate carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which would otherwise decrease the yield of ethylene. Moreover, CO2 maintains the higher oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, which is crucial for achieving a high yield of ethylene. The presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface also plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 using Fe oxide-based oxidized diamond catalysts. Maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface is essential for optimizing catalytic systems for this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。二氧化碳显著提高了这些催化剂的活性，导致乙烷脱氢为乙烯的性能改善。这是因为二氧化碳有助于清除催化剂表面的碳沉积，否则会降低乙烯的产率。此外，二氧化碳维持了金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的更高氧化态，这对于实现高产率的乙烯至关重要。金刚石表面上的氧物种的存在也在使用铁氧化物负载的氧化金刚石催化剂进行乙烯脱氢过程中起着重要的作用。保持金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的更高氧化态对于优化此过程的催化系统至关重要。
