[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8, some reports 14,15 have pointed out that thermal noncatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8 proceeded to give alkene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which were operated at higher temperatures than those in noncatalyzed runs."
[2] "In this work, we dealt with the performance of oxidized diamond as a new support material for the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 and found that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2."
[3] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "In the case of Ga2O3/TiO2, the conversion of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 increased twice that in the presence of Ar; however, a secondary reaction such as the decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 occurred to give CH4 decreasing C2H4 selectivity."
[5] "In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, the increase in C2H4 yield was about 17% in the presence of CO2."

1. In the context of thermal noncatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation, studies have shown that the yield of alkene from C2H6 and C3H8 is comparable to that from catalyzed runs operated at higher temperatures than noncatalyzed runs.
2. The research focused on evaluating oxidized diamond as a new support material for a Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4.
3. The Cr2O3 catalyst supported on oxidized diamond showed an enhanced activity when CO2 was present, with its activity being approximately three times higher than in the absence of CO2.
4. For Ga2O3/TiO2, the conversion of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 doubled that in the presence of Ar, but secondary reactions like the decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 resulted in the production of CH4, reducing C2H4 selectivity.
5. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst led to a 17% increase in C2H4 yield when CO2 was present during the dehydrogenation of C2H6.

1. 在热非催化氧化脱氢作用下，关于C2H6和C3H8的研究表明，非催化运行时的温度高于非催化运行的温度，两者生成烯烃的产率是相同的。
2. 研究着重探讨了氧化金刚石作为Cr2O3催化剂在脱氢C2H6生成C2H4中的新支撑材料性能。
3. 在CO2存在的条件下，Cr2O3负载在氧化金刚石上的催化剂的活性明显提高，其活性大约是CO2不存在时的三倍。
4. 对于Ga2O3/TiO2，当存在CO2时，C2H6的转化率比存在Ar时增加了两倍，但副反应如C2H6或C2H4的分解产生了CH4，降低了C2H4的选择性。
5. 氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3催化剂在存在CO2期间，C2H6脱氢生成C2H4的产率提高了17%。
