[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "In the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, C2H4 yields increased remarkably with increasing reaction temperature."
[3] "In the absence of CO2, this inverse relation, i.e., the decrease the C2H4 yield with an increase in the reaction temperature, is probably caused by rapid carbon deposition on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts."
[5] "C2H4 yields over this catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure."
[6] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required."
[7] "From the result of FT-IR, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface would also play the important role for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst."
[8] "The role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface."
[9] "Furthermore, to maintain the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 would be necessary."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their reducibility and support materials. The presence of CO2 significantly enhances the activity of these catalysts, leading to improved performance in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. This is because CO2 helps to eliminate carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which would otherwise decrease the yield of ethylene. Moreover, CO2 maintains the higher oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, which is crucial for achieving a high yield of ethylene. The presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface also plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 using Fe oxide-based oxidized diamond catalysts. Maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface is essential for optimizing catalytic systems for this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响。二氧化碳显著提高了这些催化剂的活性，导致乙烷脱氢为乙烯的性能改善。这是因为二氧化碳有助于清除催化剂表面的碳沉积，否则会降低乙烯的产率。此外，二氧化碳维持了金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的更高氧化态，这对于实现高产率的乙烯至关重要。金刚石表面上的氧物种的存在也在使用铁氧化物负载的氧化金刚石催化剂进行乙烯脱氢过程中起着重要的作用。保持金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的更高氧化态对于优化此过程的催化系统至关重要。
