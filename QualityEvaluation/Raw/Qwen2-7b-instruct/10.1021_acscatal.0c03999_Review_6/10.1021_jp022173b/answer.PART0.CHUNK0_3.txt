[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "In the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, C2H4 yields increased remarkably with increasing reaction temperature, and a 27.4% C2H4 yield was obtained at 973 K."
[3] "The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts (Table 1)."
[4] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required."
[5] "From the result of FT-IR, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface would also play the important role for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst."

1. The presence of CO2 increased the activity of the Cr2O3 catalyst on oxidized diamond by about three times compared to its activity without CO2. 
2. The reaction temperature had a significant impact on the dehydrogenation yield, with the highest yield of 27.4% occurring at 973 K in the presence of CO2.
3. CO2 showed promoting effects on the yield of C2H4 over Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts on oxidized diamond.
4. Maintaining a higher oxidation state of chromium species on the catalyst was suggested to be essential for obtaining a high yield of C2H4 in the presence of CO2.
5. The presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface played a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 using Cr2O3 loaded on oxidized diamond catalysts in the presence of CO2.

1. CO2的存在使Cr2O3在氧化金刚石上的活性提高了大约三倍，与没有CO2的情况相比。
2. 在973 K的反应温度下，在CO2的存在下，得到了最高的27.4%的C2H4产率。
3. CO2在Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂上对氧化金刚石的促进效果明显。
4. 维持铬物种的更高氧化态被认为是获得高C2H4产率的关键因素，在CO2的存在下使用Cr2O3负载在氧化金刚石催化剂上。
5. 碳酸盐表面存在的氧物种在CO2的存在下对使用Cr2O3负载在氧化金刚石催化剂上的C2H6脱氢为C2H4起到了关键作用。
