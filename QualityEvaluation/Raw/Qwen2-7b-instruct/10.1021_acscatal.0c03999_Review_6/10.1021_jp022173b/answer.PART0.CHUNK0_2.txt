1. The presence of CO2 significantly enhances the activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, making it about three times more active than in its absence. This enhancement is observed across multiple catalysts, including Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts supported on oxidized diamond surfaces.

2. The introduction of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts supported on oxidized diamond surfaces. In contrast, the use of Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts in CO2 atmosphere results in a doubled conversion of C2H6 compared to Ar atmosphere, but secondary reactions like decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 occur, leading to a decrease in C2H4 selectivity.

3. Among various metal oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, Cr2O3 shows the highest catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 at 923 K, followed by V2O5, MoO3, Ga2O3, CeO2, Mn3O4, Fe2O3, Sm2O3, CaO, Tb4O6, Y2O3, SnO2, ZnO, La2O3, and Pr6O11.

4. The elimination of deposited carbon on the catalyst surface might be a key factor in the enhanced dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. 

5. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure leads to a marked increase in C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield. This effect is observed even with a small amount of CO2, and the yield continues to increase with further increases in CO2 pressure.

1. 在氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂存在下，CO2显著提高了催化剂的活性，使其活动性大约是其不存在时的三倍。这种增强在Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂上都能观察到，这些催化剂都支持在氧化金刚石表面上。

2. CO2的引入促进了C2H6在Cr、V、Mo、Ga和Ce催化剂上氧化金刚石表面的脱氢反应。相比之下，在使用Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的情况下，尽管在CO2气氛中C2H6的转化率增加了两倍，但出现了C2H6或C2H4的分解等次级反应，导致C2H4的选择性降低。

3. 在氧化金刚石上支持的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr2O3在923 K时显示了最高的催化活性，其次是V2O5、MoO3、Ga2O3、CeO2、Mn3O4、Fe2O3、Sm2O3、CaO、Tb4O6、Y2O3、SnO2、ZnO、La2O3和Pr6O11。

4. 催化剂表面沉积碳的消除可能是C2H6在CO2存在的条件下增强脱氢作用的关键因素。

5. 随着CO2分压的增加，C2H6转化率和C2H4产率明显提高。即使只有少量的CO2，这一效果也会出现，并且随着CO2压力的进一步增加，产率继续增加。
