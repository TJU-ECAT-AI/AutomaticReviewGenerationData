[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "The order of the activity of various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at the reaction temperature of 923 K was as follows: Cr2O3 > V2O5 > MoO3 > Ga2O3 > CeO2 > Mn3O4 > Fe2O3 > Sm2O3 > CaO > Tb4O6 > Y2O3 > SnO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > Pr6O11."
[3] "The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts (Table 1)."
[4] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[5] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4)."
[6] "Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[7] "The roles of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be considered as follows: in the Ga2O3 catalyst, a visible amount of carbon was deposited;25 however, visible carbon deposition was not observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[8] "Maintaining a higher-oxidation state of the chromium species might be an important factor indicating high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2."
[9] "From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do not seem to be discussed in the provided document. The document focuses on the performance of Cr2O3-supported catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and optimization of catalytic systems for this process are provided through the discussion of Cr2O3 and other metal oxide catalysts' activity in the presence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3-supported catalyst in the presence of CO2 is notably higher than in its absence. The catalysts' activity varies depending on the metal oxide type, with Cr2O3 being the most active. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane, and it maintains the higher oxidation state of the chromium species, contributing to the catalyst's efficiency. The roles of CO2 in the reaction include eliminating deposited carbon and modifying the surface acidity of the catalyst. Maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are crucial for achieving high C2H4 yields. The XRD and XPS analyses suggest that the oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen on the diamond surface play important roles in the dehydrogenation process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料并未在提供的文献中提及。文献主要关注Cr2O3负载型催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。对于此过程的反应机制和催化体系优化，通过讨论不同金属氧化物催化剂在CO2存在的条件下活性提供了一些见解。Cr2O3负载催化剂在CO2存在下的活性明显高于其不存在时。根据金属氧化物类型的不同，催化剂活性有所变化，其中Cr2O3活性最高。CO2的存在促进了乙烷的脱氢，并维持了铬物种的高氧化状态，这有助于催化剂的效率。CO2的作用包括去除催化剂表面沉积的碳以及改变催化剂表面的酸性。保持铬物种的高氧化状态和钻石表面的氧气存在对实现高C2H4产率至关重要。XRD和XPS分析表明，铬物种的氧化状态和钻石表面的氧气的存在在脱氢过程中扮演着重要角色。
