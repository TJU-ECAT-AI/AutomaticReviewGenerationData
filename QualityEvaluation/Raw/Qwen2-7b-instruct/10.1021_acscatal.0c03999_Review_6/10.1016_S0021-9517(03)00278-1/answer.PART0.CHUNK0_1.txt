[1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[2] "It has been clarified that the two different methods for introducing metal ions bring about remarkably different catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions."
[3] "The two kinds of catalytic reactions, viz., the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen are investigated and compared to elu- cidate the structure-property relationships for the two types of Cr-MCM-41."

1. Various forms of chromium species, including monochromates, polychromates, and aggregated chromium oxides, have been identified on catalyst samples. These species show different catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions depending on the synthesis method used.

2. The direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods result in distinct chromium species with differing coordination environments within the MCM-41 framework. This leads to distinct catalytic properties when used in selective oxidation reactions.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen are studied to understand the relationship between the structure of chromium species in Cr-MCM-41 and their catalytic properties.

1. 这些催化剂样品上报告了多种类型的铬物种，包括单铬酸盐、多铬酸盐和聚合铬氧化物。这些物种在不同的合成方法下显示出不同的选择性氧化反应行为。

2. 直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）方法导致了MCM-41框架内不同协调环境下的不同铬物种。这导致了在选择性氧化反应中具有不同催化性能的物种。

3. 研究丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢和甲烷与氧气的部分氧化，以理解Cr-MCM-41中铬物种结构与其催化性能之间的关系。
