[1] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) has been characterized by X-ray diffrraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromium species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
[3] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
[4] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process can be gained by comparing the differences in performance between catalysts based on different reducibility and support materials. This highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the catalyst components in the design and development of efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
