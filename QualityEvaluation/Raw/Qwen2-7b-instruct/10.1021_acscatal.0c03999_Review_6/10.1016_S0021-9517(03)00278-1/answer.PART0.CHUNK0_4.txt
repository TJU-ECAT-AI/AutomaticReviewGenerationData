[1] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) has been characterized by X-ray dif- fraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chro- mates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
[3] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
[4] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

The study discusses the preparation and characterization of chromium-mesoporous molecular sieve (Cr-MCM-41) using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The Cr-MCM-41 samples prepared by both methods show similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, indicating similar activity. However, when it comes to the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen, the Cr-MCM-41 sample prepared by the DHT method exhibits higher selectivity towards formaldehyde production compared to the sample prepared by the TIE method.

研究讨论了使用两种不同方法制备铬-介孔分子筛(Cr-MCM-41)：直接水热合成(DHT)和模板离子交换(TIE)。由这两种方法制备的Cr-MCM-41样品在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中表现出相似的催化性能，表明具有相似的活性。然而，在甲烷与氧气的部分氧化反应中，通过DHT方法制备的Cr-MCM-41样品对甲醛的产率选择性更高，与通过TIE方法制备的样品相比。
