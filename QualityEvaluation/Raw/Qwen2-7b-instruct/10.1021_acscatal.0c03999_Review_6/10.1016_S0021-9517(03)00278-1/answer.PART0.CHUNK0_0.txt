[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
[2] "The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
[3] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."
[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

The study investigates the synthesis and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 using two methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The researchers focus on the catalytic properties of these materials in two specific reactions: the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen. They find that both methods lead to Cr-MCM-41 samples with similar catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions, with high selectivity towards propylene and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of carbon dioxide. However, in the partial oxidation of methane, the DHT method results in higher selectivity for formaldehyde compared to the TIE method. This suggests that the structure of the chromate species is preserved during the oxidation of methane, and the higher dispersion of monochromate species is likely responsible for the improved selectivity observed with the DHT method.

研究使用直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）两种方法合成了Cr-MCM-41。研究人员重点考察了这些材料在丙烷脱氢与二氧化碳反应以及甲烷部分氧化与氧气反应中的催化性能。他们发现，这两种方法得到的Cr-MCM-41样品在脱氢反应中具有相似的催化性能，对丙烯的选择性高于90%，并且二氧化碳的存在可以增强丙烷的转化率。然而，在甲烷的部分氧化中，DHT方法产生的甲醛选择性比TIE方法高。这表明，铬酸盐物种在甲烷氧化过程中保持结构稳定，而DHT方法中单铬酸盐物种的高分散可能是导致其较高选择性的原因。
