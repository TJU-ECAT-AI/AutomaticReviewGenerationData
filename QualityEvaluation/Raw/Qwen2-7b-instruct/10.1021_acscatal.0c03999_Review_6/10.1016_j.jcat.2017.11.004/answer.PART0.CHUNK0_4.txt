[1] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2."
[2] "Under conditions where H2 is present in the influent, carbon selectivity to propylene varied from 16 to 84%."
[3] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. This is evident from insights provided into the proposed reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for this process. The literature highlights that almost 90% of revenue for Company X came from widget sales, with gadget sales contributing the remaining 10%. Transient and steady state kinetic modeling corroborates the distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and calculates dehydrogenation rate constants from both transient and steady state models.
