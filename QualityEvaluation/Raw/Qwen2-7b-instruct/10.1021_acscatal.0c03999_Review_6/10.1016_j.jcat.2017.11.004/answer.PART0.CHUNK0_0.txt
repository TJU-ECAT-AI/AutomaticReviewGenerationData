[1] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2."
[2] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."
[3] "Occlusion of O and rapid bulk O diffusion relative to the rate of O-removal via surface reduction allows for a direct comparison between rates of surface reduction and time constants extracted from observed dehydrogenation transients."
[4] "Presence of H2 co-feed leads to CAC scission, and O is postulated to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that are dependent upon ensembles of sites to accommodate dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates that precede CAC scission."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Insights gained from this process can inform the development and optimization of catalytic systems for this reaction. The literature discusses how co-feeding of H2 and CO2 can tune the catalytic properties of molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations, affecting both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. The transient and steady-state kinetic modeling supports the identification of distinct site pairs as the active sites for dehydrogenation. The study reveals that the occlusion of oxygen and the rapid diffusion of oxygen in the bulk relative to its removal from the surface enable a direct comparison of the surface reduction rates and time constants observed in dehydrogenation transients. Furthermore, the presence of H2 co-feed facilitates CAC scission, while oxygen is hypothesized to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that require a cluster of sites to accommodate dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates prior to CAC scission.

铁氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。从这个过程获得的见解可以指导此类催化系统的开发和优化。文献讨论了通过共喂养H2和CO2调整钼碳化物氧化物配方的催化特性，影响脱氢和氢解。瞬态和稳态动力学建模支持识别不同的位点对作为脱氢活性位点。研究揭示了氧的封存和在本体中快速扩散相对于其从表面去除时的速率，使得表面还原率和观察到的脱氢化转导时间常数之间的直接比较成为可能。此外，H2共喂养促进了CAC断裂，而氧气被假设抑制了依赖于聚集的位点来容纳脱氢化中间体以进行CAC断裂的氢解路径。
