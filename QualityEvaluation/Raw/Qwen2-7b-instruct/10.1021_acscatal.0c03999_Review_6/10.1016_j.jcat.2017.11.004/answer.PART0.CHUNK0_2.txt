[1] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2. Propane dehydrogenation occurs under all conditions while CAC scission is induced by H2 and inhibited by O."
[2] "Under conditions where H2 is present in the influent, carbon selectivity to propylene varied from 16 to 84%."
[3] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."
[4] "Presence of H2 co-feed leads to CAC scission, and O is postulated to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that are dependent upon ensembles of sites to accommodate dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates that precede CAC scission."

1. Molybdenum oxycarbidic catalysts can perform dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of alkanes, with their performance adjustable by the co-supply of H2 and/or CO2. Propane dehydrogenation happens regardless of conditions, whereas CAC scission is triggered by H2 and suppressed by O.
2. When H2 is in the feedstock, the carbon selectivity shifts from propylene to around 84%.
3. Both transient and steady-state kinetic models were employed to validate the concept of distinct site pairs as the active sites for dehydrogenation, leading to the determination of dehydrogenation rate constants from both models.
4. The presence of H2 promotes CAC scission, while O is believed to hinder hydrogenolysis processes requiring ensembles of sites to facilitate the formation of dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates preceding CAC scission.

1. 钼碳化物氧化复合催化剂可以催化烷烃的脱氢和氢解，其性能可以通过H2和/或CO2的共供给进行调整。无论条件如何，丙烷脱氢都能发生，而CAC断裂则由H2触发并被O抑制。
2. 当在进料中存在H2时，碳选择性从丙烯变化到约84%。
3. 通过将瞬态和稳态动力学模型结合使用，验证了作为脱氢活性位点的不同位点对的存在，并且从瞬态和稳态模型中计算了脱氢速率常数。
4. 存在H2会促进CAC断裂，而O被认为阻碍了依赖于用于形成脱氢化烷基中间体的位点集合的氢解过程，这些中间体在进行CAC断裂之前。
