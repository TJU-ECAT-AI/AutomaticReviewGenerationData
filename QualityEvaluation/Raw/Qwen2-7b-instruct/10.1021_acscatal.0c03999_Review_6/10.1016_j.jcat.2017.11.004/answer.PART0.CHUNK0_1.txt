[1] "The oxycarbide catalyzes the reverse water-gas shift reaction to equilibrium under conditions of H2/CO2 co-feed, and the equilibrated RWGS reaction product ratio PCO2/PCO can be used to calculate the fraction of oxidized surface sites, hO."
[2] "Dehydrogenation can be modeled by a two-site mechanism with dehydrogenation events being catalyzed by three distinct site pairs: oxidized OAO site pairs, carbidic A site pairs, and cooperative OA site pairs."
[3] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."

1. The oxycarbide catalyst equilibrates the reverse water-gas shift reaction under H2/CO2 co-feed conditions, and the ratio of CO2 to CO in the effluent can be used to determine the fraction of oxidized surface sites, hO.

2. Dehydrogenation is modeled using a two-site mechanism involving three types of active sites: oxidized OAO sites, carbidic A sites, and cooperative OA sites.

3. Both transient and steady state kinetic modeling were utilized to confirm the presence of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and rate constants for dehydrogenation were determined from these models.

4. The oxycarbide catalyst equilibrates the reverse water-gas shift reaction under H2/CO2 co-feed conditions, and the ratio of CO2 to CO in the effluent can be used to calculate the fraction of oxidized surface sites, hO.
