[1] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[2] "The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture."
[3] "The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase."
[4] "Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[5] "The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 0 to 5 mbar (Fig. 4)."
[6] "The mechanism proposed to be operative under our conditions here is based on homogeneous radical chain propagation reactions, similar to thermal pyrolysis."
[7] "Assuming the proposed initiation on the catalyst by hydrogen abstraction, the question arises as to how the catalytic sequence is closed by regeneration of the active site, i.e., how hydrogen is removed from the active oxygen."

1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

2. The reaction kinetics were studied by adjusting the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture.

3. Activation of propane on the catalyst generates propyl radicals, which undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase.

4. Small amounts of oxygen significantly increase the radical gas-phase chemistry by increasing the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals.

5. Oxygen plays a dual role in the mechanism: it influences radical gas-phase chemistry and facilitates the removal of hydrogen from the surface OH species.

6. The proposed mechanism involves homogeneous radical chain propagation reactions, similar to thermal pyrolysis.

7. The question of how the catalytic sequence is closed by regeneration of the active site, specifically how hydrogen is removed from the active oxygen, remains to be addressed.
