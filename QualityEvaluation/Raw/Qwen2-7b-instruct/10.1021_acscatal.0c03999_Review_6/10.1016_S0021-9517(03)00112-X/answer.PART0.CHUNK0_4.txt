[1] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reac- tion rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals."
[2] "A second function of oxygen is to regenerate the catalyst via removal of hydrogen from the catalyst in or- der to restore the activity of the catalyst for generation of radicals."
[3] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the cat- alyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site."
[4] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst."
[5] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate- determining step."
[6] "Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern."

1. Oxygen plays a crucial role in propane conversion by facilitating the reaction rates, mainly through the interaction with chain-carrier radicals and the formation of OH radicals.
2. Oxygen also regenerates the catalyst by removing hydrogen from the active sites, restoring its ability to generate radicals.
3. Carbon dioxide significantly inhibits catalyst activity, blocking active sites by forming Li+CO3.
4. Propene reactions predominantly occur on the catalyst, yielding carbon oxides.
5. Ethane, propane, and butane conversion patterns confirm that hydrogen abstraction is the rate-determining step.
6. Gas-phase radical chemistry largely dictates the product selectivity in the reactions.

1. 氧气在丙烷转化中扮演着关键角色，通过与链传递体自由基的相互作用和OH自由基的形成来加快反应速率。
2. 氧气还可以通过从活性位点去除氢来再生催化剂，恢复其生成自由基的能力。
3. 二氧化碳显著抑制催化剂活性，通过形成Li+CO3来阻塞活性位点。
4. 丙烯反应主要在催化剂上进行，产生碳氧化物。
5. 乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势证实了从烷烃获取氢是决定性步骤。
6. 气相自由基化学在很大程度上决定了反应产物的选择性。
