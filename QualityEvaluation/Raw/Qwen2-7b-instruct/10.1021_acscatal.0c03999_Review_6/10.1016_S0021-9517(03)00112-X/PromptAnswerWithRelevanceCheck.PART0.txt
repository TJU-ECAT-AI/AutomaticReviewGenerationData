[1] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[2] "The presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[3] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."
[4] "The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 0 to 5 mbar (Fig. 4)."
[5] "The mechanism proposed to be operative under our conditions here is based on homogeneous radical chain propagation reactions, similar to thermal pyrolysis."
[6] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reaction rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals."
[7] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site."

1. Oxygen plays a crucial role in propane conversion by facilitating a fast reaction pathway and regenerating the catalyst. Carbon dioxide inhibits catalyst activity by blocking active sites. Gas-phase radical chemistry dictates the selectivity patterns in alkane conversion.

2. The conversion rates of ethane, propane, and butane demonstrate that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-limiting step in the process. This is supported by the dominant influence of gas-phase radical chemistry on the selectivity patterns.
