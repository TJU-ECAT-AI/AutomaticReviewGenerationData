[1] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[2] "The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture."
[3] "Alkane activation is rate determining."
[4] "Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[5] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."
[6] "The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex."
[7] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion."
[8] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products."
[9] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst."
[10] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step."

1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

2. The reaction kinetics were studied by adjusting the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture.

3. Alkane activation is the rate-determining step in the reaction.

4. Oxygen enhances the radical gas-phase chemistry by increasing the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals when present in small amounts.

5. Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without altering the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the propane-activating site.

6. The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex, yet it is crucial for propane conversion.

7. The presence of gas-phase oxygen significantly accelerates propane conversion.

8. Carbon dioxide significantly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products.

9. Consecutive reactions of propene mainly occur on the catalyst, producing almost exclusively carbon oxides.

10. The conversion patterns of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step in the reaction.
