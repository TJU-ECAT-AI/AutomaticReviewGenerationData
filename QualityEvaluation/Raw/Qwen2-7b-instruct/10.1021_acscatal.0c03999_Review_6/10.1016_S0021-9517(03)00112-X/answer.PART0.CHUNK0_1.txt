<p>The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reac- tion rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals. A second function of oxygen is to regenerate the catalyst via removal of hydrogen from the catalyst in or- der to restore the activity of the catalyst for generation of radicals.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the cat- alyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site. Reactions in the gas phase were not influ- enced by CO2.</p>
<p>The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate- determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern.</p>

1. Oxygen plays a crucial role in propane conversion by facilitating a fast reaction pathway and regenerating the catalyst. Carbon dioxide inhibits catalyst activity by blocking active sites. Gas-phase radical chemistry dictates the selectivity patterns in alkane conversion.

2. The conversion rates of ethane, propane, and butane demonstrate that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-limiting step in the process. This is supported by the dominant influence of gas-phase radical chemistry on the selectivity patterns.
