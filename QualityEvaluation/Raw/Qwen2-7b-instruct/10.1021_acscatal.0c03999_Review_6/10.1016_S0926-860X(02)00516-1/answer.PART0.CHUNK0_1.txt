[1] "It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Beside the fact that catalytic sur- faces often undergo a reorganization at the atomic scale when molecules adsorb on them [13], the dynamic character of oxide catalysts in oxidation pro- cesses mainly comes from their working mechanism,namely the continuous exchange of oxygen atoms be- tween the gas phase and the catalytic surfaces."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The dynamic behavior of oxide catalysts in oxidation processes is mainly due to the continuous exchange of oxygen atoms between the gas phase and the catalytic surfaces. This dynamic behavior allows the catalyst surfaces to undergo reorganization at the atomic scale when molecules adsorb on them.
