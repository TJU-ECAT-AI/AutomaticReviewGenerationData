[1] "The effects of 3 vol.% of CO2 added in the gas feed are investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene on NiMoO4 catalysts."
[2] "Under particular conditions it can improve propene formation."
[3] "CO2 is able to oxidize propane to propene."
[4] "We suggest that CO2 dissociates during the reaction to CO and an active oxygen species, which is responsible for the oxidizing effect of carbon dioxide."
[5] "Contrary to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in catalytic oxidation reactions."
[6] "In fact, in fixed-bed reactors, both the partial pressure and the temperature may vary along the catalyst bed and it may thus be very difficult to maintain, in a controlled manner, the surface in a desired oxidation state."
[7] "The injection of CO2 in the feed could thus appear as a promising way for further controlling or improving catalytic performances."
