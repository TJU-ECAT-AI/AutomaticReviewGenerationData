[1] "Under the reaction conditions used in this work, the reduction rate is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst."
[2] "Our results suggest that under precise reaction conditions (concentration, temperature, etc.), the rate of dissociation, thus the oxidation rate due to O2 dissociation can be low. Then, the oxidation rate could not be high enough anymore to fully compensate the reduction of the surface induced by the hydrocarbon (olefins, alcohols, etc.)."
[3] "Our results demonstrate the active role that CO2 plays in the ODP, it particularly helps to explain the run-away observed in some conditions of oxidation reactions and gives useful guidelines for operation applications."

1. Under the reaction conditions employed in this study, the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state, leading to a decline in catalyst selectivity due to a high reduction rate.

2. Our findings propose that under specific reaction conditions including concentration, temperature, etc., the rate of dissociation and consequent oxidation rate due to O2 dissociation might be minimal. This implies the oxidation rate isn't sufficient to counterbalance the reduction caused by hydrocarbons (olefins, alcohols, etc.), resulting in the catalyst operating in a less oxidized state.

3. Our results unveil CO2's active role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering insight into explaining the observed runaway in oxidation reactions under certain conditions and providing practical guidelines for operational applications.

1. 在本研究使用的反应条件下，活性位点被稳定在高氧化态，导致催化剂选择性下降，由于较高的还原速率。

2. 我们的发现表明，在特定的反应条件包括浓度、温度等下，解离率和由此产生的氧气解离引起的氧化速率可能很低。这意味着氧化速率不足以完全抵消由烃（烯烃、醇类等）引起的表面还原，导致催化剂以较不氧化的状态运行。

3. 我们的结果揭示了二氧化碳在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的积极作用，有助于解释某些氧化反应条件下观察到的失控现象，并为操作应用提供了实用的指导原则。
