[1] "It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "Beside the fact that catalytic surfaces often undergo a reorganization at the atomic scale when molecules adsorb on them [13], the dynamic character of oxide catalysts in oxidation processes mainly comes from their working mechanism,namely the continuous exchange of oxygen atoms between the gas phase and the catalytic surfaces."
[3] "Precisely, it has been shown that higher activities and selectivities are obtained on oxides with their superficial atoms stabilized in an oxidation state promoting easy oxygen exchanges and reconstruction."
[4] "The stabilization of the superficial atoms of the catalytic surface in their most efficient oxidation state can be achieved through a global approach by tuning the conditions of reaction, namely by adjusting the ratio of the partial pressures of oxygen and hydrocarbon in the gas feed, and the temperature, and by adapting the catalyst formulations, e.g. through the addition of elements in tiny quantities."
[5] "In fact, in fixed-bed reactors, both the partial pressure and the temperature may vary along the catalyst bed and it may thus be very difficult to maintain, in a controlled manner, the surface in a desired oxidation state."
[6] "For these systems, the injection of dopes in the gas feed appears as a very useful tool."
[7] "It is a very flexible method that will allow either to incorporate the dope directly in the gas feed at the reactor inlet or at the level of the different sections along the catalyst bed."
[8] "In all of these cases, important and interesting effects have been observed justifying the aim of the present work."
[9] "The use of CO2 as a dope leads to obvious difficulties of interpretation related to its extremely unfavorable thermodynamics."
[10] "Our suggestion is that the adsorbed oxygen species, resulting from the dissociation of CO2 at the surface of the catalyst induces the oxidation of reduced Mo-containing oxides at temperatures around 400450 C."
[11] "In addition, these oxygen species play the role of a powerful oxidant, stronger than those given by molecular oxygen."
[12] "Indeed, CO2 increases conversion but decreases selectivity."
[13] "Under particular conditions, CO2 can promote the formation of propene but with a loss in the selectivity."
[14] "They give strong arguments revealing a new role attributed to CO2 during the catalytic reaction."
[15] "They give guidelines for a utilization of CO2 as a dope in industrial applications."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The dynamic processes that occur on the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are mainly due to the continuous exchange of oxygen atoms between the gas phase and the catalytic surfaces. Higher activities and selectivities are achieved by stabilizing the superficial atoms of the catalyst in an oxidation state that promotes easy oxygen exchanges and reconstruction.

2. The stabilization of the superficial atoms of the catalytic surface in their most efficient oxidation state can be achieved by adjusting the conditions of reaction, including the ratio of the partial pressures of oxygen and hydrocarbon in the gas feed, and the temperature, and by adding elements in tiny quantities to the catalyst formulation.

3. In fixed-bed reactors, maintaining the surface in a desired oxidation state becomes challenging due to variations in both the partial pressure and temperature along the catalyst bed. This necessitates the use of gaseous dopes in the gas feed as a useful tool.

4. Gaseous dopes, such as CO2, can be injected directly into the gas feed at the reactor inlet or at different sections along the catalyst bed. This method is flexible and allows for the incorporation of dopes without requiring any modification of existing commercial units.

5. The effects of gaseous dopes in catalytic reactions, such as CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), have been observed and justified. CO2 can induce the oxidation of reduced Mo-containing oxides at temperatures around 400450 C, resulting in a powerful oxidant stronger than molecular oxygen.

6. The use of CO2 as a dopant increases the conversion of hydrocarbons but decreases selectivity. However, under certain conditions, CO2 can promote the formation of propene with a loss in selectivity.

7. The use of CO2 as a dopant provides new insights into the role of CO2 during catalytic reactions and offers guidelines for its industrial application.

1. 在烃类氧化反应过程中，氧化物催化剂表面动态过程的主要来源是其工作机制，即气体相与催化表面之间氧原子的连续交换。通过提高活性和选择性，可以实现表面原子在促进易氧交换和重建的氧化状态的稳定。

2. 通过调整反应条件，包括气体流中氧气和烃类的分压比例、温度以及对催化剂配方的小量添加，可以实现催化表面在最有效氧化状态的稳定化。

3. 在固定床反应器中，由于催化剂床内压力和温度的变化，维持表面在理想氧化状态变得困难。因此，向气体流中注入杂质作为有用的工具。

4. 向气体流中直接注入杂质，如二氧化碳，可以在反应器入口或沿催化剂床的不同部分进行。这种方法灵活且无需修改现有商业装置。

5. 在催化反应中，如丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，气体杂质的作用已经被观察到并得到解释。二氧化碳能够诱导还原钼含氧化合物在约400-450°C的氧化，产生比分子氧更强的强力氧化剂。

6. 二氧化碳作为掺杂剂的使用增加了烃类的转化但降低了选择性。然而，在特定条件下，二氧化碳可以促进丙烯的形成，并伴随着选择性的降低。

7. 二氧化碳作为掺杂剂的应用为催化反应中的二氧化碳作用提供了新的见解，并为其工业应用提供了指导原则。

1. The study investigates the impact of adding 3 vol.% of CO2 in the gas feed on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using NiMoO4 catalysts. CO2 acts as a strong oxidant, maintaining the catalytic surface in a high oxidation state, which contributes to the catalyst's enhanced activity and resistance against deactivation. 

2. CO2 promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. It can also improve propene formation under specific conditions. CO2 dissociates during the reaction, producing CO and an active oxygen species responsible for its oxidizing effect.

3. The results demonstrate that NiMoO4 catalysts, when used in the presence of CO2, maintain a higher oxidation state on their surface under reaction conditions. This higher oxidation state explains the catalyst's improved activity and resistance against loss of activity or deactivation.

4. The stronger oxidant character of O(a) aligns with the process's decreased selectivity and reduced O2 consumption. O(a) can oxidize selective products, leading to a loss in selectivity. 

5. The study finds that, for the first time, the oxidation state of catalysts in the ODP can be adjusted by incorporating small volumes of gas additives into the reaction feed. This dynamic control offers a promising approach for enhancing catalyst performance and selectivity.

2. CO2促进催化剂的非选择性，并能抑制失活。在特定条件下，它还能提高丙烯的生成量。CO2在反应过程中分解，产生CO和一种活性氧物种，负责其氧化作用。

3. 结果表明，当使用CO2时，NiMoO4催化剂在其表面上保持较高的氧化状态，这解释了催化剂的活性增强和防止活性丧失或失活的原因。

4. O(a)的更强氧化性与过程的选择性降低和氧气消耗减少相一致。O(a)可以氧化选择性产物，导致选择性的损失。

5. 首次发现，在ODP过程中，催化剂的氧化状态可以通过将少量的气体添加剂加入到反应流体中进行调节。这种动态控制为提高催化剂性能和选择性提供了有前景的方法。

1. Under the reaction conditions employed in this study, the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state, leading to a decline in catalyst selectivity due to a high reduction rate.

2. Our findings propose that under specific reaction conditions including concentration, temperature, etc., the rate of dissociation and consequent oxidation rate due to O2 dissociation might be minimal. This implies the oxidation rate isn't sufficient to counterbalance the reduction caused by hydrocarbons (olefins, alcohols, etc.), resulting in the catalyst operating in a less oxidized state.

3. Our results unveil CO2's active role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering insight into explaining the observed runaway in oxidation reactions under certain conditions and providing practical guidelines for operational applications.
