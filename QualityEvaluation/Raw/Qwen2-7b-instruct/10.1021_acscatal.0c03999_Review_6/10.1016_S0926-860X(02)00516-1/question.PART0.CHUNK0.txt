Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203 The active role of CO2 at low temperature in oxidation processes:the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts

Unit de catalyse et chimie des matriaux diviss, Universit catholique, Croix du Sud 2/17, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium Received 29 May 2002; received in revised form 23 July 2002; accepted 10 September 2002 Abstract The effects of 3 vol.% of CO2 added in the gas feed are investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene on NiMoO4 catalysts. In spite of the low reaction temperature range (400480 C), it turns out that CO2 is not inert during the reaction. CO2 behaves as a strong oxidant with respect to the catalyst. CO2 helps to maintain the catalytic surface in a high oxidation state under conditions for which NiMoO4 undergoes a reduction. CO2 clearly promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. Under particular conditions it can improve propene formation. CO2 is able to oxidize propane to propene. We suggest that CO2 dissociates during the reaction to CO and an active oxygen species, which is responsible for the oxidizing effect of carbon dioxide. This work opens promising perspectives in using CO2 to tune dynamically the oxidation state of working oxide surfaces in their most active and selective configurations for oxidation processes. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Beside the fact that catalytic sur- faces often undergo a reorganization at the atomic scale when molecules adsorb on them [13], the Corresponding author. Tel.: +32-10-47 36 65;fax: +32-10-47 36 49.

Gaigneaux is Chercheur qualifi e (research associate) for the National Foundation for Scientific Research (FNRS) of Belgium. dynamic character of oxide catalysts in oxidation pro- cesses mainly comes from their working mechanism,namely the continuous exchange of oxygen atoms be- tween the gas phase and the catalytic surfaces. Related to the dynamic character of a typical Mars and van Krevelen cycle, one must also mention the frequent tendency of the slightly reduced oxide surfaces to re- arrange their structures to more oxygen-thrifty ones.
The new structures are more stable but also less active [4]. At the macroscopic level, the dynamic behavior of the oxides at work materializes as structuration and reconstruction of the catalytic sites which lead to modifications with time-on-stream of the catalysts,of the kinetics (oscillations, bistabilities, etc.), and to 0926-860X/02/$  see front matter  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

the emergence of synergetic effects between phases [59].
All of this is contrary to the old static view that catalysts do not undergo any modification of their characteristics under the conditions of reaction. Pre- cisely, it has been shown that higher activities and selectivities are obtained on oxides with their super- ficial atoms stabilized in an oxidation state promot- ing easy oxygen exchanges and reconstruction. Pre- viously we mainly have focused our investigation on Mo-containing oxide catalysts, but our conclusions certainly meet those drawn by other authors with cat- alysts based on other metal oxides such as VPO and FePO catalysts [6,10]. Precisely, in the case of the oxidation of hydrocarbons on Mo-containing oxides (MoO3 and molybdates), high performances are ob- tained with catalysts having their surfaces maintained in a slightly reduced suboxide state [11].
The stabilization of the superficial atoms of the cat- alytic surface in their most efficient oxidation state can be achieved through a global approach by tuning the conditions of reaction, namely by adjusting the ratio of the partial pressures of oxygen and hydrocarbon in the gas feed, and the temperature, and by adapting the catalyst formulations, e.g. through the addition of elements in tiny quantities. The understanding of the selectivity of an oxidation process thus requires the knowledge of the effects induced by these factors on the architecture of the active sites and on the dynamic phenomena occurring at the surface of the catalyst during the reaction. But, in order to further improve the catalytic performance of a process, it is also cru- cial to develop in parallel new strategies leading to a better control of the dynamic behavior of the catalytic surfaces at work, with the objective of stabilizing in situ the active sites in a more active and selective configuration during the catalytic reaction.
A very promising approach to master in situ the dy- namic phenomena at the surface of oxides at work con- sists of the addition of gaseous dopes (also termed promoters hereinafter) in the reaction gas feed. In fact, in fixed-bed reactors, both the partial pressure and the temperature may vary along the catalyst bed and it may thus be very difficult to maintain, in a controlled manner, the surface in a desired oxidation state. This is nearly impossible by simply modifying the global operation conditions. For these systems, the injection of dopes in the gas feed appears as a very useful tool.
It is a very flexible method that will allow either to incorporate the dope directly in the gas feed at the reactor inlet or at the level of the different sections along the catalyst bed. In addition, in industry the ad- dition of dopes could be realized easily and practically without any modification of the existent commercial operation unit. Then, the efficiency of the modulation of the oxidation state of the active sites could thus be largely improved thanks to this approach.
Presently, the addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. The partial ox- idation of aromatic compounds, in particular of ben- zene to phenol, has been performed in the presence of a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen on supported oxide catalysts of V, W, La, Mo, etc. enriched in Pt or Pd [12]. Hydrogen has been used as a dope added to the oxygen-containing gas feed to perform the di- rect oxidation of propylene to propylene oxide on Ti catalysts [13]. At low temperatures (<500 C), CO2 has been used as a dope in the oxidation of alkylaro- matics over Fe/Mo/borosilicate molecular sieve [14],in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane over LaBaSm oxide catalysts [15], in the oxidation of bu- tane to maleic anhydride [16] and principally in the oxidative coupling of methane [1721]. The effects caused by the introduction of CO2 have been explained by: (i) a faster, more extended formation of oxycar- bonate phase and its regeneration; (ii) the formation of inactive carbonate species; (iii) the formation of peroxocarbonate intermediate which serves as a pro- moter for the gas phase oxygen oxidation; (iv) a poi- soning caused by competitive adsorption on the sites where oxygen (and possibly the hydrocarbon) adsorbs and by the inhibition of molecular oxygen adsorp- tion; (v) the decrease of the formation of coke; and (vi) the lower tendency for hydrocarbon to undergo deep oxidation. On the other hand, based on indirect observations, it can be suggested that co-adsorbates and gas dopes could modify the surface properties of the catalysts by: (i) changing the coordination and the electronic properties of the superficial metal atoms;(ii) a direct participation in the reaction mechanism;(iii) changing the acido-basicity of the oxides; (iv) blocking chemisorption sites; or (v) inhibiting the dif- fusion of surface species towards reacting molecules [22]. However, only a few experimental verifications of these conclusions are available in the literature and more detailed explanations are very difficult to get.

189 A detailed experimental approach is thus required in order to understand the exact effects of gaseous dopes during catalytic reactions. This is the aim of our investigations. In all of these cases, important and interesting effects have been observed justifying the aim of the present work.
The present communication reports on the effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP). Results concerning the use of N2O as a dope are given elsewhere [23]. In this work we focus ex- clusively on the role exerted by CO2 on the behavior,the characteristics of active sites and the performance of NiMoO4.
The use of CO2 as a dope leads to obvious diffi- culties of interpretation related to its extremely unfa- vorable thermodynamics. The two CO bonds in the CO2 are quite stable and a high amount of heat must be supplied for their dissociation. The entropy is not favorable because CO2 is a small gas molecule. Both terms of the Gibbs free energy function disfavor the conversion in the gas phase of CO2 to O2 and CO (un- der a pressure of 101.325 kPa and at 25.15 C, H is
293.0 kJ mol1). It is estimated that not more than 2%
of CO2 transforms to CO and O2 at 2000 C. These are the reasons why CO2 is traditionally considered as inert in oxidation reactions, which are indeed usually performed at temperatures low enough (<500 C).However, the interesting and surprising is that our results show exactly the contrary. We plan to demon- strate that, if all the dynamic processes occurring on the catalytic surfaces are taken into account, the dissociation of CO2 happens at lower temperature at the surface of our catalyst and must thus be consid- ered to interpret the experimental data correctly and exhaustively.The strategy of this work is based on reactions in the presence and in the absence of CO2, and on a detailed physico-chemical characterization of the NiMoO4 catalysts before and after reaction. In order to verify the oxidant character of CO2 and to investigate the possibility that CO2 oxidize propane, a catalytic test with a high amount of CO2 and a low amount of O2 was performed. The comparison of the oxidant role of CO2 and molecular oxygen was performed by oxidiz- ing a molybdenum suboxide. Astounding results are obtained. Contrary to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in catalytic oxidation reactions. Our suggestion is that the adsorbed oxygen species,resulting from the dissociation of CO2 at the sur- face of the catalyst induces the oxidation of re- duced Mo-containing oxides at temperatures around 400450 C. In addition, these oxygen species play the role of a powerful oxidant, stronger than those given by molecular oxygen. As an oxidant, CO2 in- fluences the behavior of the catalysts in oxidation processes. Indeed, CO2 increases conversion but de- creases selectivity. However CO2 is able to oxidize propane to propene. Under particular conditions, CO2 can promote the formation of propene but with a loss in the selectivity.Our results show that the addition of CO2 could be an important and useful tool to modulate the nature of the active sites during the catalytic oxidation reac- tion. They give a coherent and never reported explana- tion about the mechanisms by which such modulation could be realized. They give strong arguments reveal- ing a new role attributed to CO2 during the catalytic reaction. In addition, they also give guidelines for a utilization of CO2 as a dope in industrial applications.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
Nickel molybdate was prepared from a 0.0571 M aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·7H2O, Aldrich, +99%) and a 0.4 M aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Aldrich, +99%). A 1000 ml volume of the nickel so- lution was heated to 60 C in a 2000 ml vessel. Then,1000 ml of the ammonium heptamolybdate solution was added drop-wise to the nickel solution under vigorous stirring, with the temperature kept constant at 60 C. The pH of the mixture was kept constant at a value of 6 by the addition of ammonium hydrox- ide. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was filtered and the precipitate was dried in air at 110 C for 24 h.
It was thereafter calcined at 500 C for 4 h under 60 ml min1 of flowing oxygen (Indugas, 99.995%).
The molybdenum suboxide sample was prepared by the solid-state reaction under reduced pressure of an intimate mixture of MoO3 (BDH Chemicals, >99.5%) and MoO2 (Aldrich, 99%) with a 7/1 molar ratio. The mixture was introduced into a quartz tube in such a 190
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
way to avoid empty spaces and then the sample was evacuated to 105 mbar before the tube was sealed.
The tube was heated at 10 C min1 and maintained at 750 C for 96 h before being cooled to room tem- perature at a rate of 1 C min1. The identification of the obtained Mo suboxide sample was done by com- parison of the corresponding X-ray diffractogram with the JCPDS-ICDD database [24]. The suboxide sam- ple was a mixture of Mo8O23, as the main constituent,with a small amount of Mo9O26 and traces of Mo4O11 [25].
2.2. Catalytic performance measurements
Catalytic tests were performed in a conventional fixed-bed micro-reactor operated at atmospheric pres- sure. The reactor was made of a Pyrex U-tube with an internal diameter of 8 mm into which the cata- lyst was packed between two beds of glass spheres (diameter between 490 and 720 m) checked to be inactive under the conditions of reaction used. The mass of catalyst used was 250 mg. The catalysts were used as pellets with a granulometry between 200 and 315 m. The total flow of the reactant mixture was 30 ml min1 and helium (Indugas, 99.995%) was used as carrier gas. The reaction was run at 400, 450 and 480 C for 1 h at each temperature. Analysis of re- actants and products was continuously performed by on-line gas chromatography (GC) during the whole duration of the catalytic tests. The reactor outlet was analyzed using two columns, namely a Hayesep Q col- umn 6 × 1/8 100120 m and a molecular sieve 6 × 1/8 0.5 nm. The Hayesep column was used for the quantification of propane, propylene and CO2.
Water was also detected on the Hayesep column but was not quantified. The molecular sieve was used for the quantification of molecular oxygen. No CO signal was detected with this column for any of the catalytic reactions reported. Carrier gas in both columns was helium. In some of the catalytic tests, traces of other compound were observed on the Hayesep. This com- pound was not successfully identified but based on its retention time, it was possible to ascertain that it was a light compound. Based on calibrations and analyses of standards, the GC quantifications were established to be reproducible within ranges of about 1% for the signals of propane and CO2, and of about 3% for the signals of oxygen and propylene.
2.3. Test in absence or presence of CO2
The catalytic activity was measured in the absence and in the presence of CO2 (Indugas, 99.998%) intro- duced as gas dope in the feed. For the test in the ab- sence of CO2 (test TR), both the concentrations of O2 (Indugas, 99.995%) and propane (Indugas, 99.5%) in the feed were 10 vol.%. The concentrations of O2 and propane for the catalytic test in the presence of CO2 (test TRCO2) were identical to those of the test TR, but 3 vol.% of CO2 were added to the reaction feed. In order to maintain the space velocity constant for all tests, the flow of He was balanced so that the total gas flow was unchanged.
2.4. Test to verify the oxidant role of CO2
To further understand the precise role played by CO2, additional tests were realized with only a small amount of O2 (0.5 vol.%). One test was carried out in the absence of CO2 (test 0.5O2) and another one was carried out adding 10 vol.% of CO2 (test
0.5O2+10CO2). The quantity of CO2 formed during
the catalytic reaction was calculated by subtraction of the amount of CO2 introduced in the gas feed from the total amount of CO2 measured.
2.5. Test of oxidation of suboxide
Oxidation experiments were performed at 400 C with the Mo suboxide sample. Mo8O23 sample was oxidized for 15 min in the presence of O2 (10 vol.% of O2 in He, test SubOx10.0O2) and in the pres- ence of pure CO2 (5 vol.% of CO2 in He, test SubOx5.0CO2). As a reference, Mo8O23 was also submitted for 15 min at 400 C to a flow of pure helium (test SubOxpureHe).
2.6. Reproducibility of the measurements
As CO2 is produced in the reaction, the effects observed introducing CO2 are not very exalted, thus in order to have a more accurate estimation of the results a multiple realization of catalytic reactions under identical conditions and using catalysts from the same batch were performed. Results of repro- ducibility showed that the measured performances were accurate within ranges of about 1% (in relative)
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
191 for the conversions of propane and oxygen and within ranges of about 8% (in relative) for the yields in propylene and CO2. The range of accuracy on the selectivities was thus about 10% (in relative).
2.7. Homogeneous reaction and diffusion
limitations Homogeneous gas phase conversion of propane was not observed for any set of conditions of reaction de- scribed. No limitation by intraparticle gas diffusion of reactants was observed [11].
2.8. Characterization
Catalysts were characterized before and after the tests and the oxidation experiments by specific area measurements (SBET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dif- fuse reflectance IR spectroscopy (DRIFT), ammonia temperature programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and confocal laser Raman microscopy (Raman).
SBET were determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument using the adsorption isotherm of nitrogen at 77 K. A mass of 200 mg of sample previously degassed at 180 C for 2 h under a flow of pure helium (Indugas, 99.995%) was used for the measurement.
XRD was performed on a Siemens D5000 diffrac- tometer using the K radiation of Cu (λ = 1.5418 Å).
The 2θ range was scanned between 5 and 80at a rate of 0.02s1. Identification of the phases was achieved by using the ICDD-JCPDS database [24].
XPS was performed with two different instruments depending on the samples. NiMoO4 samples were an- alyzed with an SSI X-probe (SSX-100/206) spectrom- eter from Surface Science Instrument working with a monochromatic Al K radiation (10 kV, 22 mA).
Charge compensation was achieved by using an elec- tron flood gun adjusted at 8 eV and placing a nickel grid 3.0 mm above the sample. Pass energy for the an- alyzer was 50 eV and the spot size was 1000 m in di- ameter, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.1 eV for the Au 4f7/2 band of a gold standard. For these measurements, Ni 2p, Mo 3d, O 1s and C 1s bands were recorded. Mo suboxide samples were analyzed with an Axis Ultra spectrometer from Kratos working with a monochromatic Al K radia- tion (15 kV, 10 mA) and the charge compensation de- vice provided by the supplier (charge balance fixed at
2.3 V). Pass energy for the analyzer was 40 eV and
the spot size was 700 m×300 m corresponding to a FWHM of 0.92 eV for the Ag 3d5/2 band of a freshly sputtered silver standard. For these experiments, Mo 3d, O 1s and C 1s bands were recorded. For both exper- iments, the binding energies were calibrated by fixing the C(C, H) contribution of the C 1s adventitious car- bon at 284.8 eV. Peaks were considered to be combina- tions of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions in a 85/15 ratio, working with a Shirley baseline, for the measure- ments with the SSI, and in a 70/30 ratio, working with linear baseline, for those with the Kratos (following recommendations from the supplier). For the quantifi- cation of the elements, sensibility factors provided by the manufacturers were used. Decomposition of the Mo 3d doublets to Mon+ species was done by fixing an energy gap of 3.15 eV, and an area ratio of 2/3 between the Mo 3d3/2 and the Mo 3d5/2 bands. Solutions of the decomposition were afterwards validated by checking that the binding energies for the different Mon+ even- tually found fitted with those commonly accepted and that an energy gap around 1.2 eV existed between cor- responding bands of two successive Mon+ species.
Reproducibility of the quantitative aspects involved in the different alternatives to evaluate by XPS the de- gree of reduction of Mo in the suboxide samples was checked. For the interpretation of XPS data, atomic percentages cannot be used as such for discussion and therefore the data were discussed in terms of atomic ratios. Multiple XPS analyses of an identical batch of sample within a time interval of about 6 months re- vealed that the ratios Mo5+/(Mo5++Mo6+) and O/Mo were reproducible within a range of about 10% (in relative). Differences between values of atomic ratios were discussed in this contribution taking into con- sideration these levels of accuracy. However, it is dif- ficult to distinguish the different contributions in the O 1s band corresponding to the lattice oxygen of the oxides (at a binding energy of about 530.5 eV) and to the oxygen bound to carbon in an oxidized chemical environment (at a binding energy of about 532.7 eV).
As a consequence of that we did not use the atomic ratio O/Mo as a fully reliable evaluation of the de- gree of reduction of Mo in the samples (to do so,it would be absolutely required that only the lattice oxygen be taken into consideration in the calculation 192
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
of the O/Mo ratio). This was supported by the fact that the rearrangement of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the samples in the MoO3x series also makes the interpretation of variations in the O/Mo ratio difficult.
DRIFTS analyses were performed with a Brker Equinox 55 spectrometer equipped with an air cooled MIR source. Spectra were obtained by averaging 100 scans of the 4000400 cm1 range recorded with a spectral resolution of 4 cm1. DRIFTS was used with the precise objective to detect carbonate species that could have possibly formed at the surface of the cat- alysts during the tests performed with CO2 addition in the feed.
NH3-TPD was performed to determine the number and the strength of the acid sites. The samples were first degassed for 1 h at 470 C under helium. There- after, NH3 (anhydrous, Indugas) was adsorbed on the samples at 150 C as 10 pulses of 380 l. The desorp- tion profile was recorded by GC-MS, while heating the sample at a rate of 10 C min1 up to 470 C and then stabilizing it at this temperature for 30 min. The quan- tity of NH3 adsorbed and that desorbed were both mea- sured by titration of the ammonia trapped at the outlet of the reactor in a solution of boric acid. No other prod- ucts than NH3 were detected during the desorption step for any of the experiments carried out. In particular, no NO or NO2 was formed as ascertained by the absence of signal for the masses 30 and 46 followed by MS.
Raman was performed with a Labram spectrom- eter (Dilor) interfaced with an Olympus optical mi- croscope. The excitation radiation was a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) operated at a power of 10 mW. The 100× objective of the microscope was used, so that a spot of about 1 m at the surface of the sample was measured at once. Spectra were obtained by averaging 3 scans of the Raman shift range between 1200 and 200 cm1 recorded in 10 s with a spectral resolution of 7 cm1.
The identity of the spectra obtained at different posi- tions of each sample was systematically verified.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performances
3.1.1. Test in absence or presence of CO2
Fig. 1 shows the results obtained at 450 C with NiMoO4 as catalyst. The comparison of the performances obtained during the test TR (10% of oxygen and 10% of propane in the feed, no CO2 addition) to those obtained during the test TRCO2 (10% of oxygen + 10% of propane + 3% of CO2 in the feed) reveals that the addition of CO2 as a dope in the feed brings about (i) an increase of the conver- sion of propane (+18%); (ii) a decrease of the yield (10%); (iii) a decrease of the selectivity in propene (23%); (iv) a weak decrease of the conversion of oxygen (6%); (v) a decrease of the yield in CO2 (26%) and of the selectivity in CO2 (38%); (vi) the formation of traces of a non-identified oxygenated compound (as defined in the experimental section). At 400 C an increase in the conversion (28%) and in the yield of propene (+15%) with a loss in the selectivity (10%) and at 480 C, a loss in the yield (8%) and in the selectivity (8%) with an unchanged conver- sion and a decrease in the oxygen conversion and in the yield and of the selectivity in CO2 was observed.
Considering the degree of accuracy for the measure- ments of the catalytic performances, these tendencies must be regarded as significant.
3.2. Test to verify the oxidant role of CO2
When only a small amount of oxygen (0.5 vol.%) is used and no CO2 is added in the feed (test 0.5O2), NiMoO4 exhibits during the first hour of reaction an extremely high conversion of propane (about 80%) with respect to that obtained under the standard condi- tions of the test TR. However, propene is not formed at all and only a small amount of CO2 is produced.
Several other compounds are also detected. Despite the fact that their retention times suggest that these compounds are light and thus that they probably re- sult from the cracking of propane, they have not been identified successfully. After 1 h of reaction, the cata- lyst deactivates suddenly and its conversion of propane drops completely to zero. When the catalytic reaction is carried out with a small amount of oxygen, but hav- ing added CO2 (10 vol.%) in the feed (test 0.5O2 + 10CO2), the conversion of propane is low (about 2%),but propene is produced with a high selectivity (66%) and with an yield of 1.5%. Moreover, contrary to the behavior observed in the test 0.5O2, NiMoO4 does not undergo any deactivation with time-on-stream. During the test 0.5O2 + 10CO2 the catalyst keeps its perfor- mances constant for several hours of reaction.

For the test 0.5O2, the data plotted correspond to the performance obtained at the beginning of the test (during the first hour of reaction).
3.3. Characterization
The fresh NiMoO4 sample has a specific area value of 58 m2 g1. After the catalytic reactions with 10% of oxygen in the feed, the specific area of NiMoO4 drops very similarly for both tests TR and TRCO2 to about 39 m2 g1. On the other hand, the specific area increases similarly for both tests performed with only a small amount of oxygen in the feed, namely test
0.5O2 and test 0.5O2 + 10CO2, to about 90 m2 g1.
The fresh NiMoO4 sample has an XRD pattern possessing all the peaks characteristics of -NiMoO4 as recorded in file 31-0902 of the ICDD-JCPDS database [24]. Only two peaks of the diffractogram,at 2θ values of 26.6 and 27.3, do not belong to -NiMoO4, but they are pointing to the presence of -NiMoO4 in the sample as suggested by file 45-0142 of the ICDD-JCPDS database. The presence of -NiMoO4 is additionally suggested by XPS data (the excess of superficial Ni with respect to the sto- ichiometry) and Raman spectroscopy (the presence of bands typical of tetrahedrally co-ordinated Mo) as will be discussed later. DRIFT studies [26] showed some bands (1000 cm1 assigned to the M=O fun- damental stretching vibration of crystalline MoO3, at 976, 885, 823 and 810 cm1) characteristic of MoO3.
One must thus admit that the fresh NiMoO4 sample is a mixture of  phase, as the main component, and of  phase, as a minor component, both covered by some crystallites of MoO3.
Independently of the reaction conditions used, the two peaks pointing to the presence of -NiMoO4 almost completely disappear after the NiMoO4 sam- ple was used in a catalytic test. This observation indicates without ambiguity that -NiMoO4 is not stable during the catalytic tests, regardless of the presence or absence of CO2. This is consistent with the fact that -NiMoO4 is a metastable phase that, in 194

Fig. 2. X-ray diffraction patterns for (a) fresh NiMoO4 and recovered after (b) test TR; (c) test TRCO2; (d) test 0.5O2; and (e) test

principle, only exists at high temperature. Maintaining the NiMoO4 sample under the conditions of the cat- alytic reactions, namely heating the sample at 400 C or more, thus appears as a further possibility for the phase to recrystallize and disappear from the system.
Except for the peaks of -NiMoO4 that have disap- peared after reaction, the XRD patterns of the NiMoO4 catalyst after tests TR and TRCO2 are completely identical to those of the fresh sample (Fig. 2). This is also true when NiMoO4 is used with a small amount of oxygen in the feed provided that CO2 is also present (test 0.5O2 + 10CO2). But NiMoO4 undergoes a very pronounced amorphization during test 0.5O2, namely when the reaction is run with a small amount of oxy- gen and without addition of CO2 in the feed.
The Raman spectrum (Fig. 3) found for the fresh NiMoO4 exhibits a combination of peaks typical of Mo-O vibrations involving molybdenum atoms in an octahedral co-ordination (peaks at 938, 908 and 703 cm1) and of peaks typical of Mo-O vibra- tions involving molybdenum atoms in a tetrahedral co-ordination (peaks at 955, 886 and 818 cm1) [2228]. Peaks corresponding to octahedral co-ordina- tions are more intense than those corresponding to tetrahedral co-ordinations. After tests TR and TRCO2, both carried out with 10% of oxygen in the feed, all the peaks corresponding to tetrahedral co-ordinations have disappeared and only those cor- responding to octahedral co-ordinations remain with Raman shifts and intensities identical to those found for the fresh NiMoO4. On the other hand, after test
0.5O2, all peaks typical of octahedral co-ordinations
have largely vanished while the peaks typical of tetra- hedral co-ordinations have dramatically grown. These are the peaks already detected for the fresh catalyst with slight shifts at 945, 888 and 814 cm1, and an additional one at 935 cm1. The Raman spectrum for NiMoO4 recovered after test 0.5O2 + 10CO2, is almost identical to that recovered after TRCO2.
As concerns the DRIFTS experiments, for all sam- ples analyzed, namely the fresh NiMoO4 and the cat- alysts recovered after the different catalytic tests, no vibration band is found in the range 14501410 cm1.
This indicates that under any of the sets of reaction conditions described in this work, carbonate species never forms at the surface of NiMoO4.

Table 1 shows the main results obtained from the characterization of the NiMoO4 catalysts by XPS. The binding energies at which the element bands appear are almost identical for the fresh NiMoO4 and the samples recovered after the different catalytic tests. The only exception to this concerns the sample recovered after 196

the test 0.5O2 for which the signals of O, Mo and Ni appear at binding energies higher than for the other samples. This observation will be explained later.
For all the samples, no contribution in the C 1s signal for binding energies below 283 eV is found for any sample. This undoubtedly indicates that no car- bide species of Ni or of Mo are formed at the surface of the NiMoO4 catalysts during the test carried out in the presence of CO2. All samples after test in presence of CO2 present the same atomic ratios. The fact that the values for the Ni/Mo atomic ratios are higher than 1 indicates an excess of Ni with respect to the stoi- chiometry at the surface of the fresh NiMoO4 sample.
We cannot exclude the presence of some free Ni or nickel oxide at its surface. The decrease in the Ni/Mo atomic ratio after test in presence of CO2 could be correlated with the fact that -NiMoO4 disappears af- ter reaction and/or with the fact that the concentration of Mo increases after reaction. This could explain also the decrease in the O/Mo atomic ratio. The sam- ple recovered after test 0.5O2 presents a lower Ni to Mo atomic ratio. In this sample a high carbon atomic percentage was observed at the surface (79.8%). This high deposition of carbonaceous products makes the determination of the atomic superficial concentrations of Ni and Mo very difficult. Thus, one cannot draw any conclusion from the Ni to Mo atomic ratio ob- tained for that sample. On the contrary, in catalysts af- ter test 0.5O2 +10CO2, no carbonaceous product was observed.
A significant difference between the samples con- cerns the Mon+ species detected and their correspond- ing atomic concentrations at the surface of the differ- ent samples. For the fresh NiMoO4, as for the catalysts recovered after the tests TR and TRCO2, both per- formed with 10% of oxygen in the feed, only Mo6+ species are found. On the contrary, for the NiMoO4 recovered after test 0.5O2 + 10CO2, Mo5+ species are also detected in a quantity representing about 4% of the total molybdenum detected at the surface of the sample. However, for the NiMoO4 recovered after test
0.5O2, carried out with a small amount of oxygen and
without CO2, the quantitative decomposition of the Mo 3d band into Mo6+ and Mo5+ is made difficult be- cause of a deformation in the shape of the signal on the side of the high binding energies. An important point is that the Mo 3d band recorded for NiMoO4 after test
0.5O2 exhibits a much more intense signal for binding
Fig. 4. Mo 3d bands recorded for NiMoO4 (a) after test 0.5O2 and (b) after test 0.5O2 + 10CO2. energies below 232.0 eV than for the sample recovered after test 0.5O2 + 10CO2 (Fig. 4). Our interpretation of the deformation of the Mo 3d band on the side of the high binding energies is based on an effect induced by the large quantity of carbonaceous material present at the surface of the sample. Because of their likely intimate contact, this carbon layer provides a high electrical conductivity to the very outer surface of the sample (probably a layer of just a few, maybe one, atoms thick at the surface of the sample). As a counterpart, the near-surface of the catalyst (the layer just below the outer surface of the sample) is not in close contact enough with the carbon layer to have its conductivity increased. The result of this difference of behavior between the outer surface and the near-surface of the sample is the occurrence of the differential charging effect between the two parts of the samples. Thus a splitting or a broadening of the XPS signal of the elements present in both layers of the samples is observed. Namely the signal of the elements present in the outer surface of the sample appear at a higher binding energy that those present in the near-surface layer. This phenomenon is responsible of the increase of the binding energies of the global signals of Ni, Mo and O for the sam- ple recovered after the test 0.5O2 as compared with
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
197 the signals obtained for the other samples (Table 1).
In the particular case of the Mo 3d band, the de- formation above 238 eV is thus due to Mo atoms in the outer surface. It is noteworthy that a similar deformation of the O 1s signal is also observed as two distinct O 1s bands appear at about 532 eV (the normal O 1s position for Ni molybdate material) and at about 534 eV. The latest corresponds to oxygen atoms of the outer surface of the sample. The simi- larity of the gap between the two parts of the Mo 3d signal and between the two parts of the O 1s signal argues in favor of the differential charging effect as described above.
Because of the differential charging effect, an accu- rate quantitative determination of the concentrations of the different Mon+ species was difficult. However,having understood that the tendency of the Mo sig- nal was to go towards higher binding energies, thus to denote a higher oxidation state of the Mo atoms than it is in reality, the Mo 3d signal below 232 eV unambiguously indicates a high concentrations of Mo5+ and/or of Mo4+ species at the surface of the NiMoO4 recovered after test 0.5O2. Thus, it must be understood that the surface of the NiMoO4 catalyst is by far more reduced after test 0.5O2 than after test
0.5O2 + 10CO2. This means that CO2 succeeds to
maintain Mo in a high oxidation state under reducing reaction conditions.
3.4. Test of oxidation of suboxide
The other set of XPS data concerns the oxidation ex- periments conducted on the Mo8O23 sample (Table 2).
No significant binding energy difference was found between fresh samples and those recovered after the different oxidation procedure.

Binding energies (in eV) of the summit of the bands are given in parentheses. of the Mo 3d band for the fresh Mo8O23 corresponds to Mo6+ species. A Mo5+ contribution is also found representing about 11.2% of the total molybdenum detected at the surface of the sample. When Mo8O23 is submitted to a flow of pure He at 400 C (test SubOx- pureHe), its surface gets more reduced (15.4%), with the proportion of superficial Mo5+ species increasing with respect to the fresh sample. This observation is consistent with the known reduction effect induced at about 400 C by a flow of helium on the surface of molybdenum trioxide samples. On the contrary, Mo8O23 undergoes oxidation, corresponding to a de- crease of the proportion of Mo5+ found at its surface (4.9%), when it is submitted to the procedure with oxygen in the gas flow (test SubOx10.0O2). However,the proportion of Mo5+ species (4.4%) detected at the surface of Mo8O23 after test SubOx5.0CO2, namely using a gas containing CO2 diluted in He, is slightly smaller than when the sample is oxidized using a gas containing O2 diluted in He (test SubOx10.0O2).
It is noteworthy to mention that this is observed al- though a concentration of only 5 vol.% of CO2 is used for test SubOx5.0CO2, while 10 vol.% of O2 is used for test SubOx10.0O2. The variations of the Mo5+/(Mo5+ + Mo6+) ratios as shown in Table 2 and discussed above must be regarded as significant regarding the level of reproducibility of the measure- ments (namely 10% in relative). Furthermore, the experiment aiming at oxidizing Mo8O23 following the procedure of test SubOx5.0CO2 was duplicated to check the significance of the observation described above. An identical tendency of the suboxide sample was found. Therefore, it must thus be unequivocally accepted that CO2 succeeds in oxidizing the sur- face of a reduced MoO3x and this more efficiently than O2. 198

4. Discussion and conclusion
4.1. Explanation of the effects observed in the
presence of CO2 Data from the characterization exclude the possibil- ity that the catalytic effects induced by the addition of CO2 in the gas feed, observed when comparing tests TR and TRCO2, could be due to (i) a change in the surface area; (ii) a formation of a new compound, typi- cally carbides or carbonates, at the surface of the cata- lyst; (iii) a modification in the acidity of the catalyst; or (iv) to a modification in the surface composition of the catalyst due to a metal migration during the reaction,that would have happened to a significantly different extent, depending on the presence of CO2. The pres- ence of Ni oxide at the surface of the catalyst, due to the recrystallization of -NiMoO4 to -NiMoO4 dur- ing the catalytic reactions, could be evoked as a possi- ble origin of the differences of catalytic performances observed in this work. This possibility must however be discarded, as the recrystallization of the  phase and the associate accumulation of Ni were shown to occur identically regardless of the reaction conditions.
On the other hand, nickel oxide was checked not to have any role in the ODP, being almost inactive under the reaction conditions used in this work.
It could be argued that the changes in Mo co-ordination be involved. Two possible origins can be proposed for the tetrahedrally co-ordinated Mo. It may concern Mo involved in -NiMoO4, but it may also concern Mo atoms involved in a slightly reduced -NiMoO4 [26,27]. Regarding the second possibility,a parallelism can be made with the observation of Raman bands typical of tetrahedral Mo in slightly re- duced MoO3x samples, while fully oxidized MoO3,like as fully oxidized -NiMoO4, only possesses Mo in octahedral environment [28]. For the fresh NiMoO4 sample, the Raman bands typical of tetrahedral Mo are most likely due to the presence of -NiMoO4 in the sample. But reminding that the -NiMoO4 shown by XRD disappears during the catalytic tests regard- less of the reaction conditions, one must accept that the bands typical of tetrahedral Mo observed for the catalysts recovered after test 0.5O2 only point to the presence of Mo in a reduced -NiMoO4 matrix.
On the basis of this understanding of the spectra,the meaning of the Raman observations is thus that NiMoO4 catalyst, precisely the -NiMoO4 phase,undergoes an oxidation of its structure (presence of octahedral Mo) during both tests performed with 10 vol.% of oxygen in the feed, namely tests TR and TRCO2, and that the presence of CO2 in the feed does not perturb this tendency. At the opposite extreme,-NiMoO4 undergoes a clear reduction (formation of tetrahedral Mo) when it is used as catalyst in the presence of only a small amount of oxygen, namely in test 0.5O2. But an important point is that even when only a small concentration of oxygen is used,-NiMoO4 does not undergo any reduction when CO2 is added to the feed (test 0.5O2 + 10CO2). The main conclusion is thus that CO2 succeeds maintain- ing the structure of -NiMoO4 in a rather oxidized state during the catalytic reaction even when a high,and thus quite reductive, hydrocarbon to oxygen ratio is applied during the catalytic reaction.In all experiments carbon balance was <100%.In fact the sum of selectivities for propene and CO2 formation are 82.6, 55.7, 2.7 and 87.8% for the four tests reported (TR, TRCO2, test 0.5O2 and test 0.5O2 + 10CO2, respectively). Only traces of a non-identified oxygenated or light product were ob- served in some tests. We have not performed a detailed carbon balance analysis experiments to discuss more in detail these aspects. The objective of this work was principally to detect any change in the catalytic per- formances due to the co-feeding of CO2. However, XPS results give some indications. In test under low oxygen concentration (test 0.5O2), a high amount of carbon was detected. This could indicate that this car- bon unbalance should be accounted in part for as due to coke formation. However, similar concentrations of carbon was observed in the experiments TR, TRCO2 and in test 0.5O2 + 10CO2. Thus, apparently coke is formed in low amounts. We remark that DRIFT ex- periments are conclusive respect to the absence of any carbonate species formed during the reaction. The un- balance of carbon is higher in presence of CO2 (55.7),suggesting that the formation of another compound accounts probably more adequately for this unbalance.It is necessary to emphasize that comparing test TR and TRCO2, the additional compound was observed in presence of CO2 supporting the fact CO2 promotes the formation of some oxygenated or volatile products depressing the coke formation. The other products accounting for the 97.3% in test 0.5O2, were not
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
199 identified. In fact many compounds would be formed.
These compounds are formed as a consequence of the high reduction of the catalysts due to the absence of oxygen.
It could be argued that the effects in the selectivity observed by the CO2 co-feeding could be simply ex- plained by the consecutive nature of the formation of propene and CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation.
This could be absolutely logical because, the higher the conversion the lower the olefin selectivity then higher CO2 yield. But this explanation seems to be in contradiction with experiment results. Comparing tests TR and TRCO2, the oxygen consumption and the yield and selectivity in CO2 were always lower when CO2 was present. On the other hand, the fact that at high temperature the conversion remains unchanged and that simultaneously the selectivity decreases seems to be in contradiction with the consecutive reaction ex- planation. As a conclusion it seems that in presence of CO2, the catalyst principally promotes the forma- tion of other non-selective product (oxygenated and/or light compounds), different of CO2.
An alternative explanation, could be an inhibition of the coke formation, for example, by blocking the corresponding active centers of the catalysts by CO2 adsorption, leading to a higher oxidation state as the coke formation involves a deeper reduction of the ox- ide than the oxidative dehydrogenation. We have un- derlined that formation of coke is probably very low.
This alternative seems not to be supported by the XPS results which show the same amount of carbon af- ter test TR and TRCO2. But we have to emphasize that probably the sensibility of these techniques is not enough to discriminate on this aspect. Other arguments against this explanation come from the DRIFTS spec- tra. This technique is very sensitive to any modification by adsorption on the surface. Under the set of condi- tions used for this analysis, carbonate species where never observed. This indicates that if carbon species are formed, they are extremely low and the amount formed is independent of the absence or presence of
CO2. The catalytic results seem to support this expla-
nation. In fact, an increase in the conversion (+29% at 400 C and +18% at 450 C) and in all cases a loss in the selectivity was observed, what is contrary to the results expected by the blockage of the active cen- ters by CO2 which have to lead to a decrease in the conversion and an increase in the selectivity. Without discarding completely this alternative, it seems to us that, if occurs it cannot explain the present results.
As a consequence of this, the most likely expla- nation is that CO2 succeeds to modify the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the reaction conditions.
4.2. The dissociative adsorption of CO2
The results from confocal laser Raman microscopy and XPS, and the fact that Mo8O23 sample is suc- cessfully oxidized by CO2, show that the principal role of CO2 is to increase the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. Our results show, with- out ambiguity, that pure CO2 is able to oxidize a re- duced molybdenum oxide. This result has never been reported before. CO2 has been cited as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane but at higher temperatures (>500 C) [15]. Our suggestion is that the mechanism by which CO2 promotes such an ox- idation is via the formation of monoatomic oxygen species O(a) on the surface of NiMoO4. This species would form by the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4 following the reaction CO2 CO + O(a). However as already mentioned in the in- troduction, thermodynamics shows that the dissocia- tion of CO2 to CO and O2 is very difficult, especially at low temperatures and/or in the presence of oxygen.
Our argumentation in favor of the dissociative adsorp- tion is based on the following points. (1) The fact that Mo5+ in Mo8O23 is successfully reoxidized to Mo6+ by CO2 (in absence of O2) without formation of any carbonate. (2) Thermodynamics shows that the dis- sociative adsorption of CO2 to CO and O(a) should proceed very spontaneously under our reaction condi- tions. The coverage of adsorbed oxygen on copper sur- face, O(a), up to a half-monolayer, was determined by reaction with N2O and it was found to be controlled by the overall reaction of dissociation as indicated above.
If the standard state of O(a) is taken to be 0.5 mono- layer (the limit reached under experimental conditions in controlled reaction with N2O), then the equilibrium constant for the reaction of dissociation is 0.6 atm at 240 C and the free energy of formation of O(a) was indeed evaluated to be 240 kJ mol1 [29]. The dis- sociation of CO2 to CO and O(a) was already shown to play an important role in the synthesis of methanol from synthesis gas in the presence of CO2 and in the 200

water shift reaction under similar temperature [29,30].
(3) Experiments with LEED, TDS, HREELS, LEED IV, TAP, AES, PSRA, FEM evidenced the dissocia- tive adsorption in studies on Ni, Pt and Cu catalysts [2935].
In addition, it is authorized to admit that the equi- librium of the dissociative adsorption of CO2 to CO and O(a) is shifted to the right when it occurs at the surface of a slightly reduced oxide catalyst. In- deed, the latter will likely have a marked tendency to rapidly accommodate monoatomic oxygen species,like O(a), in its structure to undergo the reoxidation of its catalytic sites. It is indeed highly probable that monoatomic oxygen species are much more easy in- corporated as such in the reduced oxide matrix, than O2 that needs to be dissociated by the oxide before incorporation.
We have attempted to detect the formation of CO during the co-feeding of CO2. We have not been successful on that. Regarding the sensibility of our equipment, no indication of CO formation was ob- served. This results suggests that the dissociation of CO2 under the present experimental conditions seems to be very low. Other particular experiments with more sophisticated and sensible equipment as indi- cated previously are necessary. Important to underline is the fact that if the amount of monoatomic oxygen formed by dissociation appears to be very low, its effect seems to be very important.
4.3. Roles of O(a) produced from dissociation
of CO2 The amount of O(a) formed by dissociation seems to be very low. In the case of Cu catalysts, the coverage of the catalytic surface by O(a) represents between 10 and 50% of a monolayer under conditions typically used for the synthesis of methanol. O(a) on copper takes part both as reactant and also as a promoter of CO2, H2O and H2 adsorption. In the synthesis of methanol from synthesis gas, CO2 has apparently two effects. It is the main source of carbon for the methanol synthesis and it also forms the adsorbed oxygen that promotes the reaction [29,30].
In our case, it is difficult to determine in a direct way the quantity of O(a) formed during the reaction from the dissociation of CO2. This would require the application of heavy techniques as mentioned above.
An indirect measurement of O(a) could be envisaged by the quantification of CO correspondingly formed.
However, no CO was detected with our GC equip- ment, meaning that the quantity of CO formed during the reaction (both considering the CO coming from the combustion of propane and from the dissociation of CO2) is very low. This indirectly means that the quantity of O(a) formed is also very low. It must thus be concluded that, because the amount of O(a) formed is certainly very low, and taking into account the ef- fects brought about by O(a), O(a) is extremely more active as oxidant than O2.
Our results show that NiMoO4 used in the presence of CO2 works with its surface maintained in a higher oxidation state under the reaction conditions, which accounts for their improved activity and resistance against loss of activity or deactivation. The phe- nomenon is particularly well marked when comparing the behavior of NiMoO4 in the catalytic tests where oxygen was nearly completely absent from the reac- tion feed (test 0.5O2 and test 0.5O2 + 10CO2). With- out CO2 addition (test 0.5O2), NiMoO4 undergoes a dramatic loss of activity and significant modifications of both its structural and superficial characteristics.
Amorphization is observed by XRD, and a severe reduction of the catalyst is evidenced by Raman and
XPS. These deep modifications of NiMoO4 in the
near-absence of O2 are most likely the origin of the sudden loss of activity that it suffers under these con- ditions. At the opposite extreme, when CO2 is added to the feed (test 0.5O2 + 10CO2), NiMoO4 does not undergo any major modification, in particular amor- phization or reduction, and thus keeps its catalytic performance unchanged during long time-on-stream even when O2 is nearly completely removed from the feed.
The stronger oxidant character of O(a) is also con- sistent with the lower selectivity of the process (as O(a) probably succeeds to oxidize selective products) and with the lower O2 consumption (as part of the oxygen atoms come from CO2 and no more from O2 only) when it compares test TRCO2 with test TR.
O(a) would thus play at least two roles during the reaction. The first role would be to modify the nature of the active sites by maintaining them in a more oxidized state. These more oxidized states would be responsible for the higher conversion of propane, the formation of non-selective (cracked or oxygenated)
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 242 (2003) 187203
201 products and the loss of selectivity in propylene. The other role of O(a) would be to behave as a reactant and to react directly with adsorbed propane, so also leading to increases of the conversion of propane and the formation of non-selective products. O(a) could be able to oxidize some strongly adsorbed molecules (probable coke precursors) which cannot be oxidized by molecular oxygen, thus releasing non-selective sites on the catalyst.
However, the increase in the yield of propene ob- served at low temperatures is also a consequence of a promoting role of CO2 in the formation of propene. In spite of the fact that the increase in yield of propene is not so high (+15%), this result has been reproduced many times under our experimental conditions. How- ever, selectivity is always lower (due to the increase in the conversion). This could be an indication that,under particular conditions, CO2 can increase the for- mation of selective products (propene in our case).
This could be explained because, at low temperature the dissociation rate is lower, then the amount of dis- sociated O(a) is also lower. Thus either the catalysts could work in a less oxidized state which could pro- mote propene formation as has been discussed pre- viously [5,23,25] or simply because the quantity of O(a) formed is sufficient to regenerate active sites,but not large enough to deeply oxidize the propene formed.It has been clearly demonstrated (test 0.5O2 and test 0.5O2 + 10CO2) that when the amount of O2 is low, propene is produced only in the presence of CO2. There is two possibilities to explain this result. The first one is that CO2 is able to oxidize propane to propene on nickel molybdate catalysts.
If this is the case, propene is formed from propane at very low temperature (450 C). Apparently, this is a very new result which has not been reported previously in the literature. The second explanation is that CO2 modifies the nature of selective sites on nickel molybdate allowing the formation of propene following mechanisms which consider the oxidation of the catalysts by molecular oxygen. We have not enough arguments to discriminate which of these alternatives is more plausible, but what is clearly es- tablished is that only in presence of CO2, the catalyst produces propene and maintains its activity for a long time without decay, as is the case in the absence of
CO2.
4.4. Other implication of the active role of
CO2
A crucial implication of our results is that, contrary to what is believed, and in spite of the low temperature of the oxidation reactions performed in this work, CO2 is not inert in the reaction. Therefore, CO2 should be taken into account when interpreting data from reac- tions in which CO2 is formed (catalytic performances,kinetics, etc.). The most important to understand is that the higher is the formation of CO2 in the system,the higher is the amount of O(a) which can be formed by dissociation. Further, with the quantity of O(a) in the system increasing, the sites become more oxidized and less selective. Simultaneously, the deeper oxida- tion of propane and the intermediates by O(a) is fa- vored. As a consequence the catalyst is less selective,increasing the conversion of the paraffin and lowering the formation of selective products. It is thus crucial to understand that CO2 is not only a non-selective prod- uct but it also catalyzes, via O(a), the non-selectivity of the catalyst.
However, as discussed above, under precise reac- tion conditions, CO2 could increase the formation of selective products, however, with a loss in the selec- tivity due to the increasing of the propane conversion.
4.5. Control of the oxidation state by CO2
as a dope in the gas feed Our results show for the first time that, in the ODP,the oxidation state of the catalysts can be tuned by adding small amounts of gas dopes in the reaction feed. This is a direct consequence of the dynamic behavior of the catalysts during the reaction. In this work we restricted our investigation on the effects of CO2 dopes, but corresponding similar results con- cerning the effects of N2O dopes are reported else- where [23,36,37]. In both cases, significant beneficial promoting effects have been obtained.
We have considered CO2 as a dope in the gas feed in the ODP. It is obvious that our findings can bring fruitful information and can be applied to other ox- idation reactions. In the present case, CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo in the catalysts, so pro- moting their non-selectivity. This is a consequence of the equilibrium between the reduction (brought by propane) and the oxidation (brought by molecular 202

oxygen and O(a)) of the catalytic surface as described by the Mars and van Krevelen cycle. Under the re- action conditions used in this work, the reduction rate is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst. Our results suggest that under precise reaction conditions (concentration, temperature, etc.), the rate of dissoci- ation, thus the oxidation rate due to O2 dissociation can be low. Then, the oxidation rate could not be high enough anymore to fully compensate the reduction of the surface induced by the hydrocarbon (olefins,alcohols, etc.). The catalyst would thus work in a less oxidized state that will probably, further improve the formation of selective products and/or its selectivity.
On the other hand, it could be recommended that the amount of CO2 in the system does not decrease below a certain threshold. CO2 has indeed been shown to be able to eliminate some resistant adsorbed species on the catalysts that cause its deactivation. These ad- sorbed species are not oxidized by molecular oxygen.
The O(a) formed by the dissociative adsorption of CO2 could facilitate the oxidation of these species,so cleaning and thus protecting the sites during reaction.
The injection of CO2 in the feed could thus appear as a promising way for further controlling or improv- ing catalytic performances. The adjustment of the con- centration of dopes (as it dictates the oxidation state of active sites) thus clearly appears as a promising tool to improve selectivity and deactivation.
Our results give a coherent explanation of the use of these dopes in some industrial processes. The oxidant role of CO2 has also been clearly shown. Our results demonstrate the active role that CO2 plays in the ODP,it particularly helps to explain the run-away observed in some conditions of oxidation reactions and gives useful guidelines for operation applications.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
