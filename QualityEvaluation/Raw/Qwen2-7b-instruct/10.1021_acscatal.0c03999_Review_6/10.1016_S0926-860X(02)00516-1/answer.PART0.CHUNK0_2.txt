1. The study investigates the impact of adding 3 vol.% of CO2 in the gas feed on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using NiMoO4 catalysts. CO2 acts as a strong oxidant, maintaining the catalytic surface in a high oxidation state, which contributes to the catalyst's enhanced activity and resistance against deactivation. 

2. CO2 promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. It can also improve propene formation under specific conditions. CO2 dissociates during the reaction, producing CO and an active oxygen species responsible for its oxidizing effect.

3. The results demonstrate that NiMoO4 catalysts, when used in the presence of CO2, maintain a higher oxidation state on their surface under reaction conditions. This higher oxidation state explains the catalyst's improved activity and resistance against loss of activity or deactivation.

4. The stronger oxidant character of O(a) aligns with the process's decreased selectivity and reduced O2 consumption. O(a) can oxidize selective products, leading to a loss in selectivity. 

5. The study finds that, for the first time, the oxidation state of catalysts in the ODP can be adjusted by incorporating small volumes of gas additives into the reaction feed. This dynamic control offers a promising approach for enhancing catalyst performance and selectivity.

1. 研究考察了向丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）过程中，通过NiMoO4催化剂使用3 vol.% CO2气体添加剂的影响。CO2表现出强烈的氧化性，维持催化表面处于高氧化状态，这有助于催化剂的活性增强和防止失活。

2. CO2促进催化剂的非选择性，并能抑制失活。在特定条件下，它还能提高丙烯的生成量。CO2在反应过程中分解，产生CO和一种活性氧物种，负责其氧化作用。

3. 结果表明，当使用CO2时，NiMoO4催化剂在其表面上保持较高的氧化状态，这解释了催化剂的活性增强和防止活性丧失或失活的原因。

4. O(a)的更强氧化性与过程的选择性降低和氧气消耗减少相一致。O(a)可以氧化选择性产物，导致选择性的损失。

5. 首次发现，在ODP过程中，催化剂的氧化状态可以通过将少量的气体添加剂加入到反应流体中进行调节。这种动态控制为提高催化剂性能和选择性提供了有前景的方法。
