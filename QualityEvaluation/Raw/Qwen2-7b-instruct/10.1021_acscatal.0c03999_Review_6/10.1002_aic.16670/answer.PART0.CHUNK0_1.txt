[1] "The present work aimed to identify bimetallic combinations that were active and selective for the reactions of CO2+C3H8."
[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[3] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[4] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their reactivity towards CO2 and propane. Fe oxide supports with high reducibility facilitate better interaction with CO2 molecules, enhancing the activation and subsequent reaction rates.

2. Bimetallic combinations with Ni3 and Co3 outperform those with Fe3 in terms of activity and stability for CO2-ODHP reactions. This suggests that Ni and Co interact synergistically with Pt or Pd, leading to more efficient catalytic sites and improved stability.

3. Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit selectivity towards CO2-ODHP reactions, with the selectivity being modifiable by adjusting the Ni content. This indicates that the nature of the interaction between Fe and Ni can be tuned to favor specific reaction pathways.

4. Increasing the Ni content in Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts shifts the selectivity towards the DRP pathway, implying that higher Ni content reduces the efficiency of CO2-ODHP reactions. This suggests that the balance between Ni and Fe plays a crucial role in determining the optimal catalytic activity and selectivity.

1. 铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，通过影响其对CO2和丙烷的反应性来实现。具有高还原性的铁氧化物支持体能够促进与CO2分子的更好相互作用，从而提高激活和后续反应速率。

2. 含有Ni3和Co3的双金属组合在CO2-ODHP反应中比Fe3更活跃且稳定性更高。这表明Ni和Co与Pt或Pd之间存在协同作用，导致更有效的催化位点和改善的稳定性。

3. 含有Fe的双金属催化剂表现出选择性，倾向于CO2-ODHP反应，选择性可以通过调整Ni含量进行修改。这表明Fe和Ni之间的相互作用可以被调整以偏好特定的反应途径。

4. 增加Fe-Ni双金属催化剂中的Ni含量会将选择性转向DRP途径，这意味着更高的Ni含量减少了CO2-ODHP反应的效率。这表明Ni和Fe之间的平衡对于确定最佳催化活性和选择性至关重要。
