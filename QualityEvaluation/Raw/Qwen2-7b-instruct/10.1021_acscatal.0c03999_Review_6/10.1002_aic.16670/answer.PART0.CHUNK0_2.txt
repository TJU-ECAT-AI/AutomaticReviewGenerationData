[1] "The present work aimed to identify bimetallic combinations that were active and selective for the reactions of CO2+C3H8."
[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[3] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[4] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe oxide catalysts, especially those containing metallic Fe and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, show a preference for forming propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The presence of oxidized Fe on the surface is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. However, in catalysts with a greater amount of Ni than Fe, metallic Ni particles tend to dominate, potentially dampening the catalytic effect and shifting the activity towards the dry reforming (DRP) reaction pathway. This insight suggests that optimizing the atomic ratio of Ni to Fe can effectively modify the selectivity of Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts, favoring either CO2-ODHP or DRP, depending on the specific composition. This finding highlights the importance of balancing the metallic and oxidized components in Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts for achieving desired selectivity in CO2 reduction reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能产生了显著影响。含有表面金属Fe和反应条件下的氧化Fe的Fe氧化物催化剂表现出形成丙烯的偏好，但其性能较低，因为它们容易失活。在表面Fe含量高于Ni的情况下，氧化Fe的存在对于通过CO2-ODHP途径进行氧化性C-H键断裂至关重要。然而，在Ni含量大于Fe的催化剂中，金属Ni颗粒可能会占据主导地位，可能削弱催化效果，并将活性转向干重整（DRP）路径。这一发现表明，通过调整Ni和Fe的原子比，可以有效地改变Fe-Ni双金属催化剂的选择性，根据特定组成，要么促进CO2-ODHP，要么促进DRP。这突出了平衡Fe-Ni双金属催化剂中的金属和氧化成分的重要性，以实现所需的CO2降解反应选择性。
