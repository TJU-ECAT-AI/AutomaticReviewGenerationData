[1] "The present work aimed to identify bimetallic combinations that were active and selective for the reactions of CO2+C3H8. Pt1 and Pd1 based bimetallic catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 as well as non-precious metal combinations with varying atomic composition have been evaluated in flow reactor studies."
[2] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperformed Pd-based catalysts on both mass-based conversion and site-specific TOF values. Of the three transition metals examined with Pt1 and Pd1, Ni3 outperformed Fe3 and Co3 in terms of CO2 and propane conversions."
[3] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[4] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[5] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[6] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their ability to activate CO2 and facilitate the desired chemical transformations. The support material, CeO2 in this case, provides a framework for the metal to be dispersed and interact with reactants. Fe oxide, being less costly than precious metals, offers a cost-effective alternative for catalyst development.

2. The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts can be optimized by tailoring the atomic ratio of the metal components. For instance, increasing the nickel content in the Fe-Ni bimetallic system shifts the selectivity towards the DRP pathway, indicating that the specific arrangement and interaction between metals play a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

3. The findings suggest that the choice of metal components and their atomic ratio significantly impacts the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. By understanding these relationships, researchers can design more efficient catalysts tailored for specific applications.

4. The metallic nature of the catalysts under reaction conditions indicates that they are in a reactive state, which is conducive to the catalytic processes. This highlights the importance of the metal's electronic structure and its ability to facilitate electron transfer, which is essential for CO2 activation and subsequent reactions.

5. The variation in selectivity among different catalyst compositions underscores the complexity of metal-metal interactions. The ability to modify selectivity through adjustments in the bimetallic ratio suggests a high degree of tunability in the catalyst design, allowing for the optimization of product distribution according to specific needs.

6. The insights gained from studying Fe oxide-based catalysts can inform the development of more effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. By leveraging the principles of metal-metal interactions, researchers can engineer catalysts that efficiently convert CO2 to valuable products, contributing to sustainable chemical processes and the management of atmospheric CO2.
