The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts demonstrated better stability compared to Ni1 and Co3. The in situ XANES analysis indicated that both Fe3Ni1 and Fe1Ni3 catalysts contained metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This oxidized Fe under reaction conditions played a crucial role in promoting oxidative C-H bond cleavage through the CO2-ODHP pathway.

铁氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支持材料在决定其CO2-ODHP反应性能中起着关键作用。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在稳定性上优于Ni1和Co3。原位XANES分析显示，Fe3Ni1和Fe1Ni3催化剂均含有金属Ni和氧化Fe。这种反应条件下的氧化Fe对于通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。
