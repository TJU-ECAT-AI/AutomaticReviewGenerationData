1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting their reactivity towards CO2 and propane. Fe oxide supports with high reducibility facilitate better interaction with CO2 molecules, enhancing the activation and subsequent reaction rates.

2. Bimetallic combinations with Ni3 and Co3 outperform those with Fe3 in terms of activity and stability for CO2-ODHP reactions. This suggests that Ni and Co interact synergistically with Pt or Pd, leading to more efficient catalytic sites and improved stability.

3. Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit selectivity towards CO2-ODHP reactions, with the selectivity being modifiable by adjusting the Ni content. This indicates that the nature of the interaction between Fe and Ni can be tuned to favor specific reaction pathways.

4. Increasing the Ni content in Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts shifts the selectivity towards the DRP pathway, implying that higher Ni content reduces the efficiency of CO2-ODHP reactions. This suggests that the balance between Ni and Fe plays a crucial role in determining the optimal catalytic activity and selectivity.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe oxide catalysts, especially those containing metallic Fe and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, show a preference for forming propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The presence of oxidized Fe on the surface is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. However, in catalysts with a greater amount of Ni than Fe, metallic Ni particles tend to dominate, potentially dampening the catalytic effect and shifting the activity towards the dry reforming (DRP) reaction pathway. This insight suggests that optimizing the atomic ratio of Ni to Fe can effectively modify the selectivity of Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts, favoring either CO2-ODHP or DRP, depending on the specific composition. This finding highlights the importance of balancing the metallic and oxidized components in Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts for achieving desired selectivity in CO2 reduction reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能产生了显著影响。含有表面金属Fe和反应条件下的氧化Fe的Fe氧化物催化剂表现出形成丙烯的偏好，但其性能较低，因为它们容易失活。在表面Fe含量高于Ni的情况下，氧化Fe的存在对于通过CO2-ODHP途径进行氧化性C-H键断裂至关重要。然而，在Ni含量大于Fe的催化剂中，金属Ni颗粒可能会占据主导地位，可能削弱催化效果，并将活性转向干重整（DRP）路径。这一发现表明，通过调整Ni和Fe的原子比，可以有效地改变Fe-Ni双金属催化剂的选择性，根据特定组成，要么促进CO2-ODHP，要么促进DRP。这突出了平衡Fe-Ni双金属催化剂中的金属和氧化成分的重要性，以实现所需的CO2降解反应选择性。

1. The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe oxide catalysts can undergo partial reduction to create an active surface that facilitates CO2 adsorption and subsequent reaction. The support material, in this case, CeO2, allows for the reversible conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is essential for CO2 activation. The reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts is enhanced by the support material, enabling the catalyst to maintain its activity at high temperatures. The support material also affects the dispersion of Fe oxide particles, influencing the surface area and, consequently, the number of active sites available for CO2 adsorption and reaction. This interaction between Fe oxide and CeO2 supports can optimize the catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP by enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

2. Propane is considered for CO2-ODHP due to its abundance, competitive pricing, and the high demand for propylene. Propylene is a versatile building block in petrochemical industries, used in the production of various chemicals and materials such as fibers and textiles. Its widespread application necessitates efficient and scalable production methods, making propane an attractive feedstock for CO2 reduction processes.

3. Chromium-based catalysts have been the primary focus in CO2-ODHP efforts. These catalysts are effective in activating CO2 due to the formation of a Cr6+ active center, which is a result of a redox cycle involving Cr3+. However, their implementation is limited by short lifecycles and high toxicity, posing challenges for practical industrial application.

4. Bimetallic catalysts offer an opportunity to design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to their parent metals. By combining two metals with complementary properties, bimetallic catalysts can exhibit synergistic effects that enhance the overall catalytic performance. This is particularly beneficial in CO2-ODHP reactions, where the interplay between the metals can optimize the adsorption and reaction kinetics of CO2, leading to higher yields of propylene and synthesis gas.

5. Fe3Ni1 catalyst was found to be inactive at steady state, while Co3 exhibited low conversion. This suggests that the composition and structure of Fe and Ni in the catalyst significantly influence its reactivity towards CO2-ODHP. The inactivity of Fe3Ni1 and low conversion of Co3 highlight the importance of optimizing the metal composition to achieve efficient CO2-ODHP reactions.

6. Ni3 and Ni1 were found to be active catalysts for dry reforming, indicating that nickel-based catalysts can efficiently convert propane into synthesis gas. The selectivity and activity of these catalysts demonstrate the potential of nickel in CO2-ODHP reactions, suggesting that nickel might be a valuable component in developing catalysts for CO2 conversion.

7. Doubling the metal loading in the Fe-Ni catalyst (Fe9Ni3) resulted in increased conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity towards propylene. This observation indicates that adjusting the metal loading can influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The trade-off between conversion and selectivity emphasizes the need for fine-tuning the catalyst composition to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

2. 由于其丰富的供应、竞争性的价格以及对丙烯的需求，丙烷被考虑用于CO2-ODHP。丙烯是各种化学品如纤维和纺织品生产中的多用途基础化工原料。其广泛的应用需要高效的规模化生产方法，使得丙烷成为CO2减少过程有吸引力的原料。

3. 铬基催化剂一直是CO2-ODHP努力的主要焦点。这些催化剂由于形成了Cr6+活性中心而有效激活CO2，这是Cr3+参与的还原循环的结果。然而，它们的实施受限于较短的生命周期和高毒性，这为工业应用带来了挑战。

4. 双金属催化剂提供了设计具有改进活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂的机会，相比其母金属。通过结合两种具有互补性质的金属，双金属催化剂可以展现出协同效应，从而增强整体催化性能。这对于CO2-ODHP反应特别有益，因为金属之间的相互作用可以优化CO2吸附和反应动力学，导致更高的丙烯和合成气产率。

5. Fe3Ni1催化剂被发现处于静止状态时无活性，而Co3表现出较低的转化率。这表明Fe和Ni的组成和结构显著影响其对CO2-ODHP的反应活性。Fe3Ni1的无活性和Co3的低转化率强调了优化催化剂组成以实现高效CO2-ODHP反应的重要性。

6. Ni3和Ni1被发现是干重整的有效催化剂，表明镍基催化剂可以有效地将丙烷转化为合成气。这些催化剂的选择性和活性表明，镍在CO2-ODHP反应中具有潜力，暗示镍可能是开发CO2转换催化剂时有价值的成分。

7. 将Fe-Ni催化剂（Fe9Ni3）的金属负载加倍导致了转化率的增加，但负面影响了丙烯的选择性。这一观察结果表明调整金属负载可以影响催化剂的活性和选择性。转化率和选择性之间的权衡强调了需要精确调整催化剂组成以实现CO2-ODHP反应的最佳性能。
