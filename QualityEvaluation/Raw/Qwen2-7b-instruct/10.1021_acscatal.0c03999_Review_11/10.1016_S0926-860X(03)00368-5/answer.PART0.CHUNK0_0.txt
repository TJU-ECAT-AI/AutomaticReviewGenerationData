[5] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[6] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It states that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the nature of the dehydrogenation reactions being endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen or carbon dioxide is mentioned as an alternative to thermal cracking, offering the advantage of lower temperatures and high selectivity. However, the reaction with oxygen is exothermic and prone to overoxidation, necessitating the development of selective catalysts or the exploration of weaker oxidants. The document focuses on the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of propane, achieving high selectivity and low temperatures. It highlights the effectiveness of gallium oxide catalysts, particularly in the presence of carbon dioxide, for the dehydrogenation of propane. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. The promoting role of carbon dioxide is observed only in the initial stages of the reaction, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst. The document concludes that the key challenge remains the development of a catalyst with desirable selectivity for the dehydrogenation of propane.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢将丙烷转化为丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。它指出，在这些过程中，丙烷的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃显著不同，因为脱氢反应是吸热的，需要高温和低压以获得良好的乙烯产率。氧气或二氧化碳的氧化脱氢作为一种替代的热裂解方法被提及，其优点在于较低的温度和高选择性。然而，氧气反应是放热的，并且容易过氧化，因此需要开发选择性催化剂或者探索较弱的氧化剂。文档重点介绍了利用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用，实现了较高的选择性和低温度。它强调了镓氧化物催化剂的有效性，尤其是在二氧化碳存在的条件下，用于丙烷脱氢。向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化活性丧失，表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。二氧化碳促进作用仅在反应初期观察到，并且它不会抑制催化剂的快速失活。文档总结说，关键挑战仍然是开发具有高选择性的催化剂来实现丙烷脱氢。
