The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It states that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the nature of the dehydrogenation reactions being endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen or carbon dioxide is mentioned as an alternative to thermal cracking, offering the advantage of lower temperatures and high selectivity. However, the reaction with oxygen is exothermic and prone to overoxidation, necessitating the development of selective catalysts or the exploration of weaker oxidants. The document focuses on the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of propane, achieving high selectivity and low temperatures. It highlights the effectiveness of gallium oxide catalysts, particularly in the presence of carbon dioxide, for the dehydrogenation of propane. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. The promoting role of carbon dioxide is observed only in the initial stages of the reaction, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst. The document concludes that the key challenge remains the development of a catalyst with desirable selectivity for the dehydrogenation of propane.

The document discusses various methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It mentions dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. However, the specific details of reaction conditions for each method are not provided in the document. It does mention that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its unique chemical structure and bonding characteristics. Propane's dehydrogenation is typically nonselective due to the equal chance of all CH bonds to react. However, the presence of CO2 in the process can enhance the selectivity to propene at relatively low temperatures compared to other dehydrogenation methods. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is noted as an effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, achieving a high yield of propene with high selectivity. This is in contrast to methane and ethane, which may require different catalysts or conditions for effective dehydrogenation due to their differing chemical properties.

1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene over gallium oxide in the presence of CO2 has been studied. This process requires high temperatures and low pressures. In the presence of CO2, propane conversion and propene selectivity reached 33% and 93% after 0.2 hours of reaction, compared to 25% conversion and 90% selectivity in argon atmosphere under the same conditions.

2. Carbon dioxide plays a role in enhancing the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst. It shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products by consuming hydrogen produced in the reaction.

3. The introduction of potassium to the Ga2O3 catalyst results in a loss of catalytic activity. This is likely due to potassium blocking active sites for dehydrogenation, as acidic sites are suspected to be active in the reaction.

4. The activity of gallium oxide catalysts is influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in de-NOx reactions due to their weaker acidity. On the other hand, Lewis acid sites may be active in ethane dehydrogenation.

5. The dehydrogenation of propane occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst, as evidenced by the loss of activity in potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.

6. Gallium oxide catalysts have been proven to be active in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. The initial promotion of the catalyst by CO2 is observed, but it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

7. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 can be explained by its ability to react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface or act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative pathway.

8. XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase is -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, K2CO3 is also detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under CO2 flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst was more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 在二氧化碳的存在下，通过镓氧化物对丙烷进行脱氢反应以生成丙烯进行了研究。此过程需要高温和低压。在二氧化碳存在下，0.2小时后反应的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性分别达到33%和93%，而氩气气氛下的转化率和选择性分别为25%和90%。

2. 二氧化碳在提高镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性方面起着作用。它通过消耗反应中产生的氢气，将脱氢平衡向产物方向移动。

3. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化活性丧失。这可能是因为钾阻止了脱氢反应的活性位点，因为酸性位点被怀疑是乙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点。

4. 镓氧化物催化剂的活性受其酸碱性质的影响。支持的镓氧化物在去除氮氧化物反应中优于沸石，由于它们的较弱酸性。另一方面，在乙烷脱氢反应中，Lewis酸位点可能是活性位点。

5. 丙烷的脱氢反应发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这是由钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂活性下降所证明的。

6. 镓氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在下表现出对丙烷到丙烯的脱氢活性。在反应初期观察到二氧化碳的促进作用，但不会抑制催化剂的快速失活。

7. 二氧化碳在使用二氧化碳的脱氢反应中可以解释为与吸附在镓氧化物表面的氢气反应或作为氧化途径中的温和氧化剂。

8. 粉末X射线衍射分析显示，所有镓氧化物样品的主要相都是-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的镓氧化物形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。在二氧化碳流动下的脱氢反应前后，未观察到衍射图案的显著变化。然而，新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂比反应后873K的催化剂更非晶态。

The selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be achieved through various halogen-assisted methods, including oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen, oxidative dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions vary significantly depending on the method used. For instance, oxidative dehydrogenation typically involves the use of oxygen, while oxyhalogenation uses halogens. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of salts containing metal halides.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its structure and electronic properties. Propane's three carbon atoms allow for the possibility of multiple dehydrogenation pathways, leading to a mix of products including propene, ethane, ethene, and methane. This non-selective nature contrasts with the more straightforward reactions of methane and ethane, which tend to undergo simpler transformations.

The presence of halogens can assist in the dehydrogenation process by acting as oxidants, helping to drive the reaction forward. Oxygen, when used in oxidative dehydrogenation, also plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards propene production. However, the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mild oxidant is particularly advantageous because it allows for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures, with high selectivity to C3H6.

Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is found to be an effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The promoting role of CO2 is observed in the initial stages of the reaction, enhancing the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst. However, CO2 does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The addition of potassium to Ga2O3 leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. This is in contrast to the behavior of alkali metals, which can inhibit the catalytic activity.

In summary, propane's dehydrogenation to propene can be effectively achieved using various halogen-assisted methods, with CO2 serving as a mild oxidant to facilitate the reaction at lower temperatures. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired selectivity, reaction conditions, and the properties of the catalyst used. The acidic sites of gallium oxide play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of catalyst design and modification in achieving high yields and selectivities.

在多种卤素辅助方法中，可以实现丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯，包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些过程的反应条件根据所使用的方法有很大差异。例如，氧化脱氢通常涉及氧气的使用，而氧卤化则使用卤素。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及到含有金属卤化物的盐的使用。

丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应活性不同，主要是由于其结构和电子性质。丙烷的三个碳原子允许存在多个脱氢路径，导致产物包括丙烯、乙烷、乙烯和甲烷等多种物质，表现出非选择性的特征。相比之下，甲烷和乙烷倾向于进行更简单的转变。

卤素的存在可以在脱氢过程中起到协助作用，作为氧化剂帮助推动反应。当使用氧气进行氧化脱氢时，也通过促进向丙烯的转变来影响平衡。然而，二氧化碳（CO2）作为一种温和的氧化剂尤其有利，因为它允许在较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，同时保持高选择性到C3H6。

镓氧化物（Ga2O3）被发现是丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢的有效催化剂。CO2在反应初期展现出促进作用，增强镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性。然而，CO2并不能阻止催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化活性的丧失，这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。这与碱金属的作用形成对比，后者会抑制催化活性。

总之，丙烷在丙烯脱氢过程中可以通过多种卤素辅助方法有效实现，其中二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂有助于在较低温度下进行反应并保持高选择性。选择方法取决于所需的选择性、反应条件以及所使用的催化剂特性。镓氧化物的酸性位点在脱氢过程中起着关键作用，强调了催化剂设计和改性在实现高产率和选择性方面的重要性。
