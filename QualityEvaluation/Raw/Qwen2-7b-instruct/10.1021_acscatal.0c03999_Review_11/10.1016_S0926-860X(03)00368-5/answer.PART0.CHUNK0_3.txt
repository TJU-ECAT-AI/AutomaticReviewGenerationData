<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking.</p>
<p>Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selectivity.</p>
<p>In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3%.</p>
<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations, propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

The selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be achieved through various halogen-assisted methods, including oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen, oxidative dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions vary significantly depending on the method used. For instance, oxidative dehydrogenation typically involves the use of oxygen, while oxyhalogenation uses halogens. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of salts containing metal halides.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its structure and electronic properties. Propane's three carbon atoms allow for the possibility of multiple dehydrogenation pathways, leading to a mix of products including propene, ethane, ethene, and methane. This non-selective nature contrasts with the more straightforward reactions of methane and ethane, which tend to undergo simpler transformations.

The presence of halogens can assist in the dehydrogenation process by acting as oxidants, helping to drive the reaction forward. Oxygen, when used in oxidative dehydrogenation, also plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards propene production. However, the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mild oxidant is particularly advantageous because it allows for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures, with high selectivity to C3H6.

Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is found to be an effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The promoting role of CO2 is observed in the initial stages of the reaction, enhancing the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst. However, CO2 does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The addition of potassium to Ga2O3 leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. This is in contrast to the behavior of alkali metals, which can inhibit the catalytic activity.

In summary, propane's dehydrogenation to propene can be effectively achieved using various halogen-assisted methods, with CO2 serving as a mild oxidant to facilitate the reaction at lower temperatures. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired selectivity, reaction conditions, and the properties of the catalyst used. The acidic sites of gallium oxide play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of catalyst design and modification in achieving high yields and selectivities.

在多种卤素辅助方法中，可以实现丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯，包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些过程的反应条件根据所使用的方法有很大差异。例如，氧化脱氢通常涉及氧气的使用，而氧卤化则使用卤素。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及到含有金属卤化物的盐的使用。

丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应活性不同，主要是由于其结构和电子性质。丙烷的三个碳原子允许存在多个脱氢路径，导致产物包括丙烯、乙烷、乙烯和甲烷等多种物质，表现出非选择性的特征。相比之下，甲烷和乙烷倾向于进行更简单的转变。

卤素的存在可以在脱氢过程中起到协助作用，作为氧化剂帮助推动反应。当使用氧气进行氧化脱氢时，也通过促进向丙烯的转变来影响平衡。然而，二氧化碳（CO2）作为一种温和的氧化剂尤其有利，因为它允许在较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，同时保持高选择性到C3H6。

镓氧化物（Ga2O3）被发现是丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢的有效催化剂。CO2在反应初期展现出促进作用，增强镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性。然而，CO2并不能阻止催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化活性的丧失，这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。这与碱金属的作用形成对比，后者会抑制催化活性。

总之，丙烷在丙烯脱氢过程中可以通过多种卤素辅助方法有效实现，其中二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂有助于在较低温度下进行反应并保持高选择性。选择方法取决于所需的选择性、反应条件以及所使用的催化剂特性。镓氧化物的酸性位点在脱氢过程中起着关键作用，强调了催化剂设计和改性在实现高产率和选择性方面的重要性。
