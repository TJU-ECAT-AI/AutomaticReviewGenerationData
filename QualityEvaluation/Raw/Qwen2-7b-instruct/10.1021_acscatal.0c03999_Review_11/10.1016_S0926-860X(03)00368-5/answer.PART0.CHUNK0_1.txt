[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a method to obtain unsaturated hydrocarbons from feedstocks of the corresponding paraffins."
[2] "Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene."
[3] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[4] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[5] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes."
[6] "In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3%."

The document discusses various methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It mentions dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. However, the specific details of reaction conditions for each method are not provided in the document. It does mention that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its unique chemical structure and bonding characteristics. Propane's dehydrogenation is typically nonselective due to the equal chance of all CH bonds to react. However, the presence of CO2 in the process can enhance the selectivity to propene at relatively low temperatures compared to other dehydrogenation methods. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is noted as an effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, achieving a high yield of propene with high selectivity. This is in contrast to methane and ethane, which may require different catalysts or conditions for effective dehydrogenation due to their differing chemical properties.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷制备丙烯的各种方法。它提到了卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。但是，每个方法的具体反应条件在文档中没有提供。文档提到，丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃大不相同，这是由于其独特的化学结构和键合特性。丙烷的脱氢通常是非选择性的，因为所有CH键都有相等的机会反应。然而，在过程中加入CO2可以提高丙烯的选择性，同时在较低温度下进行脱氢。文献指出，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）是一种有效的催化剂，可以在二氧化碳的存在下催化丙烷脱氢，实现高丙烯产率和高选择性。这与甲烷和乙烷不同，后者的脱氢可能需要不同的催化剂或条件，由于它们具有不同的化学性质。
