<p>Dehydrogenation of propane to propene has a significant industrial impact as it enables the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons from paraffin feedstocks. This process is crucial for synthesizing compounds such as cumene, acrylonitrile, and high-purity polypropylene.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen is proposed as an alternative to thermal cracking, although it requires heat removal to prevent overoxidation and formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates.</p>
<p>Gallium oxide catalysts have been proven effective in dehydrogenation or amortization of light alkanes, and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen. Their activity is significantly influenced by acidity/basicity properties.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can enhance the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Under the same conditions, propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33% and 93%, respectively, in the presence of carbon dioxide, compared to 25% conversion and 90% selectivity in argon.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide catalysts occurs via the following steps: CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2 and H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O. Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen, shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products.</p>
<p>The role of carbon dioxide is primarily observed in the initial stages of the reaction, improving propane conversion. However, it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction appears to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of propane to propene using gallium oxide catalysts. The key points are:

1. Gallium oxide is an effective catalyst for dehydrogenating propane to propene.
2. Carbon dioxide enhances the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts, achieving higher propane conversion and propene selectivity.
3. The reaction proceeds via the consumption of hydrogen by carbon dioxide, shifting the equilibrium towards propene.
4. The role of carbon dioxide is limited to the initial stages of the reaction and does not prevent catalyst deactivation.
5. Adding potassium to gallium oxide decreases the catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites by excess potassium.
6. The reaction occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst, explaining the difference in reactivity between propane and other alkanes like methane and ethane.

文献讨论了使用镓氧化物催化剂对丙烷进行脱氢生成丙烯的过程。关键点如下：

1. 镓氧化物是有效催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的催化剂。
2. 二氧化碳可以增强镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性，实现更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
3. 反应通过消耗氢气来实现，二氧化碳促进氢气的消耗，使平衡向丙烯方向移动。
4. 二氧化碳的作用仅限于反应的初期阶段，并不能阻止催化剂的快速失活。
5. 向镓氧化物中添加钾会降低催化活性，因为过量的钾会阻塞活性位点。
6. 反应发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，解释了丙烷与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷在反应活性上的差异。
