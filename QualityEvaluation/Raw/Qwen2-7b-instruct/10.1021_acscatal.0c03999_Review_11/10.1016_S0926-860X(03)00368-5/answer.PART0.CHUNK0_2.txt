1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene over gallium oxide in the presence of CO2 has been studied. This process requires high temperatures and low pressures. In the presence of CO2, propane conversion and propene selectivity reached 33% and 93% after 0.2 hours of reaction, compared to 25% conversion and 90% selectivity in argon atmosphere under the same conditions.

2. Carbon dioxide plays a role in enhancing the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst. It shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products by consuming hydrogen produced in the reaction.

3. The introduction of potassium to the Ga2O3 catalyst results in a loss of catalytic activity. This is likely due to potassium blocking active sites for dehydrogenation, as acidic sites are suspected to be active in the reaction.

4. The activity of gallium oxide catalysts is influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in de-NOx reactions due to their weaker acidity. On the other hand, Lewis acid sites may be active in ethane dehydrogenation.

5. The dehydrogenation of propane occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst, as evidenced by the loss of activity in potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.

6. Gallium oxide catalysts have been proven to be active in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. The initial promotion of the catalyst by CO2 is observed, but it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

7. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 can be explained by its ability to react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface or act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative pathway.

8. XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase is -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, K2CO3 is also detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under CO2 flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst was more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 在二氧化碳的存在下，通过镓氧化物对丙烷进行脱氢反应以生成丙烯进行了研究。此过程需要高温和低压。在二氧化碳存在下，0.2小时后反应的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性分别达到33%和93%，而氩气气氛下的转化率和选择性分别为25%和90%。

2. 二氧化碳在提高镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性方面起着作用。它通过消耗反应中产生的氢气，将脱氢平衡向产物方向移动。

3. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化活性丧失。这可能是因为钾阻止了脱氢反应的活性位点，因为酸性位点被怀疑是乙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点。

4. 镓氧化物催化剂的活性受其酸碱性质的影响。支持的镓氧化物在去除氮氧化物反应中优于沸石，由于它们的较弱酸性。另一方面，在乙烷脱氢反应中，Lewis酸位点可能是活性位点。

5. 丙烷的脱氢反应发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这是由钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂活性下降所证明的。

6. 镓氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在下表现出对丙烷到丙烯的脱氢活性。在反应初期观察到二氧化碳的促进作用，但不会抑制催化剂的快速失活。

7. 二氧化碳在使用二氧化碳的脱氢反应中可以解释为与吸附在镓氧化物表面的氢气反应或作为氧化途径中的温和氧化剂。

8. 粉末X射线衍射分析显示，所有镓氧化物样品的主要相都是-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的镓氧化物形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。在二氧化碳流动下的脱氢反应前后，未观察到衍射图案的显著变化。然而，新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂比反应后873K的催化剂更非晶态。
