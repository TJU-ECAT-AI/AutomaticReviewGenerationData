<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates. Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range.</p>
<p>The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on. When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes. The steric constraints of the zeolite prevent the formation of molecules with more than 10 C-atoms.</p>
<p>Indeed it was shown by Chu that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600°C. The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi. They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (C1, C2).</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures, over Pt/H-ZSM-5. Thus we got information about the initial reactions occurring before the formation of aromatics starts.</p>
<p>The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane. Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5. Reversely the low deactivation of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples indicates that the active platinum is located inside the zeolite pores.</p>
<p>Over the whole temperature range the amount of pentanes formed over both catalysts was low. Not only higher products were formed: above 250°C over the 4 wt% Pt H-ZSM-5 catalyst equimolar amounts of methane and ethane were formed. In contrast the 0.4 wt% Pt catalyst produced only ethane as lower product.</p>

The literature discusses the use of zeolite H-ZSM-5, particularly in conjunction with platinum (Pt), for the conversion of propane into higher hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties facilitate the formation of carbenium ions through the adsorption of alkenes. These carbenium ions then react with additional alkenes to form dimers and larger molecules, with steric constraints preventing the formation of molecules with more than 10 carbon atoms. Ethane can be converted to benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at around 600°C. Propane conversion under moderate temperatures, over Pt/H-ZSM-5, reveals two key steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The presence of Pt particles near the acid sites enhances the conversion efficiency compared to physical mixtures. At temperatures below 350°C, butanes are the main higher hydrocarbons formed, while higher products like normal and iso butane are favored at higher temperatures. The Pt catalysts produce butanes due to the low concentration of propene, which leads to the formation of smaller oligomers that crack and recombine, primarily resulting in butane formation.

文献讨论了使用沸石H-ZSM-5，特别是与铂（Pt）结合，用于丙烷转化为更高碳氢化合物。沸石的强酸性特性促进了通过烷二烯吸附形成的碳正离子反应。这些碳正离子然后与额外的烷二烯形成二聚体和更大的分子，由于立体约束，防止形成超过10个碳原子的分子。在约600°C下，乙烷可以转化为苯、甲苯、二甲苯（BTX）芳香烃。在中等温度下，过Pt/H-ZSM-5催化转化丙烷揭示了两个关键步骤：首先，Pt催化的丙烷脱氢为丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合。Pt颗粒靠近酸性位点的存在增强了与物理混合相比的转化效率。在低于350°C的温度下，但烷是主要的较高碳氢化合物，而在较高温度下，则更倾向于形成更高产物，如正丁烷和异丁烷。由于丙烯浓度低，Pt催化剂产生但烷，这导致形成较小的寡聚物裂解并重新组合，主要结果是生成但烷。
