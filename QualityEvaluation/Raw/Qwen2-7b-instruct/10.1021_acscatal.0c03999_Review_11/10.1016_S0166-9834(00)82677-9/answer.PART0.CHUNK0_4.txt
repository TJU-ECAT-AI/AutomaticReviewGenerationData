[1] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[2] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[3] "Thus we got information about the initial reactions occurring before the formation of aromatics starts."
[4] "Firstly the conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[5] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[6] "The conversion started at about 200C and increased with temperature to about 18% for the 4 wt% and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C."
[7] "The deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5."
[8] "This may be due to an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5."
[9] "Reversely the low deactivation of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples indicates that the active platinum is located inside the zeolite pores."
[10] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."

1. Chu demonstrated that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C. This process also involves the formation of smaller products (C1, C2).

2. Inui and Okazumi observed that the formation of aromatics at high temperatures is linked to the formation of smaller products (C1, C2).

3. The study provided insights into the initial reactions that occur prior to the formation of aromatics.

4. The conversion experiments displayed good reproducibility within the temperature range of 200-350C.

5. The activity of the Pt loaded H-ZSM-5 catalysts was significantly higher compared to the catalysts where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were physically mixed.

6. The conversion process started at around 200C and increased to about 18% for the 4 wt% Pt zeolite and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C.

7. The deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst was minimal compared to the activity reduction of a physical mixture of Pt/SiO2 and H-ZSM-5.

8. The low deactivation rate of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst samples suggests that the active platinum is situated within the zeolite pores.

9. The lack of change in the H/C ratio during the reaction indicates that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form. The hydrogen released by propene formation is fully utilized for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.

1. Chu证明了在约600°C时，可以通过铂负载的H-ZSM-5将乙烷转化为BTX芳烃。这一过程还伴随着较小产物（C1，C2）的形成。

2. Inui和Okazumi观察到在高温下形成芳烃与形成较小产物（C1，C2）之间存在关联。

3. 研究提供了关于在形成芳烃之前发生的初始反应的见解。

4. 转化实验在200-350°C的温度范围内显示出了良好的可重复性。

5. Pt负载的H-ZSM-5催化剂的活性明显高于铂和H-ZSM-5物理混合的催化剂。

6. 转化过程从约200°C开始，4 wt% Pt硅酸盐/氢氧化铝的转化率约为18%，0.4 wt% Pt硅酸盐的转化率约为12%在330°C时。

7. 双功能催化剂的失活程度远低于铂/SiO2和H-ZSM-5物理混合物的活性降低。

8. Pt/H-ZSM-5催化剂样品的低失活率表明活性铂位于沸石孔内。

9. 反应过程中H/C比未发生变化，表明没有分子形式的氢损失。由丙烯形成的氢完全用于氢化和氢解。
