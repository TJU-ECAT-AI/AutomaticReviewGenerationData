[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on."
[4] "By the action of the strong acid groups these can be cracked to the reactive small alkenes mentioned above."
[5] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[6] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[7] "The conversion experiments however, were badly reproduc- able. At 300C the initial conversion to higher products fluctuates around 7 C%."
[8] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[9] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[10] "The product distributions obtained with the Pt loaded catalysts showed a number of interesting features (see Figure 2)."
[11] "For both catalysts the absolute amount of unsaturated products was small; mainly alkanes were formed."
[12] "The deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5."
[13] "This may be due to the fact that the active Pt is situated inside the pores where the shape selective properties of the zeolite prevent coke deposition."
[14] "The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite."
[15] "The activity balance between Pt and the acid sites, is not perfect. The platinum produces but small amounts of propene, while the zeolite besides oligomerization inevitably also catalyzes cracking."
[16] "It appears that during propane conversion platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[17] "Consequently also low hydrocarbons (methane, ethane), and mainly saturated hydrocarbons are formed."

The literature describes the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons using a bifunctional catalyst consisting of platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite. This process involves two main steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by the platinum component, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The conversion is more effective when Pt is incorporated into the zeolite pores rather than mixed physically with the zeolite, resulting in a higher conversion rate and less deactivation. The literature also mentions that at low temperatures, the main product formed is butane, which suggests that the activity balance between Pt and the acid sites is not perfect, leading to cracking in addition to oligomerization. The process is selective for butane formation, although hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis by the Pt component contribute to the formation of methane, ethane, and other saturated hydrocarbons.

文献描述了使用铂（Pt）和H-ZSM-5沸石组成的双功能催化剂将丙烷转化为更高碳数化合物的过程。该过程涉及两个主要步骤：首先，铂成分催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯；然后，在沸石的酸性位点上进行丙烯的聚合。当Pt被引入到沸石孔中时，这种转化更为有效，结果是转化率更高且催化剂的失活较少。文献还指出，在低温下，主要产物为丁烷，这表明Pt和酸性位点之间的活性平衡并不完美，导致除了聚合之外还会发生裂解。此过程对丁烷的选择性较高，但铂成分的氢化和氢解作用也会导致甲烷、乙烷和其他饱和烃的形成。
