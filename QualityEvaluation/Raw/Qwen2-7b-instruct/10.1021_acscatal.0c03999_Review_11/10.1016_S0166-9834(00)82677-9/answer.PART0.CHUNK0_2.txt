<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates.</p>
<p>In addition, the unique pore system of this type of zeolite hinders the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules [l], thus preventing the so-called coke deposition, which normally causes a rapid deactivation of acid catalysts.</p>
<p>Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3]. The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Another possibility to start the reaction sequence is offered by the 0166-9834/85/$03.30 0 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.</p>
<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z]. The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on. When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes. The steric constraints of the zeolite prevent the formation of molecules with more than 10 C-atoms (see Scheme 1).</p>
<p>Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is suitable for the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons at moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>The deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5.</p>
<p>The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite.</p>
<p>It appears that during propane conversion platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.</p>
<p>Consequently also low hydrocarbons (methane, ethane), and mainly saturated hydrocarbons are formed.</p>

The literature discusses the use of a bifunctional catalyst, combining platinum and zeolite H-ZSM-5, for the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties and shape-selective pore structure prevent coke formation, enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency. The conversion process involves dehydrogenation of propane to propene by the platinum component, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. This results in the formation of higher hydrocarbons, with the predominant product being butane. The literature does not specifically mention halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene or compare them to oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. The differences in propane's reactivity compared to other alkanes like methane and ethane might stem from its higher reactivity with the acidic zeolite sites, allowing for the formation of higher hydrocarbons at moderate temperatures. 

The conversion process does not involve halogens directly, as it relies on the catalytic properties of platinum and the zeolite's acid sites. The key difference in reactivity compared to other alkanes is likely due to propane's ability to form stable carbenium ions upon adsorption on the zeolite's acidic sites, facilitating further reactions leading to higher hydrocarbon formation. Methane and ethane, with weaker bonds, would not undergo similar conversions under the same conditions.

文献讨论了铂和沸石H-ZSM-5的双功能催化剂用于丙烷向更高级烃的转化。该沸石的强酸性特性和孔结构的选择性防止了焦炭的形成，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和效率。转化过程包括通过铂成分进行丙烷的脱氢化为丙烯，随后在沸石的酸位上进行丙烯的聚合化。这导致了更高碳数烃的生成，主要产物为丁烷。文献并未具体提及卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯，或与氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法进行比较。丙烷与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应差异可能源自其与沸石酸位的更高反应性，允许在中温条件下形成更高碳数的烃。 
转换过程并不直接涉及卤素，而是依赖于铂和沸石酸位的催化性质。与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）相比的主要差异可能是由于丙烷能够在其沸石酸位上形成稳定的碳正离子，从而促进进一步反应并最终形成更高碳数的烃。甲烷和乙烷由于键能较弱，因此在相同条件下不会经历类似的转化。
