[1] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[2] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[3] "Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5."
[4] "Reversely the low deactivation of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples indicates that the active platinum is located inside the zeolite pores."
[5] "Most likely Pt not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane but also the hydrogenation of subsequent formed alkenes."
[6] "Cracking a C6 oligomer will give C3 species again. The smallest oligomer for which cracking can result in new products is Cg; this can be cracked to C4 and C5 species."
[7] "We obtain mainly n-butane as higher product. A) 0.4 wt% Pt 6) 4% Pt/H-ZSM-5 product."
[8] "According to their results first the n-alkane hydroisometizes to a monomethyl species which subsequent cracks to linear products which are hydrogenated to linear alkanes."

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly in reaction conditions. For instance, dehydrogenation with halogens typically requires high temperatures and the presence of a halogen catalyst. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen or air, often accompanied by a catalyst such as Pt or Ni. Oxyhalogenation utilizes halogen compounds in the presence of oxygen. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing a metal halide. Propane's reactivity in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its ability to form stable alkyl radicals under certain conditions, facilitating dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons is achieved through a bifunctional catalyst system consisting of platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite. Platinum facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, while the zeolite's acidic sites are responsible for the subsequent oligomerization of propene. The deactivation rate of the bifunctional catalyst is lower compared to a physical mixture of Pt/SiO2 and H-ZSM-5, suggesting that the active Pt particles are localized within the zeolite pores, benefiting from the zeolite's shape-selective properties.

3. Platinum, when combined with H-ZSM-5, activates propane conversion. The Pt catalyzes the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, and the zeolite's acidic sites enable the oligomerization of propene. This bifunctional catalytic system leads to a higher conversion rate and minimal deactivation, indicating that the Pt particles are effectively situated within the zeolite pores.

4. During the conversion of propane, the catalyst system not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms new net + C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. Consequently, low hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, as well as primarily saturated hydrocarbons, are generated alongside the desired higher hydrocarbons.

5. The propane conversion process elucidates the catalytic properties of H-ZSM-5 zeolite, indirectly suggesting that at higher temperatures, propene undergoes oligomerization leading to the formation of linear or singly branched products.

1. 卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些方法在反应条件上存在显著差异。例如，卤素脱氢通常需要高温和卤素催化剂的存在。氧化脱氢涉及氧气或空气的使用，通常伴有铂或镍等催化剂。氧卤化利用卤素化合物与氧气共存。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及含金属卤化物的熔融盐浴。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）不同，因为它能够在特定条件下形成稳定的烷基自由基，促进脱氢反应。

2. 通过铂（Pt）和H-ZSM-5沸石组成的双功能催化剂系统可以实现丙烷向更高碳数烃的转化。铂催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，而沸石的酸性位点则负责丙烯的进一步多聚化。与物理混合的Pt/SiO2和H-ZSM-5相比，双功能催化剂的失活率较低，这表明活性Pt颗粒位于沸石孔内，得益于沸石的形状选择性特性。

3. 当铂与H-ZSM-5结合时，激活了丙烷的转化。铂催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，而沸石的酸性位点则使丙烯发生多聚化。这种双功能催化体系导致更高的转化率和最小化失活，表明Pt颗粒有效位于沸石孔内。

4. 在丙烷转化过程中，催化剂系统不仅断裂C-H键，还通过氢化和氢解反应形成新的净+C-H键。因此，生成低级烃类（如甲烷和乙烷），以及主要为饱和烃类，同时产生所需的更高碳数烃类。

5. 丙烷转化过程揭示了H-ZSM-5沸石的催化性质，间接暗示了在较高温度下，丙烯可能发生多聚化，导致线性或单支链产物的形成。
