<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates. Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range.</p>
<p>The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on. When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes. The steric constraints of the zeolite prevent the formation of molecules with more than 10 C-atoms.</p>
<p>Indeed it was shown by Chu that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600°C. The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi. They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (C1, C2).</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures, over Pt/H-ZSM-5. Thus we got information about the initial reactions occurring before the formation of aromatics starts.</p>
<p>The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane. Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5. Reversely the low deactivation of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples indicates that the active platinum is located inside the zeolite pores.</p>
<p>Over the whole temperature range the amount of pentanes formed over both catalysts was low. Not only higher products were formed: above 250°C over the 4 wt% Pt H-ZSM-5 catalyst equimolar amounts of methane and ethane were formed. In contrast the 0.4 wt% Pt catalyst produced only ethane as lower product.</p>

The literature discusses the use of zeolite H-ZSM-5, particularly in conjunction with platinum (Pt), for the conversion of propane into higher hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties facilitate the formation of carbenium ions through the adsorption of alkenes. These carbenium ions then react with additional alkenes to form dimers and larger molecules, with steric constraints preventing the formation of molecules with more than 10 carbon atoms. Ethane can be converted to benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at around 600°C. Propane conversion under moderate temperatures, over Pt/H-ZSM-5, reveals two key steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The presence of Pt particles near the acid sites enhances the conversion efficiency compared to physical mixtures. At temperatures below 350°C, butanes are the main higher hydrocarbons formed, while higher products like normal and iso butane are favored at higher temperatures. The Pt catalysts produce butanes due to the low concentration of propene, which leads to the formation of smaller oligomers that crack and recombine, primarily resulting in butane formation.

文献讨论了使用沸石H-ZSM-5，特别是与铂（Pt）结合，用于丙烷转化为更高碳氢化合物。沸石的强酸性特性促进了通过烷二烯吸附形成的碳正离子反应。这些碳正离子然后与额外的烷二烯形成二聚体和更大的分子，由于立体约束，防止形成超过10个碳原子的分子。在约600°C下，乙烷可以转化为苯、甲苯、二甲苯（BTX）芳香烃。在中等温度下，过Pt/H-ZSM-5催化转化丙烷揭示了两个关键步骤：首先，Pt催化的丙烷脱氢为丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合。Pt颗粒靠近酸性位点的存在增强了与物理混合相比的转化效率。在低于350°C的温度下，但烷是主要的较高碳氢化合物，而在较高温度下，则更倾向于形成更高产物，如正丁烷和异丁烷。由于丙烯浓度低，Pt催化剂产生但烷，这导致形成较小的寡聚物裂解并重新组合，主要结果是生成但烷。

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly in reaction conditions. For instance, dehydrogenation with halogens typically requires high temperatures and the presence of a halogen catalyst. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen or air, often accompanied by a catalyst such as Pt or Ni. Oxyhalogenation utilizes halogen compounds in the presence of oxygen. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing a metal halide. Propane's reactivity in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its ability to form stable alkyl radicals under certain conditions, facilitating dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons is achieved through a bifunctional catalyst system consisting of platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite. Platinum facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, while the zeolite's acidic sites are responsible for the subsequent oligomerization of propene. The deactivation rate of the bifunctional catalyst is lower compared to a physical mixture of Pt/SiO2 and H-ZSM-5, suggesting that the active Pt particles are localized within the zeolite pores, benefiting from the zeolite's shape-selective properties.

3. Platinum, when combined with H-ZSM-5, activates propane conversion. The Pt catalyzes the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, and the zeolite's acidic sites enable the oligomerization of propene. This bifunctional catalytic system leads to a higher conversion rate and minimal deactivation, indicating that the Pt particles are effectively situated within the zeolite pores.

4. During the conversion of propane, the catalyst system not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms new net + C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. Consequently, low hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, as well as primarily saturated hydrocarbons, are generated alongside the desired higher hydrocarbons.

5. The propane conversion process elucidates the catalytic properties of H-ZSM-5 zeolite, indirectly suggesting that at higher temperatures, propene undergoes oligomerization leading to the formation of linear or singly branched products.

1. 卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些方法在反应条件上存在显著差异。例如，卤素脱氢通常需要高温和卤素催化剂的存在。氧化脱氢涉及氧气或空气的使用，通常伴有铂或镍等催化剂。氧卤化利用卤素化合物与氧气共存。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及含金属卤化物的熔融盐浴。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）不同，因为它能够在特定条件下形成稳定的烷基自由基，促进脱氢反应。

2. 通过铂（Pt）和H-ZSM-5沸石组成的双功能催化剂系统可以实现丙烷向更高碳数烃的转化。铂催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，而沸石的酸性位点则负责丙烯的进一步多聚化。与物理混合的Pt/SiO2和H-ZSM-5相比，双功能催化剂的失活率较低，这表明活性Pt颗粒位于沸石孔内，得益于沸石的形状选择性特性。

3. 当铂与H-ZSM-5结合时，激活了丙烷的转化。铂催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，而沸石的酸性位点则使丙烯发生多聚化。这种双功能催化体系导致更高的转化率和最小化失活，表明Pt颗粒有效位于沸石孔内。

4. 在丙烷转化过程中，催化剂系统不仅断裂C-H键，还通过氢化和氢解反应形成新的净+C-H键。因此，生成低级烃类（如甲烷和乙烷），以及主要为饱和烃类，同时产生所需的更高碳数烃类。

5. 丙烷转化过程揭示了H-ZSM-5沸石的催化性质，间接暗示了在较高温度下，丙烯可能发生多聚化，导致线性或单支链产物的形成。

The literature discusses the use of a bifunctional catalyst, combining platinum and zeolite H-ZSM-5, for the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties and shape-selective pore structure prevent coke formation, enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency. The conversion process involves dehydrogenation of propane to propene by the platinum component, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. This results in the formation of higher hydrocarbons, with the predominant product being butane. The literature does not specifically mention halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene or compare them to oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. The differences in propane's reactivity compared to other alkanes like methane and ethane might stem from its higher reactivity with the acidic zeolite sites, allowing for the formation of higher hydrocarbons at moderate temperatures. 

The conversion process does not involve halogens directly, as it relies on the catalytic properties of platinum and the zeolite's acid sites. The key difference in reactivity compared to other alkanes is likely due to propane's ability to form stable carbenium ions upon adsorption on the zeolite's acidic sites, facilitating further reactions leading to higher hydrocarbon formation. Methane and ethane, with weaker bonds, would not undergo similar conversions under the same conditions.

文献讨论了铂和沸石H-ZSM-5的双功能催化剂用于丙烷向更高级烃的转化。该沸石的强酸性特性和孔结构的选择性防止了焦炭的形成，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和效率。转化过程包括通过铂成分进行丙烷的脱氢化为丙烯，随后在沸石的酸位上进行丙烯的聚合化。这导致了更高碳数烃的生成，主要产物为丁烷。文献并未具体提及卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯，或与氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法进行比较。丙烷与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应差异可能源自其与沸石酸位的更高反应性，允许在中温条件下形成更高碳数的烃。 
转换过程并不直接涉及卤素，而是依赖于铂和沸石酸位的催化性质。与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）相比的主要差异可能是由于丙烷能够在其沸石酸位上形成稳定的碳正离子，从而促进进一步反应并最终形成更高碳数的烃。甲烷和乙烷由于键能较弱，因此在相同条件下不会经历类似的转化。

The literature describes the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons using a bifunctional catalyst consisting of platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite. This process involves two main steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by the platinum component, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The conversion is more effective when Pt is incorporated into the zeolite pores rather than mixed physically with the zeolite, resulting in a higher conversion rate and less deactivation. The literature also mentions that at low temperatures, the main product formed is butane, which suggests that the activity balance between Pt and the acid sites is not perfect, leading to cracking in addition to oligomerization. The process is selective for butane formation, although hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis by the Pt component contribute to the formation of methane, ethane, and other saturated hydrocarbons.
