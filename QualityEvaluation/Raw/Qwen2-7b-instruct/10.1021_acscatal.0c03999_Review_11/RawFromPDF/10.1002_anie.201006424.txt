1. Introduction
“… I believe that in twenty-five years methane will be the most
popular ligand in coordination chemistry.”
Joseph Chatt, 1976[1]
While, in retrospect, Chatts bold prediction may be
dismissed as exaggerated, there cannot possibly exist any
serious doubt about the grand challenges associated with the
activation and functionalization of methane.[2] For example,
current large-scale, economically viable processes at ambient
conditions are unable to bring about direct conversion of
methane to methanol [Eq. (1)], to couple this alkane with

carbon dioxide [Eq. (2)], or to use methane as a hydrogen

Clearly, a part of the difficulties is due to the intrinsic
properties of the hydrocarbon, as indicated by the significant
energies required for both homo- and heterolytic CH bond
cleavages, the negligibly small (if not negative) electron
affinity, the large ionization energy, the huge HOMO–LUMO
gap, the extremely high pKa value, the absence of a dipole
moment, and the rather small polarizability of CH4. All these
features make the substrate rather unsuitable for ordinary
redox or acid–base chemistry. Moreover, in the context of
CH4 activation for the time being, tunable catalysts are not
available to solve the deceptively simple problems of bond
breaking and bond making or the coupling of the molecular
fragments and the liberation of the product from the catalyst.
Furthermore, attempts aimed at uncovering the elementary
steps and elucidating mechanistic aspects associated with
these transformations have proved particularly challenging.[2]
This deplorable situation is not really surprising and is further
enhanced given the enormous complexity that prevails in
“real-life situation” in which often ill-defined effects of
solvents, counterions, aggregates, or surface inhomogeneities
obscure a reaction center or mask the intrinsic properties of a
reactive intermediate. Clearly, a detailed understanding of the
reaction mechanisms, derived from atomic or molecular-level
insights, is desirable if not necessary for improving existing
and designing new catalysts.[3]
Gas-phase studies on “isolated” reactants provide an ideal
arena for probing experimentally the energetics and kinetics
of a chemical reaction in an unperturbed environment at a
strictly molecular level. In fact, in the last two decades
numerous mass-spectrometry-based experiments have been
exploited to provide insight into the elementary steps of
various catalytic reactions and to characterize in detail
reactive intermediates that have previously not been within
the reach of conventional condensed-phase techniques.[4] Of
course, as a result of the net Coulombic charge of the ions
studied in high vacuum as well as the absence of counterions
and solvation, these “naked” species will, in general, be much
more reactive than their condensed-phase counterparts. Thus,
gas-phase studies will, in principle, never account for the
Four seemingly simple transformations related to the chemistry of
methane will be addressed from mechanistic and conceptual points of
view: 1) metal-mediated dehydrogenation to form metal carbene
complexes, 2) the hydrogen-atom abstraction step in the oxidative
dimerization of methane, 3) the mechanisms of the CH4!CH3OH
conversion, and 4) the initial bond scission (CH vs. OH) as well as
the rate-limiting step in the selective CH3OH!CH2O oxidation. State-
of-the-art gas-phase experiments, in conjunction with electronic-
structure calculations, permit identification of the elementary reactions
at a molecular level and thus allow us to unravel detailed mechanistic
aspects. Where appropriate, these results are compared with findings
from related studies in solution or on surfaces.

precise mechanisms, energetics, and kinetics which prevail in
the condensed phase, and direct transfers of the conclusions
arrived at are, in general, not warranted. Having said that,
studies of this kind, performed under well-defined conditions
and complemented by computational investigations, have
nevertheless proved meaningful, for they provide a concep-
tual framework to analyze the reactions in question. In fact,
the Degussa process, that is, the platinum-mediated coupling
of CH4 and NH3 to generate HCN,[5a] may serve as a good
example.

existence of this species was later confirmed by means of in

all of which are associated with the chemistry of methane

process 

While we will refrain from describing the various exper-
imental techniques and computational methodologies (which
are available from the references given), we will rather focus
on the elucidation of the (often) intriguing mechanisms,
and—where appropriate—a comparison will be made with
related processes performed in the condensed phases.
2. Dehydrogenation of Methane: Relativistic and
Cluster-Size Effects
“[Relativistic effects] are therefore of no importance in the
consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary
chemical reactions.”
Paul A. M. Dirac, 1929[6]
Dehydrogenation of methane (Scheme 1, process 
1 ) to
generate [M]CH2 is of conceptual interest, as the methylene
complex can serve as an intermediate in the metal-mediated
conversion CH4!CH2O.[7] To make dehydrogenation ther-
mochemically feasible, the metal–methylidene bond strength
D0(MCH2) must exceed the heat of dehydrogenation of
methane [Eq. (5)].

DrH ¼ 111 kcal mol1
ð5Þ
Among “bare” transition-metal cations, this requirement
is met only by some of the 5d elements, for example, M+ = Ta,
W, Os, Ir, and Pt.[8] In fact, in contrast to their lighter 3d and
4d congeners, these cations bring about spontaneous gas-
phase dehydrogenation of methane at room temperature, as
first reported by Irikura and Beauchamp[9] and later by
others.[10] The remarkable increase in bond strength from, for
example, 74 kcalmol1 (for Ni+CH2) to 111 kcalmol1 (for
Pt+CH2)[11] has been attributed to a sizeable relativistic
stabilization[12] of the 6s orbital of M+ in these cationic
complexes M+CH2, as demonstrated for M = Pt by fully
relativistic, four-component Dirac–Fock–Coulomb bench-
mark calculations including correlation effects.[8,13] Actually,
up to 40% of the bond strength in Pt+CH2 is due to a
relativistic contribution.[8,12,13b]
Armentrout and co-workers have extended the earlier
work[9] and performed extensive experimental and computa-
tional studies for the systems M+/CH4 (M = Re,[11b] W,[14] Ir,[15]
and Ta[16]). Most interesting is their finding that in the course
of dehydrogenation, in particular to form the insertion
intermediate
HM+CH3,
a
spin–orbit-mediated
switch
from the high-spin ground state to the low-spin excited
surface is crucial. As will be shown later in a different context,
this scenario of a two-state reactivity (TSR) pattern,[17] in
which excited states play a pivotal role, is a hallmark of many
transition-metal-mediated processes.
TSR matters also in the unexpected thermal gas-phase
dehydrogenation of CH4 by main-group atomic As+.[18] As
shown in Figure 1, in the course of the reaction the ground-
state triplet asymptote of the couple As+ (3P0)/CH4 undergoes
a crossover to the excited singlet surface at a minimal-energy
crossing point (MECP) located between the encounter
complex As-2 and the oxidative addition intermediate As-3.
If the system stayed on the triplet ground-state surface,
insurmountably high transition states (e.g. As-TS3–4 or As-
TS4–5) would have to be overcome. Instead, it is the very spin-

flip that opens up a reaction channel for a thermal process
which would not be accessible at all for the reactants.
Interestingly, as shown by a comparison of Figures 1a and b,
scalar relativistic effects, however, do not affect the energetics
in this particular system. Finally, in the thermal dehydrogen-
ation of methane by the doubly-charged metal ion Ta2+ [19a] or
the actinide species Th, Th+, and Th2+,[19b–f] a TSR scenario
has also been invoked.
Admittedly, bare metal cations have been rightly consid-
ered as extreme “reagents”, and the findings derived from
their reactions in the gas phase have little relevance to
processes in solution or on surfaces—clearly, the reductionist
principle in simplifying the complexity that prevails in reality
has been stretched a bit too far. More appropriate models are
clusters, and collections of cluster have been suggested as the
reactive sites on surfaces.[20] In fact, size-selected unsupported
neutral platinum clusters not only react with methane but also
exhibit a remarkable size dependence in the dehydrogenation
of CH4, and the analysis reveals that coordinative unsatura-
tion is of crucial importance.[21] A related behavior has also
been observed for free charged Ptn
+/ clusters (n = 1–21)
which, in addition to pronounced size effects, exhibit the
following trends: 1) Cationic clusters, owing to their electro-
philic character and to the mechanism of CH bond
activation, are generally more reactive than their anionic
counterparts, with the reactivity of a given neutral platinum
cluster falling between those of the charged systems; 2) with
increasing cluster size the reactivity drops.[22] The anoma-
lously low reactivity of Pt4
+[22] has been traced back to the lack
of a thermochemical driving force.[23c] In the room-temper-
ature reactions of cationic heteronuclear MPt+ (M = Cu, Ag,
Au) or of the homonuclear Rh2
+ clusters, dehydrogenation of
CH4 is also facile.[5c,d,23]
A notable cluster-size effect in the context of catalytic
methane activation was reported by Bernhardt, Landman,
and co-workers.[24] While atomic ground-state Au+ (1S0) is
entirely unreactive towards methane,[25] isolated Au2
+ clusters
mediate CC coupling of methane at increased substrate
pressure to yield ethane [Eq. (6)].

In this experimental and computational study, approx-
imately 106 mass-selected Au2
+ ions were confined to an ion
trap (which acts, so to speak, as the gas-phase chemists test
tube) for a few hundred microseconds in CH4/He mixtures at
a pressure of about 1 Pa and a temperature that was varied
between 200 and 300 K. These experimental conditions

Scheme 2, which was completely characterized in terms of
the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Several
features are noteworthy. 1) Owing to the rather high pressure
applied, reaction intermediates were collisionally stabilized
and thus accessible; further, the temperature variation
permitted the study of endothermic processes. 2) These
findings illustrate an oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)
at ambient temperature. 3) In the multicollision experiment,
methane is not only involved as a reactant but also serves as a
ligand to release C2H4 from the Au2
+ catalyst. 4) Working at
higher pressure removes the problem of the so-called
“pressure gap” between the high vacuum and condensed
phases, which often hampers model studies in their “rele-
vance” for understanding real catalysis.[3b,26] As to some of the
facets contained in Scheme 2, the first barrier DE1, surpassed
only at temperatures above 250 K, is encountered in the
sequence of CH bond activation, making an HH bond, and
the elimination of H2. A second barrier (DE2) must be

involved in the release of C2H4 from the intermediate
Au2(C2H4)(CH4)+, because this intermediate is observed
between 250 and 270 K, but not at 300 K. Finally, a third
barrier (DE3) is associated with the cluster degradation. As
stated in a Highlight article,[27] these findings, in addition to
their fundamental importance, are likely to be of practical
importance in the design of catalysts.
Finally, it should be mentioned that coupling of methane
to produce C2H4 has also been realized in a cluster-assisted s-
bond-activation reaction. Here, atomic Ti+, at elevated CH4
pressure, undergoes CH bond activation and oxidative
coupling of the CHn (n = 2, 3) fragments in Ti(CH4)m
+ clusters
(m  4) at thermal energies.[28,29]
3. Hydrogen-Atom Abstraction from Methane: The
Very First Step in the Lunsford Mechanism of
Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM)
Much of the research on the direct conversion of methane
has been devoted to this reaction, which involves the catalytic
conversion of methane and oxygen to ethane and water
[Eq. (7)] at elevated temperature (above 6508C).[2d,30]
2 CH4 þ 1=
2 O2 ! C2H6 þ H2O
ð7Þ
The fundamental aspects of the problem involve both a
heterogeneous component, which includes the activation of
CH4 on (usually doped) metal oxide surfaces, and a homoge-
neous gas-phase part; in the latter, coupling of the free methyl
radicals and subsequent dehydrogenation (C2H6!C2H4)
occurs. Much of the current debate[31] centers around the
nature of the active metal oxide surface species, which,
according to Lunsfords suggestion,[30b,32] corresponds to an
oxygen-centered radical (Scheme 3). However, no contro-
versy exists as to the rate-limiting step of OCM, and the
consensus view assigns this role to the initial homolytic
scission of the CH bond of methane.[33]
Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of
oxygen-centered radicals in the hydrogen-atom abstraction
step by metal oxides [Eq. (8)], as well as mechanistic insight

ð8Þ
into the elementary steps of the reaction with an emphasis on
the detailed role of [M], have been provided by gas-phase
studies of mass-selected, electronic ground-state metal oxide
ions. These include not only the transition-metal-based oxides

+C,[36] V4O10
+C,[37] TiO2

+C,[38] and their oligomeric clusters[39] but also main-
group-element oxides, for example, MgO+C,[40] MO+C (M = Ca,
Sr, Ba),[41] PbO+C,[42] non-metallic SO2
+C,[43] mixed metal/non-
metal clusters PnV4nO10
+C (n = 1, 2, 4),[44] the bimetallic oxide
AlVO4
+C,[45] as well as the oligomeric clusters (Al2O3)n
+C (n =
3–5).[46] Common to all these systems are the following
features: 1) A very efficient homolytic CH bond activation
according to Equation (8) achieved at room temperature; this
activation is a consequence of a favorable thermochemistry,
as the hydrogen affinities of these element oxide species
exceed the CH bond strength in methane, and 2) without
exception, according to the theoretical studies, all element
oxide radical ions exhibit high spin densities at a terminal
oxygen atom.
The crucial role of an oxygen-centered radical is demon-
strated by the following experimental observations and
computational
findings.
1) For
the
oligomeric
clusters
(Al2O3)n
+C (n = 3–5) only those clusters react spontaneously
at room temperature according to Equation (8) that have an
even number of aluminum atoms (Al6O9
+C, Al8O12
+C, and
Al10O15
+C); clusters that contain an odd number of aluminum
atoms (Al7On
+ (n = 9, 10, 11) and Al9On
+ (n = 13, 14)) lack a
radical center and do not exhibit any reactivity towards
CH4.[46] 2) In contrast to the open-shell cluster Al3VO7
+C,
whose spin is not located at a terminal oxygen atom, the
related system AlVO4
+C brings about efficient homolytic
cleavage of the CH bond of CH4 at room temperature. DFT
calculations indicate that the hydrogen-atom transfer is
exclusively confined to the terminal AlO and not the VO
unit, as it is the former group at which the spin is located
(Figure 2).[45a] Similarly, in the mixed PnV4nO10
+C clusters (n =
1, 2) or the heteronuclear vanadium silicon oxide radical
cation clusters, the radical site is located at the terminal PO
or SiO units.[44b,c,45b] 3) Finally, while H-atom abstraction
from the closed-shell system CaO/CH4 is calculated to be
slightly exothermic, the barrier of the process is insurmount-
ably high;[47] this behavior very much contrasts with that of the
rather reactive CaO+C/CH4 couple.[41]
As to the mechanism(s) of the hydrogen-atom abstraction
from CH4, two conceivable scenarios have been identified,
that is, a direct pathway (“harpoon” mechanism) and an
indirect process in which the hydrogen delivery from the

carbon atom to the oxygen atom is mediated by the metal
atom. Convincing examples for both scenarios are known,
with SO2
+C, AlVO4
+C, and PnV4nO10
+C (n = 0, 1, 2, 4) belonging
to the former and MgO+C, PbO+C, MnO+C, FeO+C, and MoO3
+C
to the latter. Both mechanistic variants will be presented
below.
In the gas-phase reaction of the polynuclear oxide cluster
V4O10
+C with methane,[48] no long-lived encounter complex
V4O10
+C/CH4 seems to exist; rather, in a barrier-free process
(Figure 3) the hydrogen atom is pulled away to produce, in a
rather
exothermic
reaction,
the
intermediate
[V4O9OH]+···CH3C, from which the loosely bound CH3C is
liberated.[37]
The evolution of this efficient process (60% of the
collision rate), which is associated with an intramolecular
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.35,[37,49] has been confirmed
by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Figure 4 and
Figure 5). For the first 450 fs of the simulation, the potential
energy decreases steadily, driven only by the small attractive
forces between methane and the cluster ion, which is
indicative of a barrier-free reaction. In parallel, the OH
and VC distances decrease steadily, and the CH distance
increases. After 450 fs, when the system has gained approx-
imately 24.5 kcalmol1 internal energy, energy is transferred
into the CH and OH stretching modes, corresponding to
oscillations of the hydrogen atom between the vanadyl
oxygen atom and the methyl carbon atom. Further, the V
C distance decreases until t = 470 fs and then slowly increases
again, thus indicating the beginning of the expulsion of the
CH3 radical.
The progress of the reaction can also be seen by inspection
of the calculated spin densities shown in Figure 5. In the
initial-state structure (a), the spin density is similar to that of
the isolated V4O10
+C cluster and only insignificantly more
delocalized. Structure (b) describes the situation after 443 fs;
the OH and CH distances are nearly identical, and the spin
density is distributed between the vanadyl oxygen atom and
the carbon atom and is polarized along the O-H-C axis.
Finally, in the product (c), the spin is completely transferred
to the methyl radical.
Room-temperature activation of CH4 by diatomic MgO+C
may serve as an example for a “metal-mediated” hydrogen
abstraction; such homolytic bond cleavage is also a hallmark
of the reactions of CH4 with PbO+C, MnO+C, FeO+C, and
MoO3
+C As shown in Figure 6, the reaction commences with
the generation of an encounter complex CH4···Mg2+···OC in
which the spin is almost exclusively located at the oxygen
atom. Next, the methane molecule migrates around the
magnesium atom toward the oxygen atom, delivery of a
hydrogen atom occurs, and the newly formed methyl group is
pulled back to the magnesium core. The thus formed
H3C···Mg+OH intermediate represents a complex between
a loosely bound methyl radical, which carries more than 98%
of the spin, and protonated magnesium oxide. From this
intermediate, CH3C is liberated in an entropy-driven dissoci-
ation; formation of the thermochemically more favored
product combination Mg+C/CH3OH by a rebound mechanism
is kinetically less attractive.[40]
Finally, in the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage
reactions, a brief comment seems befitting about using kinetic

isotope effects as an experimental probe to classify reaction
mechanisms. As already mentioned, direct hydrogen abstrac-
tion from CH4 is characterized by rather small KIEs, whereas
those homolytic CH bond cleavages which are mediated by
the metal core exhibit larger KIEs, typically greater than 2.0.
Moreover, as discussed by Schrçder et al. in detail,[50] for a
given reaction type there exists a relationship between the
size of the KIEs and the overall rate coefficients of the
hydrogen-atom abstraction from methane. For example, the
intermolecular KIE, derived from the reactions with CH4 and
CD4, continuously increases from about 1.3 for MgO+C via 2.1
and 2.4 for CaO+C and SrO+C, respectively, to 3.2 for BaO+C.[41]
This trend of increasing KIEs is paralleled by a decrease of
the overall rate coefficients for the activation of methane, for
example, from 3.9  1010 for MgO+C and 2.9  1010 for CaO+C
to 9.8  1011 and 1.1  1011 cm3molecule1s1 for SrO+C and
BaO+C, respectively.[41,50] With regard to catalysis, this obser-
vation implies that the less reactive oxidants exhibit higher
selectivities in terms of the associated KIEs, apparently in line
with the time-honored Bell–Evans–Polanyi principle.[51]
4. The Conversion of Methane to Methanol: A
Long-Time Conundrum Resolved at Long Last by
the Two-State Reactivity Concept
“Dem Anwenden muss das Erkennen vorausgehen.”
Max Planck, 1919[52][*]
Plancks comment on the decision to award the Nobel
Prize for Chemistry (1918) to Fritz Haber, and repeated at the
annual meeting of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft on Octo-
ber 29, 1919 in a different context, does not only serve to this
very day as a precept of Germanys Max-Planck-Gesellschaft
but also summarizes Habers exceptional skill in bridging the
gap in the natural sciences between theory and application. In
Bernals words, Haber was “the greatest authority in the
world on the relations between science and industry”.[53]
Perhaps the largest potential for a major advance in
methane conversion technology is in the discovery of a direct
route to the formation of methanol and formaldehyde at
ambient conditions,[2] and it is not unjustified to relate Sir
Derek Bartons famous dictum[2a] about “Holy Grails in
Chemistry”[54] to the oxygenation of CH bonds in alkanes,
for example, the reaction in Equation (1), given the complex-
ity of this deceptively trivial reaction, which looks easy only
on paper.[55,56] In reality, there are quite a few challenges, as
for example:
1) the unbalanced stoichiometry: there is one oxygen atom
too many in Equation (1);
2) the overoxidation challenge: both intermediates CH3OH
and CH2O are kinetically more prone to further oxidation
than the starting molecule CH4 with its thermochemically
strong and kinetically inert CH bond;
3) the spin dilemma: since CH4 and CH3OH possess singlet
ground states, the reaction is spin-forbidden when O2 is
used as terminal oxidant.
Nature has solved these riddles in the evolutionary
development
of
the
methane
monooxygenase
(MMO)
enzyme, which contains at the reaction center a structurally
relatively simple, doubly oxygen-bridged diiron cluster.[57]
MMO has served chemists as an enticing example of what
could possibly be achieved, and FePO4 is an interesting in
vitro model for the production of CH3OH and CH2O when H2
is added to CH4 and O2.[58] The two oxidation products are
formed with selectivities of 23 and 45%, respectively, but only
at a disappointingly low methane conversion level of about
0.6%. Similarly unsatisfying with regard to a large-scale,
economically attractive, environmentally benign functionali-
zation of CH4 were the mechanistically appealing experi-
ments of Periana et al., which made use of bipyrimidyl-
substituted platinum(II) complexes,[2i,59a] in analogy to Shi-
lovs seminal studies employing platinum compounds dating
back to the mid-20th century,[60] or Au0-based oxidations of
CH4 with H2SeO4.[59b] With regard to practical applications,
however, experiments which employ platinum-based solid
catalysts are more promising.[59c,d]
A rewarding insight into the mechanisms—and thus the
underlying obstacles encountered in the numerous, often
frustrating solution-phase and surface-based experiments—
has been derived in the last two decades from a happy
marriage between sophisticated gas-phase experiments of
mass-selected, electronic-ground-state metal oxide cations
MO+ and computational studies. Only some of the more
fundamental aspects from this rather extensive work[61] will be
addressed here. First, it should be mentioned in passing,
without discussing this fascinating topic in any further detail,
that the understanding of the simple gas-phase reaction,
depicted in Equation (9a), has later proved helpful in the
clarification and elucidation of the mechanisms of the
intricate cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation of hydro-

H-atom abstraction versus O-atom transfer of nonheme
iron(IV) oxide oxidants.[62]
In the stoichiometric gas-phase model reactions of MO+
with CH4, three principal product channels are conceivable
[Eq. (9)], and the experimentally determined rate coefficients
and branching ratios are controlled by thermochemical and
spin considerations; Reaction (9c) is usually reserved for
oxides that contain 5d metals.[7] In this Section, we will focus
on features that are of particular relevance for the reaction
shown in Equation (9a), in which the insertion intermediate
H3CM+OH is key. Although the metal has the formal
oxidation state MIII in both MO+ and H3CM+OH, there are
fundamental differences in the bonding situations, which have
important consequences. Thus, 3d and 4d metals cannot
effectively support p-type double bonds in MO+, which
consequently leads to high-spin ground states for the MO+
monocations. In contrast, the insertion intermediates primar-
ily involve s-type bonding, for which perfect pairing and thus
low-spin ground states are preferred. Therefore, a situation
results, in which the spin surfaces cross each other such that
the reaction pathway of lowest energy demand must involve a
crossover from the high-spin to the low-spin surface and
eventually back to high spin in the final products. In fact, the
analysis of the reactions of bare metal oxide cations in the gas
phase led, among other things, to the development of the
paradigm of two-state reactivity (TSR).[17c,d,62,63] The TSR
scenario is now widely accepted in various areas of science far
beyond gas-phase-ion chemistry, for example in organome-
tallic chemistry[64] and also in the context of metalloen-
zymes.[62]
The (simplified) potential-energy surface for the reaction
of bare FeO+ with CH4 (Figure 7) may serve as an illustrative
example.
After
having
formed
an
encounter
complex
(CH4)FeO+, spin–orbit-mediated coupling brings about a
switch from the high-spin sextet ground state to an excited
quartet state;[34e,65] only in this spin state is formation of the
insertion intermediate H3CFe+OH via TS1 thermochemi-
cally possible under ambient conditions, and it is the spin
change that avoids the high-energy TS1 on the ground-state
sextet surface.
Thus, as stated above, excited states are involved in a
thermal reaction. As pointed out by Poli and Harvey,[64a] it is
only because of a spin change that these reactions occur at all
under ambient conditions. The essence of the idea of a TSR
scenario is depicted in Figure 8, and it represents the key
element of “spin catalysis”: a (thermal) reaction is accelerated
by a spin change which, by avoiding energetically less attractive
transition structures, opens up favorable pathways.
While the details of the PESs for CH bond oxygenation
by MO+ depend very much on the nature of the transition
metal M in MO+, excellent agreement has been arrived at for
the thermal reactions of MO+ (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
and Ni) with CH4 when compared with computational
studies.[4a,34a,b,35a,b,66] Several notable, general trends are as
follows: First, the early 3d transition-metal oxides ScO+,
TiO+, VO+, CrO+, and MnO+ have low-spin ground states.
This characteristic alters the PESs such that the intersystem
crossing does not occur in the vicinity of TS1 (Figure 7) but
instead closer to TS2. As the ground states of the products are
high-spin systems, only one spin flip is necessary. Next, the
reactions of ScO+, TiO+, and VO+ with CH4 to produce
CH3OH are endothermic owing to the enormous D0(M+O)
values (greater than 135 kcalmol1), which substantially
exceed the oxygen-atom affinity of CH4 to produce CH3OH
(90.7 kcalmol1). Further, as the O-atom transfer from CrO+
is only slightly exothermic, none of these oxides bring about
thermal activation of CH4.
For MnO+, the exothermicity of its reaction with methane
already suffices to break the CH bond and to generate H3C
Mn+OH; next, this intermediate liberates a methyl radical in
a spin-allowed, entropically favored process; the spin-for-
bidden rebound step, with subsequent CH3OH loss, is not
competitive. The two late-transition-metal oxides CoO+ and
NiO+, when treated with CH4, undergo spin inversion close to
the entrance channel; an additional spin flip at the elimina-
tion of CH3OH is not required, because the ground state of
the resulting metal ions is of the 3dn configuration. The

experimentally observed significant differences in the reac-
tion coefficients (more than a factor of 20 in favor of NiO+) in
generating CH3OH from CH4 and MO+ (M = Co, Ni) are due
to details of the PESs close to the insertion step as well as to
different spin–orbit coupling factors. Finally, according to the
calculations, CuO+ is predicted to be one of the most powerful
hydrocarbon oxidants among all binary 3d metal oxide
cations; however, as a consequence of its small bond-
dissociation energy, D0(Cu+O) = 37.4 kcalmol1, to date all
attempts to generate the reagent in the gas phase and to
subject it to the stoichiometric or catalytic conversions of
methane have failed. [See however the Addendum.]
The genuine gas-phase catalytic oxidation CH4!CH3OH
by MO+ was realized quite some time ago for FeO+ [34a] and,
more recently, for NiO+ and PdO+.[67] On the basis of
computational and experimental studies, it was shown that
NiO+, owing to its easy availability and high selectivity, is a
rather promising candidate, and experiments that use NiO- or
FeO-doped zeolites as catalyst for the oxygenation of CH4
under ambient conditions are also encouraged by computa-
tional and (for iron and copper) experimental investiga-
tions.[68]
5. On the Detailed Mechanisms of CH3OH!CH2O
Oxidation
While most of the roughly 40 million metric tons of
methanol processed annually are converted into a variety of
diverse chemical products,[2k] the leading among them is
formaldehyde, which is also one of the top 25 chemicals
produced worldwide.[2k,69] Here, we focus on some mecha-
nistic aspects of the conversion CH3OH!CH2O, and the
relevant questions in this context center around the following
topics: 1) In the initial step (Scheme 4) does a metal-based
mediator [M] preferentially induce a cleavage of the stronger
OH bond (102.4 kcalmol1) or the weaker CH bond
(91.7 kcalmol1), and 2) for a given sequence of events,
which of the two hydrogen-transfer steps constitutes the rate-
determining one? These questions will be addressed first by
describing reactions of methanol with neutral atoms under
matrix-isolation conditions, on surfaces, or in the gas phase
when treated with bare or ligated ions. Subsequently,
examples of genuine gas-phase catalysis will be presented,
and, finally, a brief comparison will be made between model
systems and a real catalyst.
5.1. The Initial Step: Cleavage of the Strong OH versus the
Weaker CH Bond
In all matrix-isolation studies, often complemented by
computational exercises, for the reactions of methanol with
neutral atoms (M = Fe,[70] Si,[71] B,[72] Be,[73] Mg,[73a] Sc,[74] Ti,[75]
or Mn[70a]) upon annealing or photochemical activation, the
encounter complexes M(CH3OH) undergo, in a kinetically
controlled fashion, specific activation of the stronger OH
bond (path 
A Scheme 4) to produce the corresponding [M]
OCH3 species.[76] Similarly, the numerous experimental inves-
tigations, employing the whole arsenal of contemporary
advanced surface-spectroscopy techniques, combined with
elaborate computational studies of the reactions of methanol
on supported metal oxides, demonstrate that the “methoxide
pathway” 
A is preferred.[77] These studies, which, among
other things, also deal with the role of support effects, formal
oxidation states of the metal oxides, and selectivity effects
caused by the atomic structures of the surfaces, further reveal
that in the sequence CH3OH![M]OCH3!CH2O the second
step, that is, the CH bond activation in the methoxy
intermediate, constitutes the rate-limiting one.[77] In a rather
detailed computational investigation, the kinetic and mech-
anistic aspects of the CH3OH!CH2O conversion using
titania-supported vanadates were addressed, and the follow-
ing main conclusions were drawn:[78]
1) Methoxy species are key intermediates in the reaction,
with a tetrahedral vanadia unit containing a vanadyl
group, a methoxy group, and two bridging V-O-Ti sites
forming the most stable one. A fivefold-coordinated
vanadia unit was found to be potentially interesting for
catalytic reactivity.
2) The rate-limiting step in the oxidation mechanisms
corresponds to the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the
[V]OCH3 intermediate to the catalyst oxygen site V=O
(barrier of 41.0 kcalmol1) or to a bridging interface unit
V-O-Ti (barrier 46.0 kcalmol1). Both pathways involve
spin crossings from the singlet to the triplet potential-
energy surfaces, involving TSR scenarios.
However, and perhaps not entirely unexpectedly, a
change in mechanism can occur when methanol oxidation is
brought about by oxide-free surfaces. For example, in the
oxidative CH3OH decomposition on Pt(111), according to
periodic, self-consistent DFT calculations, the rate-limiting
step is now assigned to initial OH bond activation to
produce a methoxy-bound intermediate.[79] Other computa-
tional work[80] arrived at the conclusion that CH bond
scission contributes to the first and rate-limiting step in the
Pt(111) decomposition of CH3OH; while this process is
favored by 12 kcalmol1 as compared with an initial OH
bond activation (Figure 9),[80a] neither decomposition route
for methanol can compete with the desorption of the intact
substrate from the surface.
A change in mechanism has also been noted in the
electrochemical decomposition of CH3OH on platinum
surfaces; a KIE of 3 for the system CH3OH/CD3OH and its
absence for the CH3OH/CH3OD couple, together with other
data, were interpreted in favor of the “hydroxymethyl

pathway” (
B in Scheme 4).[80,81] Finally, initial CH rather
than OH bond cleavage is computationally predicted to be
favored in methanol activation on sub-nanometer Pd clus-
ters.[82]
Numerous gas-phase experiments with both cationic and
anionic reagents, bare or ligated atoms, and clusters of
different sizes and varying stoichiometries have been con-
ducted over the last three decades and aimed at revealing the
mechanisms of CH3OH!CH2O conversion at a strictly
molecular
level.
While
highly
remarkable
cluster-size
effects,[83g–k,n,q] the role of formal oxidation states,[83q] or
anomalously large kinetic isotope effects have been observ-
ed,[83e] most of these studies[83] did not provide a clear-cut
mechanistic distinction between initial OH versus CH
bond scission (Scheme 4). Preferred OH bond activation,
however, is suggested for the system FeO+/CH3OH according
to experimental data[84a] and supported by DFT calcula-
tions.[84b] Similarly, mass-selected cations FeX+ (X = OH, F)
undergo a clean reaction with CD3OH [Eq. (10)],[85a] while

the related NiX+ systems (X = OH, F, Cl, Br) effect both OH
and CD bond activation of CD3OH; the branching ratio is
strongly ligand-dependent.[85b] For example, Ni(OH)+ prefers
OH bond activation, but the complex NiBr+ preferentially
activates the CD bond of CD3OH.[85b] Finally, in the initial
phase of the reaction of VO3
 with methanol, extensive
labeling experiments and computational studies indicate that
specific activation of the OH group prevails as well.[86]
Unambiguous examples for an initial CH bond activa-
tion are rather scarce; for example, the gas-phase reaction
between Mn(CO)3
 and methanol commences with the rate-
limiting CH bond cleavage of the substrate,[86a] and in the
reaction of Con
+ (n = 4, 5) cluster ions with CD3OH, only D2 is
liberated.[86b] For the oxidation of methanol by ferrate
(FeO4
2), numerous pathways were considered computation-
ally, and it appears that CH and OH bond scissions
compete with each other.[87] This prediction, including com-
puted KIEs to distinguish between different mechanistic
scenarios, calls for an experimental verification. For the
dehydrogenation of CH3OH by mononuclear vanadium oxide
cations, in line with the experimental findings, calculations
clearly favor a reaction path that is initiated by activation of a
CH bond in the course of which the metals oxidation state
does not change (Scheme 5); moreover, spin changes from the
ground-state triplet surface to the excited singlet manifold do
not matter in this particular system, as the two electronic
ground states are well-separated energetically and do not
cross.[88]
The mechanisms of the CH3OH!CH2O oxidation by the
Fenton reagent were studied by Baerends and co-workers at
the DFT level[89] both in the gas phase by considering
microsolvated clusters and in aqueous solutions. Two com-
peting mechanisms were identified, in line with the dual
nature of the reagent: 1) A direct one in which the high-valent
FeIVO2+ moiety homolytically abstracts a hydrogen atom from
the methyl group (path 
B in Scheme 4) and 2) a coordination
mechanism in which after complexation the OH bond of the
substrate is cleaved heterolytically to generate initially an
Fe(OCH3) species (path 
A in Scheme 4). As expected, given
the nature of highly charged systems, solvent effects matter,
with the consequence that the energy barriers calculated are
quite sensitive to changes of the microenvironment.[89]
A strongly metal-dependent, alternating activation of C
H versus OH bonds of methanol occurs when the gas-phase
species are generated upon electrospray ionization of meth-
anolic solutions of MX2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni; X = Br, I).[90–92] As
shown in Figure 10, in the iron system selective activation of
the hydroxy group of the ESI solvent prevails; in contrast,
nickel salts activate the CH bond, and for the cobalt
complexes an intermediate situation is encountered.[90a]
Combining the labeling data (Figure 10) with structure-
specific collision experiments of the [M,C,H3,O]+ product
ions provides evidence for the exclusive formation of Fe-
(OCH3)+, Ni(CH2OH)+, and a mixture of Co(OCH3)+ and
Co(CH2OH)+ with a preference for the methoxy complex.[90a]

Interestingly, a mixture of Rh(OCH3) and Rh(CH2OH), with
comparable RhO and RhC bond dissociation energies, has
also been obtained from treating rhodium(I) porphyrines
with methanol.[90b]
Mechanistic insight into the origin of the bond-selective,
metal-dependent CH3OH activation has been gathered from
extensive DFT calculations and by experimentally establish-
ing the precursors from which the [M,C,H3,O]+ species
originate upon ESI of MX2/CH3OH solutions.[90a,92] For iron,
the Fe(OCH3)+ product is due to sequential evaporation of up
to eight CH3OH molecules from Fe(OCH3)(CH3OH)n
+ (n 
8), and the latter is generated by solvolysis of FeX2 by the
nucleophilic
CH3OH
solvent.
Moreover,
high-spin
Fe-
(OCH3)+ is, according to DFT calculations, 16.6 kcalmol1
more stable than the quintet isomer Fe(CH2OH)+. For the co-
generation of isomeric [Co,C,H3,O]+, two pathways have been
identified. One, leading to the methoxy complex Co(OCH3)+,
is analogous to that for the iron system starting from
Co(OCH3)(CH3OH)n
+ (n  8). However, this precursor, in
competition with sequential CH3OH evaporation, also under-
goes loss of CH2O and CH3OH to generate Co(H)(CH3OH)+.
This intermediate, in a spin-allowed elimination involving the
CoH bond and a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of
CH3OH, then decomposes to a quartet state of Co(CH2OH)+
which is 6.0 kcalmol1 higher in energy than ground-state
Co(OCH3)+ having the same multiplicity. For the exclusive
generation of Ni(CH2OH)+ two pathways were identified,
both involving Ni(X)(CH3OH)+ (X = H, Br) as immediate
precursors; in the subsequent evaporation of HX, the hydro-
gen atom originates from the methyl group of CH3OH. DFT
calculations (Figure 11) are not only consistent with the
experimental observations but also explain why Ni(CH2OH)+
is formed rather than the thermochemically slightly more
favorable Ni(OCH3)+ isomer. Here, the crucial point is that
starting from ground-state triplet Ni(H)(CH3OH)+ (36), the
spin-allowed reaction to pro-
duce
3Ni(OCH3)+
via
3TS6/7
cannot
compete
energetically
with a reaction which, after
spin inversion 36!16, proceeds
via

toward

Finally,
the

Ni(H)(OH)+ species[93] in the

goes exclusive loss of HD, thus
pointing to a clean activation of
the methyl CD bond.[85b]

hOi equivalent of the reaction shown in Equation (11) is
provided by FeO+. Since FeO+ cannot be generated directly
from the Fe+/O2 couple on thermochemical grounds,[95] the
decisive experiment is a methanol-mediated activation of
dioxygen in which the alcohol serves as a co-reductant
[Eq. (16)]. While this process is quite exothermic (DrH =
24 kcalmol1), the rate efficiency is only about 10% as a
result of spin barriers.[84,85,96]
A combination of the steps in Equations (14)–(17) leads
to a viable sequence for the Fe+-mediated oxidation of CH4 to
generate CH2O according to Equation (13). Here, the
CH3OH molecule coordinated to the metal plays a central
role both as a precursor for the oxidation product CH2O and
as a crucial intermediate in the activation of O2. Furthermore,
the co-formation of FeO+ in Reaction (16) is quite remark-
able in that over-oxidation (namely, the formation of Fe+ and
HCOOH) does not occur in this experiment, although bare
FeO+ rapidly reacts with formaldehyde.[97] The seemingly
most simple step in Scheme 6, that is, the mere complexation
of the iron cation by methanol [Eq. (17)], however, does not
take place in the low-pressure regime (typically below
107 mbar). However, the magnitude of k17 can be enhanced
with increasing pressure through ternary collisions.
A completely different, rather interesting example has
been reported by OHair and co-workers, who studied
computationally and experimentally the reaction of VO3

with CH3OH in the gas phase, including the re-oxidation of
the catalyst.[98] The first step of the reaction corresponds to the
addition of methanol so that the methoxy group coordinates
directly to the vanadium atom and the hydrogen atom of the
OH group interacts with one of the oxygen atoms of VO3

(Scheme 7). In the second step, another hydrogen atom from
the methyl group migrates to the newly formed hydroxy
group, which leads to a complex of VO2
, water, and
formaldehyde. This complex loses preferentially H2O. Form-
aldehyde is subsequently replaced by molecular oxygen, and
this step represents the reoxidation of VIII back to the VV
catalyst. The subsequent coordination of another methanol
molecule proceeds in analogy with the first step, but the
oxidation of the methoxy group to formaldehyde this time is
not associated with the formation of a water molecule but
with the reduction of the h2-peroxy ligand. Elimination of the
thus formed formaldehyde and subsequent water loss leads to
the regeneration of the VO3
 catalyst.
For the binuclear anionic dimolybdate clusters shown in
Scheme 8, two gas-phase cycles have been identified, and in
both cycles Mo2(O6)(OCHR2) (R = H, alkyl) acts as a
central intermediate.[99] Three steps matter: 1) condensation
of [Mo2O6(OH)] with the alcohols R2CHOH and elimina-
tion of water to produce an alkoxo-bound cluster; 2) oxida-
tion of the alkoxo ligand and its liberation as an aldehyde or a
ketone in a step which is rate-limiting and requires the supply
of external energy through collisional activation; 3) regener-
ation of the catalyst by oxidation with nitromethane. The
second cycle is similar, but differs in the order of the reaction

with the alcohol and the use of nitromethane as the terminal
oxidant.
The role of the binuclear metal center was assessed by
examination of the relative reactivities of the mononuclear
MO3(OH) and binuclear M2O6(OH) complexes (M = Cr,
Mo, W). The molybdenum and tungsten binuclear centers
(M = Mo, W) were reactive towards alcohols, but the
chromium complex was not; this finding is consistent with
the order of basicity of the hydroxo ligand in these anionic
complexes. However, the tungsten complex W2O6(OCHR2)
prefers a redox-neutral elimination of an alkene rather than
oxidation of the alkoxo ligand to form an aldehyde or a
ketone. This observation is in keeping with the oxidizing
power of the anions. Interestingly, each of the mononuclear
anions MO3(OH) (M = Cr, Mo, W) was inert to reaction
with methanol, which highlights the importance of the second
MO3 unit in the catalytic cycles. Clearly, only the bimolybdate
center has the appropriate balance of electronic properties
that allows it to participate in each of the three steps; these
gas-phase studies with well-defined cluster anions correspond
to the unique role of molybdenum(VI) trioxide (MoO3) in the
industrial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde at 300–
4008C.[100]
Finally, the dinuclear manganese oxide cations Mn2O2
+
and Mn2O+ were also found to act as catalysts in the gas-phase
oxidation of CH3OH.[101] As in the previous system, input of
external energy (collisional activation or heating) is, however,
essential for at least one of the reaction steps to close the
catalytic cycle for the Mn2On
+ (n = 1, 2) oxides.
5.3. Comparison of a Model System with a Real Catalyst
While most of the gas-phase experiments rely on charged
systems and therefore are somewhat limited in scope, in an in
silico experiment, that is, computations, the intermediates and
transition states assumed to be involved in a catalytic cycle do
not suffer from this limitation; in addition, the structural
complexity of the species can be modified at will and adjusted
to both the gas-phase models and the real catalyst. Here, we
will describe some aspects of the CH3OH!CH2O conversion
for which silica-supported vanadium oxides serve as real
catalysts. This reaction has also been studied in the gas phase
in quite some detail using VO(OCH3)3
+ and larger vanadium
oxide clusters as models,[83r,88,102] and extensive computational
work also exists.[77h,103] The computed reaction sequence
commences with adsorption of the substrate on the surface,
the latter having a presumed vanadyl-site structure VO(O
Si
)3 (Figure 12). This step is associated with the cleavage of
one of the VOSi bridges and provides VO(OCH3)(OSi
)2
and HOSi sites. Next, a hydrogen atom from the methoxy
group is transferred to the terminal vanadyl oxygen atom,
which results in the formation of formaldehyde. The model
compound VO(OCH3)3 thus mimics an intermediate in which
two methoxy groups represent the missing OSi links to the
silica support, while the remaining part is realistic. In the

singly charged state, the model corresponds to the VV
oxidation state with a radical site located at the oxygen
atom of the V=O unit; rearrangement leads to the VIV radical
species coordinated to formaldehyde (Figure 12). The overall
reaction within this distonic radical cation is exothermic. The
energy barrier predicted at the B3LYP level (ca. 19 kcal
mol1) is slightly overestimated, as revealed by a comparison
with the threshold photoionization study of the dissociation of
VO(OCH3)3
+; the latter suggests a barrier of about (13 
2) kcalmol1. The same model reaction in the neutral state
shows similar results as far as the geometry and the formal
oxidation states of the vanadium sites of intermediates and
products are concerned; however, the corresponding reaction
step is endothermic, as are experiments with real catalysts.
Thus, in this case, while the charged model provides hints as to
the reaction mechanism and suggests possible structures of
intermediates, it cannot be taken as a reliable guide for
energetic considerations.[103a]
As a further test for the relevance of such simplified
models, a comparison of VO(OCH3)3 with larger model
compounds,
such
as
the
dimer
of
VO(OCH3)3,
VO-
[OSi(OH)3]3, or vanadyl silsesquioxane (Figure 12) has been
made. The dimer of VO(OCH3)3 exhibits a reactivity that is
qualitatively analogous with that of the monomer. The next
two models, VO[OSi(OH)3]3 and silsesquioxane, offer the
possibility to study the first reaction step, that is, the
adsorption of methanol on the catalyst. This step leads, in
the case of the VO[OSi(OH)3]3, to free Si(OH)4, which is
stabilized by the formation of intramolecular hydrogen
bonds.[104] As this option is not available in a real catalyst,
this model overestimates the adsorption energy (21 kcal
mol1). In the case of the vanadyl silsesquioxane complex,
the addition of methanol to the model catalyst is accompanied
by the formation of an integrated OSi(H)(OH)O unit,
and therefore, the results can be expected to be more
accurate. Accordingly, the adsorption energy drops substan-
tially to 9.6 kcalmol1. Next, hydrogen rearrangement within
the OVO(OCH3)O unit occurs, and the activation
energy for this step is calculated to be around 48 kcalmol1
for the VO[OSi(OH)3]3 model and 48.5 kcalmol1 for silses-
quioxane. Final optimization using the broken-symmetry
approach, correction for the spin contamination, and the
inclusion of zero-point vibrational energy lowers the energy
barrier to 37 kcalmol1 (Figure 12). This value is in rather
good agreement with the experiments conducted with real
systems; therefore, the model approach appears adequa-
te.[103a,104]
Other examples for using gas-phase experiments with
“isolated” reagents as models for mimicking reactions in the
condensed phase include 1) the Degussa process, that is, the
platinum-mediated coupling of methane and ammonia to
generate HCN,[5] 2) the mechanistic understanding of the
Cytochrome P450 mediated CH bond oxygenation[62,63]
based on a detailed analysis of the most simple system, that
is, FeO+/H2,[63,96] or 3) the relationship between the rich gas-
phase chemistry of bare PtO2
+[105] and the extraordinary
features exhibited by high-valent platinum oxides,[106] just to
mention a few.
6. Conclusions
“It remains a source of frustration to know so much about the
reactions of transition-metal ions with hydrocarbons and yet
have so many questions remain unanswered.”
Peter B. Armentrout, Jack L. Beauchamp, 1989[107]
On this rather depressing note, Armentrout and Beau-
champ concluded their superb review on the fundamental
aspects of gas-phase organometallic chemistry. Considering
the difficulties encountered at that time in elucidating
mechanistic aspects of reactions occurring at a single metal
center, it was not surprising that processes of higher complex-
ity involving clusters, surface reactions, and metal catalysts
were considered as “largely shrouded in mystery”.[107] How-
ever, things have changed since the landmark paper of
Allison, Freas, and Ridge in 1979[108a] about the first example
of gas-phase activation of alkanes by “naked” transition-
metal ions, the seminal Kappes–Staley report[108b] on genuine,
homogeneous gas-phase catalysis by bare Fe+, and the
Armentrout–Beauchamp review in 1989[107]—and, fortu-
nately, things have changed for the better! This is in no
small part due to the breath-taking instrumental improve-
ments (laser desorption, electrospray ionization, Smalley-
type cluster-ion sources, multipole analyzer, ion traps, gas-
phase ion spectroscopy, ion-mobility experiments, or ion-
electron diffraction, to name but a few) which permit
experiments which were thought of as simply impossible
two decades ago. Structures of gaseous, medium-sized species
of any charge state can now be routinely identified spectro-
scopically and thus form a reliable starting point for reactivity
studies.[109] Conceptually, the development of new mechanistic
paradigms, such as two-state reactivity[17] or appreciating the
role of relativistic effects[12–14] in bond-activation processes,
has removed some of the mysteries and are now considered
relevant in several areas far beyond the field of gas-phase
organometallic chemistry.[62,64] Further,
the inclusion of
ligated systems[4j,m,n,110] not only extends beyond the world
of “idealized” naked-atom chemistry; these systems also
serve as more realistic models for reactive species or
intermediates that are capable of activating methane in the
condensed phase, as do the exciting cluster studies aimed at
mimicking surface reactions.[4a,g,k,l,n,22,24,48b,c,83,111] A major
breakthrough certainly was driven by computational chemis-
try. While open-shell, electronically and coordinatively unsa-
turated transition-metal systems still pose non-trivial prob-
lems,[112] the progress made in the last two decades is nearly
unparalleled—and that applies not only to gas-phase stud-
ies[113] but extends also to the most complex surface reac-
tions.[31a,114] Actually, the quality of contemporary computa-
tional studies is such that theoretical work no longer only
complements or explains experimental findings after the fact;
rather, theory occasionally challenges experimentalists by
predicting the fleeting existence of particularly reactive
species which have not yet been generated.[115]
There is indeed good reason to argue that an integrated
approach, as intended and already realized to some extent by
UniCat,[116] will also help to cope with the persisting
challenges associated with the activation of small molecules,

for example, methane or carbon dioxide.[117] Thus, at long last,
bridging the gap between chemistry conducted at an atomic
level in the gas phase and the most complex behavior at
surfaces[118] or in solution[119] seems possible, provided scien-
tists do not ignore Gerhard Ertls gentle reminder about the
relationship between the simple and the complex, as depicted
in Figure 13.[120]
7. Addendum
Since the submission of this review article, numerous
publications have appeared which have a bearing on the
topics discussed here. Among these studies, together with a
few articles which were not included originally, the following
ones deserve brief mentioning.
An exhaustive review on the role of organometallic
intermediates on the active centers in surface-mediated CH
bond activation has been published by Copert,[121] and the
state-of-the-art of theoretical descriptions of surface reac-
tions, aimed at engineering the electronic structure of the
active surface sites, forms the focus of a review by Norskøv
et al.[122]
With
regard
to
the
dehydrogenation
of
methane
(Scheme 1, process 
1 ) by singly or doubly charged actinide
ions (An+ or An2+), the role of 5f electrons and orbitals has
been analyzed both computationally and experimentally.[123]
Of particular importance is the finalizing that the insertion
efficiency to produce CAn2+H or CAn+H species is
related to the energy needed to promote the An+/An2+ ions
from their ground state to a prepared divalent state with two
non-5f-valence electrons.[124] In addition, in the exothermic
reaction of, for example, Th2+ with CH4, a spin crossing from
the ground-state triplet reactant to the excited singlet surface
of the products is necessary to bring about thermal dehydro-
genation. Possible origins of the anomalously low reactivity of
Pt4
+ towards CH4
[22,23d] has been discussed at great length
using DFT-based calculations.[125]
In the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage [Eq. (8)],
quite a few studies have been performed recently. In addition
to the hydrogen-atom abstraction from CH4 by PbO+C,[42] the
congeners GeO+C and SnO+C exhibit parallel behavior both in
terms of efficiencies and kinetic isotope effects.[126] Extremely
insightful experimental and computational studies on this
topic were conducted by He, Ding, and co-workers.[127] This
work once more underlines the crucial role that oxygen-
centered radicals play in the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT),
irrespective of the charge state; in fact, the calculated spin
density at the terminal oxygen atoms in cluster oxides could
be correlated with the observed rate constants, and evidence
was presented how, by a proper choice of the chemical
composition of the cluster oxides, a fine tuning of the spin
density can be achieved.[127b] These findings, together with
those described in Section 3, are of quite some importance in
the conceptual understanding of HAT in solution. Here it has
been suggested[128] that “the presence of unpaired spin density
at the abstracting atom is not a requirement for, or a predicator
of, HAT reactivity”,[128a] and that HAT is better described by a
coupled electron/proton transfer, that is, HCﬃe- + H+. In the
latter, the electron is transferred to the highly electrophilic
metal (often in a high oxidation state), and the proton to the
basic (oxygen) ligand. As far as gas-phase reactions are
concerned, without any exception, thermal HAT requires the
presence of unpaired spin density at the abstracting oxygen
atom. This view is also supported by the recently described
CuO+C/CH4 couple.[129] Here, the ground-state triplet of CuO+C
with a spin density of 1.68 at the oxygen atom brings about, at
room temperature, HAT with an efficiency of 20% and an
intramolecular KIE of 2.6. The competing CH4!CH3OH
conversion, having an efficiency of 31%, occurs after a
triplet–singlet switch, that is, the CuO+C/CH4 system demon-
strates spin-selective reactions in the thermal activation of
methane.
For the CH4!CH3OH conversion, several new articles
addressing different aspects of this problem have also
surfaced recently. Gunnoe and co-workers describe in a
minireview strategies and fundamental advancements,[130] the
identification of reactive intermediates by matrix-isolation
infrared spectroscopy has been reviewed by Wang and
Zhou,[131] theoretical aspects of the cytochrome P450 medi-
ated methane oxidation form the subject of articles by Hu
et al.[132a] and the Shaik group,[132b] tuning a P450 enzyme by
protein engineering has been reported by Reetz and co-
workers,[133] and, finally, the role of Fe-doped zeolites[68] in the
oxidation of CH4 by N2O was reported as early as 1998.[134]
For the mechanism of the CH3OH!CH2O oxidation
(Section 5), the work of Mavrikakis and co-workers[135] is
worth mentioning; the authors present a microkinetic model
together with detailed experimental studies on the platinum-
mediated decomposition of CH3OH and demonstrate that the
reaction commences with scission of the CH bond, according
to Scheme 4, path 
B ; this step is also rate-limiting. For iron–
vanadate catalysts, often employed for this reaction, in recent
studies the nature of the catalytically active site has been
identified, and it was shown that OH bond activation
(Scheme 4, path 
A ) initiates the methanol oxidation.[136,137]
