Abstract
Constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics is used to study reactions between molten LiI and gas phase molecules (O2, H2O, and I2) in an attempt to elucidate some aspects of the alkane oxidative dehydrogenation activity performed in the presence of molten LiI. We investigate the energy of reactions that produce LiIO, LiIO3, LiIO4, Li2O2, Li2O, LiOH, and I2. We find that the most favorable process is the formation of gaseous I2, coproduced with LiOH or Li2O (depending on the availability of water). If water is absent, then some LiIO4 will also be formed. However, this is unlikely to happen during oxidative dehydrogenation, because LiI is very hydroscopic and the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction produces water.

1 Introduction
Alkenes (ethylene, propylene, styrene, etc.) are basic compounds in industrial organic chemistry. Currently they are obtained by thermal dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, or ethylbenzene. (1-3) These reactions are equilibrium-limited, require high temperature, use large amounts of energy, and are plagued by catalyst coking. Many approaches have been proposed for overcoming these difficulties. One of the most popular is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), where the endothermic dehydrogenation of alkanes is combined with the exothermic formation of water from O2 and hydrogen. In spite of much effort, no commercially successful ODH catalyst has been found. (4, 5) An alternative is halogen-mediated ODH (HM-ODH) which is formally described by the following reactions:
(1)
(2)
The sum of these reactions is as follows:
(3)
which is the ODH reaction. This scheme has been carried out by exposing a mixture of hydrocarbon and oxygen to molten LiI. (6-9) LiI is utilized as an I2 source through the reaction 2LiI + 1/2O2 → I2 + Li2O. (10) If the hydrocarbon was propane, then the propylene yield was around 60%, which is competitive with the existing industrial dehydrogenation processes. HM-ODH has several advantages when compared to the existing industrial dehydrogenation: it is exothermic (the industrial dehydrogenation is very endothermic), it does not require vacuum or the dilution of the feed with steam, it is carried out at lower temperatures, and coking is not a problem. The molten salt has high heat capacity and heat conductivity and hot-spot formation is less likely. A substantial disadvantage is that molten LiI, LiOH, and the mixture of HI and water are very corrosive.
The experimental results do not make clear the role of the molten LiI salt. It is possible that LiI is only a source of I2 and the HM-ODH reactions take place in the gas phase, but it is also conceivable that some chemistry takes place at the surface of the molten salt. This may happen if the oxygen reacts with the salt and makes oxygen containing iodine compounds which then oxidize the alkane. Another possibility is that I2 dissolves in the molten salt and this dissolved form reacts with the alkanes.
In this paper, we use ab initio, constant-temperature, molecular dynamics to investigate the solvation of H2O, I2, and O2 in molten LiI and the reaction of gaseous O2 with molten LiI. It is found that, at 800 K, it is thermodynamically preferable that dry O2 gas reacts with the molten LiI to produce I2, solid Li2O (Li2O is not soluble in LiI) and a minor amount of LiIO4. In the presence of water, the reaction of O2 with molten LiI produces only LiOH and I2. LiOH is soluble in molten LiI. The calculations suggest that the main oxidant in alkane dehydrogenation is I2, which can exist as either gaseous I2 or as I42– ions dissolved in the salt.
2 Computational Methods
The catalyst is modeled by a thin film of molten LiI (40 LiI units) in a periodic 12.6 × 12.6 × 44.0 Å3 supercell. The LiI film is free-standing and has a thickness of about 25 Å. Ab initio, constant temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out using the VASP program. (11-14) The energies and the forces acting on the atoms are calculated with density functional theory (DFT) and the PBE functional. (15) A plane-wave basis set with a 350 eV energy cutoff is used and all calculations are performed at the Γ-point. The valence electrons (one for H and Li, six for O, and seven for I) are treated with the PAW method, and the core electrons are treated with the frozen core approximation. To assess the importance of spin, both spin-polarized and spin-paired calculations have been performed. It was found that the spin-paired electronic structure is correct (lowest energy), when the system does not contain O2 molecules. With one O2 molecule, the system is a triplet. We therefore impose a triplet spin electronic structure in MD simulations that contain an O2 molecule, but we do not use spin-polarized calculations for the other simulations. We are aware that spin–orbit coupling and van der Waals interactions are not properly accounted for in this study. However, we calculate energy differences and therefore some of these effects are canceled. Furthermore, the conclusions reached are based on energy difference of the order of 1 eV, and therefore it is unlikely that they will be changed by inclusion of van der Waals interactions or spin–orbit coupling.
The MD simulations are performed at constant N, V, T (particle number, volume and temperature, respectively) with a Nosé thermostat that keeps the temperature around 800 K. (16) The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is used, which is accurate due to the large band gap in the system. The atomic motions are treated classically and propagated with 1 fs time steps. The internal energy of different systems is obtained from the MD simulations as the time average kinetic and potential energy:
(4)
The time t0 is chosen to allow the system to equilibrate and lose memory of the initial conditions; it was found that between 0.3 and 3.4 ps were sufficient for this purpose. The only exception is the solvation of I2 for which t0 = 10.3 ps; this was necessary because I2 combines with two I– ions over a 10 ps timespan. The MD simulations are subsequently sampled for at least 9 ps (t–t0 ≥ 9 ps). Solvation and reaction energies are obtained by subtracting the mean energy of the initial state from the mean energy of the final state. In this way, the solvation energy of a molecule is calculated as the mean energy of the solvated molecule in LiI(l), minus the mean energy of pure LiI(l), minus the mean energy of the molecule in the gas phase. We add kBT to internal energies of gas phase molecules, because VASP fixes the center of mass for these MD simulations, so translational kinetic energy is not included.
The limitation in computational resources necessitates relatively short molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, it is possible that the molten LiI system gets trapped in some local minimum or that it retains memory of the starting configuration. Such issues may result in errors in the time average energies. However, the main conclusions regarding which molecular species are soluble in molten LiI and which reaction products are energetically favorable are based on energy differences that are larger than the possible errors in the calculations.

The function gA–B(r) is defined such that pA–B dr = 4π r2gA–B(r) ρB dr, where pA–B(r) dr is the probability of finding an atom B at a distance between r and r + dr from A and ρB is the number density of atom B calculated by estimating the volume of the film to be 12.6 × 12.6 × 25 Å3.
3 Structure of the Molten LiI Film
In this section, we discuss the structural properties of the pure LiI(l) thin film obtained from a 14 ps MD simulation. Figure 1(a) shows a side view of the atomic configuration at the end of the MD simulation and the Supporting Information, SI, contains a movie of the MD simulation. The purpose of the movie is to demonstrate that the ions change their position and sample a variety of configurations. The LiI(l) thin film is therefore a liquid and not an amorphous solid.
Figure 1(b) shows the time-averaged number density of I and Li atoms in the film as a function of position perpendicular to the film surface. This was calculated by averaging in time over the number of atoms (ions) between two planes parallel to the surface of the liquid film, and separated by 0.5 Å. We find no segregation of the Li+ and I– ions at the molten salt–vacuum interfaces. Such segregation has been observed in aqueous electrolyte solutions, (18) but it is less likely in this system because of the large ion concentration and the constraints imposed by charge neutrality. The average atomic density of both Li and I in the bulk is found to be higher than expected from the experimental density of bulk molten LiI (black dashed line). (17) This may be caused by the fact that the film is thin.
The radial pair-distribution functions (g(r)) for Li—I, Li—Li, and I—I are shown in Figure 1(c). The average Li—I bond length (2.7 Å) and Li—Li/I—I bond length (∼4.5 Å) is in reasonable agreement with the 2.85 and 4.45 Å found by X-ray diffraction messurements. (19) By integrating the probability of finding an atom of the opposite type in the first peak of the Li—I radial pair-distribution function, we find that the average number of Li—I neighbors is 2.9 (r < 3.3 Å). This is less than the 5.6 neighbors obtained in the X-ray diffraction experiment. Some of the discrepancy is due to the atoms situated at the molten salt–vacuum interfaces, which inevitably have lower number of neighbors, but it does not explain all of the difference. It is not easy to reconcile the observations of too high bulk density, accurate bond lengths, and too few nearest neighbor atoms at the same time.

Li atoms closer than 2.5 Å from the solvated species have increased radii.
4 Solvation of H2O, I2, and O2 in Molten LiI
LiI, like most other molten alkali halides, is very hygroscopic (20) and the ODH reaction 3 produces water. For these reasons, we examine water solvation by placing a water molecule inside the molten LiI film, performing a MD simulation of this system to obtain the internal energy, and subtracting the internal energy of the pure LiI thin film and that of gaseous H2O. We find that there is a mean energy gain of −1.0 eV when the water molecule is dissolved in the salt (Figure 2(a)). Figure 2(b) shows that the O atom of the water molecule interacts with a Li+ cation (the O—Li distance is less than 2.5 Å). Such interactions are present throughout the MD simulation with the water molecule “jumping” from one Li+ cation to another Li+ cation by coordinating to two Li+ cation for short period of time. The solvation of H2O in LiI(l) is found to be more favorable than solvation in LiCl(l) supported on MgO(s), which results in an energy gain of −0.6 to −0.7 eV. (21) This is likely because the electrostatic interaction of Li+ with I– is weaker than the interaction of Li+ with Cl–, so the Li+ cations are more free to bind to water. The SI includes a movie of the MD simulation for solvated H2O in LiI(l).
Next we investigate solvation of an I2 molecule in the molten LiI. Gaseous I2 formation was observed in the ODH experiments, when oxygen gas was passed through the molten LiI. (6-9) The formed I2 molecules may react with alkanes to produce alkenes and HI, (22) but I2 could also dissolve in the LiI molten salt. I2 solvation is found to be energetically favorable with a mean energy stabilization of −1.1 eV (see the green curve in Figure 2(a)). This indicates that a significant portion of the I2 molecules produced by the oxidation of molten LiI (in the HM-ODH process) will be dissolved in the molten LiI. The MD simulation of I2 solvation required a long initial thermalization time (t0 = 10.3 ps), because I2 solvation is followed by bond formation between I2 and two I– ions. Stable mean energies were only obtained after this process was completed. The linear I42– species (shown by four larger purple spheres in Figure 2(c)), formed through the reaction I2(g) + 2I– → I42–, is stable. Linear I42– ions are known from compounds such as [Cu(NH3)4]2+I42–. (23) Larger polyions are also possible (24) but they cannot be formed in our simulation because they would exceed the size of the computational cell. The behavior of I2 dissolved in molten LiI differs from that observed in aqueous LiI solution where I3– is the common ion found in connection with I2 solvation. (25) The I42– species spans the entire supercell and one might think that the simulated system forms a long chain consisting of I42– units. We argue that this is not the case, because the four I atoms in I42– are not equivalent. The average distance between the outer I atom (in I42–) and its periodic replica is slightly longer than the internal bond distances in the I42– ion (3.34 ± 0.27 Å compared to 3.24 ± 0.25 Å, 3.20 ± 0.26 Å, and 3.24 ± 0.27 Å (±one standard deviation)). These distances are shorter than the average I—I distance (4.5 Å) in pure LiI(l) obtained from the radial pair-distribution function (Figure 1(c)) indicating that none of the I atoms are I– ions any longer. Bader charge analysis was performed on ten configurations separated by 1 ps and selected from the last 9 ps of the simulation. The average Bader charges (±one standard deviation) on the I atoms forming the I42– ion are −0.53 ± 0.09 e, −0.34 ± 0.08 e, −0.37 ± 0.10 e, and −0.55 ± 0.09 e, confirming that the four I atoms are not equivalent. These values are significantly different from the average values for the surrounding I– ions (−0.87 ± 0.01 e) and Li+ ions (0.87 ± 0.01 e). We conclude that the species I42– is formed when I2 dissolves in molten LiI, but we cannot rule out the possibility that polyions containing more iodine atoms are more stable.
Finally, we investigate O2 solubility by placing one O2 molecule in the LiI(l) film and fixing the total spin of the system to a triplet state. Solvation is energetically unfavorable: placing O2 in the liquid increases the average energy by +0.3 eV (Figure 2(a)). Therefore, molecular oxygen is not stabilized in the LiI(l) system. The average O—O bond length for O2 in LiI(l) is 1.39 ± 0.10 Å, which is somewhat longer than the average bond length found in the O2-gas MD simulation (1.24 ± 0.05 Å). This indicates that some electron charge from I– ions is transferred to the solvated O2 molecule. The atomic configuration at the end of the MD simulation (Figure 2(d)) supports this, because the O2 molecule is mainly surrounded by Li+ ions. However, this interaction is not strong enough to favor the dissolution of O2.
5 Reactions between O2 and Molten LiI
In this section, we investigate possible reactions between O2 molecules and the LiI system (eqs 5–10) to form LiIO, LiIO3, and LiIO4 species in the molten salt (Figure 3), as well as the formation of gaseous I2 together with Li2O2, Li2O, or LiOH species in the molten salt (Figure 4). All of these reactions produce possible oxidizing specie, and the analysis of the energies of these reactions may give information about the possible ODH mechanism.

Li atoms closer than 2.5 Å from the product ions have increased radii.
5.1 Formation of Oxyanions Species
Oxygen and iodine can form a series of oxyanions (IxOyz-), (26) where most of them are good oxidizing agents. (27, 28) First, we consider lithium hypoiodite (LiIO) formed by the following reaction:
(5)
To calculate the energy of this reaction, we place two O atoms into the LiI molten salt and calculate the mean energy. To obtain the reaction energy, we subtract from this the mean energy of pure LiI(l) and that of O2(g). The reaction energy obtained in this way is −1.6 eV (Figure 3(a)). During the initialization of the simulation, both O atoms bind to I– and form two IO– species (Figure 3(b)). The I and O atoms in the IO– species stay together for the entire simulation with an average I–O bond length of 2.04 ± 0.10 Å.
Similarly, the reaction between O2 and LiI may lead to the formation of lithium iodate (LiIO3):
(6)
which is another possible oxyanion. The mean energy of reaction 6 is −3.0 eV (Figure 3(a)). The three I—O bonds in IO3– (Figure 3(c)) have average lengths of 1.86 ± 0.07 Å, 1.85 ± 0.06 Å, and 1.84 ± 0.05 Å.
Finally, we put two O2 into the LiI molten salt system to form lithium periodate (LiIO4) and calculate the mean energy of the following reaction:
(7)
which is −4.7 eV (Figure 3(a)). The four I—O bonds in IO4– (Figure 3(d)) have average lengths of 1.95 ± 0.11 Å, 1.88 ± 0.06 Å, 2.02 ± 0.10 Å, and 1.95 ± 0.10 Å.
These results indicate that IO4– is energetically the most stable oxyanion, since formation of IO4– gives the highest stabilization of the internal energy both per I– ion consumed and per O2 molecule consumed (ΔE/nO2 = −2.4 eV for IO4– compared to −1.6 eV for IO– and −2.0 eV for IO3–).

The internal energy of pure LiI(l) is included as it is used as a reference (0 eV). Final configuration in the MD sampling for (b) the O22– ion, (c) the two O2– ions, and (d) the two OH– ions. Li atoms closer than 2.5 Å from the product ions have increased radii.
5.2 Formation of I2 Gas and Li2O2, Li2O, or LiOH
An oxygen molecule can also react with LiI to produce I2 gas and lithium peroxide (Li2O2) according to the following:
(8)
To calculate the energy of this reaction we insert one O2 molecule into the molten salt and remove two I atoms to form one I2 molecule in the gas. By adding the mean energy of this system to that I2(g) and subtracting the mean energy of the pure LiI(l) and O2(g) we find a reaction energy of −0.8 eV (Figure 4(a)). From the MD simulation we observe that O22– coordinates to several Li+ cations (Figure 4b) and that the average O—O bond length is 1.55 ± 0.08 Å. This is longer than the bond length we found for solvated molecular O2 (1.39 ± 0.10 Å) and fits with the bond length in bulk Li2O2(s) (1.55 Å). (29) These observations indicate that the oxygen inside the molten salt is a peroxide ion, O22–.
Oxygen can also react with the salt to produce 2I2(g) and lithium oxide (Li2O) (rather than Li2O2):
(9)
The mean energy of this reaction is −1.3 eV (Figure 4(a)). The average O—O bond length is 3.42 ± 0.40 Å (±one standard deviation). The large distance indicates that, unlike the case of O22–, there is no O—O bond when 2Li2O is formed. A snapshot of the atomic configuration surrounding the two O2– ions shows that each O2– ion binds to five Li+ with one of the Li+ binding to both O2– ions (Figure 4(b)). The energy of eq 9 is more negative than the energy of eq 8, which indicates that the Li2O(LiI) is more stable than Li2O2(LiI). However, the reaction path to 2O2– requires breaking the O—O bond, which may have a high barrier, i.e., slow kinetics.
So far, water has not been part of the reactions considered. However, water is produced in the ODH reaction and our calculations show that water has a high stability in molten LiI. Therefore, we have also studied the following reaction:
(10)
Two I– ions are exchanged with two OH– ions to produce LiOH and I2 gas. The reaction energy is −2.4 eV (Figure 4(a)). A snapshot of the atomic configuration at the end of the MD simulation shows two separate OH– ions that are each surrounded by three Li+ ions (Figure 4(d)).
5.3 Thermodynamic Stability of the Considered Species
The mean energy changes associated with the reactions between O2(g) and LiI(l) are summarized in Table 1. At 800 K, entropy contributes significantly to the reaction Gibbs free energy, and it must be accounted for. Unfortunately, the entropy change is not directly accessible from the MD simulations and has to be estimated separately. Our approach is to use pure phase entropy data, which are available for some species we consider: LiI(l), O2(g), H2O(g), Li2O(l), LiOH(l), and I2(g) [http://kinetics.nist.gov/janaf/]. Data for LiIO4(l) are not available and we use the entropy of 2O2(g) + LiCl(l) → LiClO4(l) as a substitute. The entropy change for reactions 7, 9, and 10 can be estimated from these pure phase values, and the estimated change in Gibbs free energy is obtained as ΔGestimate° = ΔE + pΔV– TΔSestimate°. The volume change (ΔV) is assumed to originate purely from changes in the number of gas phase molecules (Δngas) and is calculated by the ideal gas law (pΔV= ΔngaskBT).
Table 1. Energies (ΔE) and Estimated Free Energies (ΔGestimate°) for Reactions 5–10
  ΔE ΔGestimate°
40LiI(l) + O2(g) → 2LiIO(LiI) + 38LiI(l) –1.6 eV  
40LiI(l) + 3/2O2(g) → LiIO3(LiI) + 39LiI(l) –3.0 eV  
40LiI(l) + 2O2(g) → LiIO4(LiI) + 39LiI(l) –4.7 eV –2.5 eVa
40LiI(l) + O2(g) → Li2O2(LiI) + I2(g) + 38LiI(l) –0.8 eV  
40LiI(l) + O2(g) → 2Li2O(LiI) + 2I2(g) + 36LiI(l) –1.3 eV –1.1 eV
40LiI(l) + 1/2O2(g) + H2O(g) → 2LiOH(LiI) + I2(g) + 38LiI(l) –2.4 eV –1.6 eV
aEntropy contribution for LiIO4 formation is based on entropy data for LiCl(l), O2(g), and LiClO4(l), since data for LiIO4(l) are not available.
The negative reaction energies and Gibbs free energies indicate that several reactions are possible and that there will be a competition between formations of the different products. The abundance of the species in catalysis is controlled by the reaction kinetics. Unfortunately, the reaction kinetics is not easily obtained, but it is possible to calculate the equilibrium composition of the system. In equilibrium the distribution of the products will depend on the initial amount of reactants (LiI, O2(g) and H2O(g)) and the ΔGestimate° of the reactions. For illustration, we consider a system with a significant excess of LiI (40 mol), limited initial O2(g) (0 to 3 mol) and either initial H2O(g) (6 mol) (Figure 5(a)) or no initial H2O(g) (Figure 5(b)). In addition, only reactions eq 7, 9, and 10 are included. These are the reactions where ΔGestimate° values are available, but also the reactions that appear to be most favorable based on the reaction energies. The total pressure is kept constant at 0.1 MPa, and the activity coefficients used in the equilibrium conditions are approximated by 1. We thereby assume ideal mixing of the different ionic species, i.e., internal energy changes are concentration-independent and entropy of mixing depends only on the individual molar fractions. This is seldom true for ionic mixtures (30) and therefore the equilibrium compositions obtained in these calculations are qualitative. The equilibrium product and reactant distribution is plotted in Figure 5. The first observation is that O2 is completely consumed at all considered amounts of initial O2. This is also the case in the experiments (oxygen conversion is 100%). When water is available, LiOH and I2(g) are the only products formed (Figure 5(a)). Only when gas phase water is absent are Li2O and a minor amount of LiIO4 formed (Figure 5(b)).

Only the reactions of eq 7, 9, and 10 are included. The total pressure is kept constant at standard pressure (0.1 MPa), and the activity coefficients used in the equilibrium equations are approximated by 1.
6 Conclusions
In this study, we have considered the solvation of O2, H2O, and I2 in molten LiI. Solvation of O2 is associated with an internal energy cost and the degree of molecular solvation is therefore expected to be limited. Solvation of H2O and I2 is thermodynamically favorable. In the molten LiI solvent, H2O coordinates to a Li+ ion, while I2 combines with two I– ions to form I42–.
We further considered reactions between O2, H2O, and LiI to form the following oxygen-containing species: LiIO, LiIO3, LiIO4, Li2O2, Li2O, and LiOH, where formation of Li2O2, Li2O, and LiOH is accompanied by formation of I2. It was found that all these reactions are downhill in energy, so reaction kinetics will determine the abundance of the different species.
Unfortunately, the reaction kinetics is not easily accessible. Instead, we evaluated which species will be present if the system is allowed to reach equilibrium. This might not be the case for the actual catalytic system. In the presence of gas phase water, I2(g) and OH– are the only species formed. In the absence of water, I2(g) and O2– will be formed together with a minority of IO4–. It is therefore most likely that the ODH activity of molten LiI is due to the formation of solvated and gaseous I2.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Side view of the pure LiI(l) film at the end of the 14 ps MD simulation. (b) Number density of Li and I atoms in the film as a function of height in the computational cell. The vertical dashed line marks the experimental number density for Li and I in molten LiI at 800 K. (17) (c) Radial pair-distribution functions gLi–I(r), gLi–Li(r), and gI–I(r). The function gA–B(r) is defined such that pA–B dr = 4π r2gA–B(r) ρB dr, where pA–B(r) dr is the probability of finding an atom B at a distance between r and r + dr from A and ρB is the number density of atom B calculated by estimating the volume of the film to be 12.6 × 12.6 × 25 Å3.

Figure 2. (a) Mean solvation energies as a function of elapsed time (t–t0) for H2O, I2, and O2 solvated in LiI and compared to the molecules in the gas phase and pure LiI(l) (0 eV). Final atomic configuration in the MD sampling for (b) solvated H2O, (c) solvated I2 (exist as an I42– species) and (d) solvated O2. Li atoms closer than 2.5 Å from the solvated species have increased radii.

Figure 4. (a) Mean reaction energies as a function of elapsed time (t–t0) for the formation of O22– + I2(g) (eq 8), 2O2– + 2I2(g) (eq 9) and 2OH– + I2(g) (eq 10). The internal energy of pure LiI(l) is included as it is used as a reference (0 eV). Final configuration in the MD sampling for (b) the O22– ion, (c) the two O2– ions, and (d) the two OH– ions. Li atoms closer than 2.5 Å from the product ions have increased radii.

Figure 5. Equilibrium distribution of chemical species. (a) Initial composition of 40 mol LiI, 0 to 3 mol O2(g) and 6 mol H2O(g). (b) Initial composition of 40 mol LiI and 0 to 3 mol O2(g) (no H2O). Only the reactions of eq 7, 9, and 10 are included. The total pressure is kept constant at standard pressure (0.1 MPa), and the activity coefficients used in the equilibrium equations are approximated by 1.
