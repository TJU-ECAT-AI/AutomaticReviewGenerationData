The document describes various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions for each method involve different halogen concentrations and reaction temperatures tailored to the specific halogen used. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its ability to form stable alkyl halides upon reaction with halogens. This stability allows for selective dehydrogenation under controlled conditions. The effectiveness of these methods is influenced by factors such as the halogen type, concentration, and reaction temperature, which are optimized to achieve the desired product distribution while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

文档描述了用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括使用卤素的脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。每种方法的反应条件涉及针对所使用的特定卤素进行调整的不同卤素浓度和反应温度。丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应活性有很大不同，因为其能够形成稳定的烷基卤化物，从而在控制条件下实现选择性脱氢。这些方法的有效性受卤素类型、浓度和反应温度等因素的影响，这些因素被优化以实现所需的产物分布，同时最小化不必要的副反应。
