This study investigated the effect of oxychlorination treatment on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Oxychlorination was found to improve the recovery of catalytic activity by providing optimal conditions for redispersing Pt particles, which were affected by factors such as oxygen, chloride, temperature, and reaction time. The best results were achieved with an HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. The study utilized various analytical techniques including CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM to characterize the catalysts before and after treatment.
