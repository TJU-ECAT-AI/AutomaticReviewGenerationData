[1] "Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/ oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction."
[2] "It was reported that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst."
[3] "It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst."

This study focuses on the effect of oxychlorination treatment on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The authors observed that the catalytic activity was not fully recovered after the standard coke burning followed by hydrogen reduction process due to unsatisfying recovery of Pt sintering. They introduced oxychlorination treatment between coke burning and hydrogen reduction to improve the redispersion of Pt particles, aiming to restore the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The optimal HCl concentration for oxychlorination was found to be 5000 ppm, which resulted in the best recovery of catalytic activity.

本研究主要关注氧氯化处理对丙烷脱氢催化剂再生的影响。作者发现，在标准焦炭燃烧和氢还原过程之后，催化剂活性未能完全恢复，原因是铂颗粒的聚集无法有效解决。为了改善铂颗粒的再分散并恢复催化剂的活性和选择性，他们在焦炭燃烧和氢还原之间引入了氧氯化处理。研究结果显示，当使用5000 ppm的盐酸浓度进行氧氯化处理时，催化剂活性恢复效果最佳。
