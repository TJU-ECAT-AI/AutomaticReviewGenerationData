1. The propane dehydrogenation reaction converts propane (C3H8) into propene (C3H6) along with hydrogen (H2), releasing 129 kJ/mol of heat at standard temperature and pressure.

2. Controlling the oxygen content and heater programs can minimize the exothermic temperature during the coke removal process in the regeneration of catalysts.

3. During the regeneration of catalysts, the metal crystallites might inevitably sinter, resulting in a decrease in their diameter. This can lead to a reduction in activity.

4. The propylene selectivity is calculated based on the moles of propene (C3H6) produced compared to the total moles of products (methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4), and propene (C3H6)) that come out of the reactor. 

5. The propane conversion percentage is determined by the ratio of propane (C3H8) consumed to the total moles of propane (C3H8) coming out of the reactor.

6. The propylene yield percentage is calculated by dividing the propylene yield by the propane conversion and then multiplying by 100.

1. 烯丙烷（C3H8）在标准温度和压力下转化为丙烯（C3H6）和氢气（H2），释放出129 kJ/mol的热量。

2. 通过控制氧气含量和加热程序，可以最小化焦炭去除过程中的放热温度。

3. 在催化剂再生过程中，金属晶粒可能会不可避免地发生聚集，导致其直径变大，从而降低活性。

4. 丙烯选择性是基于从反应器中流出的产品（甲烷（CH4）、乙烷（C2H6）、乙烯（C2H4）和丙烯（C3H6））中丙烯（C3H6）的摩尔数与总摩尔数的比例计算得出的。

5. 烯烃转化百分比是根据流出反应器的烯烃（C3H8）消耗量与总烯烃（C3H8）摩尔数的比例确定的。

6. 丙烯产率百分比是通过将丙烯产量除以烯烃转化率，然后乘以100来计算得出的。
