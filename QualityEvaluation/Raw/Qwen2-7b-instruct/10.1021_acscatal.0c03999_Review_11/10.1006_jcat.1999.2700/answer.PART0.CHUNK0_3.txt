[1] "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."
[2] "In the absence of TCM, CO2 was the principal product from the oxidation of propane and the selectivity to this oxide remained relatively unchanged with increases in the partial pressure of O2, while the conversion of propane, as expected, increased."
[3] "On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."
[4] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."
[5] "The results of the experiments performed with neither O2 nor TCM present suggest that lattice oxygen does not participate directly in the oxidation process."
[6] "Other differences between the present and earlier systems are evident. After either partial oxidation or oxidative coupling of methane in the presence of TCM on a wide variety of catalysts, almost inevitably XRD showed that a chlorinated analog of the catalyst had been produced in the bulk structure, in contrast to the present results under which such species were not formed."
[7] "The ability of some of the lanthanides to assume a valency of 4, in addition to their group valency of 3, is well known, particularly for cerium, which has a higher proclivity for the latter oxidation state than any of the remaining lanthanides."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involve the use of halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

1. **Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation**: This method involves the use of halogen gases or compounds to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from propane molecules. The presence of halogens enhances the reactivity of propane, leading to the formation of propene.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH)**: In this process, propane is oxidized in the presence of a suitable catalyst, typically a metal oxide, under controlled conditions. The key difference here is that the catalyst facilitates the oxidation without necessarily requiring a halogen. For instance, cerium oxide (CeO2) was used in the study, and the addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) enhanced the conversion of propane to propene.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This method combines the use of oxygen and halogen compounds to selectively dehydrogenate propane. The oxygen provides the oxidizing environment, while the halogen helps in the dehydrogenation process. This approach is similar to oxidative dehydrogenation but specifically highlights the role of oxygen-halogen interactions.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods involve using molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. The high ionic conductivity and specific properties of these salts facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions, often under high temperatures and pressures.

The reaction conditions vary depending on the method. For halogen-assisted dehydrogenation, halogen gases or compounds are introduced to the system, often at specific partial pressures. In oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalyst and the presence of oxygen are crucial, typically under atmospheric pressure and high temperatures. Oxyhalogenation requires a balance of oxygen, halogen, and propane, possibly under inert conditions to prevent unwanted reactions. Molten metal halide salt approaches necessitate a specific temperature range, often above the melting point of the salt, and a controlled atmosphere to prevent decomposition.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to several factors. Firstly, propane has a larger molecular size and stronger C-H bonds compared to methane, which makes it more reactive under certain conditions. Secondly, the presence of multiple carbon-carbon bonds in propane allows for more complex reaction pathways compared to ethane, which has only single bonds. Additionally, the introduction of halogen compounds or the use of specific catalysts in the methods described can significantly enhance the reactivity of propane, leading to selective dehydrogenation to propene rather than the formation of other products.

In summary, the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involve distinct reaction conditions tailored to the specific requirements of each technique. These methods differ in their catalysts, reagents, and environmental conditions, reflecting the unique reactivity profiles of propane relative to other alkanes. The enhanced reactivity of propane in these processes is attributed to factors such as molecular size, bond strength, and the influence of catalysts and reagents.

描述并比较使用卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯的各种方法，包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃显著不同。

使用的各种方法包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：这种方法涉及使用卤素气体或化合物来选择性地从丙烷分子中去除氢原子。卤素的存在增强了丙烷的反应性，导致丙烯的形成。

2. **氧化脱氢（ODH）**：在这个过程中，在适当的催化剂存在下，丙烷被氧化。关键的不同之处在于催化剂促进了氧化，而无需必需的卤素。例如，使用铈氧化物（CeO2），添加四氯化碳（TCM）可以增强丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法结合使用氧气和卤素化合物来选择性地脱氢丙烷。氧气提供氧化环境，卤素有助于脱氢过程。这种方法类似于氧化脱氢，但特别强调氧气-卤素相互作用的作用。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法涉及使用含有金属卤化物的熔融盐作为反应介质。这些盐的高离子导电性和特定性质使脱氢反应得以进行，通常在高温和高压下进行。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同。对于卤素辅助脱氢，通常需要特定的卤素气体或化合物的压力。在氧化脱氢中，催化剂和氧气的存在至关重要，通常在大气压和高温下进行。氧卤化需要平衡氧气、卤素和丙烷，可能在惰性条件下进行以防止不必要的反应。熔融金属卤化盐方法需要特定的温度范围，通常高于盐的熔点，并且需要控制气氛以防止分解。

丙烷在这些过程中相对于甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性的差异主要归因于几个因素。首先，丙烷的分子尺寸更大，C-H键强度更强，这使得它在某些条件下更具有反应性。其次，丙烷中含有多个碳-碳双键，使其反应路径比乙烷（只有单键）更为复杂。此外，描述的方法中引入的卤素化合物或特定催化剂可以显著增强丙烷的反应性，导致选择性脱氢为丙烯，而不是形成其他产物。

简而言之，使用卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯涉及根据每种技术的具体要求定制的不同反应条件。这些方法在催化剂、试剂和环境条件上有所不同，反映了丙烷相对于其他烷烃的独特反应性特征。这些过程的增强反应性归因于分子大小、键强度以及催化剂和试剂的影响等因素。
