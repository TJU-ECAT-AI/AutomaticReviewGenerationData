[1] "The introduction of small partial pressures of TCM increases the conversion of propane with selectivities to propene up to 80%."
[2] "Except under special circumstances no evidence of chlorinated species from TCM is found in the bulk structure while the surface region is shown to contain chlorine, although its form is not known."
[3] "The enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene is shown to be dependent upon the presence of chlorine, in whatever form, in the surface region of the catalyst."
[4] "While the values of Cl/Ce of one or less than one can be rationalized on the basis of the partial formation of the oxychloride the stoichiometric equivalent may not, of course, be gener- ated."

1. Tetrachloromethane (TCM) is used as a gas-phase additive in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide. Its introduction enhances the conversion of propane to propene, achieving selectivities up to 80%. Chlorine is detected on the catalyst's surface, although its specific form is unknown. The presence of chlorine, in any form, on the catalyst surface is crucial for the conversion and selectivity improvement. However, the stoichiometric equivalent of CeOCl might not be fully formed.

1. 四氯甲烷（TCM）被用作气相添加剂，在铈氧化物上进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。其引入可以提高丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率，达到80%的选择性。表面检测到氯，但其具体形式未知。表面存在的氯，无论何种形式，对于转化和选择性的提升至关重要。然而，铈氧化氯的定比等效体可能并未完全形成。
