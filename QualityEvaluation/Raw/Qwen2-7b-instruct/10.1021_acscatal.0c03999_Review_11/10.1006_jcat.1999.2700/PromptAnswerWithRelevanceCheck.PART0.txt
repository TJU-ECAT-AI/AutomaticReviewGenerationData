[1] "Relatively little work has been reported in which rare earth oxides are employed as catalysts in this reaction (5, 6) in spite of evidence of their activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane (7–10) and ethane (11, 12)."
[2] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."
[3] "With the exception of cerium oxide, no increase of conversions is observed and only carbon oxides are produced."
[4] "In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2 substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the feedstream."
[5] "Other differences between the present and earlier systems are evident. After either partial oxidation or oxidative coupling of methane in the presence of TCM on a wide variety of catalysts, almost inevitably XRD showed that a chlorinated analog of the catalyst had been produced in the bulk structure, in contrast to the present results under which such species were not formed (23)."
[6] "While care must be taken in comparing selectivities at different conversions it is clear that both the conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity to C3H6 are increased on introduction of TCM."
[7] "The results of the experiments performed with neither O2 nor TCM present suggest that lattice oxygen does not participate directly in the oxidation process."
[8] "However, on introduction of TCM, propane was converted to the expected products with a relatively high selectivity to propene."
[9] "The ability of some of the lanthanides to assume a valency of 4, in addition to their group valency of 3, is well known, particularly for cerium, which has a higher proclivity for the latter oxidation state than any of the remaining lanthanides."
[10] "It is probable that both the aforementioned mechanisms are operative during the ODH process with propane. This would provide explanations for most of the observations from the present work, particularly those related to the apparent irregularity of chlorine concentrations in the surface region which may result from the presence of both oxidation states of cerium in the surface."

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of halogenated compounds to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen to convert propane into propene. Oxyhalogenation combines oxygen and halogen to assist in the dehydrogenation process. Molten metal halide salts are another approach, often used in industrial settings due to their high reactivity and efficiency. The reaction conditions vary widely across these methods, depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific halogen used.

2. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane because it is more susceptible to dehydrogenation reactions when exposed to certain conditions and catalysts. For instance, methane and ethane typically require more severe conditions or specialized catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation effectively, while propane shows enhanced reactivity under milder conditions, especially in the presence of cerium oxide as a catalyst and tetrachloromethane as an additive.

3. In dehydrogenation with halogens, propane reacts with halogenated compounds to produce propene. In oxidative dehydrogenation, oxygen plays a key role in facilitating the conversion of propane into propene. Oxyhalogenation combines the effects of oxygen and halogen to enhance the dehydrogenation process. Molten metal halide salts offer an alternative method, where the molten salts act as a medium for the reaction to occur, often at high temperatures, to drive the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently.

4. The difference in reactivity between propane, methane, and ethane in these processes can be attributed to their molecular structures and electronic properties. Propane's larger size and more stable carbon-hydrogen bonds make it more reactive under certain conditions compared to smaller alkanes like methane and ethane. Additionally, the presence of certain catalysts, like cerium oxide, can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of propane in dehydrogenation reactions, leading to enhanced conversion and selectivity to propene.

1. 卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。卤素脱氢利用卤素化合物促进脱氢反应。氧化脱氢通过氧气将丙烷转化为丙烯。氧卤化结合了氧气和卤素，协助脱氢过程。熔融金属卤化盐是另一种方法，通常在工业中使用，由于其高反应性和效率而受到青睐。这些方法的反应条件差异很大，取决于温度、压力以及所使用的特定卤素等因素。

2. 丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷相比显示出显著不同的反应性，因为当在特定条件下使用特定催化剂时，它更容易进行脱氢反应。例如，甲烷和乙烷通常需要更剧烈的条件或专门的催化剂才能有效进行脱氢，而丙烷在较温和的条件下显示出增强的反应性，尤其是在铈氧化物作为催化剂和四氯化碳作为添加剂的情况下。

3. 在卤素脱氢中，丙烷与卤素化合物反应生成丙烯。在氧化脱氢中，氧气在促进丙烷转化为丙烯方面起着关键作用。氧卤化结合氧气和卤素的作用，增强了脱氢过程。熔融金属卤化盐提供了一种替代方法，在这种情况下，熔融盐作为反应发生的介质，通常在高温下进行，以高效地驱动脱氢反应。

4. 丙烷、甲烷和乙烷在这类过程中反应性的差异可以归因于它们的分子结构和电子性质。丙烷较大的尺寸及其更稳定的碳-氢键使其在某些条件下比较小的烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）更具反应性。此外，某些催化剂，如铈氧化物的存在，可以显著影响丙烷在脱氢反应中的反应性和选择性，导致丙烯转化率和选择性显著提高。

The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of a halogen, such as tetrachloromethane (TCM), to increase the conversion of propane to propene. The introduction of TCM enhances the conversion of propane with a high selectivity to propene, reaching up to 80%. This process is distinct because it requires a halogen additive to achieve the desired conversion and selectivity. 

Oxyhalogenation refers to reactions where a halogen is involved in the oxidation of hydrocarbons, typically resulting in the formation of hydrocarbons with an additional oxygen atom compared to the starting material. In contrast to the other methods, oxyhalogenation often leads to the formation of chlorinated analogues of the catalyst in the bulk structure, whereas in the case of propane dehydrogenation over cerium oxide, no such chlorinated species were found in the bulk structure. Instead, chlorine was detected on the surface of the catalyst.

Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing metal halides as catalysts. These methods are not specifically mentioned in the provided text, but they are known to facilitate selective dehydrogenation reactions by providing an active surface for the reaction to occur.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger size and the presence of a tertiary carbon center. The tertiary carbon allows for more complex interactions with the catalyst, leading to a higher conversion rate and selectivity to propene in the presence of halogen additives. Methane and ethane, being primary and secondary carbon compounds, respectively, do not exhibit the same level of reactivity or selectivity towards propene when undergoing dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of halogen additives.

这些卤素辅助方法包括氧化脱氢化、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐途径。氧化脱氢化利用卤素，如四氯甲烷（TCM），增加丙烷到丙烯的转化率。引入TCM可以显著提高丙烷的转化率，并以高达80%的高选择性转化为丙烯。与其它方法不同的是，它需要卤素添加剂才能实现所需的转化率和选择性。

氧卤化是指在卤素参与下对烃类的氧化反应，通常会导致产物中比原始物质多一个氧原子。与其它方法相比，氧卤化往往导致催化剂在基体结构中形成氯化衍生物，而在此类丙烷脱氢化过程中，没有在基体结构中发现这样的氯化物种。相反，在催化剂表面发现了氯元素。

熔融金属卤化盐途径涉及使用含金属卤化物的熔盐浴作为催化剂。这些方法通过提供一个反应发生的活性表面，从而促进选择性脱氢反应。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其同类烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）大不相同，主要是由于其较大的分子大小以及三元碳中心的存在。三元碳允许与催化剂发生更复杂的相互作用，导致在卤素添加剂存在下丙烷具有更高的转化率和丙烯选择性。而甲烷和乙烷作为一元和二元碳化合物，它们在使用卤素添加剂进行脱氢反应时，不会表现出相同的反应性和选择性向丙烯。

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide, the introduction of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane (TCM) enhances both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene up to 80%. Except under special circumstances, no evidence of chlorinated species from TCM is found in the bulk structure of the catalyst, while the surface region contains chlorine. The presence of chlorine, in any form, is crucial for the enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene. 

2. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the specific interaction between propane and cerium oxide catalyst in the presence of TCM. In contrast to methane and ethane oxidation, where the introduction of a halomethane improves the selectivity to certain products, propane's oxidative dehydrogenation over cerium oxide is notably enhanced by TCM. This suggests that the reactivity is influenced by the unique properties of cerium oxide and the role of TCM in modifying the surface of the catalyst.

3. The dehydrogenation with halogens involves adding halogen compounds to the reaction mixture, which can enhance the conversion and selectivity of the desired product. In the case of propane, the use of cerium oxide as a catalyst in conjunction with TCM provides a selective pathway to produce propene.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation is a process that involves the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins through oxidation. In the context of propane, the introduction of TCM to the cerium oxide catalyst system enables a higher conversion of propane and a higher selectivity towards propene compared to other alkanes.

5. Oxyhalogenation refers to the addition of halogen-containing compounds to a reaction system, which can facilitate the oxidation of hydrocarbons. In the study, the addition of TCM to the cerium oxide catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation demonstrates a selective pathway that differs from the typical oxyhalogenation processes.

6. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The study on propane oxidative dehydrogenation over cerium oxide highlights a distinct mechanism that utilizes TCM as a gas-phase additive, leading to enhanced conversion and selectivity towards propene, unlike the traditional molten metal halide salt approaches.

The key differences in reactivity between propane and other alkanes stem from the unique catalytic properties of cerium oxide and the role of TCM as a gas-phase additive, which modifies the surface of the catalyst, leading to improved conversion and selectivity towards propene.

1. 氟辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯包括卤化物脱氢，氧化脱氢，氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。在铈氧化物上进行的丙烷氧化脱氢中，引入小部分压力的四氯化碳（TCC）可以提高丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性至80%。除了特殊情况外，在催化剂的主体结构中未发现来自TCC的氯化物种的证据，而在表面区域发现了氯，但其形式未知。氯的存在，无论以何种形式，对于表面区域的催化剂，增强丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性至关重要。

2. 丙烷与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应活性存在显著差异，因为它们与铈氧化物催化剂的特殊相互作用。相比之下，在铈氧化物上的甲烷和乙烷氧化过程中，引入卤代甲烷可改善某些产品的选择性，而丙烷的氧化脱氢过程则明显得益于TCC的引入。这表明反应活性受到铈氧化物的独特性质以及TCC在修改催化剂表面中的作用的影响。

3. 通过卤化物添加到反应混合物中的脱氢涉及增加卤化物化合物，这可以增强所需产物的转化和选择性。在研究中，铈氧化物作为催化剂与TCC结合使用时，提供了一条选择性路径来生产丙烯，与其它烷烃不同。

4. 氧化脱氢是一个将碳氢化合物转化为烯烃通过氧化的过程。在丙烷的情况下，向铈氧化物催化剂系统中加入TCC可以提高丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性，这与甲烷和乙烷的典型氧化脱氢过程有所不同。

5. 氧卤化物是指向反应系统添加含卤化物的化合物，以促进碳氢化合物的氧化。研究中，铈氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢的添加TCC显示了一种选择性途径，与传统的氧卤化物过程不同。

6. 熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含金属卤化物的熔融盐作为催化剂，用于脱氢碳氢化合物。研究中对铈氧化物的丙烷氧化脱氢突出了一个独特的机制，利用TCC作为气体相添加剂，导致更高的转化率和更高的丙烯选择性，不同于传统的熔融金属卤化盐方法。

丙烷与其他烷烃反应活性的不同主要源于铈氧化物的独特催化特性以及TCC作为气体相添加剂在修改催化剂表面中所起的作用，从而提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involve the use of halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

1. **Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation**: This method involves the use of halogen gases or compounds to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from propane molecules. The presence of halogens enhances the reactivity of propane, leading to the formation of propene.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH)**: In this process, propane is oxidized in the presence of a suitable catalyst, typically a metal oxide, under controlled conditions. The key difference here is that the catalyst facilitates the oxidation without necessarily requiring a halogen. For instance, cerium oxide (CeO2) was used in the study, and the addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) enhanced the conversion of propane to propene.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This method combines the use of oxygen and halogen compounds to selectively dehydrogenate propane. The oxygen provides the oxidizing environment, while the halogen helps in the dehydrogenation process. This approach is similar to oxidative dehydrogenation but specifically highlights the role of oxygen-halogen interactions.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods involve using molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. The high ionic conductivity and specific properties of these salts facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions, often under high temperatures and pressures.

The reaction conditions vary depending on the method. For halogen-assisted dehydrogenation, halogen gases or compounds are introduced to the system, often at specific partial pressures. In oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalyst and the presence of oxygen are crucial, typically under atmospheric pressure and high temperatures. Oxyhalogenation requires a balance of oxygen, halogen, and propane, possibly under inert conditions to prevent unwanted reactions. Molten metal halide salt approaches necessitate a specific temperature range, often above the melting point of the salt, and a controlled atmosphere to prevent decomposition.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to several factors. Firstly, propane has a larger molecular size and stronger C-H bonds compared to methane, which makes it more reactive under certain conditions. Secondly, the presence of multiple carbon-carbon bonds in propane allows for more complex reaction pathways compared to ethane, which has only single bonds. Additionally, the introduction of halogen compounds or the use of specific catalysts in the methods described can significantly enhance the reactivity of propane, leading to selective dehydrogenation to propene rather than the formation of other products.

In summary, the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involve distinct reaction conditions tailored to the specific requirements of each technique. These methods differ in their catalysts, reagents, and environmental conditions, reflecting the unique reactivity profiles of propane relative to other alkanes. The enhanced reactivity of propane in these processes is attributed to factors such as molecular size, bond strength, and the influence of catalysts and reagents.

描述并比较使用卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯的各种方法，包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃显著不同。

使用的各种方法包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：这种方法涉及使用卤素气体或化合物来选择性地从丙烷分子中去除氢原子。卤素的存在增强了丙烷的反应性，导致丙烯的形成。

2. **氧化脱氢（ODH）**：在这个过程中，在适当的催化剂存在下，丙烷被氧化。关键的不同之处在于催化剂促进了氧化，而无需必需的卤素。例如，使用铈氧化物（CeO2），添加四氯化碳（TCM）可以增强丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法结合使用氧气和卤素化合物来选择性地脱氢丙烷。氧气提供氧化环境，卤素有助于脱氢过程。这种方法类似于氧化脱氢，但特别强调氧气-卤素相互作用的作用。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法涉及使用含有金属卤化物的熔融盐作为反应介质。这些盐的高离子导电性和特定性质使脱氢反应得以进行，通常在高温和高压下进行。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同。对于卤素辅助脱氢，通常需要特定的卤素气体或化合物的压力。在氧化脱氢中，催化剂和氧气的存在至关重要，通常在大气压和高温下进行。氧卤化需要平衡氧气、卤素和丙烷，可能在惰性条件下进行以防止不必要的反应。熔融金属卤化盐方法需要特定的温度范围，通常高于盐的熔点，并且需要控制气氛以防止分解。

丙烷在这些过程中相对于甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性的差异主要归因于几个因素。首先，丙烷的分子尺寸更大，C-H键强度更强，这使得它在某些条件下更具有反应性。其次，丙烷中含有多个碳-碳双键，使其反应路径比乙烷（只有单键）更为复杂。此外，描述的方法中引入的卤素化合物或特定催化剂可以显著增强丙烷的反应性，导致选择性脱氢为丙烯，而不是形成其他产物。

简而言之，使用卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯涉及根据每种技术的具体要求定制的不同反应条件。这些方法在催化剂、试剂和环境条件上有所不同，反映了丙烷相对于其他烷烃的独特反应性特征。这些过程的增强反应性归因于分子大小、键强度以及催化剂和试剂的影响等因素。
