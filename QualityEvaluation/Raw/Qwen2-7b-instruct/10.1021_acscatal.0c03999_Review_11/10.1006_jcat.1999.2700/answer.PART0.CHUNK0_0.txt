[1] "Relatively little work has been reported in which rare earth oxides are employed as catalysts in this reaction (5, 6) in spite of evidence of their activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane (7–10) and ethane (11, 12)."
[2] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."
[3] "With the exception of cerium oxide, no increase of conversions is observed and only carbon oxides are produced."
[4] "In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2 substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the feedstream."
[5] "Other differences between the present and earlier systems are evident. After either partial oxidation or oxidative coupling of methane in the presence of TCM on a wide variety of catalysts, almost inevitably XRD showed that a chlorinated analog of the catalyst had been produced in the bulk structure, in contrast to the present results under which such species were not formed (23)."
[6] "While care must be taken in comparing selectivities at different conversions it is clear that both the conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity to C3H6 are increased on introduction of TCM."
[7] "The results of the experiments performed with neither O2 nor TCM present suggest that lattice oxygen does not participate directly in the oxidation process."
[8] "However, on introduction of TCM, propane was converted to the expected products with a relatively high selectivity to propene."
[9] "The ability of some of the lanthanides to assume a valency of 4, in addition to their group valency of 3, is well known, particularly for cerium, which has a higher proclivity for the latter oxidation state than any of the remaining lanthanides."
[10] "It is probable that both the aforementioned mechanisms are operative during the ODH process with propane. This would provide explanations for most of the observations from the present work, particularly those related to the apparent irregularity of chlorine concentrations in the surface region which may result from the presence of both oxidation states of cerium in the surface."

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of halogenated compounds to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen to convert propane into propene. Oxyhalogenation combines oxygen and halogen to assist in the dehydrogenation process. Molten metal halide salts are another approach, often used in industrial settings due to their high reactivity and efficiency. The reaction conditions vary widely across these methods, depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific halogen used.

2. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane because it is more susceptible to dehydrogenation reactions when exposed to certain conditions and catalysts. For instance, methane and ethane typically require more severe conditions or specialized catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation effectively, while propane shows enhanced reactivity under milder conditions, especially in the presence of cerium oxide as a catalyst and tetrachloromethane as an additive.

3. In dehydrogenation with halogens, propane reacts with halogenated compounds to produce propene. In oxidative dehydrogenation, oxygen plays a key role in facilitating the conversion of propane into propene. Oxyhalogenation combines the effects of oxygen and halogen to enhance the dehydrogenation process. Molten metal halide salts offer an alternative method, where the molten salts act as a medium for the reaction to occur, often at high temperatures, to drive the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently.

4. The difference in reactivity between propane, methane, and ethane in these processes can be attributed to their molecular structures and electronic properties. Propane's larger size and more stable carbon-hydrogen bonds make it more reactive under certain conditions compared to smaller alkanes like methane and ethane. Additionally, the presence of certain catalysts, like cerium oxide, can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of propane in dehydrogenation reactions, leading to enhanced conversion and selectivity to propene.

1. 卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。卤素脱氢利用卤素化合物促进脱氢反应。氧化脱氢通过氧气将丙烷转化为丙烯。氧卤化结合了氧气和卤素，协助脱氢过程。熔融金属卤化盐是另一种方法，通常在工业中使用，由于其高反应性和效率而受到青睐。这些方法的反应条件差异很大，取决于温度、压力以及所使用的特定卤素等因素。

2. 丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷相比显示出显著不同的反应性，因为当在特定条件下使用特定催化剂时，它更容易进行脱氢反应。例如，甲烷和乙烷通常需要更剧烈的条件或专门的催化剂才能有效进行脱氢，而丙烷在较温和的条件下显示出增强的反应性，尤其是在铈氧化物作为催化剂和四氯化碳作为添加剂的情况下。

3. 在卤素脱氢中，丙烷与卤素化合物反应生成丙烯。在氧化脱氢中，氧气在促进丙烷转化为丙烯方面起着关键作用。氧卤化结合氧气和卤素的作用，增强了脱氢过程。熔融金属卤化盐提供了一种替代方法，在这种情况下，熔融盐作为反应发生的介质，通常在高温下进行，以高效地驱动脱氢反应。

4. 丙烷、甲烷和乙烷在这类过程中反应性的差异可以归因于它们的分子结构和电子性质。丙烷较大的尺寸及其更稳定的碳-氢键使其在某些条件下比较小的烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）更具反应性。此外，某些催化剂，如铈氧化物的存在，可以显著影响丙烷在脱氢反应中的反应性和选择性，导致丙烯转化率和选择性显著提高。
