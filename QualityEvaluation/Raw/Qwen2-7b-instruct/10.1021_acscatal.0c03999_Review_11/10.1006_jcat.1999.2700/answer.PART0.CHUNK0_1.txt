[1] "In the absence of tetrachloromethane (TCM) carbon dioxide is the principal product formed in the oxidation of propane on ceria."
[2] "The introduction of small partial pressures of TCM increases the conversion of propane with selectivities to propene up to 80%."
[3] "Ex- cept under special circumstances no evidence of chlorinated species from TCM is found in the bulk structure while the surface region is shown to contain chlorine, although its form is not known."
[4] "The enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene is shown to be dependent upon the presence of chlorine, in whatever form, in the surface region of the catalyst."
[5] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed."
[6] "On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively,were measured."
[7] "After either partial oxidation or oxida- tive coupling of methane in the presence of TCM on a wide variety of catalysts, almost inevitably XRD showed that a chlorinated analog of the catalyst had been produced in the bulk structure, in contrast to the present results under which such species were not formed."

The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of a halogen, such as tetrachloromethane (TCM), to increase the conversion of propane to propene. The introduction of TCM enhances the conversion of propane with a high selectivity to propene, reaching up to 80%. This process is distinct because it requires a halogen additive to achieve the desired conversion and selectivity. 

Oxyhalogenation refers to reactions where a halogen is involved in the oxidation of hydrocarbons, typically resulting in the formation of hydrocarbons with an additional oxygen atom compared to the starting material. In contrast to the other methods, oxyhalogenation often leads to the formation of chlorinated analogues of the catalyst in the bulk structure, whereas in the case of propane dehydrogenation over cerium oxide, no such chlorinated species were found in the bulk structure. Instead, chlorine was detected on the surface of the catalyst.

Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing metal halides as catalysts. These methods are not specifically mentioned in the provided text, but they are known to facilitate selective dehydrogenation reactions by providing an active surface for the reaction to occur.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger size and the presence of a tertiary carbon center. The tertiary carbon allows for more complex interactions with the catalyst, leading to a higher conversion rate and selectivity to propene in the presence of halogen additives. Methane and ethane, being primary and secondary carbon compounds, respectively, do not exhibit the same level of reactivity or selectivity towards propene when undergoing dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of halogen additives.

这些卤素辅助方法包括氧化脱氢化、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐途径。氧化脱氢化利用卤素，如四氯甲烷（TCM），增加丙烷到丙烯的转化率。引入TCM可以显著提高丙烷的转化率，并以高达80%的高选择性转化为丙烯。与其它方法不同的是，它需要卤素添加剂才能实现所需的转化率和选择性。

氧卤化是指在卤素参与下对烃类的氧化反应，通常会导致产物中比原始物质多一个氧原子。与其它方法相比，氧卤化往往导致催化剂在基体结构中形成氯化衍生物，而在此类丙烷脱氢化过程中，没有在基体结构中发现这样的氯化物种。相反，在催化剂表面发现了氯元素。

熔融金属卤化盐途径涉及使用含金属卤化物的熔盐浴作为催化剂。这些方法通过提供一个反应发生的活性表面，从而促进选择性脱氢反应。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其同类烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）大不相同，主要是由于其较大的分子大小以及三元碳中心的存在。三元碳允许与催化剂发生更复杂的相互作用，导致在卤素添加剂存在下丙烷具有更高的转化率和丙烯选择性。而甲烷和乙烷作为一元和二元碳化合物，它们在使用卤素添加剂进行脱氢反应时，不会表现出相同的反应性和选择性向丙烯。
