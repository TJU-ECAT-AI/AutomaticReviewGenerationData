[1] "The introduction of small partial pressures of TCM increases the conversion of propane with selectivities to propene up to 80%."
[2] "Ex- cept under special circumstances no evidence of chlorinated species from TCM is found in the bulk structure while the surface region is shown to contain chlorine, although its form is not known."
[3] "The enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene is shown to be dependent upon the presence of chlorine, in whatever form, in the surface region of the catalyst."
[4] "In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2 substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the feedstream."
[5] "While care must be taken in comparing selec- tivities at different conversions it is clear that both the con- version of C3H8 and the selectivity to C3H6 are increased on introduction of TCM."
[6] "From the present results it is clear that the introduction of TCM into the feedstream is chlorinating the surface."

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide, the introduction of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane (TCM) enhances both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene up to 80%. Except under special circumstances, no evidence of chlorinated species from TCM is found in the bulk structure of the catalyst, while the surface region contains chlorine. The presence of chlorine, in any form, is crucial for the enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene. 

2. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the specific interaction between propane and cerium oxide catalyst in the presence of TCM. In contrast to methane and ethane oxidation, where the introduction of a halomethane improves the selectivity to certain products, propane's oxidative dehydrogenation over cerium oxide is notably enhanced by TCM. This suggests that the reactivity is influenced by the unique properties of cerium oxide and the role of TCM in modifying the surface of the catalyst.

3. The dehydrogenation with halogens involves adding halogen compounds to the reaction mixture, which can enhance the conversion and selectivity of the desired product. In the case of propane, the use of cerium oxide as a catalyst in conjunction with TCM provides a selective pathway to produce propene.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation is a process that involves the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins through oxidation. In the context of propane, the introduction of TCM to the cerium oxide catalyst system enables a higher conversion of propane and a higher selectivity towards propene compared to other alkanes.

5. Oxyhalogenation refers to the addition of halogen-containing compounds to a reaction system, which can facilitate the oxidation of hydrocarbons. In the study, the addition of TCM to the cerium oxide catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation demonstrates a selective pathway that differs from the typical oxyhalogenation processes.

6. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The study on propane oxidative dehydrogenation over cerium oxide highlights a distinct mechanism that utilizes TCM as a gas-phase additive, leading to enhanced conversion and selectivity towards propene, unlike the traditional molten metal halide salt approaches.

The key differences in reactivity between propane and other alkanes stem from the unique catalytic properties of cerium oxide and the role of TCM as a gas-phase additive, which modifies the surface of the catalyst, leading to improved conversion and selectivity towards propene.

1. 氟辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯包括卤化物脱氢，氧化脱氢，氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。在铈氧化物上进行的丙烷氧化脱氢中，引入小部分压力的四氯化碳（TCC）可以提高丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性至80%。除了特殊情况外，在催化剂的主体结构中未发现来自TCC的氯化物种的证据，而在表面区域发现了氯，但其形式未知。氯的存在，无论以何种形式，对于表面区域的催化剂，增强丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性至关重要。

2. 丙烷与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应活性存在显著差异，因为它们与铈氧化物催化剂的特殊相互作用。相比之下，在铈氧化物上的甲烷和乙烷氧化过程中，引入卤代甲烷可改善某些产品的选择性，而丙烷的氧化脱氢过程则明显得益于TCC的引入。这表明反应活性受到铈氧化物的独特性质以及TCC在修改催化剂表面中的作用的影响。

3. 通过卤化物添加到反应混合物中的脱氢涉及增加卤化物化合物，这可以增强所需产物的转化和选择性。在研究中，铈氧化物作为催化剂与TCC结合使用时，提供了一条选择性路径来生产丙烯，与其它烷烃不同。

4. 氧化脱氢是一个将碳氢化合物转化为烯烃通过氧化的过程。在丙烷的情况下，向铈氧化物催化剂系统中加入TCC可以提高丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性，这与甲烷和乙烷的典型氧化脱氢过程有所不同。

5. 氧卤化物是指向反应系统添加含卤化物的化合物，以促进碳氢化合物的氧化。研究中，铈氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢的添加TCC显示了一种选择性途径，与传统的氧卤化物过程不同。

6. 熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含金属卤化物的熔融盐作为催化剂，用于脱氢碳氢化合物。研究中对铈氧化物的丙烷氧化脱氢突出了一个独特的机制，利用TCC作为气体相添加剂，导致更高的转化率和更高的丙烯选择性，不同于传统的熔融金属卤化盐方法。

丙烷与其他烷烃反应活性的不同主要源于铈氧化物的独特催化特性以及TCC作为气体相添加剂在修改催化剂表面中所起的作用，从而提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。
