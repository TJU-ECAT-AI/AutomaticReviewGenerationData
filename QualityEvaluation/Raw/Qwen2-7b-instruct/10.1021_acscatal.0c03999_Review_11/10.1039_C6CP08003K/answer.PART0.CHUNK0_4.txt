It is estimated that approximately 200×10%& cubic meters of methane remain uncaptured in the earths crust1. If methane hydrates are included, the number could be as high as 15×10%( cubic meters1. Unfortunately, while abundant, methane is not an ideal source of chemical energy.

This finding is significant because both Au and Ag have the appropriate geometry to proceed through the surface-stabilized pathway, implying that the preference of these noble metals to proceed through a radical-like pathway must be due to their electronic structures.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This discovery is notable as both gold (Au) and silver (Ag) have the suitable geometry for the surface-stabilized pathway, suggesting that their preference for a radical-like pathway over the surface-stabilized one is primarily dictated by their electronic structures.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这一发现值得注意，因为金(Au)和银(Ag)都具备进行表面稳定化路径所需的几何结构，这意味着这两种贵重金属偏好自由基途径而非表面稳定化途径，主要是由它们的电子结构所决定的。

We have demonstrated the existence of a second universal TS scaling relationship for the surface-stabilized methane activation pathway. By combining this with the previously described universal radical TS scaling12, we formulated a simple model to predict which pathway will be preferred to activate methane on a given catalyst site, facilitating the subsequent use of the correct scaling relationship.
