The document discusses the activation of methane through two primary pathways: a radical pathway and a surface-stabilized pathway. The radical pathway involves the stabilization of the methyl group by the catalyst, while the surface-stabilized pathway forms a radical-like intermediate where the methyl group is stabilized by the OH bond. The TS energies for these pathways depend on different descriptors: the hydrogen abstraction energy for the radical pathway (EH) and the final state energy for the surface-stabilized pathway (EFS).

For catalysts with isolated active sites, such as zeolites, the radical pathway is favored due to the large distance between active sites. However, it was previously assumed that catalysts with a high density of active sites, such as metals, would activate methane via the surface-stabilized pathway. The document highlights that reactivity plays a crucial role in determining the pathway, with catalysts preferring the radical pathway if the methyl binding energy is sufficiently low. This means that both the reactivity and the structure of the catalyst influence the choice between the two pathways.

The document also presents a model to predict which pathway will be preferred based on the catalyst's electronic properties and geometry. This model uses two universal TS scaling relationships: one for the radical pathway (described by EH) and another for the surface-stabilized pathway (described by EFS). The intersection of these scaling lines determines the switch point where the catalyst prefers one pathway over the other. The document applies this model to various catalyst materials, including FCC (111) metals, noble metals, and oxides, demonstrating its utility in estimating methane activation barriers on a wide range of catalysts.

本文讨论了甲烷激活通过两种主要途径：自由基途径和表面稳定化途径。自由基途径涉及催化剂对甲基团的稳定，而表面稳定化途径形成一个类似于自由基的中间体，在此中间体中，甲基团由OH键而不是表面稳定。这些途径的TS能取决于不同的描述符：自由基途径的氢解离能（EH）和表面稳定化途径的最终状态能（EFS）。

对于具有孤立活性位点的催化剂，如沸石，由于活性位点之间的距离较大，自由基途径被优先选择。然而，过去曾假设具有高活性位点密度的催化剂，如金属，将通过表面稳定化途径激活甲烷。本文强调了反应性在确定路径选择中的关键作用，如果甲基结合能足够低，则催化剂更倾向于自由基途径。这意味着催化剂的反应性和结构都影响选择两种途径中的哪一条。

本文还提出了一种模型来预测哪种路径更受欢迎，基于催化剂的电子特性和几何形状。该模型使用了两种通用的TS尺度关系：一种用于自由基途径（由EH描述），另一种用于表面稳定化途径（由EFS描述）。这些尺度线的交点决定了催化剂偏爱的切换点，即从一种途径转向另一种途径。本文将此模型应用于各种催化剂材料，包括FCC（111）金属、贵金属和氧化物，证明了其在估计大量催化剂上的甲烷激活壁垒的实用性。
