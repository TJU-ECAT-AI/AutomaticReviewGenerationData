[1] "While natural gas is an abundant chemical fuel, its low volumetric energy density has prompted a search for catalysts able to transform methane into more useful chemicals."
[2] "It has been shown that methane can be activated via a radical or surface- stabilized pathway, both of which possess a unique TS scaling relationship."
[3] "Clearly, in catalysts with isolated active sites such as zeolites and other porous materials, the radical pathway will be favored due to the large distance between active sites."
[4] "Similarly, as a surface-stabilized pathway intuitively seems more energetically favorable than the formation of a methyl radical, it has previously been assumed that catalysts with a high density of active sites, such as metals, will activate methane via methyl-surface stabilization."
[5] "Herein, we demonstrate that reactivity must be considered in addition to catalyst structure to determine the lowest energy methane activation pathway."
[6] "By combining the universal scaling relationships for both radical and surface-stabilized methane activation pathways, we show that catalyst reactivity must be considered in addition to catalyst geometry to obtain an accurate estimation for the TS energy."
[7] "We show that catalysts that possess the appropriate geometry to activate methane via surface stabilization will prefer the radical pathway if the methyl binding energy is sufficiently low."
[8] "Therefore, it is important to understand which catalyst properties favor one pathway over the other so that the proper scaling relation may be used to estimate the TS energy."
[9] "On non-promoted (clean) metal surfaces, no saddle point was found between the initial state, CH4(g), and the radical final state, CH3(g)+H*."
[10] "Because a surface-stabilized TS could not be isolated for these materials, it can be assumed that their preferred TS is radical-like."
[11] "This finding is significant because both Au and Ag have the appropriate geometry to proceed through the surface-stabilized pathway, implying that the preference of these noble metals to proceed through a radical-like pathway must be due to their electronic structures."
[12] "This model can yield fast and accurate predictions of methane activation barriers on a wide range of catalysts, thus accelerating the discovery of more active catalysts for methane conversion."
