The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane by cobalt oxide nanoparticles was studied via temperature programmed reaction combined with in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates.
Both 6 and 12 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles were made through a surfactant-free preparation and dispersed on an Al2O3 surface formed by atomic layer deposition. Under reaction conditions the nanoparticles retained their oxidation state and did not sinter. They instead underwent an assembly/disassembly process and could reorganize within their assemblies.
The selectivity of the catalyst was found to be size- and temperature-dependent, with larger particles preferentially producing cyclohexene at lower temperatures and smaller particles predominantly resulting in benzene at higher temperatures.
The mechanistic features thought to control the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide were established by carrying out density functional theory calculations on the activation of propane, a surrogate model alkane, over model Co3O4 surfaces.
The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites. The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface. Hydroxyl recombination results in the formation of water which desorbs from the surface. Oxygen is necessary to regenerate the surface oxygen sites, catalyze CH activation steps, and minimize catalyst degradation.
The apparent activation energies toward cyclohexane and individual products are shown for the 6 and 12 nm particles in Table 4.
The reported activation energies for cyclohexane (105.8 and 53.9 kJ mol1) are in good agreement with those obtained with the unsupported catalyst powders in the quartz reactor (associated with the TORs reported above), 98.1 kJ mol1 and 61.0 kJ mol1 for the 6 and 12 nm size particles, respectively.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane was studied using cobalt oxide nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were made through a surfactant-free method and dispersed on an aluminum oxide surface. The nanoparticles retained their oxidation state during the reaction and underwent an assembly/disassembly process. The selectivity of the catalyst was size and temperature-dependent. Propane was used as a model alkane in density functional theory calculations to understand the activation process. The activation of the alkane proceeded via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites, followed by the activation of the alkoxide intermediate to form the alkene. Oxygen was necessary to regenerate the surface oxygen sites and minimize catalyst degradation. The activation energies for cyclohexane were in good agreement with those obtained using unsupported catalyst powders.

在钴氧化物纳米颗粒上研究了环己烷的氧化脱氢作用。纳米颗粒通过无表面活性剂的方法制备，并分散在氧化铝表面上。在反应过程中，纳米颗粒保持了其氧化状态，并经历了组装/解组装过程。催化剂的选择性与颗粒大小和温度有关。丙烷被用作模型烷烃，在密度泛函理论计算中作为活性氧表面位点的氢化作用的模型，以理解激活过程。烷烃的激活过程首先涉及表面氧位点的氢化作用，随后是烷氧基中间体的激活以形成烯烃。氧气对于再生表面氧位点并最小化催化剂降解至关重要。环己烷的活化能与其在石英反应器中获得的未支持催化剂粉末的一致性良好。
