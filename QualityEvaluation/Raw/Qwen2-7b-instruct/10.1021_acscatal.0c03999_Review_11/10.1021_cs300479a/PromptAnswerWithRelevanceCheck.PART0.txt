[1] "First principle density functional theoretical calculations with Hubbard U corrections were carried out on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over model Co3O4 surfaces to gain insights into the pathways and mechanisms that control the CH bond activation, water formation, and surface reoxidation steps in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Co3O4 particles."
[2] "The results show that CH activation preferentially proceeds via a homolytic mechanism where the most weakly held and most basic oxygen surface sites carry out hydrogen abstraction to form a propoxy intermediate that subsequently reacts to form propene."
[3] "The comparison of the lowest energy (111) and Type B (110) surfaces of Co3O4 which make up the terrace sites on cobalt oxide particles used in this work indicates that the Type B(110) surface is the most active and that the active sites are the weakly held O* that form in the presence of oxygen."
[4] "The presence of oxygen is critical as it replenishes the active surface O*-O* sites which carry out CH bond activation and the formation and removal of water."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Co3O4 surfaces was studied through first principle density functional theoretical calculations to understand the pathways and mechanisms controlling the activation of the CH bond, water formation, and surface reoxidation steps. 

2. The activation of the CH bond predominantly occurs via a homolytic process, where the most loosely held and most basic oxygen surface sites perform hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of a propoxy intermediate that then reacts to produce propene.

3. Comparing the lowest energy (111) and Type B (110) surfaces of Co3O4, the Type B (110) surface is found to be the most active, with the active sites being the weakly held oxygen atoms present in the presence of oxygen.

4. The presence of oxygen is essential as it replenishes the active surface oxygen-oxygen (O*-O*) sites, facilitating the activation of the CH bond and the formation/removal of water.

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane by cobalt oxide nanoparticles was studied via temperature programmed reaction combined with in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates."
[2] "Under reaction conditions the nanoparticles retained their oxidation state and did not sinter. They instead underwent an assembly/disassembly process and could reorganize within their assemblies."
[3] "The selectivity of the catalyst was found to be size- and temperature-dependent, with larger particles preferentially producing cyclohexene at lower temperatures and smaller particles predominantly resulting in benzene at higher temperatures."
[4] "The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites. The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface."
[5] "The product distribution of cyclohexane dehydrogenation over Co3O4 surfaces is rather diverse involving the formation of cyclohexene, benzene, water, oxygenated intermediates, and CO2."
[6] "The activation barriers for the homolytic abstraction of hydrogen at O*-O* site pairs (2958 kJ mol1) over both the (110) and (111) Co3O4 surfaces were calculated to be considerably lower than the heterolytic activation of the CH bond over the Co*-O* site pairs via σ-bond metathesis (6887 kJ mol1) over these same surfaces."
[7] "The comparison of the 3-fold O* sites (on the (111) and the type B (110) surfaces) and the 2-fold sites O2f on the type B (110) surface indicates that the 2-fold sites O2f are easier to remove as water as the abstracted hydrogen atoms bind rather strongly."
[8] "The higher reactivity of the larger Co3O4 clusters can also be the result of the smaller band gaps for the larger oxide clusters over the smaller oxide clusters."

1. The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane using cobalt oxide nanoparticles, incorporating temperature-programmed reactions and in situ grazing incidence X-ray techniques alongside theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates.
2. Under reaction conditions, the nanoparticles preserved their oxidation state without sintering, undergoing an assembly/disassembly process that allowed for reorganization.
3. The catalyst's selectivity was influenced by both particle size and temperature, with larger particles favoring cyclohexene production at lower temperatures and smaller particles producing benzene predominantly at higher temperatures.
4. The initial activation of the alkane involves hydrogen abstraction from surface oxygen sites, followed by the activation of the alkoxide intermediate at a second oxygen site, leading to alkene formation.
5. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane yields a variety of products, including cyclohexene, benzene, water, oxygenated intermediates, and CO2.
6. Homolytic hydrogen abstraction over O*-O* sites on Co3O4 surfaces is significantly less energetically demanding than heterolytic activation via σ-bond metathesis over Co*-O* sites.
7. The 2-fold O2f sites on the type B (110) surface are more easily removed as water compared to other sites due to the strong binding of the abstracted hydrogen atoms.
8. The enhanced reactivity of larger cobalt oxide clusters can be attributed to their smaller band gaps compared to smaller clusters.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane by cobalt oxide nanoparticles was studied via temperature programmed reaction combined with in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates.
Both 6 and 12 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles were made through a surfactant-free preparation and dispersed on an Al2O3 surface formed by atomic layer deposition. Under reaction conditions the nanoparticles retained their oxidation state and did not sinter. They instead underwent an assembly/disassembly process and could reorganize within their assemblies.
The selectivity of the catalyst was found to be size- and temperature-dependent, with larger particles preferentially producing cyclohexene at lower temperatures and smaller particles predominantly resulting in benzene at higher temperatures.
The mechanistic features thought to control the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide were established by carrying out density functional theory calculations on the activation of propane, a surrogate model alkane, over model Co3O4 surfaces.
The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites. The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface. Hydroxyl recombination results in the formation of water which desorbs from the surface. Oxygen is necessary to regenerate the surface oxygen sites, catalyze CH activation steps, and minimize catalyst degradation.
The apparent activation energies toward cyclohexane and individual products are shown for the 6 and 12 nm particles in Table 4.
The reported activation energies for cyclohexane (105.8 and 53.9 kJ mol1) are in good agreement with those obtained with the unsupported catalyst powders in the quartz reactor (associated with the TORs reported above), 98.1 kJ mol1 and 61.0 kJ mol1 for the 6 and 12 nm size particles, respectively.

This study examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on cobalt oxide nanoparticles of two sizes, 6 and 12 nm, deposited on an alumina support. The selectivity towards the conversion of cyclohexane to benzene is found to depend on both the size and temperature of the catalyst. At lower temperatures, the larger 12 nm particles produce cyclohexene preferentially, while the smaller 6 nm particles predominantly form benzene at higher temperatures. The mechanism controlling the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide is elucidated through density functional theory calculations on propane, a model alkane, over model Co3O4 surfaces. The calculations show that the activation of the alkane occurs via hydrogen abstraction at oxygen sites, followed by activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate at a second oxygen site to form the alkene, which then desorbs from the surface. Oxygen is essential for regenerating the active surface sites and minimizing catalyst degradation.
