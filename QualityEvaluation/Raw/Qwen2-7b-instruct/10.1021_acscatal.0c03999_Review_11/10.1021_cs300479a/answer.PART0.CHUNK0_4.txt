<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is a critical step in the reforming of naphtha, and is important in the commercial production of benzene where significant quantities of cyclohexane that remain in the product stream must be removed at a considerable expense.</p>
<p>While the complete dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is necessary for the production of aromatics and fuels, the selective dehydrogenation to cycloalkene intermediates is often more desirable as they provide the necessary building blocks for chemicals.</p>
<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on cobalt oxide nanoparticles was studied via temperature programmed reaction combined with in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates.</p>
<p>The selectivity of the catalyst was found to be size- and temperature-dependent, with larger particles preferentially producing cyclohexene at lower temperatures and smaller particles predominantly resulting in benzene at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The mechanistic features thought to control the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide were established by carrying out density functional theory calculations on the activation of propane, a surrogate model alkane, over model Co3O4 surfaces.</p>
<p>The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites.</p>
<p>The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface.</p>
<p>Hydroxyl recombination results in the formation of water which desorbs from the surface.</p>
<p>Oxygen is necessary to regenerate the surface oxygen sites, catalyze CH activation steps, and minimize catalyst degradation.</p>

This study examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on cobalt oxide nanoparticles of two sizes, 6 and 12 nm, deposited on an alumina support. The selectivity towards the conversion of cyclohexane to benzene is found to depend on both the size and temperature of the catalyst. At lower temperatures, the larger 12 nm particles produce cyclohexene preferentially, while the smaller 6 nm particles predominantly form benzene at higher temperatures. The mechanism controlling the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide is elucidated through density functional theory calculations on propane, a model alkane, over model Co3O4 surfaces. The calculations show that the activation of the alkane occurs via hydrogen abstraction at oxygen sites, followed by activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate at a second oxygen site to form the alkene, which then desorbs from the surface. Oxygen is essential for regenerating the active surface sites and minimizing catalyst degradation.

这项研究考察了在12纳米和6纳米两种尺寸的钴氧化物纳米颗粒上进行环己烷的氧化脱氢作用。催化剂的选择性对于环己烷转化为苯的转化取决于颗粒的大小和温度。在较低温度下，较大的12纳米颗粒更倾向于生成环己烯，而较小的6纳米颗粒在较高温度下主要形成苯。通过密度泛函理论计算，以模型化合物丙烷为对象，在模型钴氧化物表面上研究环烷烃的氧化脱氢机制。计算结果表明，烷基的激活过程发生在氧原子位点上的氢原子摘取，随后在第二个氧原子位点上激活生成的烷氧基中间体，形成烷基，然后从表面脱附。氧气对于再生活性表面位点并最小化催化剂降解至关重要。
