[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane by cobalt oxide nanoparticles was studied via temperature programmed reaction combined with in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates."
[2] "Under reaction conditions the nanoparticles retained their oxidation state and did not sinter. They instead underwent an assembly/disassembly process and could reorganize within their assemblies."
[3] "The selectivity of the catalyst was found to be size- and temperature-dependent, with larger particles preferentially producing cyclohexene at lower temperatures and smaller particles predominantly resulting in benzene at higher temperatures."
[4] "The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites. The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface."
[5] "The product distribution of cyclohexane dehydrogenation over Co3O4 surfaces is rather diverse involving the formation of cyclohexene, benzene, water, oxygenated intermediates, and CO2."
[6] "The activation barriers for the homolytic abstraction of hydrogen at O*-O* site pairs (2958 kJ mol1) over both the (110) and (111) Co3O4 surfaces were calculated to be considerably lower than the heterolytic activation of the CH bond over the Co*-O* site pairs via σ-bond metathesis (6887 kJ mol1) over these same surfaces."
[7] "The comparison of the 3-fold O* sites (on the (111) and the type B (110) surfaces) and the 2-fold sites O2f on the type B (110) surface indicates that the 2-fold sites O2f are easier to remove as water as the abstracted hydrogen atoms bind rather strongly."
[8] "The higher reactivity of the larger Co3O4 clusters can also be the result of the smaller band gaps for the larger oxide clusters over the smaller oxide clusters."

1. The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane using cobalt oxide nanoparticles, incorporating temperature-programmed reactions and in situ grazing incidence X-ray techniques alongside theoretical calculations on model Co3O4 substrates.
2. Under reaction conditions, the nanoparticles preserved their oxidation state without sintering, undergoing an assembly/disassembly process that allowed for reorganization.
3. The catalyst's selectivity was influenced by both particle size and temperature, with larger particles favoring cyclohexene production at lower temperatures and smaller particles producing benzene predominantly at higher temperatures.
4. The initial activation of the alkane involves hydrogen abstraction from surface oxygen sites, followed by the activation of the alkoxide intermediate at a second oxygen site, leading to alkene formation.
5. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane yields a variety of products, including cyclohexene, benzene, water, oxygenated intermediates, and CO2.
6. Homolytic hydrogen abstraction over O*-O* sites on Co3O4 surfaces is significantly less energetically demanding than heterolytic activation via σ-bond metathesis over Co*-O* sites.
7. The 2-fold O2f sites on the type B (110) surface are more easily removed as water compared to other sites due to the strong binding of the abstracted hydrogen atoms.
8. The enhanced reactivity of larger cobalt oxide clusters can be attributed to their smaller band gaps compared to smaller clusters.

1. 研究通过使用钴氧化物纳米颗粒，结合温度程序反应和原位掠入射X射线技术以及对模型Co3O4基底的理论计算，研究了环己烷的氧化脱氢。
2. 在反应条件下，纳米颗粒保持了其氧化状态，没有发生烧结。它们经历了组装/分解过程，并在内部重新组织。
3. 催化剂的选择性受到颗粒大小和温度的影响，较大的颗粒在较低温度下更倾向于产生环己烯，而较小的颗粒在较高温度下主要产生苯。
4. 甲烷的初始激活涉及从表面氧原子位点的氢原子抽象，随后是烷氧中间体在第二个氧原子位点的激活，形成烷烯。
5. 环己烷脱氢产生的产品包括环己烯、苯、水、氧代中间体和CO2。
6. Co3O4表面上的O*-O*位点的同裂解氢抽象的能量要求远低于通过σ键重排在Co*-O*位点上的异裂解激活的CH键。
7. 类型B（110）表面的2折O2f位点更容易作为水被去除，因为脱离的氢原子与水的结合很强。
8. 较大的钴氧化物簇的增强反应性可以归因于它们比较小的簇具有更小的带隙。
