[1] "First principle density functional theoretical calculations with Hubbard U corrections were carried out on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over model Co3O4 surfaces to gain insights into the pathways and mechanisms that control the CH bond activation, water formation, and surface reoxidation steps in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Co3O4 particles."
[2] "The results show that CH activation preferentially proceeds via a homolytic mechanism where the most weakly held and most basic oxygen surface sites carry out hydrogen abstraction to form a propoxy intermediate that subsequently reacts to form propene."
[3] "The comparison of the lowest energy (111) and Type B (110) surfaces of Co3O4 which make up the terrace sites on cobalt oxide particles used in this work indicates that the Type B(110) surface is the most active and that the active sites are the weakly held O* that form in the presence of oxygen."
[4] "The presence of oxygen is critical as it replenishes the active surface O*-O* sites which carry out CH bond activation and the formation and removal of water."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Co3O4 surfaces was studied through first principle density functional theoretical calculations to understand the pathways and mechanisms controlling the activation of the CH bond, water formation, and surface reoxidation steps. 

2. The activation of the CH bond predominantly occurs via a homolytic process, where the most loosely held and most basic oxygen surface sites perform hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of a propoxy intermediate that then reacts to produce propene.

3. Comparing the lowest energy (111) and Type B (110) surfaces of Co3O4, the Type B (110) surface is found to be the most active, with the active sites being the weakly held oxygen atoms present in the presence of oxygen.

4. The presence of oxygen is essential as it replenishes the active surface oxygen-oxygen (O*-O*) sites, facilitating the activation of the CH bond and the formation/removal of water.

1. 对于丙烷在钴氧化物粒子上的氧化脱氢作用，通过第一原理密度泛函理论计算进行了研究，以了解控制碳氢键激活、水生成和表面再氧化步骤的路径和机制。

2. 碳氢键激活主要通过同裂解途径进行，其中最弱的、最基础的氧表面原子执行氢提取，形成丙氧中间体，随后反应生成丙烯。

3. 比较能量最低的（111）型和类型B（110）型钴氧化物表面，类型B（110）表面被发现是最活跃的，活性位点是氧原子在氧存在的情况下形成的弱结合。

4. 氧的存在至关重要，因为它补充了活性表面氧-氧（O*-O*）位点，促进碳氢键的激活和水的生成/去除。
