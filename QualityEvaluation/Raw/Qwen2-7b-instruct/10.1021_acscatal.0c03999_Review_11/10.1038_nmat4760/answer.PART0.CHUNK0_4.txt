[1] "While the search for catalysts capable of directly converting methane to higher value commodity chemicals and liquid fuels has been active for over a century, a viable industrial process for selective methane activation has yet to be developed1."
[2] "Electronic structure calculations are playing an increasingly relevant role in this search, but large-scale materials screening efforts are hindered by computationally expensive transition state barrier calculations."
[3] "By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1)."
[4] "Our modelsuccessfullyrationalizestheavailableempiricaldataand lays the foundation for future catalyst design strategies that transcend diferent catalyst classes."
[5] "The universal scaling lines for these reactants lie below and parallel to the methane activation line (Fig. 3a)."
[6] "We posit the physical origin of these two lines may be related to the ability of the substrate to delocalize changes in charge following active site formation, as determined by a Bader charge analysis before and after oxygen adsorption to form the active site (Supplementary Figs 811)."
[7] "While a new catalysts selectivity must be explored separately, this simple kinetic and thermodynamic model can provide a useful foundation for easily evaluating the often rate-limiting crucial first step in methane oxidation."

Understanding trends in CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis involves the use of electronic structure calculations to predict and optimize catalysts for methane conversion. A unified framework using a single descriptor, Hydrogen Affinity (EH), enables the prediction of activation barriers for a wide range of catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism. This model successfully rationalizes empirical data and provides a basis for future catalyst design strategies that can apply across different catalyst classes. By comparing the activation energies of methane, ethane, and methanol across various catalyst materials, a universal scaling relationship emerges that can be used to accelerate materials discovery. The model also aids in identifying materials that can activate methane efficiently, setting the stage for subsequent exploration of selectivity in methane conversion processes.
