[1] "Many different classes of catalysts have been investigated for its activation."
[2] "In all catalyst materials, one of two distinct transition state (TS) geometries is observed2 (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[3] "For some catalysts, such as non-noble metals and certain oxides, unsaturated surface atoms are available to stabilize the methyl group in the TS36."
[4] "However,if the CH3surface interaction is energetically unfavourable7 or geometrically inaccessible8, a radical-like TS is observed2,913."
[5] "Many of the most promising catalysts for alkane activation fall into this second category: cation-exchanged zeolites11,1417, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)18,19 and decorated graphene nanosheets20 for the partial oxidation of alkanes, and certain oxides2,21 and zeolites22 for oxidative coupling of methane."
[6] "Hydrogen affinity (EH) has previously been shown to be a suitable descriptor of reactivity for radical-like hydrocarbon activation2325."
[7] "By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1)."
[8] "Our modelsuccessfullyrationalizestheavailableempiricaldataand lays the foundation for future catalyst design strategies that transcend diferent catalyst classes."
[9] "The universal scaling lines for these reactants lie below and parallel to the methane activation line (Fig. 3a)."
[10] "Using this relationship,we can describe CH bond activation across reactants and catalysts by a more general equation (equation (2)) that depends only on the hydrogen affinity of the catalyst and the CH bond energy of the reactant."
[11] "It is useful to examine the implications of accurately predicting CH activation energies for many reactants and a large library of chemically and structurally diverse catalyst materials (Fig. 2) using a single descriptor."
[12] "We posit the physical origin of these two lines may be related to the ability of the substrate to delocalize changes in charge following active site formation, as determined by a Bader charge analysis before and after oxygen adsorption to form the active site (Supplementary Figs 811)."
[13] "Materials that fall on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line (the high-activity class, red line) include various active site motifs for zeolites and several oxygen-promoted rutile oxides."
[14] "This finding is especially relevant given that Cu3O3/MOR (purple square, Fig. 4b) was recently demonstrated to have an order of magnitude greater methanol yield (per Cu atom) than other zeolites16."
[15] "Additionally,certain materials that, to the best of our knowledge, have not yet been tested for partial oxidation of methane, such as oxygen- promoted IrO2, also lie close to the peak of the volcano."

The document discusses the activation of various alkanes using different classes of catalysts. It mentions that hydrogen affinity (EH) is a suitable descriptor for predicting the reactivity of radical-like hydrocarbon activation. The study demonstrates that EH can be universally applied to describe catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism across diverse materials such as zeolites, oxides, metals, and MOFs. The document also explores the activation of different alkanes (methane, ethane, and methanol) using a single descriptor, hydrogen affinity, to predict their activation energies. It further explains how the physical origin of the observed scaling lines might relate to the ability of the substrate to delocalize changes in charge following active site formation. The document identifies that materials falling on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line, representing high-activity catalysts, include zeolites and oxygen-promoted rutile oxides. It highlights that Cu3O3/MOR has an exceptionally high methanol yield compared to other zeolites. Certain materials, like oxygen-promoted IrO2, which have not been tested for methane activation, also exhibit high activation activity based on the volcano plot.

文档讨论了不同类别的催化剂用于烷烃激活。它提到，氢亲和力（EH）是预测类似自由基烃激活反应性的合适描述符。研究证明，EH可以广泛应用于描述遵循甲烷激活机制的催化剂，这些催化剂跨越了如沸石、氧化物、金属和MOF等不同的材料。文档还探讨了不同烷烃（甲烷、乙烷和甲醇）使用单一描述符——氢亲和力——来预测它们的激活能量的方法。进一步解释了观察到的尺度线物理起源可能与在形成活性位点后，基团能够重新分布电荷的能力有关。文档识别出，位于较低Gf与GH尺度线上的材料，代表高活性催化剂，包括沸石和氧促进的锐钛矿氧化物。它强调，与其它沸石相比，Cu3O3/MOR的甲醇产率非常高。某些材料，如氧促进的IrO2，虽然尚未进行甲烷激活测试，但基于火山图也显示出高度的激活活性。
