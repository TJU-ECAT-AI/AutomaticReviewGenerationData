<p>Many different classes of catalysts have been investigated for its activation. In all catalyst materials, one of two distinct transition state (TS) geometries is observed2 (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p>
<p>By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Our analysis provides the guidelines necessary to predict and compare the performance of new catalysts with the existing materials used for CH bond activation reactions.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, many catalysts that are able to activate methane at low temperatures will have poor selectivity, but no catalyst that fails to activate methane can go on to be selective.</p>

The document does not contain information to answer the question about selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene using halogen-assisted methods, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The text focuses on methane activation and provides insights into predicting activation energies for various catalysts and reactants using descriptors like Hydrogen Affinity (EH) and Gas Phase Free Energy of Active Site Formation (Gf). It discusses the use of these descriptors to create a universal scaling relationship for methane activation and to develop a model for predicting methane activation rates. However, it does not delve into the specifics of dehydrogenation processes for propane or other alkanes.

文档没有提供关于使用卤素辅助方法、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯的信息。文本主要关注甲烷活化，并提供了预测各种催化剂和反应物激活能的见解，使用如氢亲和力（EH）和气相活性位点形成自由能（Gf）等描述符。它讨论了使用这些描述符建立甲烷活化的通用标度关系以及开发预测甲烷活化速率模型的方法。但是，它并未深入探讨丙烷或其他烷烃的脱氢过程的具体细节。
