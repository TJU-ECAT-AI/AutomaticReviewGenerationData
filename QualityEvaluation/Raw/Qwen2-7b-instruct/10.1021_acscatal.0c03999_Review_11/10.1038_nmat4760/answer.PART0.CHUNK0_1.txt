<p>While the search for catalysts capable of directly converting methane to higher value commodity chemicals and liquid fuels has been active for over a century, a viable industrial process for selective methane activation has yet to be developed1.</p>
<p>By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>We note that other related descriptors have been previously used for similar purposes, including oxide surface reducibility2, acidity/basicity26 and reaction energy4,27. However, these studies have generally been limited to describing trends within one subset of catalyst materials.</p>
<p>Given that the TS energy scales with the hydrogen affinity (Fig. 1), Gf and GH provide a complete description of the ability of a catalyst to activate methane. GH is defined analogously to EH as: GH =G(MmOxHy+1)G(MmOxHy)</p>
<p>A plot of ϑmotif as a function of Gf for oxygen activation of MmOx active sites is given in Supplementary Fig. 5.</p>
<p>Materials that fall on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line (the high-activity class, red line) include various active site motifs for zeolites and several oxygen-promoted rutile oxides.</p>

1. Over a century of research has focused on catalysts for converting methane into valuable chemical products and liquid fuels, but a practical industrial process for selective methane activation remains elusive.

2. By analyzing 20 distinct active site structures and catalyst types, including zeolites, oxides, metals, and MOFs, the study establishes a unified framework for predicting methane activation barriers using a single universal descriptor. This descriptor is applicable to catalysts that use a radical intermediate in their activation process.

3. Previous studies have employed descriptors like oxide surface reducibility, acidity/basicity, and reaction energy to describe catalyst trends. However, these analyses typically confined themselves to specific categories of catalyst materials.

4. The hydrogen affinity (EH) serves as a suitable descriptor for predicting the reactivity of radical-like hydrocarbon activation, as demonstrated in this study. The descriptor's utility extends to catalysts that utilize a radical-like methane activation mechanism.

5. A plot illustrating the relationship between the formation energy (Gf) of active sites and their oxygen activation capability on MmOx materials is presented in Supplementary Figure 5.

6. Catalysts located along the lower Gf versus GH scaling line, categorized as the high-activity class, encompass various zeolite active site motifs and oxygen-promoted rutile oxides. These catalysts exhibit enhanced methane activation activity.

1. 对于直接将甲烷转化为高价值的商品化学品和液体燃料的催化剂的研究已经超过一个世纪，但具有选择性的甲烷活化过程尚未发展为可行的工业流程。

2. 通过分析包括沸石、氧化物、金属和MOF在内的20种不同的活性位点结构和催化剂类型，研究建立了预测通过自由基中间体进行甲烷活化的催化剂激活壁垒的统一框架。该描述符适用于所有遵循自由基类似物甲烷激活机制的催化剂。

3. 过去的研究使用氧化物表面还原性、酸碱性和反应能量等描述符来描述催化剂趋势。然而，这些分析通常局限于特定类别的催化剂材料。

4. 氢亲和力（EH）作为描述类似自由基的碳氢化合物活化反应活性的合适描述符，已经在本研究中得到证明。该描述符的适用范围扩展到使用类似自由基的甲烷激活机制的催化剂。

5. 在补充图5中展示了活性位点形成能（Gf）与氧激活能力之间的关系图，针对MmOx材料。

6. 分布在较低的Gf对GH尺度线上的催化剂，被归类为高活性类别，包括各种沸石活性位点模式和氧促进的锐钛矿氧化物。这些催化剂表现出增强的甲烷活化活性。
