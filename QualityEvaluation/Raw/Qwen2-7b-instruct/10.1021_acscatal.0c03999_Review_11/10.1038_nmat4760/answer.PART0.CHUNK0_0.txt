[1] "Methane is relatively inert, and many different classes of catalysts have been investigated for its activation."
[2] "In all catalyst materials, one of two distinct transition state (TS) geometries is observed2 (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[3] "For some catalysts, such as non-noble metals and certain oxides, unsaturated surface atoms are available to stabilize the methyl group in the TS36."
[4] "However,if the CH3surface interaction is energetically unfavourable7 or geometrically inaccessible8, a radical-like TS is observed2,913."
[5] "Many of the most promising catalysts for alkane activation fall into this second category: cation-exchanged zeolites11,1417, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)18,19 and decorated graphene nanosheets20 for the partial oxidation of alkanes, and certain oxides2,21 and zeolites22 for oxidative coupling of methane."
[6] "Hydrogen affinity (EH) has previously been shown to be a suitable descriptor of reactivity for radical-like hydrocarbon activation2325."
[7] "However, these analyses have traditionally been limited to trends within groups of certain transition metal oxides."
[8] "By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1)."
[9] "This TS is characterized by a CH (OH) bond length of 2.5 (1.2) Å, and its radical nature is confirmed by examining the carbon projected density of states and spin density difference (Supplementary Figs 24)."
[10] "Similar to the above analysis, we determined the TS and universal scaling lines for CH bond activation in ethane and methanol for different active sites and materials using the same descriptor, EH."
[11] "The universal scaling lines for these reactants lie below and parallel to the methane activation line (Fig. 3a)."
[12] "Using this relationship,we can describe CH bond activation across reactants and catalysts by a more general equation (equation (2)) that depends only on the hydrogen affinity of the catalyst and the CH bond energy of the reactant."
[13] "It is useful to examine the implications of accurately predicting CH activation energies for many reactants and a large library of chemically and structurally diverse catalyst materials (Fig. 2) using a single descriptor."
[14] "The errors for the scaling relationships shown in Figs 1 and 3a (0.1 eV) are comparable to the typical accuracy of DFT adsorption energies29,30."
[15] "More importantly, these small deviations indicate that computationally expensive calculations of TS energies can be avoided, and this model can easily be used to accelerate materials discovery for various CH bond activation reactions."
[16] "With the insight that a single descriptor can be used to predict CH activation energies on many diverse catalyst materials, we are able to generate a simple model that describes the ability of a catalyst to activate methane."
[17] "Therefore, we shift our focus to free energies,as these are more relevant for a reaction rate analysis."
[18] "Given that the TS energy scales with the hydrogen affinity (Fig. 1), Gf and GH provide a complete description of the ability of a catalyst to activate methane."
[19] "GH is defined analogously to EH as: GH =G(MmOxHy+1)G(MmOxHy) (6) where G(MmOxHy+1) and G MmOxHy are the formation free energies of the reduced and bare active sites referenced to the gas-phase free energies of H2O and O2."
[20] "Using these quantities as independent descriptors, a two-dimensional rate volcano can be constructed showing the rate of methane activation as a function of Gf and GH (Fig. 4a)."
[21] "Interestingly, all the materials explored seem to fall on one of two distinct Gf versus GH scaling lines (red and purple lines, Fig. 4a)."
[22] "Materials that fall on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line (the high-activity class, red line) include various active site motifs for zeolites and several oxygen-promoted rutile oxides."
[23] "Additionally,certain materials that, to the best of our knowledge, have not yet been tested for partial oxidation of methane, such as oxygen- promoted IrO2, also lie close to the peak of the volcano."
[24] "Only once the question of methane activation is answered can the difficult problem of selectivity be explored."

1. The document discusses various catalysts used for activating methane, including non-noble metals, certain oxides, cation-exchanged zeolites, metal organic frameworks, and decorated graphene nanosheets. These catalysts are used for the partial oxidation of alkanes and oxidative coupling of methane.

2. Hydrogen affinity (EH) is a suitable descriptor for radical-like hydrocarbon activation. The study broadens the scope of previous analyses to include diverse catalysts like zeolites, oxides, metals, and MOFs. This descriptor can universally describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism.

3. The document mentions that the TS for methane activation is characterized by a CH (OH) bond length of 2.5 (1.2) Å, indicating a radical-like nature. The TS is confirmed by analyzing the carbon projected density of states and spin density difference.

4. The study determines universal scaling lines for CH bond activation in ethane and methanol using the hydrogen affinity descriptor (EH). These lines are positioned below and parallel to the methane activation line.

5. A general equation (equation (2)) is derived that depends on the hydrogen affinity of the catalyst and the CH bond energy of the reactant. This equation allows describing CH bond activation across reactants and catalysts.

6. The study examines the implications of accurately predicting CH activation energies using a single descriptor. This model can avoid computationally expensive TS energy calculations and accelerate materials discovery for various CH bond activation reactions.

7. The document focuses on free energies as more relevant for reaction rate analysis. The TS energy scales with hydrogen affinity, indicating that Gf and GH provide a complete description of a catalyst's methane activation ability.

8. GH is defined analogously to EH, relating to the formation free energies of the reduced and bare active sites referenced to gas-phase H2O and O2. This quantity allows constructing a two-dimensional rate volcano showing the rate of methane activation.

9. All materials explored fall on one of two distinct Gf versus GH scaling lines. Materials on the lower scaling line exhibit higher methane activation activity, including zeolites and oxygen-promoted rutile oxides. Certain materials, like oxygen-promoted IrO2, also exhibit high activity.

10. The document emphasizes that only after determining methane activation can the complex problem of selectivity be explored. This insight provides a foundation for predicting and comparing catalyst performance for CH bond activation reactions.
