[1] "Methane is relatively inert, and many different classes of catalysts have been investigated for its activation."
[2] "In all catalyst materials, one of two distinct transition state (TS) geometries is observed2 (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[3] "For some catalysts, such as non-noble metals and certain oxides, unsaturated surface atoms are available to stabilize the methyl group in the TS36."
[4] "However,if the CH3surface interaction is energetically unfavourable7 or geometrically inaccessible8, a radical-like TS is observed2,913."
[5] "Many of the most promising catalysts for alkane activation fall into this second category: cation-exchanged zeolites11,1417, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)18,19 and decorated graphene nanosheets20 for the partial oxidation of alkanes, and certain oxides2,21 and zeolites22 for oxidative coupling of methane."
[6] "Hydrogen affinity (EH) has previously been shown to be a suitable descriptor of reactivity for radical-like hydrocarbon activation2325."
[7] "However, these analyses have traditionally been limited to trends within groups of certain transition metal oxides."
[8] "By examining 20 distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism (Fig. 1)."
[9] "This TS is characterized by a CH (OH) bond length of 2.5 (1.2) Å, and its radical nature is confirmed by examining the carbon projected density of states and spin density difference (Supplementary Figs 24)."
[10] "Similar to the above analysis, we determined the TS and universal scaling lines for CH bond activation in ethane and methanol for different active sites and materials using the same descriptor, EH."
[11] "The universal scaling lines for these reactants lie below and parallel to the methane activation line (Fig. 3a)."
[12] "Using this relationship,we can describe CH bond activation across reactants and catalysts by a more general equation (equation (2)) that depends only on the hydrogen affinity of the catalyst and the CH bond energy of the reactant."
[13] "It is useful to examine the implications of accurately predicting CH activation energies for many reactants and a large library of chemically and structurally diverse catalyst materials (Fig. 2) using a single descriptor."
[14] "The errors for the scaling relationships shown in Figs 1 and 3a (0.1 eV) are comparable to the typical accuracy of DFT adsorption energies29,30."
[15] "More importantly, these small deviations indicate that computationally expensive calculations of TS energies can be avoided, and this model can easily be used to accelerate materials discovery for various CH bond activation reactions."
[16] "With the insight that a single descriptor can be used to predict CH activation energies on many diverse catalyst materials, we are able to generate a simple model that describes the ability of a catalyst to activate methane."
[17] "Therefore, we shift our focus to free energies,as these are more relevant for a reaction rate analysis."
[18] "Given that the TS energy scales with the hydrogen affinity (Fig. 1), Gf and GH provide a complete description of the ability of a catalyst to activate methane."
[19] "GH is defined analogously to EH as: GH =G(MmOxHy+1)G(MmOxHy) (6) where G(MmOxHy+1) and G MmOxHy are the formation free energies of the reduced and bare active sites referenced to the gas-phase free energies of H2O and O2."
[20] "Using these quantities as independent descriptors, a two-dimensional rate volcano can be constructed showing the rate of methane activation as a function of Gf and GH (Fig. 4a)."
[21] "Interestingly, all the materials explored seem to fall on one of two distinct Gf versus GH scaling lines (red and purple lines, Fig. 4a)."
[22] "Materials that fall on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line (the high-activity class, red line) include various active site motifs for zeolites and several oxygen-promoted rutile oxides."
[23] "Additionally,certain materials that, to the best of our knowledge, have not yet been tested for partial oxidation of methane, such as oxygen- promoted IrO2, also lie close to the peak of the volcano."
[24] "Only once the question of methane activation is answered can the difficult problem of selectivity be explored."

Understanding trends in CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis involves the use of electronic structure calculations to predict and optimize catalysts for methane conversion. A unified framework using a single descriptor, Hydrogen Affinity (EH), enables the prediction of activation barriers for a wide range of catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation mechanism. This model successfully rationalizes empirical data and provides a basis for future catalyst design strategies that can apply across different catalyst classes. By comparing the activation energies of methane, ethane, and methanol across various catalyst materials, a universal scaling relationship emerges that can be used to accelerate materials discovery. The model also aids in identifying materials that can activate methane efficiently, setting the stage for subsequent exploration of selectivity in methane conversion processes.
