1. The thermodynamic study suggests that the compatible reaction temperatures for the tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene should be above 823 K. This allows the reactions to occur simultaneously on different sites. 
2. Traditional methods for ethylene production, such as thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of ethane, are energy-intensive and often lead to serious coking issues.
3. Previous research indicates that catalysts commonly used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane include Ga-based oxides, Cr-based oxides, Co-based oxides, metal carbides, and others.
4. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding the active sites and their structures on supported metal catalysts, which is crucial for optimizing their activity and selectivity in tandem reactions like CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
5. The authors confirm that there is no conflict of interest regarding this publication.
6. This article has been submitted directly to PNAS following its approval by Alexis T. Bell.

1. 根据热力学研究，这两种串联反应的兼容反应温度应超过823K，这使得两种反应能够在不同的位点同时进行。
2. 传统的乙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和乙烷直接脱氢，能耗高且不可避免地伴随严重的结焦问题。
3. 前期研究表明，用于CO2辅助乙烷脱氢的催化剂通常包括Ga基氧化物、Cr基氧化物、Co基氧化物、金属碳化物以及其他催化剂。
4. 此次研究的意义在于深入理解支持金属催化剂的活性位点及其结构与性能之间的关系，这对于优化串联反应（如CO2还原和乙烷脱氢）中的催化剂活性和选择性至关重要。
5. 作者声明在本文发表过程中不存在利益冲突。
6. 该文章作为PNAS的直接提交，在Alexis T. Bell教授的审阅下获得批准。
