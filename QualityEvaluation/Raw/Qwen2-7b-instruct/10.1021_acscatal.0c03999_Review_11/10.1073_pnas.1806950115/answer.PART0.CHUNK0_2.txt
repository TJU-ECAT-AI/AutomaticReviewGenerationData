This literature discusses the identification of active sites for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts. The most likely active sites are found to be the NiFeOx interfacial sites, which selectively break the CH bonds and preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, and the NiCeOx interfacial sites, which efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas. The selectivity of ethylene production can be tuned by adjusting the Ni/Fe ratio, with the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalyst showing the highest ethylene selectivity. The literature also provides thermodynamic conditions for the tandem reactions and demonstrates that the active sites can be fine-tuned to rationally manipulate the catalytic selectivity in parallel reaction pathways for CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

本文讨论了在CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂上进行CO2还原和乙烷脱氢联合作用的活性位点的识别。最有可能的活性位点被发现是NiFeOx界面位点，它们能够选择性地断裂乙烷的CH键并保留CC键以产生乙烯，以及NiCeOx界面位点，它们能够高效地断裂所有CH和CC键以产生合成气。通过调整Ni/Fe比例，可以调节乙烯的选择性，Ni1Fe3/CeO2催化剂显示出最高的乙烯选择性。文献还提供了串联反应的热力学条件，并表明可以通过调整活性位点来合理地调节CO2还原和乙烷脱氢联合作用的催化选择性。
