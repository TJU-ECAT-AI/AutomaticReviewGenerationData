[1] "The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydroge- nation of ethane (C2H6) to ethylene creates an opportunity to effec- tively use the underutilized ethane from shale gas while mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions."
[2] "Previous work shows that typical catalysts used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane are Ga-based oxides (6, 8), Cr-based oxides (9, 1216), Co-based oxides (17, 18), metal carbides (1, 19),and other catalysts (7, 20, 21)."
[3] "The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the Ni FeOx interfacial sites can selectively break the CH bonds and pre- serve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas."
[4] "The role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is mainly due to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites."

The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane aim to effectively utilize underutilized ethane from shale gas and mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Various catalysts, including Ga-based oxides, Cr-based oxides, Co-based oxides, metal carbides, and others, have been used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane. The NiFeOx interfacial sites are effective for selective breaking of CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene. The NiCeOx interfacial sites, on the other hand, efficiently cleave all bonds to produce synthesis gas. The introduction of Fe leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which control the ethylene selectivity by replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites.

协同反应中，通过二氧化碳辅助的乙烷脱氢为乙烯提供了机会，有效利用了页岩气中的未充分利用的乙烷并减轻了人为二氧化碳排放。各种催化剂，包括镓基氧化物、铬基氧化物、钴基氧化物、金属碳化物以及其它催化剂，被用于二氧化碳辅助的乙烷脱氢。NiFeOx界面有效选择性地断裂CH键同时保留CC键产生乙烯。NiCeOx界面则高效断裂所有键以生成合成气。引入Fe导致形成NiFeOx界面，通过替换NiCeOx界面来控制乙烯选择性。
