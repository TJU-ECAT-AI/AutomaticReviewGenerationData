[1] "The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydroge- nation of ethane (C2H6) to ethylene creates an opportunity to effec- tively use the underutilized ethane from shale gas while mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions."
[2] "The traditional routes for ethylene production from thermal steam cracking (3, 4) and direct dehydrogenation (5) of ethane are energy-intensive and inevitably accompanied with serious coking problems (1, 6)."
[3] "Previous work shows that typical catalysts used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane are Ga-based oxides (6, 8), Cr-based oxides (9, 1216), Co-based oxides (17, 18), metal carbides (1, 19),and other catalysts (7, 20, 21)."
[4] "A small amount of Fe introduction promotes the CC bond scission activity (e.g., Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with 99% CO selectivity),while an optimal amount of Fe greatly increases the selective CH bond cleavage activity (e.g., Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with 78% C2H4 selectiv- ity)."
[5] "The NiFeOx interfaces and NiCeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (i.e., selectively cleave the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane (efficiently break all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas), respectively."

The document discusses the tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) to ethylene, which offers a way to effectively utilize underutilized ethane from shale gas and mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Traditional methods of ethylene production, such as thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of ethane, are energy-intensive and come with serious coking problems. Previous work has explored using various catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane, including Ga-based oxides, Cr-based oxides, Co-based oxides, metal carbides, and others. The document identifies NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively. Introducing a small amount of Fe promotes CC bond scission, while an optimal amount of Fe increases the selective CH bond cleavage activity.

文档讨论了CO2辅助乙烷裂解与乙烯生成的串联反应，这为有效利用页岩气中未充分利用的乙烷并减少人为CO2排放提供了机会。传统的乙烯生产方法，如热蒸汽裂解和直接乙烷脱氢，能耗高，并伴随着严重的结焦问题。过去的研究已经探索了使用各种催化剂进行CO2辅助乙烷脱氢，包括镓基氧化物、铬基氧化物、钴基氧化物、金属碳化物以及其它催化剂。文档确定了NiFeOx和NiCeOx界面作为最可能的活性位点用于CO2辅助乙烷裂解（选择性断裂CH键生成乙烯）和乙烷干重整（高效断裂CH和CC键生成合成气），分别。少量Fe的引入促进了CC键的断裂，而适量的Fe显著增加了选择性断裂CH键的活性。
