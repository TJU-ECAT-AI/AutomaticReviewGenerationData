[1] "The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydroge- nation of ethane (C2H6) to ethylene creates an opportunity to effec- tively use the underutilized ethane from shale gas while mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions."
[2] "Previous work shows that typical catalysts used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane are Ga-based oxides (6, 8), Cr-based oxides (9, 1216), Co-based oxides (17, 18), metal carbides (1, 19),and other catalysts (7, 20, 21)."
[3] "The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the Ni FeOx interfacial sites can selectively break the CH bonds and pre- serve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas."

The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane aim to effectively utilize underutilized ethane from shale gas and mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Various catalysts, including Ga-based oxides, Cr-based oxides, Co-based oxides, metal carbides, and others, have been used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane. The NiFeOx interfacial sites are effective for selective breaking of CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene. The NiCeOx interfacial sites, on the other hand, efficiently cleave all bonds to produce synthesis gas. The introduction of Fe leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which control the ethylene selectivity by replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene aim to utilize the underused ethane from shale gas and reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This process creates an opportunity to effectively use ethane, a crucial raw material in the chemical industry, by converting it into ethylene through the assistance of CO2. The tandem reactions involve both CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation, occurring on metal oxide interfaces with specific selectivities for ethylene production.

[1] "According to the thermodynamic study (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), the compatible reaction temperatures should be over 823 K, at which these two tandem reactions can operate on different sites simultaneously."
[2] "In this case, CO2 can dissociate on the reducible oxide to produce CO and reactive oxygen species (*O). Then, the corre- sponding *O would assist the dehydrogenation of ethane that ad- sorbs on the metaloxide interfaces to ethylene and H2O."
[3] "Since the scission of the CC bond (377 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically more favorable than the cleavage of the CH bond (423 kJ/mol) of ethane (11), it is critical to identify catalysts that do not promote the CC bond scission to improve the selectivity to ethylene."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Based on the thermodynamic study (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), the suitable reaction temperatures for the tandem reactions should exceed 823 K, allowing both reactions to occur simultaneously on different sites. When CO2 interacts with the reducible oxide, it decomposes to produce CO and reactive oxygen species (*O). This *O assists in the dehydrogenation of ethane adsorbed on metal oxide interfaces, yielding ethylene and water. Given that breaking the CC bond (377 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically more favorable than cleaving the CH bond (423 kJ/mol) of ethane (11), it is essential to find catalysts that prevent the CC bond scission to enhance the selectivity for ethylene production.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

根据热力学研究（SI附件，图S1），串联反应的合适反应温度应超过823 K，使得两个反应同时在不同的位点发生。当CO2与可还原氧化物相互作用时，它分解产生CO和活性氧物种（*O）。这个*O协助吸附在金属氧化物界面的乙烷脱烷烃，生成乙烯和水。由于断裂CC键（377 kJ/mol）比裂解乙烷中的CH键（423 kJ/mol）更有利于热力学，因此需要找到防止CC键断裂的催化剂，以提高乙烯选择性。

[2] "A small amount of Fe introduction promotes the CC bond scission activity (e.g., Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with 99% CO selectivity),while an optimal amount of Fe greatly increases the selective CH bond cleavage activity (e.g., Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with 78% C2H4 selectiv- ity)."

Prior research indicates that common catalysts utilized for CO2-assisted ethane dehydrogenation include gallium-based oxides (6, 8), chromium-based oxides (9, 12-16), cobalt-based oxides (17, 18), metal carbides (1, 19), and other catalysts (7, 20, 21). A minimal amount of iron addition enhances the CC bond scission activity (for example, Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with 99% CO selectivity), whereas an optimal iron quantity significantly boosts the selective CH bond cleavage activity (for example, Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with 78% C2H4 selectivity). This study reveals that the active sites on CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts can be finely adjusted to rationally control the catalytic selectivity across parallel reaction pathways for CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

This literature discusses the identification of active sites for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts. The most likely active sites are found to be the NiFeOx interfacial sites, which selectively break the CH bonds and preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, and the NiCeOx interfacial sites, which efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas. The selectivity of ethylene production can be tuned by adjusting the Ni/Fe ratio, with the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalyst showing the highest ethylene selectivity. The literature also provides thermodynamic conditions for the tandem reactions and demonstrates that the active sites can be fine-tuned to rationally manipulate the catalytic selectivity in parallel reaction pathways for CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
