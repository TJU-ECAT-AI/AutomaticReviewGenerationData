3.1.1.1. CO adsorption.
Bands arising below 2000 cm1 are attributed to carbonite anions or similar polymeric structures reflecting the strong basic character of the MgO surface [12,13].
3.1.1.2. Methane adsorption.
The band located at 2827 cm1 (Fig. 5) may be assigned to a combination mode of m4 and m2. The observed bands are attributed to methane interacting with coordinatively unsaturated sites at the surface of C-MgO.

The document describes the use of infrared spectroscopy to investigate the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms on magnesium oxide (MgO) catalysts in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The study focuses on understanding the relationship between the structure of the MgO surface, specifically the abundance and nature of structural defects, and its catalytic activity. The authors employ FTIR spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and EPR spectroscopy to characterize the surface defects, which are correlated with the initial rates of methane consumption and C2+ hydrocarbon formation. The results suggest that weakly adsorbed methane and oxygen undergo a concerted reaction mechanism involving direct electron transfer from a CH bond of methane to the oxygen molecule, facilitated by specific adsorption sites on the MgO surface. These active sites, characterized by high surface roughness and the presence of mono-atomic steps, assist in the polarization of methane molecules and promote the dissociation of the CH bond leading to the formation of superoxide species. Over time, the catalyst deactivates due to the loss of these active sites, which is associated with the sintering of the MgO surface and the formation of polar and faceted surfaces.

The experimental section details the preparation of MgO catalysts using various synthesis methods, including commercial MgO, hydrothermally treated MgO, MgO prepared by sol-gel synthesis, and MgO prepared by combustion of metallic Mg in air. The catalysts are characterized using techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The authors report that the MgO catalysts differ in their morphology and surface texturing, contributing to their specific surface area, despite having similar crystallite sizes as determined by XRD. The authors observe that the catalysts exhibit sintering phenomena during use in OCM, with the domain size increasing and the morphology becoming more rounded. The study aims to understand the potential active sites on the surface of fresh, dehydroxylated MgO and how their depletion occurs under reaction conditions.

文档描述了使用红外光谱法研究镁氧化物（MgO）催化剂在甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）过程中的活性位点和反应机制。研究重点在于理解表面结构，特别是表面缺陷的丰富性和性质与催化活性之间的关系。作者利用傅里叶变换红外光谱、荧光光谱和电子自旋共振光谱来表征表面缺陷，并将这些表面缺陷的丰度与甲烷消耗速率和C2+烃类形成速率相关联。结果表明，弱吸附的甲烷和氧通过直接从甲烷中的CH键向氧分子转移电子进行协同反应机制，该机制在MgO表面上得到促进，这得益于特定吸附位点的存在。这些活性位点，具有高表面粗糙度和单原子台阶，有助于甲烷分子的极化并促进CH键的断裂，导致超氧物种的形成。随着时间的推移，催化剂由于活性位点的损失而失效，这与MgO表面的聚集现象和形成极性和晶面表面有关。

实验部分详细介绍了采用不同合成方法制备的MgO催化剂，包括商用MgO、经压力处理的MgO、溶胶合成的MgO和通过空气燃烧金属Mg制备的MgO。催化剂通过傅里叶变换红外光谱、电子自旋共振光谱、反射光谱、透射电子显微镜和荧光光谱进行表征。作者报告称，MgO催化剂在形态和表面纹理上存在差异，影响其比表面积，尽管X射线衍射测定的晶粒大小相似。观察到催化剂在OCM使用过程中出现聚集现象，晶域尺寸增大，形态变得更为圆润。研究旨在了解新鲜脱水MgO表面潜在活性位点的特性及其如何在反应条件下消失。
