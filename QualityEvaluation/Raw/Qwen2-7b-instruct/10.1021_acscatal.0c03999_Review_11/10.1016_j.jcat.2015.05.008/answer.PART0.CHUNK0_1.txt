3.1.1.1. CO adsorption. The adsorption of carbon monoxide at low temperatures results in the appearance of carbonyl bands that are shifted to higher energy compared to the CO stretching mode of the free CO molecule at 2143 cm1 due to the formation of r-donor bonds via the carbon atom of the CO molecule to coordi- natively unsaturated surface cations [9].

3.1.1.2. Methane adsorption. The IR spectrum of the free CH4 molecule is characterized by the triply degenerate antisymmetric stretching mode m3 at 3020 cm1 and the twofold degenerate HCH deformation mode m4 at 1306 cm1 [1719]. The infrared spectrum of CH4 adsorbed at 77 K on C-MgO (Fig. 5, red line) shows bands at 3003, 2896, and 2827 cm1 in the region of CH stretching vibrations and a band at 1304 cm1 in the region of deformation vibrations.

Scheme 1. Coordination of methane and CO at the MgO surface.

The spectrum of adsorbed methane shows additional bands in the region of OH stretching vibrations at 3728, 3680, and 3660 cm1 (Fig. 5, red line). The wave numbers are characteristic of MgOH species in different coordination [20].

The literature describes the adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) on a magnesium oxide (MgO) surface. CO adsorption results in the formation of carbonyl bands that are shifted to higher energies compared to its free molecule due to the formation of r-donor bonds. The IR spectrum of CH4 adsorption on MgO at 77 K shows distinct bands in the CH stretching and deformation regions, with additional OH stretching bands that are characteristic of MgOH species. These findings suggest that the surface of MgO contains various coordinatively unsaturated sites that facilitate the adsorption of both CO and CH4, leading to distinct vibrational patterns in their IR spectra.

文献描述了二氧化碳（CO）和甲烷（CH4）在镁氧化物（MgO）表面的吸附。CO吸附形成羰基带，其能量高于自由分子时的特征，这是由于形成了r-供体键。在77 K时，CH4在MgO上的红外光谱在CH伸缩和变形区域显示出特定的波数，同时还有MgOH物种的不同配位的OH伸缩带。这些结果表明，MgO表面包含各种配位不饱和位点，这些位点能够促进CO和CH4的吸附，并导致它们红外光谱中特有的振动模式。
