[1] "The performance of dehydroxylated MgO at the beginning of the reaction (at t = 0) and the kinetics of catalyst deactivation strongly depend on initial particle morphology and surface texture, whereas similar catalyst properties are finally approached in the steady state."
[2] "The trend in specific surface area is not directly related to the mean crystallite size determined by XRD indicating that surface texturing contributes substantially to the surface area measured by nitrogen adsorption."
[3] "Co-adsorption of methane and carbon monoxide reveals the relative abundance of acid-base and basic sites."
[4] "The adsorption of carbon monoxide at low temperatures results in the appearance of carbonyl bands that are shifted to higher energy compared to the CO stretching mode of the free CO molecule at 2143 cm1 due to the formation of r-donor bonds via the carbon atom of the CO molecule to coordi- natively unsaturated surface cations."
[5] "The band located at 21572152 cm1 has been assigned to Mg2+5C on (100) terrace sites."
[6] "The contribution from edges at multi-atomic steps (2164 cm1) is similar to that of C-MgO."
[7] "The band located at 2146 cm1 is assigned to a CO species bonded to Mg2+ 4CMg2+ 5C pairs at mono-atomic step edges."
[8] "The fact that the MgO  HCH3 features are not observed in the co-adsorption experiments, where Mg2+ centers are saturated by CO (Fig. 5, black line), indicates that they must be associated with acid-base pair sites only."
[9] "The band located at 2164 cm1 in Fig. 1B is swallowed up and finally completely obscured by the band associated with terrace sites located at 2152 cm1 at higher equilibrium pressures."

1. The initial performance of MgO catalysts and their deactivation kinetics are significantly influenced by the initial particle morphology and surface texture. Despite this, similar catalyst properties are eventually reached in the steady state.
2. The specific surface area's trend does not directly correlate with the mean crystallite size determined by XRD. Surface texturing plays a substantial role in the surface area measured by nitrogen adsorption.
3. Co-adsorption experiments of methane and carbon monoxide help determine the relative abundance of acid-base and basic sites on the catalyst surface.
4. Adsorption of carbon monoxide at low temperatures causes carbonyl bands to shift to higher energies, due to the formation of r-donor bonds with coordinatively unsaturated surface cations.
5. The band at 2157-2152 cm⁻¹ is assigned to Mg2+5C on (100) terrace sites.
6. The contribution from edges at multi-atomic steps is similar to that observed in C-MgO.
7. The band at 2146 cm⁻¹ is attributed to a CO species bonded to Mg2+ 4CMg2+ 5C pairs at mono-atomic step edges.
8. The absence of MgO  HCH3 features in co-adsorption experiments where Mg2+ centers are saturated by CO indicates that these features are exclusively associated with acid-base pair sites.
9. The band at 2164 cm⁻¹ is overshadowed and eventually obscured by the band associated with terrace sites at 2152 cm⁻¹ at higher equilibrium pressures.

1. MgO催化剂的初始性能和其失活动力学主要受到颗粒形态和表面纹理的影响。尽管如此，相似的催化剂性质在稳定态时会达到。
2. 特定表面积的趋势与通过XRD确定的平均晶粒大小无关。表面纹理在通过氮吸附测量的表面积中起着重要作用。
3. 同位吸附实验有助于确定催化剂表面上酸碱和基本站点的相对丰度。
4. 在低温下吸附二氧化碳会导致羰基带向更高能量移动，这是由于二氧化碳分子中的碳原子与表面配位不饱和阳离子形成的r捐赠键所致。
5. 位于(100)台阶上的Mg2+5C的波长为2157-2152 cm⁻¹。
6. 多原子台阶边缘的贡献与C-MgO中观察到的一致。
7. 波长为2146 cm⁻¹的带被归因于Mg2+ 4CMg2+ 5C对在单原子台阶边缘处吸附的CO物种。
8. 在Mg2+中心被CO饱和的共吸附实验中未观察到MgO  HCH3特征表明这些特征仅与酸碱对站点相关联。
9. 在更高的平衡压力下，波长为2164 cm⁻¹的带被与台阶上位于2152 cm⁻¹的带所覆盖并最终被掩盖。
