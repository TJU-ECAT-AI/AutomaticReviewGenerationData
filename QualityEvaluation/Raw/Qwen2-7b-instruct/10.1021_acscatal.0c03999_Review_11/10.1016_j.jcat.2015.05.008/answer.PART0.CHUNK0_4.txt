3.1.1.1. CO adsorption. The adsorption of carbon monoxide at low temperatures results in the appearance of carbonyl bands that are shifted to higher energy compared to the CO stretching mode of the free CO molecule at 2143 cm1 due to the formation of r-donor bonds via the carbon atom of the CO molecule to coordi- natively unsaturated surface cations [9].

3.1.1.2. Methane adsorption. The IR spectrum of the free CH4 molecule is characterized by the triply degenerate antisymmetric stretching mode m3 at 3020 cm1 and the twofold degenerate HCH deformation mode m4 at 1306 cm1 [1719]. The infrared spectrum of CH4 adsorbed at 77 K on C-MgO (Fig. 5, red line) shows bands at 3003, 2896, and 2827 cm1 in the region of CH stretching vibrations and a band at 1304 cm1 in the region of deformation vibrations. 

3.1.1.1. CO adsorption. Bands arising below 2000 cm1 are attributed to carbonite anions or similar polymeric structures reflecting the strong basic character of the MgO surface [12,13].

在低温下的CO吸附显示出碳氧键形成后，羰基带的能量升高，与自由CO分子的拉伸模式相比，这是由于CO分子中的碳原子与表面配位不饱和离子形成的r供体键。甲烷吸附谱显示3003、2896和2827 cm1区域的CH拉伸振动带以及1304 cm1区域的变形振动带。在2000 cm1以下，该谱带被归因于碳酸根离子或类似的聚合结构，反映了MgO表面的强碱性特征。
