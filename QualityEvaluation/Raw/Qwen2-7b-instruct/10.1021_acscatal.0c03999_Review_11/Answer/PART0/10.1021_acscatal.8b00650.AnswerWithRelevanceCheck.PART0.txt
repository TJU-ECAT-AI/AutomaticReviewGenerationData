          Different halogen-assisted techniques for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene have been examined. Halogen-mediated dehydrogenation entails the direct removal of hydrogen from alkane molecules under certain conditions. Oxyhalogenation integrates the application of halogens and oxygen to boost dehydrogenation effectiveness. Molten metal halide salt methodologies entail the utilization of molten salts containing metal halides as a reaction medium. In these processes, propane demonstrates notably different reactivity compared to other alkanes such as methane and ethane, due to its specific molecular structure and interaction with the catalyst.
