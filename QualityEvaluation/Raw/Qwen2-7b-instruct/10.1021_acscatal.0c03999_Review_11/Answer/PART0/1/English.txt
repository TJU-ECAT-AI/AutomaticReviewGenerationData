Reactions of Molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2 are relevant to halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propene. Typically, this process involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are then oxidized to alkenes. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation provides benefits over traditional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. Oxyhalogenation refers to the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, leading to the formation of an alkene. Molten metal halide salt approaches employ a molten salt bath with a halide ion as the oxidant. Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation is notably higher than that of methane and ethane because of its larger size and more intricate interactions with halogen species.

The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The results showed that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst outperformed the sulfided catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity. Sulfiding the catalyst did not enhance its activity or selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, when utilizing SO2, provided an alternative solution to address the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context. However, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 towards propylene might be due to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals as catalysts in the presence of HCl. This process contrasts significantly with the reactivity of propane compared to other alkanes like methane and ethane.

Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In ODH, propane is mixed with oxygen or carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, aiming for selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (like iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed, with the appropriate catalyst ensuring selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction. In halogen-assisted processes, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation reaction is instead reacted with a halogen to form a halogen hydride. The halogen is recovered through a Deacon-like reaction, which allows the regeneration of the original halogen atom. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation, oxygen addition, and halogen reaction result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Molten salt methods have been explored as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions due to their high heat capacity, heat conductivity, and solvent properties. However, the corrosiveness of molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides presents a significant challenge for commercial applications, particularly concerning the cost of corrosion-resistant equipment.
