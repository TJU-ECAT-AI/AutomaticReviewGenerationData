In ODH, propane is mixed with oxygen or carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, aiming for selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (like iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed, with the appropriate catalyst ensuring selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction. In halogen-assisted processes, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation reaction is instead reacted with a halogen to form a halogen hydride. The halogen is recovered through a Deacon-like reaction, which allows the regeneration of the original halogen atom. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation, oxygen addition, and halogen reaction result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Molten salt methods have been explored as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions due to their high heat capacity, heat conductivity, and solvent properties.

Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation provides benefits over traditional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. Oxyhalogenation refers to the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, leading to the formation of an alkene. Molten metal halide salt approaches employ a molten salt bath with a halide ion as the oxidant.
