Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed, with the appropriate catalyst ensuring selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction.

The halogen is recovered through a Deacon-like reaction, which allows the regeneration of the original halogen atom. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation, oxygen addition, and halogen reaction result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

In ODH, propane is mixed with oxygen or carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, aiming for selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (like iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed, with the appropriate catalyst ensuring selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction. In halogen-assisted processes, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation reaction is instead reacted with a halogen to form a halogen hydride. The halogen is recovered through a Deacon-like reaction, which allows the regeneration of the original halogen atom. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation, oxygen addition, and halogen reaction result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Molten salt methods have been explored as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions due to their high heat capacity, heat conductivity, and solvent properties. However, the corrosiveness of molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides presents a significant challenge for commercial applications, particularly concerning the cost of corrosion-resistant equipment.", "Chinese": "用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的不同卤素辅助方法包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐途径。在氧化脱氢（ODH）中，丙烷与氧气或二氧化碳在催化剂的存在下混合，旨在与脱氢过程产生的氢气进行选择性反应。卤素辅助方法涉及使用卤素原子（如碘）来介导丙烷的氧化脱氢化。氧化脱氢通常需要将氧气或二氧化碳添加到原料中，合适的催化剂确保与脱氢反应产生的氢气进行选择性反应。在卤素辅助过程中，脱氢反应产生的氢气与卤素反应形成卤化氢。通过类似于Deacon的反应，卤素可以从卤化氢中回收，允许再生原卤素原子。脱氢反应、氧气添加和卤素反应的组合导致了丙烷的氧化脱氢化为丙烯。熔融盐方法由于其高热容量、热传导性和溶剂性质而被用作氧化反应的催化剂或促进剂。然而，熔融盐、卤素和卤化氢的腐蚀性构成了商业应用的重大挑战，特别是对于耐腐蚀设备成本的考虑。", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1"},
