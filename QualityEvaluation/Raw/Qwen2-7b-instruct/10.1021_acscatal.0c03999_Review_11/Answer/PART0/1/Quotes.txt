          [2] "The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is a key process for producing propene."
          [3] "This process typically involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are subsequently oxidized to alkenes."
          [4] "Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkanes offers advantages over conventional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species."
          [5] "Oxyhalogenation involves the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, resulting in the formation of an alkene."
          [6] "Molten metal halide salt approaches utilize a molten salt bath containing a halide ion as the oxidant."
          [7] "Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation is significantly higher than that of methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex interactions with halogen species."

          [3] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."

          [7] "Third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."
          [8] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

[1] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction (1)."

          [9] "Unfortunately, molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides are corrosive and this is a serious concern for commercial applications of molten salts or of HM-ODH."
          [10] "The main impediment is the cost of corrosion resistant equipment."

          [2] "The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane."

[1] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction (1)."

          [3] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2 according to ${\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{X}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{2HX}}$."

          [7] "Molten salts have high heat capacity and heat conductivity [12, 2427] which is helpful in preventing hot spots in oxidation reactions."
          [8] "They are also good solvents, so it is easy to dope them to modify their catalytic chemistry."
          [9] "Unfortunately, molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides are corrosive and this is a serious concern for commercial applications of molten salts or of HM-ODH."

          [2] "The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is a key process for producing propene."
          [3] "This process typically involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are subsequently oxidized to alkenes."
          [4] "Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkanes offers advantages over conventional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species."

          [7] "Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation is significantly higher than that of methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex interactions with halogen species."

          [3] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."
          [4] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
