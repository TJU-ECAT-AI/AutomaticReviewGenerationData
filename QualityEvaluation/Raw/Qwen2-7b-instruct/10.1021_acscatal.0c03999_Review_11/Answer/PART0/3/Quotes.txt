          [6] "When molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is used as a source of I2, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid and produces sufficient I2 so that addition of I2 to the feed does not increase the propylene yield."
          [7] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield.
