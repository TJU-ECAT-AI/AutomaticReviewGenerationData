Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the reaction of HI with propyl iodide to make propane and I2, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to make propyl iodide.\"\n          [8] \"In the present experiments O2 was introduced in the feed (with propane) and HI was produced as the reaction proceeded along the reactor. The ratio of oxygen to HI is too high in the first half of the reactor and too low in the second half. The reason for high alkene yields when molten LiI is used is likely to be gas-phase I2-mediated ODH using iodine sourced from the salt.\"", "English": "The study focuses on the high yield of propylene production via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using iodine (I2) as a catalyst. Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated in-situ from molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). High yields of propylene are achieved by utilizing iodine either produced internally from LiI or added as a gas to the propane-oxygen feed. These two methods provided comparable yields, surpassing those obtained through ODH on solid catalysts or industrial dehydrogenation processes without oxygen. In the gas phase, increasing the oxygen concentration enhances propane conversion, with the highest propylene yield occurring when the propane-to-oxygen ratio is 1:0.5, aligning with the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O. When molten lithium iodide or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is utilized as a source of iodine, the rapid reaction of oxygen with LiI generates sufficient iodine, ensuring that the addition of iodine to the feed does not elevate the propylene yield. The high rate of oxygen consumption by hydrogen iodide (HI) is hypothesized to be the primary factor driving the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the swift consumption of HI by oxygen also hinders the reactions of HI with propyl iodide to form propane and iodine, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to generate propyl iodide. In the current experiments, oxygen was introduced into the feed along with propane, while HI was synthesized as the reaction progressed through the reactor. The oxygen-to-HI ratio was excessively high in the initial half of the reactor and insufficient in the latter half. The high yields of alkene products when using molten lithium iodide are attributed to gas-phase I2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation utilizing iodine sourced directly from the salt.", "Chinese": "本研究专注于通过使用碘（I2）作为催化剂的氧化脱氢（ODH）来实现高产率的丙烯生产。碘可以作为气体引入丙烷-氧气混合物中，或者从熔融锂碘（LiI）或熔融LiI与锂氢氧化物（LiOH）的混合物中内部产生。通过利用从LiI内部产生或作为气体添加到丙烷-氧气流中的碘，实现了高产率的丙烯生产。这两种方法提供的产率相当，超过了在固态催化剂上进行ODH或在无氧条件下进行工业脱氢化过程的产率。在气相中，增加氧气浓度可以提高丙烷转化率，最高产率出现在丙烷与氧气摩尔比为1:0.5时，这与反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O的化学计量相匹配。当使用熔融锂碘或熔融LiI与LiOH的混合物作为碘源时，快速的氧气与LiI反应产生了足够的碘，因此向流体中添加碘不会增加丙烯产率。氧气与氢碘酸（HI）的快速消耗被认为是高产率的主要原因。氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了烃类的氧化，同时氧气对HI的快速消耗也阻止了HI与丙基碘反应生成丙烷和碘，以及HI与丙烯反应生成丙基碘。在当前的实验中，氧气与丙烷一起引入流体中，同时HI在反应沿反应器进展时产生。氧气与HI的比率在反应器的前半部分过高，在后半部分过低。使用熔融锂碘时获得高烯烃产率的原因可能是气相I2介导的氧化脱氢，利用直接从盐中获取的碘。", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1"},
