Different halogen-assisted techniques for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene have been examined. Halogen-mediated dehydrogenation entails the direct removal of hydrogen from alkane molecules under certain conditions. Oxyhalogenation integrates the application of halogens and oxygen to boost dehydrogenation effectiveness. Molten metal halide salt methodologies entail the utilization of molten salts containing metal halides as a reaction medium. In these processes, propane demonstrates notably different reactivity compared to other alkanes such as methane and ethane, due to its specific molecular structure and interaction with the catalyst.

The study focuses on the high yield of propylene production via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using iodine (I2) as a catalyst. Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated in-situ from molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). High yields of propylene are achieved by utilizing iodine either produced internally from LiI or added as a gas to the propane-oxygen feed. These two methods provided comparable yields, surpassing those obtained through ODH on solid catalysts or industrial dehydrogenation processes without oxygen. In the gas phase, increasing the oxygen concentration enhances propane conversion, with the highest propylene yield occurring when the propane-to-oxygen ratio is 1:0.5, aligning with the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O. When molten lithium iodide or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is utilized as a source of iodine, the rapid reaction of oxygen with LiI generates sufficient iodine, ensuring that the addition of iodine to the feed does not elevate the propylene yield. The high rate of oxygen consumption by hydrogen iodide (HI) is hypothesized to be the primary factor driving the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the swift consumption of HI by oxygen also hinders the reactions of HI with propyl iodide to form propane and iodine, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to generate propyl iodide. In the current experiments, oxygen was introduced into the feed along with propane, while HI was synthesized as the reaction progressed through the reactor. The oxygen-to-HI ratio was excessively high in the initial half of the reactor and insufficient in the latter half. The high yields of alkene products when using molten lithium iodide are attributed to gas-phase I2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation utilizing iodine sourced directly from the salt.
