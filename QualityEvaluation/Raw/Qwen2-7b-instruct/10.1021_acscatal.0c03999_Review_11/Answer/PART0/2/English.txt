Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In these processes, a halogen atom acts as a mediator to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen or its compounds to promote the reaction, while oxyhalogenation involves an alkane reacting with a halogenated oxygen compound. Molten metal halide salt approaches use molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its specific chemical structure. Specific reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of catalysts tailored to each method.

The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The findings indicated that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst provided some benefits over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, particularly in high temperature operations where a notable increase in selectivity per pass was observed. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supported the notion that the oxidative dehydrogenation process might involve the oxidation of propylene by SO2 to produce water and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the study highlighted that the use of SO2 in the reaction mixture increased the conversion of propane but led to a lower selectivity towards propylene compared to using pure propane feed.

Propylene production via the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous iodine (I2) acting as a gas-phase catalyst was studied. Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated when propane and oxygen come into contact with molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). In both experimental setups, a single-pass propylene yield of 64% was achieved at 500°C and a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm. The primary function of iodine is to initiate chain reactions that lead to the formation of a propyl iodide intermediate, which subsequently decomposes to produce propylene. The study examines the gas phase reaction of propane with oxygen and iodine, as well as the interaction of propane and oxygen with molten lithium iodide. The objective is to maximize propylene yield and elucidate certain aspects of the reaction mechanism. An earlier approach involved combining an alkane mixture with oxygen and molten lithium iodide to facilitate the reaction. When lithium iodide reacts with oxygen, it produces iodine, which then undergoes a gas-phase reaction following the formal scheme (2)(4). Iodine-mediated chemistry in the presence of oxygen has the potential to significantly enhance the conversion of alkanes to alkenes. The utilization of a molten salt might seem unconventional, yet extensive research has been conducted over the years into its application as a catalyst or promoter [812, 1323].
