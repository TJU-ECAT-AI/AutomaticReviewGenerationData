          [7] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI."

          [10] "The use of a molten salt may appear unusual, but there has been quite a bit of work over years exploring the use of molten salts as catalysts [812] or as promoters [1323]."

          [6] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes due to its specific chemical structure."

[1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/ALOs catalysts."
          [3] "Sulfiding Pd/Al2O3 did not, therefore, improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
          [4] "The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
          [5] "In a few experiments coke deposited on chroma-alumina was measured and it averaged 2-4% of the propane converted compared with less than 1% for Pd/A1203 catalyst."

[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."
          [2] "I2 is either introduced as a gas in the mixture of propane and oxygen, or it is produced when propane and oxygen come in contact with molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."
