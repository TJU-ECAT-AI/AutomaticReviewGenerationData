Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated when propane and oxygen come into contact with molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). In both experimental setups, a single-pass propylene yield of 64% was achieved at 500°C and a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm. The primary function of iodine is to initiate chain reactions that lead to the formation of a propyl iodide intermediate, which subsequently decomposes to produce propylene. The study examines the gas phase reaction of propane with oxygen and iodine, as well as the interaction of propane and oxygen with molten lithium iodide. The objective is to maximize propylene yield and elucidate certain aspects of the reaction mechanism. An earlier approach involved combining an alkane mixture with oxygen and molten lithium iodide to facilitate the reaction. When lithium iodide reacts with oxygen, it produces iodine, which then undergoes a gas-phase reaction following the formal scheme (2)(4). Iodine-mediated chemistry in the presence of oxygen has the potential to significantly enhance the conversion of alkanes to alkenes. The utilization of a molten salt might seem unconventional, yet extensive research has been conducted over the years into its application as a catalyst or promoter [812, 1323].", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1"},
