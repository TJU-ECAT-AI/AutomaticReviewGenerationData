        Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation is significantly higher than that of methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex interactions with halogen species. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. ODH involves adding oxygen or CO2 to the feed, with the hydrogen produced reacting selectively with the appropriate catalyst. Halogen-assisted methods use halogen atoms to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation process, offering advantages over conventional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. In oxyhalogenation, an alkane reacts with an oxyhalide to form an alkene, while molten metal halide salt approaches utilize a molten salt bath containing a halide ion as the oxidant. The unique reactivity of propane in these processes is attributed to its larger size and complex interactions with halogen species, making it more reactive compared to smaller alkanes like methane and ethane.
