Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation (PDH) represent an innovative approach in the field of chemical engineering and catalysis research, aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a key feedstock for the production of polymers and other petrochemical products. The comparative analysis of these methods reveals a spectrum of strategies that differ significantly in their selectivity, efficiency, and environmental impact. Various approaches, such as homogeneous catalysts with halogen additives, heterogeneous catalysts incorporating halides, and plasma-based PDH, have been explored to optimize the conversion process. Each method requires careful consideration of reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst, to achieve high selectivity towards propylene over byproducts like carbon monoxide or hydrogen. Propane's unique reactivity plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of these methods; its ability to undergo dehydrogenation reactions under specific conditions is harnessed differently across the analyzed techniques. The comparative study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between propane's chemical properties and the operational parameters of each method to guide the development of more sustainable and efficient PDH processes. This comparative analysis not only aids in the selection of the most suitable technique for industrial applications but also drives the advancement of catalyst design and process optimization in the broader context of chemical conversion technologies.
