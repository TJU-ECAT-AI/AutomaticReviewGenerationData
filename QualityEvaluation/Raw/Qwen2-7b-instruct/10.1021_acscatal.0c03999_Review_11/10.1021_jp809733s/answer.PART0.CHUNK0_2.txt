[1] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[2] "The introduction of Cr ions in the framework of dealuminated SiBEA zeolite evidenced by XRD generates Brnsted acidic sites as shown by FTIR of pyridine used as molecular probe."
[3] "In CrxSiBEA as prepared, chromium is mainly present as octahedral Cr(III) and in calcined CrxSiBEA (773 K, 3 h, flowing air) as distorted tetrahedral Cr(VI), as evidenced by DR UVvis, TPR, and XPS."
[4] "Isolated distorted tetrahedral Cr sites present in activated CrxSiBEA are responsible for their catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, performed in the presence of air or N2O."
[5] "The presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with oxidation state lower than (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA is essential for maintaining a high selectivity."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involve different mechanisms and conditions:

1. **Dehydrogenation with Halogens**: This method uses halogenated solvents or halogen-containing catalysts to dehydrogenate propane. The reaction conditions typically involve high temperatures and pressures, along with the presence of a halogen compound. The halogen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the alkyl groups of propane, leading to dehydrogenation. The reactivity of propane in this process is influenced by the halogen's electron-withdrawing ability, which can stabilize the carbocation intermediates formed during dehydrogenation. 

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH)**: In this process, propane is oxidized to propene using oxygen as the oxidant. The reaction conditions often include elevated temperatures and pressures, and sometimes a catalyst. The presence of oxygen introduces additional activation steps, requiring more energy for the formation of the propene product compared to dehydrogenation with halogens. Propane's reactivity in ODH is influenced by the oxidative conditions, which can affect the stability of intermediates and the rate of dehydrogenation.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This refers to the use of halogen-containing oxidants, such as bromine or iodine, in the presence of oxygen to dehydrogenate propane. The reaction conditions are similar to those in oxidative dehydrogenation but may involve specific halogen compounds. The reactivity of propane is influenced by the combined effect of oxygen and the halogen, leading to a different set of reaction pathways compared to pure oxidative or halogen-assisted dehydrogenation.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: This method utilizes molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. The conditions are typically high temperatures, allowing for the dissolution of the alkane in the molten salt. Propane's reactivity in this process is influenced by the solubility parameters and the kinetic properties of the molten salt, which can affect the rate of dehydrogenation and the selectivity towards propene.

Propane's reactivity differs significantly from other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger size and the presence of a larger alkyl group. This leads to differences in reaction rates, activation energies, and the stability of intermediates. Larger alkyl groups require more energy to break the C-H bonds, affecting the overall reactivity and selectivity towards the desired product. Additionally, the electronic effects of the alkyl group can influence the reactivity in halogen-assisted and oxidative dehydrogenation processes, leading to distinct reaction profiles compared to smaller alkanes like methane and ethane.

描述并比较使用卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的不同方法，包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐途径。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应活性存在显著差异。

使用卤素辅助的方法选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯涉及不同的机制和条件：

1. **卤素脱氢**：这种方法使用卤素溶剂或含卤素催化剂来脱氢丙烷。反应条件通常包括高温和高压，同时含有卤素化合物。卤素作为亲核试剂，攻击丙烷的烷基部分，导致脱氢。丙烷在该过程中通过卤素的电子吸电子能力稳定中间体碳正离子，从而影响其反应活性。

2. **氧化脱氢（ODH）**：在这个过程中，丙烷在氧气的存在下被氧化为丙烯。反应条件通常包括较高温度和压力，有时需要催化剂。氧气引入额外的激活步骤，需要更多的能量来形成丙烯产品，与单纯的卤素辅助脱氢相比。丙烷在ODH过程中的反应活性受氧化条件的影响，这些条件可以影响中间体的稳定性及其脱氢速率。

3. **氧卤化**：这指的是在氧气的存在下使用含卤素氧化剂（如溴或碘）来脱氢丙烷。反应条件类似于氧化脱氢，但可能涉及特定的卤素化合物。丙烷的反应活性受结合氧和卤素的共同影响，导致与纯氧化或卤素辅助脱氢不同的反应路径。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐途径**：这种方法利用熔融盐中含金属卤化物作为反应介质。条件通常是高温，允许烷烃溶解在熔融盐中。丙烷在这一过程中的反应活性受溶剂参数和熔融盐的动力学特性的影响，这可以影响脱氢速率和产物选择性。

丙烷与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应活性存在显著差异，主要是由于其较大的尺寸和较大的烷基团。这导致反应速率、活化能和中间体稳定性存在差异。较大的烷基团需要更多的能量来断裂C-H键，从而影响整体反应活性和产物选择性。此外，烷基团的电子效应可以影响卤素辅助和氧化脱氢过程的反应活性，导致与较小烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的特定反应轮廓不同。
