The document discusses the development of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, focusing on the use of chromium (Cr) in silico-bea zeolites. Chromium is shown to form isolated tetrahedral sites with an oxidation state lower than VI, which are crucial for maintaining high selectivity towards propene in the presence of air or nitrogen oxide (N2O). Higher chromium content increases propane conversion, with the highest selectivity for 1.0 wt % Cr. However, the presence of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites reduces selectivity at 3.4 wt %. Propane conversion is significantly lower with N2O as an oxidant compared to air, but the selectivity towards propene is higher. The differences in propane's reactivity across these processes, compared to methane and ethane, are attributed to the specific interactions of the alkanes with the catalysts' active sites.

文档讨论了用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）催化剂的发展，重点是铬（Cr）在硅酸乙醇铝硅酸盐（SiBEA）沸石中的应用。研究表明，形成氧化态低于VI的孤立四面体点对保持空气或氮氧化物（N2O）存在的高选择性至关重要。随着Cr含量的增加，丙烷转化率提高，而1.0 wt％Cr时的选择性最高。然而，在3.4 wt％的样品中，存在额外框架的八面体Cr点会降低选择性。使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率显著降低，但相对于空气而言，丙烯的选择性更高。这些过程与甲烷和乙烷的反应活性差异归因于烷烃与催化剂活性位点的特定相互作用。
