<p>In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated.</p>
<p>The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10).</p>
<p>When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease.</p>
<p>The low propane conversion may originate from a very low concentration of isolated octahedral Cr(III) present in activated CrxSiBEA.</p>
<p>It seems, that the presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites is essential for maintaining high selectivity toward propene, which is in line with earlier data on Cr on supported mesoporous MCM-41 silica.</p>

1. The study investigates the effect of chromium content and environment on the catalytic activity of CrxSiBEA zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or N2O as oxidants. 

2. The sample with 0.2 wt% chromium exhibits very low propane conversion, primarily forming COx products.

3. Increasing the chromium content to 1.0 wt% leads to a notable increase in propane conversion, achieving approximately 50% selectivity towards propene. Further increasing the chromium content to 3.4 wt% results in a slight decrease in propene selectivity.

4. The low propane conversion observed might stem from a scarcity of isolated octahedral Cr(III) ions in the activated CrxSiBEA.

5. The presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites is crucial for maintaining high propene selectivity, aligning with previous findings on Cr catalysts supported on mesoporous MCM-41 silica.

1. 该研究通过X射线衍射、傅里叶变换红外光谱、紫外可见吸收光谱、温度程序还原、X射线光电子能谱和电子顺磁共振等方法，对CrxSiBEA催化剂进行表征，并研究了铬含量和环境对其在空气或N2O存在下丙烷氧化脱氢作用的影响。

2. 含有0.2 wt%铬的样品显示出极低的丙烷转化率，主要形成COx产物。

3. 随着铬含量增加至1.0 wt%，丙烷转化率显著提高，丙烯选择性达到约50%。进一步增加铬含量至3.4 wt%导致丙烯选择性略有下降。

4. 观察到的低丙烷转化率可能源于激活的CrxSiBEA中孤立八面体Cr(III)离子的稀缺。

5. 存在孤立四面体Cr位点对于保持高丙烯选择性至关重要，这与之前在介孔MCM-41硅基质上支持的Cr催化剂的研究结果一致。
