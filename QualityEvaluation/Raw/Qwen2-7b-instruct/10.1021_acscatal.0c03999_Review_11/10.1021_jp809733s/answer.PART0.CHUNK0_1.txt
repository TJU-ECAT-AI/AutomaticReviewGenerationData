[1] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[2] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites."
[3] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."
[4] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

1. The research investigates the effect of chromium content and its environment on the catalytic activity of CrxSiBEA zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or N2O as oxidants. The study characterizes the zeolites through XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR techniques.

2. In the presence of air, the conversion of propane increases with the chromium content, reaching its peak at 1.0 wt % of Cr. The selectivity towards propene is highest at this concentration. The decrease in selectivity at 3.4 wt % Cr might be due to the presence of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites.

3. When using N2O as an oxidant, the propane conversion is significantly lower compared to using air, but it increases with both the chromium content and the reaction temperature. 

4. Propene selectivity is higher in the presence of N2O than with air. This is likely attributed to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of the surface oxygen generated in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 研究通过XRD、FTIR、DR UVvis、TPR、XPS和EPR等技术对CrxSiBEA沸石的催化活性进行了研究，考察了空气或N2O作为氧化剂时，铬含量和其环境对其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的影响。

2. 在使用空气作为氧化剂的情况下，随着铬含量的增加，丙烷的转化率提高，达到最高点为1.0 wt %的Cr。对于丙烯的选择性在这一浓度下达到峰值。在3.4 wt % Cr的情况下，选择性的下降可能与存在额外框架的八面体Cr位点有关。

3. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，与使用空气相比，丙烷的转化率显著降低，但随铬含量和反应温度的增加而提高。

4. 在N2O存在的条件下，丙烯的选择性高于使用空气的情况。这可能归因于反应条件下铬的还原程度以及N2O或空气中表面氧的性质。
