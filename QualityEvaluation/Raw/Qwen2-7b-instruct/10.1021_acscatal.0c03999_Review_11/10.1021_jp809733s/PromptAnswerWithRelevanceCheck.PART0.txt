1. The study investigates the effect of chromium content and environment on the catalytic activity of CrxSiBEA zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or N2O as oxidants. 

2. The sample with 0.2 wt% chromium exhibits very low propane conversion, primarily forming COx products.

3. Increasing the chromium content to 1.0 wt% leads to a notable increase in propane conversion, achieving approximately 50% selectivity towards propene. Further increasing the chromium content to 3.4 wt% results in a slight decrease in propene selectivity.

4. The low propane conversion observed might stem from a scarcity of isolated octahedral Cr(III) ions in the activated CrxSiBEA.

5. The presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites is crucial for maintaining high propene selectivity, aligning with previous findings on Cr catalysts supported on mesoporous MCM-41 silica.

1. 该研究通过X射线衍射、傅里叶变换红外光谱、紫外可见吸收光谱、温度程序还原、X射线光电子能谱和电子顺磁共振等方法，对CrxSiBEA催化剂进行表征，并研究了铬含量和环境对其在空气或N2O存在下丙烷氧化脱氢作用的影响。

2. 含有0.2 wt%铬的样品显示出极低的丙烷转化率，主要形成COx产物。

3. 随着铬含量增加至1.0 wt%，丙烷转化率显著提高，丙烯选择性达到约50%。进一步增加铬含量至3.4 wt%导致丙烯选择性略有下降。

4. 观察到的低丙烷转化率可能源于激活的CrxSiBEA中孤立八面体Cr(III)离子的稀缺。

5. 存在孤立四面体Cr位点对于保持高丙烯选择性至关重要，这与之前在介孔MCM-41硅基质上支持的Cr催化剂的研究结果一致。

[1] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[2] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites."
[3] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."
[4] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

1. The research investigates the effect of chromium content and its environment on the catalytic activity of CrxSiBEA zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or N2O as oxidants. The study characterizes the zeolites through XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR techniques.

2. In the presence of air, the conversion of propane increases with the chromium content, reaching its peak at 1.0 wt % of Cr. The selectivity towards propene is highest at this concentration. The decrease in selectivity at 3.4 wt % Cr might be due to the presence of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites.

3. When using N2O as an oxidant, the propane conversion is significantly lower compared to using air, but it increases with both the chromium content and the reaction temperature. 

4. Propene selectivity is higher in the presence of N2O than with air. This is likely attributed to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of the surface oxygen generated in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 研究通过XRD、FTIR、DR UVvis、TPR、XPS和EPR等技术对CrxSiBEA沸石的催化活性进行了研究，考察了空气或N2O作为氧化剂时，铬含量和其环境对其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的影响。

2. 在使用空气作为氧化剂的情况下，随着铬含量的增加，丙烷的转化率提高，达到最高点为1.0 wt %的Cr。对于丙烯的选择性在这一浓度下达到峰值。在3.4 wt % Cr的情况下，选择性的下降可能与存在额外框架的八面体Cr位点有关。

3. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，与使用空气相比，丙烷的转化率显著降低，但随铬含量和反应温度的增加而提高。

4. 在N2O存在的条件下，丙烯的选择性高于使用空气的情况。这可能归因于反应条件下铬的还原程度以及N2O或空气中表面氧的性质。

The study investigates the influence of chromium content and its environment on the catalytic activity of CrxSiBEA zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or nitrogen oxide (N2O) as oxidants. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques are employed for characterizing these zeolites. The results indicate that the presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI on activated CrxSiBEA zeolites is crucial for maintaining high selectivity in ODH of propane. The selectivity towards propene increases with the chromium content in the presence of air, reaching its peak at 1.0 wt % of Cr. In the presence of N2O, the selectivity towards propene is higher than with air, possibly due to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of the surface oxygen formed under air or N2O conditions.

这项研究探讨了铬含量及其环境对CrxSiBEA沸石在空气或氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）催化活性的影响。采用X射线衍射（XRD）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、差分反射紫外可见光谱（DR UVvis）、温度程序化还原（TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和电子顺磁共振（EPR）等技术对这些沸石进行表征。结果表明，在激活的CrxSiBEA沸石中，存在氧化状态低于VI的孤立四面体铬位点对于维持高选择性丙烷氧化脱氢至关重要。在空气存在下，随着铬含量的增加，丙烯的选择性提高，达到1.0 wt % Cr时达到峰值。在N2O存在下，丙烯的选择性高于空气，这可能与反应条件下铬的还原程度以及在空气或N2O条件下表面氧的性质有关。

The document discusses several methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using halogen-assisted techniques, oxyhalogenation, molten metal halide salts, and the use of specific zeolites as catalysts. The ODH process uses air or nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as oxidants. The document highlights the use of zeolites, particularly BEA, ZSM-5, mordenite, and faujasite, which show varying levels of activity in the ODH of propane. The BEA and ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrate comparable activity, while mordenite and faujasite are less active and primarily yield COx. The two-step postsynthesis method, which involves removing aluminum from BEA zeolite and subsequently introducing chromium, is effective in preparing active and selective catalysts. The document also mentions the importance of chromium's coordination and oxidation state on the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by its ability to change its coordination state during activation and reaction. The nature and environment of chromium in the catalyst influence its activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with air or N2O.

文档讨论了几种用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的方法，包括使用卤素辅助技术的氧化脱氢（ODH）、氧卤化、熔融金属卤化盐方法以及特定沸石作为催化剂的应用。ODH过程使用空气或氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂。文档强调了使用沸石，特别是BEA、ZSM-5、莫尔登石和方石英石，在丙烷的ODH中表现出不同的活性。BEA和ZSM-5沸石显示出了相似的活性，而莫尔登石和方石英石活性较低，主要生成COx。两步后合成方法，涉及从BEA沸石去除铝并随后引入铬，是有效制备活性和选择性催化剂的关键。文档还提到，铬在催化剂中的配位状态和氧化状态对其性能的影响，特别是在激活和反应过程中，其能力改变其配位状态。催化剂中铬的存在及其环境影响其在使用空气或N2O的ODH中的活性和选择性。

1. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger size and stronger C-H bonds, which require more energy to break. 

2. In oxidative dehydrogenation, propane is converted to propene using oxygen or a similar oxidant. The presence of a catalyst, such as a zeolite with isolated tetrahedral chromium sites, enhances the conversion and selectivity towards propene.

3. Oxyhalogenation involves the use of halogenated compounds as co-reactants. This method requires additional handling and safety considerations due to the toxicity and potential explosiveness of halogen compounds.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve using a molten salt bath containing metal halides. These processes can offer higher temperatures and pressures, potentially increasing conversion rates, but they also require specialized equipment and careful management of the molten salt.

5. The conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA catalysts increases with chromium content and reaction temperature. At a Cr content of 1.0 wt%, the selectivity towards propene is about 50%. Further increasing the Cr content to 3.4 wt% results in a slight decrease in selectivity.

6. The low conversion of propane in the presence of N2O is attributed to a low concentration of isolated octahedral chromium(III) sites. The presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites is essential for maintaining high selectivity towards propene, aligning with previous studies on supported mesoporous MCM-41 silica.

1. 不同的卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃显著不同，这是由于其较大的尺寸和更强的C-H键，需要更多的能量来断裂。

2. 在氧化脱氢中，丙烷使用氧气或类似氧化剂转化为丙烯。存在诸如沸石催化剂的隔离四面体铬(III)位点可以增强转化和向丙烯的选择性。

3. 氧卤化涉及使用卤化物作为共反应物。这种方法需要额外的处理和安全考虑，因为卤化物化合物具有毒性且可能存在爆炸风险。

4. 熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用包含金属卤化物的熔融盐浴。这些过程可能提供更高的温度和压力，从而提高转化率，但它们也需要专门的设备和对熔融盐的精心管理。

5. 在激活的CrxSiBEA催化剂上丙烷的转化随着铬含量和反应温度的增加而增加。当铬含量为1.0 wt％时，丙烯的选择性约为50％。进一步将铬含量增加到3.4 wt％导致选择性略有下降。

6. 在N2O存在的情况下，丙烷的低转化归因于活性CrxSiBEA催化剂中孤立八面体铬(III)位点的低浓度。存在孤立四面体铬位点对于保持高丙烯选择性至关重要，这与之前关于支持的介孔MCM-41硅的研究结果一致。
