[1] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[2] "The presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with oxidation state lower than (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA is essential for maintaining a high selectivity."
[3] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr."
[4] "The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites."
[5] "The propane conversion is lower in the presence of N2O and reaches only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA."
[6] "In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air."

1. The study focuses on characterizing CrxSiBEA zeolites through various analytical techniques and investigating how the chromium content and its environment affect their catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using air or nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as oxidants.

2. Maintaining high selectivity in the ODH process requires the presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI on activated CrxSiBEA.

3. Increasing the chromium content leads to higher propane conversion when air is used as an oxidant.

4. The highest selectivity towards propene production is observed with a 1.0 wt% chromium content in the presence of air.

5. The slightly decreased selectivity towards propene for the 3.4 wt% chromium content sample is likely due to the presence of extra-framework octahedral chromium sites.

6. The propane conversion is significantly lower in the presence of N2O compared to air, reaching only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA. However, the selectivity towards propene is higher in the presence of N2O compared to air.

1. 本研究主要通过XRD、FTIR、DR UVvis、TPR、XPS和EPR等技术对CrxSiBEA沸石进行表征，并探讨铬含量及其环境对其在空气或氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢作用的影响。

2. 维持高选择性脱氢过程需要激活的CrxSiBEA中存在氧化状态低于VI的孤立四面体铬位点。

3. 增加铬含量导致空气作为氧化剂时的丙烷转化率提高。

4. 空气存在时，1.0 wt%的铬含量表现出最高的丙烯选择性。

5. 对于3.4 wt%的铬含量样本，丙烯选择性的轻微降低可能是由于额外框架的八面体铬位点的存在。

6. N2O存在下的丙烷转化率显著低于空气，仅在673 K达到3%。然而，在N2O存在下，丙烯的选择性高于空气。
