[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[5] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[6] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The document does not provide detailed descriptions or comparisons of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does mention that the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. It also states that the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. The document focuses on exploring the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over specific catalysts, such as H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is found to be the most appropriate catalyst due to its resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield.

文档没有提供各种卤素辅助方法对丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯的详细描述或比较，包括使用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物化以及熔融金属卤化盐方法。然而，它确实提到增加丙烯产量的传统方法并不令人满意。它还指出，开发更多合理的过程以提高丙烯产量是必要的。文档主要探讨了利用特定催化剂（如莫来石H型、ZSM-5型和SAPO-34型）进行C4-烯烃催化裂解以生产丙烯的可能性。发现H-ZSM-5沸石在抗失活能力和高丙烯产率方面是最合适的催化剂。
