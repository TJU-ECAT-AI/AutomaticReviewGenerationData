"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focuses on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefin using zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. These zeolites were synthesized through hydrothermal methods using different directing agents. The acid strength of the samples follows the order H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic tests follows the reverse order. Among these, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a smaller crystal size showed higher stability over a longer period compared to the H-ZSM-5 with a larger crystal size.

本研究关注C4-烯烃在H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34沸石上的催化裂解。这些沸石通过使用不同的导向剂进行水热合成。样品的酸强度按照顺序排列为：H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而在催化测试中的稳定性则相反。其中，小晶粒的H-ZSM-5沸石比大晶粒的H-ZSM-5沸石具有更长的时间稳定性。
