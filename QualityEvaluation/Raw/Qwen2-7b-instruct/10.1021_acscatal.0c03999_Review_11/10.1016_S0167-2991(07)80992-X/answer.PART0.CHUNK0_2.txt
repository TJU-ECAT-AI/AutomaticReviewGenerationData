"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
"One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins."

The document does not provide specific details on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites in catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins to produce propylene, indicating that the reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to the unique properties of the zeolite catalysts. For instance, H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the most appropriate catalyst for this purpose in terms of both resistance to deactivation and propylene yield. This suggests that the zeolite's acid strength, stability, and selectivity play crucial roles in the catalytic cracking process.

文档没有提供具体关于卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物或熔融金属卤化盐方法的细节。然而，它确实讨论了在炼油厂或化工厂中使用沸石催化裂解混合C4或更高碳数的烯烃来生产丙烯的可能性。这表明，由于沸石催化剂的独特性质，丙烷在这类过程中的反应性与其它烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）存在显著差异。例如，H-ZSM-5沸石被认为是最合适的催化剂，因为它在防止失活和丙烯产量方面表现出最佳性能。这表明，沸石的酸强度、稳定性和选择性在催化裂解过程中起着关键作用。
