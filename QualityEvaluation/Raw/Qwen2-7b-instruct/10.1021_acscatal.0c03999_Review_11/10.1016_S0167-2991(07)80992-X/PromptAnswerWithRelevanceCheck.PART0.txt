Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The document does not provide detailed descriptions or comparisons of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does mention that the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. It also states that the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. The document focuses on exploring the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over specific catalysts, such as H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is found to be the most appropriate catalyst due to its resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield.

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[7] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,"

The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. The naphtha steam cracking process produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, making it a costly route due to high capital investment and feedstock cost. Propylene generation in FCC units has a relatively low yield. Producing propylene from ethylene and butylenes through metathesis consumes high-value ethylene, making it unattractive. Therefore, developing more efficient processes with a high propylene yield is desirable. Zeolites, due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, are widely used in industrial processes. In this study, the possibility of producing propylene via catalytic cracking of C4-olefin using H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34 was explored. Among these, H-ZSM-5 zeolite is the most suitable catalyst for propylene production due to its high yield and resistance to deactivation.

传统的提高丙烯产量的方法并不令人满意。石脑油蒸汽裂解过程产生的乙烯是丙烯的两倍，这使得它成为由于高额的资本投资和原料成本而变得昂贵的过程。在FCC单元中产生丙烯的产量相对较低。通过乙烷和丁二烯的环化生产丙烯不吸引人，因为它会消耗作为主要原料的高价值乙烯。因此，开发更合理的、丙烯产量更高的过程是必要的。由于其出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，沸石在工业过程中被广泛使用。在这项研究中，探索了利用H-mordenite、H-ZSM-5和H-SAPO-34三种典型催化剂进行C4-烯烃催化裂解以生产丙烯的可能性。在这三种材料中，H-ZSM-5沸石是最合适的催化剂，因为它在抗失活和丙烯产率方面均表现出色。

"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
"One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins."

The document does not provide specific details on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites in catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins to produce propylene, indicating that the reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to the unique properties of the zeolite catalysts. For instance, H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the most appropriate catalyst for this purpose in terms of both resistance to deactivation and propylene yield. This suggests that the zeolite's acid strength, stability, and selectivity play crucial roles in the catalytic cracking process.

文档没有提供具体关于卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物或熔融金属卤化盐方法的细节。然而，它确实讨论了在炼油厂或化工厂中使用沸石催化裂解混合C4或更高碳数的烯烃来生产丙烯的可能性。这表明，由于沸石催化剂的独特性质，丙烷在这类过程中的反应性与其它烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）存在显著差异。例如，H-ZSM-5沸石被认为是最合适的催化剂，因为它在防止失活和丙烯产量方面表现出最佳性能。这表明，沸石的酸强度、稳定性和选择性在催化裂解过程中起着关键作用。

The study explores the use of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins. These zeolites were synthesized hydrothermally using different directing agents. The acid strength of the samples follows the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in catalytic tests follows the reverse order. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, especially with a smaller crystal size, proved to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking, yielding high amounts of propylene.
