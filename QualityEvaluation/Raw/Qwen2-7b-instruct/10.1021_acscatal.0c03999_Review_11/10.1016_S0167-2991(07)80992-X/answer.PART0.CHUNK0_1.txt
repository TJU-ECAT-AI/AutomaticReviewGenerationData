[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[7] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,"
[8] "Among these samples,the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. The naphtha steam cracking process produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, making it a costly route due to high capital investment and feedstock cost. Propylene generation in FCC units has a relatively low yield. Producing propylene from ethylene and butylenes through metathesis consumes high-value ethylene, making it unattractive. Therefore, developing more efficient processes with a high propylene yield is desirable. Zeolites, due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, are widely used in industrial processes. In this study, the possibility of producing propylene via catalytic cracking of C4-olefin using H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34 was explored. Among these, H-ZSM-5 zeolite is the most suitable catalyst for propylene production due to its high yield and resistance to deactivation.

传统的提高丙烯产量的方法并不令人满意。石脑油蒸汽裂解过程产生的乙烯是丙烯的两倍，这使得它成为由于高额的资本投资和原料成本而变得昂贵的过程。在FCC单元中产生丙烯的产量相对较低。通过乙烷和丁二烯的环化生产丙烯不吸引人，因为它会消耗作为主要原料的高价值乙烯。因此，开发更合理的、丙烯产量更高的过程是必要的。由于其出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，沸石在工业过程中被广泛使用。在这项研究中，探索了利用H-mordenite、H-ZSM-5和H-SAPO-34三种典型催化剂进行C4-烯烃催化裂解以生产丙烯的可能性。在这三种材料中，H-ZSM-5沸石是最合适的催化剂，因为它在抗失活和丙烯产率方面均表现出色。
