"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"G.-L. Zhaoa,b, J.-W Tenga, Z.-K Xie*a , W.-M Yanga, Q.-L Chena and Y. Tang*b"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study explores the use of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins. These zeolites were synthesized hydrothermally using different directing agents. The acid strength of the samples follows the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in catalytic tests follows the reverse order. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, especially with a smaller crystal size, proved to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking, yielding high amounts of propylene.

该研究探讨了使用沸石ZSM-5、莫尔登石和SAPO-34对C4烯烃的催化裂解。这些沸石通过使用不同的导向剂进行了水热合成。这些样品的酸强度遵循顺序：H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性遵循相反的顺序。H-ZSM-5沸石，特别是具有较小晶粒尺寸的，证明是C4烯烃裂解的最佳催化剂，能产生大量的丙烯。
