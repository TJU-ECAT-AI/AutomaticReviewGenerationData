5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29).

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity (Table 14), europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. 

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves direct reaction of propane with molecular halogens like X2. Oxidative dehydrogenation occurs in the presence of halogen and oxygen (X2 + O2). Propane oxyhalogenation involves oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, forming alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Molten metal halide salts like LiX can assist in oxidative dehydrogenation. The reaction conditions vary, with temperatures typically ranging from 300 to 700°C. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms, which can lead to successive oxidation in the case of propane but not in these other alkanes.

卤化辅助方法通过卤素协助选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯包括与卤素的脱氢，氧化脱氢，氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐催化脱氢。与卤素的直接反应涉及丙烷。在卤素和氧气（X2 + O2）的存在下发生氧化脱氢。氧卤化涉及氢卤酸的氧化与O2形成，形成烷基卤化物，烯烃和水。熔融金属卤化盐如LiX可以协助氧化脱氢。反应条件各不相同，温度通常在300至700°C之间。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）显著不同，这是由于丙烷中存在反应性的亚甲基氢原子，可能导致连续氧化，而在其他烷烃中则不会。
