5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29).

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%).

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of molecular halogens (X2) to remove hydrogen atoms from propane, resulting in propene formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes halogen (X2) in the presence of oxygen (O2). Oxyhalogenation, specifically propane oxyhalogenation, proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide (HX) with oxygen (O2), yielding alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation uses metal halide salts in a liquid state, facilitating the reaction between metal halides and oxygen to produce iodine, which initiates a radical chain reaction.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to differences in reactivity. For instance, propane contains reactive allylic hydrogen atoms that can lead to successive oxidation, affecting the selectivity towards propene. In oxyhalogenation, the alkane conversion can be enhanced due to gas-phase reactions, where highly reactive radical species are liberated from the catalyst surface and form desired and undesired products. In molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, the interplay between metal halide and metal oxide plays a crucial role in generating iodine for initiating a radical chain reaction.

These methods operate under specific conditions, such as temperatures ranging from 300 to 700°C, and require careful control of reactant ratios, catalyst selection, and operational parameters to achieve efficient propene production from propane.

卤化辅助方法通过卤素（X2）、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐催化脱氢来选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。卤素（X2）的脱氢涉及到从丙烷去除氢原子，生成丙烯。在卤素（X2）与氧气（O2）共存的情况下进行氧化脱氢。氧卤化，特别是丙烷氧卤化，通过氧化氢卤化物（HX）与氧气反应，产生卤代烷、烯烃和水。使用基于金属卤化物的熔融盐辅助氧化脱氢，通过金属卤化物与氧气反应生成碘，启动自由基链反应。

在这些过程中，丙烷的反应性与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷大不相同，主要是因为它们的反应性不同。例如，丙烷中含有反应性的亚甲基氢原子，可能导致连续氧化，影响丙烯的选择性。在氧卤化中，可以通过气相反应增强烷烃转化，其中从催化剂表面释放出高度活性的自由基物种，并形成所需和非所需的产品。在基于熔融金属卤化物的氧化脱氢中，金属卤化物与金属氧化物之间的相互作用起着关键作用，用于生成碘以启动自由基链反应。

这些方法在300至700°C的特定条件下运行，并需要精确控制反应物比例、催化剂选择和操作参数，以实现高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX.

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC. Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. The excellent performance in the case of EuOCl can be rationalized by the unique balance of its mild redox nature that enables alkane activation, minimizes gas-phase reaction by inhibiting the evolution of Cl2.

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved.

Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2) are utilized. 

Oxyhalogenation, specifically, involves the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, yielding alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretical efficiency reaches 100% in the presence of O2, but drops to 50% in halo-dehydrogenation due to the formation of HX. 

CeO2-based catalysts show high activity for hydrogen halide oxidation and alkane/alkene oxyhalogenation. Europium oxychloride (EuOCl) demonstrates superior selectivity for C3H6 (over 95% with 20% C3H8 conversion) compared to ceria (CeO2), thanks to its balanced redox nature enabling alkane activation with minimal gas-phase reactions and inhibited Cl2 evolution. 

Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 using a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C. Molten salt-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, utilizing metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2, allows for the dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons between 450 and 600°C, achieving a C3H6 yield of up to 70%.

卤化辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括与卤素的脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化物催化脱氢。条件范围广泛，从300至700°C不等，用于卤素介导途径。利用分子卤素（X2）、卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）、通过卤化物（HX + O2）进行丙烷氧卤化，以及锂X + O2辅助的氧化脱氢（熔融金属卤化物）。 

氧卤化涉及氢卤化物与O2的氧化，产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。在O2存在下理论效率可达100%，但在卤化脱氢中下降至50%，原因是形成HX。 

铈基催化剂显示出高活性，用于氢卤化物氧化和烷烃/烯烃氧卤化。铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）在丙烷氧氯化中的选择性超过95%（丙烷转化率为20%），与氧化铈相比，得益于其平衡的氧化还原性质，既能促进烷烃激活，又能最小化气相反应并抑制氯气生成。 

通过0.28%钌/二氧化钛催化剂进行丙烷卤化脱氢，在400°C时可实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择率。使用锂I、镉I2、锌I2和铅I2等金属碘化物的熔融盐催化脱氢允许在450至600°C之间对各种烃类进行脱氢，最高可达到70%的丙烯产率。

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves direct interaction of propane with halogen molecules at temperatures around 300 to 700°C. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen in the presence of halogens or halides. Oxyhalogenation specifically refers to the reaction of propane with oxygen and halogen, often in the presence of catalysts like CeO2. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve reactions of metal halides with oxygen under specific conditions to generate iodine, which initiates a radical chain reaction for dehydrogenation. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to differences in their chemical structures and reactivity towards halogen and oxygen species.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The conditions for each method vary:

1. **Dehydrogenation with Molecular Halogens**: This involves direct dehydrogenation of propane using halogen molecules (X2). It is typically carried out at temperatures between 300 and 700°C.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This process uses a combination of halogen and oxygen (X2 + O2) to oxidatively dehydrogenate propane. It also operates within the same temperature range as dehydrogenation with molecular halogens.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This method involves the oxidation of hydrogen halides with oxygen to produce alkyl halides, alkenes, and water. It is used to selectively convert propane into propene.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Assisted ODHP**: This approach uses molten salts containing metal halides (e.g., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, PbI2) to catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. It occurs at temperatures between 450 and 600°C.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the distinct reactivity profiles of these alkanes. The specific reactivity is influenced by factors such as the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propane, which can lead to successive oxidation compared to the more inert hydrogen atoms in methane and ethane.

In summary, each halogen-assisted method employs different conditions and mechanisms to selectively convert propane into propene. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired yield of propene, the reaction conditions, and the catalyst used.

卤化物辅助方法用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯包括与卤素分子（X2）的脱氢化、氧化脱氢化、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的ODHP。每种方法的条件有所不同：

1. **直接脱氢化**：此过程直接使用卤素分子（X2）进行丙烷脱氢。操作温度范围为300至700°C。

2. **氧化脱氢化**：此过程使用卤素和氧气（X2 + O2）的组合进行氧化脱氢化丙烷。操作温度范围与直接使用分子卤素相同。

3. **氧卤化**：此方法涉及通过氧气氧化氢卤化物产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。

4. **熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的ODHP**：此方法使用包含金属卤化物的熔融盐（例如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2、PbI2）来催化丙烷脱氢。在450至600°C之间发生反应。

这些过程中的丙烷反应性与其烷烃同系物如甲烷和乙烷的反应性显著不同，这归因于这些烷烃的独特反应性。特定的反应性受丙烷中存在活性烯丙基氢原子的影响，这可能导致与甲烷和乙烷中较不活泼的氢原子相比的后续氧化。

简而言之，每种卤化物辅助方法均采用不同的条件和机制来选择性地转化丙烷为丙烯。方法的选择取决于所需的丙烯产量、反应条件和所使用的催化剂等因素。
