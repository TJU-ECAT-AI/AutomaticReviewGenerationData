5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes.

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29).

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity (Table 14), europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC.

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15).

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The conditions for each method vary:

1. **Dehydrogenation with Molecular Halogens**: This involves direct dehydrogenation of propane using halogen molecules (X2). It is typically carried out at temperatures between 300 and 700°C.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This process uses a combination of halogen and oxygen (X2 + O2) to oxidatively dehydrogenate propane. It also operates within the same temperature range as dehydrogenation with molecular halogens.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This method involves the oxidation of hydrogen halides with oxygen to produce alkyl halides, alkenes, and water. It is used to selectively convert propane into propene.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Assisted ODHP**: This approach uses molten salts containing metal halides (e.g., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, PbI2) to catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. It occurs at temperatures between 450 and 600°C.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the distinct reactivity profiles of these alkanes. The specific reactivity is influenced by factors such as the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propane, which can lead to successive oxidation compared to the more inert hydrogen atoms in methane and ethane.

In summary, each halogen-assisted method employs different conditions and mechanisms to selectively convert propane into propene. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired yield of propene, the reaction conditions, and the catalyst used.

卤化物辅助方法用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯包括与卤素分子（X2）的脱氢化、氧化脱氢化、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的ODHP。每种方法的条件有所不同：

1. **直接脱氢化**：此过程直接使用卤素分子（X2）进行丙烷脱氢。操作温度范围为300至700°C。

2. **氧化脱氢化**：此过程使用卤素和氧气（X2 + O2）的组合进行氧化脱氢化丙烷。操作温度范围与直接使用分子卤素相同。

3. **氧卤化**：此方法涉及通过氧气氧化氢卤化物产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。

4. **熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的ODHP**：此方法使用包含金属卤化物的熔融盐（例如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2、PbI2）来催化丙烷脱氢。在450至600°C之间发生反应。

这些过程中的丙烷反应性与其烷烃同系物如甲烷和乙烷的反应性显著不同，这归因于这些烷烃的独特反应性。特定的反应性受丙烷中存在活性烯丙基氢原子的影响，这可能导致与甲烷和乙烷中较不活泼的氢原子相比的后续氧化。

简而言之，每种卤化物辅助方法均采用不同的条件和机制来选择性地转化丙烷为丙烯。方法的选择取决于所需的丙烯产量、反应条件和所使用的催化剂等因素。
