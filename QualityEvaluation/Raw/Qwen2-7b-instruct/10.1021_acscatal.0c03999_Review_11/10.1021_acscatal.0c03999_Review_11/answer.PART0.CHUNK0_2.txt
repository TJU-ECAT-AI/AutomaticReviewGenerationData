5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX.

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC. Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. The excellent performance in the case of EuOCl can be rationalized by the unique balance of its mild redox nature that enables alkane activation, minimizes gas-phase reaction by inhibiting the evolution of Cl2.

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The conditions vary widely, ranging from 300 to 700°C for halogen-mediated pathways. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2) are utilized. 

Oxyhalogenation, specifically, involves the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, yielding alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretical efficiency reaches 100% in the presence of O2, but drops to 50% in halo-dehydrogenation due to the formation of HX. 

CeO2-based catalysts show high activity for hydrogen halide oxidation and alkane/alkene oxyhalogenation. Europium oxychloride (EuOCl) demonstrates superior selectivity for C3H6 (over 95% with 20% C3H8 conversion) compared to ceria (CeO2), thanks to its balanced redox nature enabling alkane activation with minimal gas-phase reactions and inhibited Cl2 evolution. 

Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 using a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C. Molten salt-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, utilizing metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2, allows for the dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons between 450 and 600°C, achieving a C3H6 yield of up to 70%.

卤化辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括与卤素的脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化物催化脱氢。条件范围广泛，从300至700°C不等，用于卤素介导途径。利用分子卤素（X2）、卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）、通过卤化物（HX + O2）进行丙烷氧卤化，以及锂X + O2辅助的氧化脱氢（熔融金属卤化物）。 

氧卤化涉及氢卤化物与O2的氧化，产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。在O2存在下理论效率可达100%，但在卤化脱氢中下降至50%，原因是形成HX。 

铈基催化剂显示出高活性，用于氢卤化物氧化和烷烃/烯烃氧卤化。铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）在丙烷氧氯化中的选择性超过95%（丙烷转化率为20%），与氧化铈相比，得益于其平衡的氧化还原性质，既能促进烷烃激活，又能最小化气相反应并抑制氯气生成。 

通过0.28%钌/二氧化钛催化剂进行丙烷卤化脱氢，在400°C时可实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择率。使用锂I、镉I2、锌I2和铅I2等金属碘化物的熔融盐催化脱氢允许在450至600°C之间对各种烃类进行脱氢，最高可达到70%的丙烯产率。
