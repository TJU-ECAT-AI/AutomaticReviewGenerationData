5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29).

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%).

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C.

5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. (261,262)

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of molecular halogens (X2) to remove hydrogen atoms from propane, resulting in propene formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes halogen (X2) in the presence of oxygen (O2). Oxyhalogenation, specifically propane oxyhalogenation, proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide (HX) with oxygen (O2), yielding alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation uses metal halide salts in a liquid state, facilitating the reaction between metal halides and oxygen to produce iodine, which initiates a radical chain reaction.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to differences in reactivity. For instance, propane contains reactive allylic hydrogen atoms that can lead to successive oxidation, affecting the selectivity towards propene. In oxyhalogenation, the alkane conversion can be enhanced due to gas-phase reactions, where highly reactive radical species are liberated from the catalyst surface and form desired and undesired products. In molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, the interplay between metal halide and metal oxide plays a crucial role in generating iodine for initiating a radical chain reaction.

These methods operate under specific conditions, such as temperatures ranging from 300 to 700°C, and require careful control of reactant ratios, catalyst selection, and operational parameters to achieve efficient propene production from propane.

卤化辅助方法通过卤素（X2）、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐催化脱氢来选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。卤素（X2）的脱氢涉及到从丙烷去除氢原子，生成丙烯。在卤素（X2）与氧气（O2）共存的情况下进行氧化脱氢。氧卤化，特别是丙烷氧卤化，通过氧化氢卤化物（HX）与氧气反应，产生卤代烷、烯烃和水。使用基于金属卤化物的熔融盐辅助氧化脱氢，通过金属卤化物与氧气反应生成碘，启动自由基链反应。

在这些过程中，丙烷的反应性与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷大不相同，主要是因为它们的反应性不同。例如，丙烷中含有反应性的亚甲基氢原子，可能导致连续氧化，影响丙烯的选择性。在氧卤化中，可以通过气相反应增强烷烃转化，其中从催化剂表面释放出高度活性的自由基物种，并形成所需和非所需的产品。在基于熔融金属卤化物的氧化脱氢中，金属卤化物与金属氧化物之间的相互作用起着关键作用，用于生成碘以启动自由基链反应。

这些方法在300至700°C的特定条件下运行，并需要精确控制反应物比例、催化剂选择和操作参数，以实现高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。
