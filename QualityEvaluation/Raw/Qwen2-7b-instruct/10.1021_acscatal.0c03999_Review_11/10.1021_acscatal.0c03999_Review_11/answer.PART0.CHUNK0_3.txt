5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C.

5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water.

5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity during POC.

5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves direct interaction of propane with halogen molecules at temperatures around 300 to 700°C. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen in the presence of halogens or halides. Oxyhalogenation specifically refers to the reaction of propane with oxygen and halogen, often in the presence of catalysts like CeO2. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve reactions of metal halides with oxygen under specific conditions to generate iodine, which initiates a radical chain reaction for dehydrogenation. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to differences in their chemical structures and reactivity towards halogen and oxygen species.

卤辅助方法通过卤素介导途径在300至700°C的温和温度下选择性地脱氢丙烷为丙烯，包括与卤素分子的直接作用、氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化物催化脱氢。氧化脱氢利用氧气，在卤素或卤化物的存在下进行。氧卤化特指丙烷与氧气和卤素的反应，通常在催化剂如CeO2的参与下进行。熔融金属卤化物方法涉及金属卤化物与氧气反应生成碘，进而引发链式反应进行脱氢。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃存在显著差异，这是由于它们在卤素和氧气物种前的化学结构和反应性的不同。
