[1] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction (1)."
[2] "Formally this is described by the reaction network outlined below."
[3] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2 according to ${\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{X}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{2HX}}$."
[4] "To recover the halogen from HX one performs a Deacon-like reaction ${\text{2HX}} + {\text{1}}/{\text{2O}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{X}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} {\text{O}}$."
[5] "The sum of the reactions (1)(3) is ${\text{C}}_{{\text{3}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{8}}} + {\text{1}}/{\text{2O}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{C}}_{{\text{3}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{6}}} + {\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} {\text{O}}$."
[6] "The use of a molten salt may appear unusual, but there has been quite a bit of work over years exploring the use of molten salts as catalysts [812] or as promoters [1323]."
[7] "Molten salts have high heat capacity and heat conductivity [12, 2427] which is helpful in preventing hot spots in oxidation reactions."
[8] "They are also good solvents, so it is easy to dope them to modify their catalytic chemistry."
[9] "Unfortunately, molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides are corrosive and this is a serious concern for commercial applications of molten salts or of HM-ODH."
[10] "The main impediment is the cost of corrosion resistant equipment."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is a process that involves adding oxygen or carbon dioxide to the feed. It aims to react selectively with hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially using a suitable catalyst.

2. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (such as iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed. The appropriate catalyst ensures selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. The reaction between hydrogen and a halogen forms a halogen hydride. This reaction is reversible and allows the recovery of the original halogen atom.

5. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation and oxygen addition result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

6. Molten salts have been extensively studied as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions. They offer high heat capacity and conductivity, helping to prevent hot spots in the reaction zone.

7. Molten salts also act as solvents, allowing for the modification of their catalytic properties through doping.

8. The corrosiveness of molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides poses a significant challenge for their commercial application, particularly in terms of equipment costs.

9. Corrosion-resistant materials are required to ensure safe and effective operation in processes involving molten salts and halogen chemistry.

10. The primary barrier to the commercialization of halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation is the expense of using corrosion-resistant equipment.
