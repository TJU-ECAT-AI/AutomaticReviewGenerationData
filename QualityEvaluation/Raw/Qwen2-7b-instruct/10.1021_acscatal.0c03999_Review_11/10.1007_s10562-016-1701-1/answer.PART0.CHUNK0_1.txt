[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."
[2] "I2 is either introduced as a gas in the mixture of propane and oxygen, or it is produced when propane and oxygen come in contact with molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."
[3] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."
[4] "The main role of I2 is to initiate chain reactions that lead to the formation of a propyl iodide intermediate that decomposes to form propylene."
[5] "In the present article we examine the gas phase reaction of propane with oxygen and I2, as well as the reaction of propane and oxygen with molten LiI."
[6] "The goal is to produce propylene with high yield and to clarify some aspects of the mechanism."
[7] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI."
[8] "The reaction of LiI with oxygen produced I2, which then reacted, in gas phase, according to the formal scheme (2)(4)."
[9] "Halogen-mediated chemistry, in the presence of oxygen, has the potential to improve substantially the conversion of alkanes to alkenes."
[10] "The use of a molten salt may appear unusual, but there has been quite a bit of work over years exploring the use of molten salts as catalysts [812] or as promoters [1323]."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and using molten metal halide salts. In oxidative dehydrogenation, propane is mixed with oxygen in the presence of a halogen catalyst, like iodine. In oxyhalogenation, hydrogen is reacted with a halogen to form a halide, which then reacts with oxygen to regenerate the halogen and produce the desired alkene. Using molten metal halide salts involves bringing a mixture of alkane, oxygen, and a molten salt containing the halide into contact. The halide reacts with oxygen to produce the desired alkene. The reaction conditions differ across methods, but generally involve high temperatures and pressures, with oxygen as a key reactant. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from other alkanes like methane and ethane because it forms stable alkyl halides that readily decompose to form the desired alkene, propene, instead of forming unwanted byproducts.

卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化和使用熔融金属卤化盐。在氧化脱氢中，丙烷与氧气在卤化物催化剂（如碘）的存在下混合。在氧卤化中，氢与卤素反应形成卤化物，然后该卤化物与氧气反应再生卤素并产生所需的烯烃。使用熔融金属卤化盐的方法涉及将丙烷、氧气和含卤素的熔融盐混合物引入接触。卤素与氧气反应产生所需烯烃。这些过程中的条件各不相同，但通常需要高温和高压，氧气作为关键反应物。丙烷在这类过程中与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应性不同，因为它形成了稳定的烷基卤化物，容易分解形成所需的烯烃，即丙烯，而不是形成其他副产品。
