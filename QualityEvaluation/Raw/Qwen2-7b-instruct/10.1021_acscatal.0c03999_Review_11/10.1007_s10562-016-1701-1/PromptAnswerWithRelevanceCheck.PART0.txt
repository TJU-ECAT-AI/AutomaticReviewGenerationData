[1] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction (1)."
[2] "Formally this is described by the reaction network outlined below."
[3] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2 according to ${\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{X}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{2HX}}$."
[4] "To recover the halogen from HX one performs a Deacon-like reaction ${\text{2HX}} + {\text{1}}/{\text{2O}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{X}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} {\text{O}}$."
[5] "The sum of the reactions (1)(3) is ${\text{C}}_{{\text{3}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{8}}} + {\text{1}}/{\text{2O}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{C}}_{{\text{3}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{6}}} + {\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} {\text{O}}$."
[6] "The use of a molten salt may appear unusual, but there has been quite a bit of work over years exploring the use of molten salts as catalysts [812] or as promoters [1323]."
[7] "Molten salts have high heat capacity and heat conductivity [12, 2427] which is helpful in preventing hot spots in oxidation reactions."
[8] "They are also good solvents, so it is easy to dope them to modify their catalytic chemistry."
[9] "Unfortunately, molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides are corrosive and this is a serious concern for commercial applications of molten salts or of HM-ODH."
[10] "The main impediment is the cost of corrosion resistant equipment."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is a process that involves adding oxygen or carbon dioxide to the feed. It aims to react selectively with hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially using a suitable catalyst.

2. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (such as iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed. The appropriate catalyst ensures selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. The reaction between hydrogen and a halogen forms a halogen hydride. This reaction is reversible and allows the recovery of the original halogen atom.

5. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation and oxygen addition result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

6. Molten salts have been extensively studied as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions. They offer high heat capacity and conductivity, helping to prevent hot spots in the reaction zone.

7. Molten salts also act as solvents, allowing for the modification of their catalytic properties through doping.

8. The corrosiveness of molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides poses a significant challenge for their commercial application, particularly in terms of equipment costs.

9. Corrosion-resistant materials are required to ensure safe and effective operation in processes involving molten salts and halogen chemistry.

10. The primary barrier to the commercialization of halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation is the expense of using corrosion-resistant equipment.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and using molten metal halide salts. In oxidative dehydrogenation, propane is mixed with oxygen in the presence of a halogen catalyst, like iodine. In oxyhalogenation, hydrogen is reacted with a halogen to form a halide, which then reacts with oxygen to regenerate the halogen and produce the desired alkene. Using molten metal halide salts involves bringing a mixture of alkane, oxygen, and a molten salt containing the halide into contact. The halide reacts with oxygen to produce the desired alkene. The reaction conditions differ across methods, but generally involve high temperatures and pressures, with oxygen as a key reactant. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from other alkanes like methane and ethane because it forms stable alkyl halides that readily decompose to form the desired alkene, propene, instead of forming unwanted byproducts.

卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化和使用熔融金属卤化盐。在氧化脱氢中，丙烷与氧气在卤化物催化剂（如碘）的存在下混合。在氧卤化中，氢与卤素反应形成卤化物，然后该卤化物与氧气反应再生卤素并产生所需的烯烃。使用熔融金属卤化盐的方法涉及将丙烷、氧气和含卤素的熔融盐混合物引入接触。卤素与氧气反应产生所需烯烃。这些过程中的条件各不相同，但通常需要高温和高压，氧气作为关键反应物。丙烷在这类过程中与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应性不同，因为它形成了稳定的烷基卤化物，容易分解形成所需的烯烃，即丙烯，而不是形成其他副产品。

[1] "High ODH yields to propylene were achieved by using iodine either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed."
[2] "In the gas phase, propane conversion increases with increased oxygen concentration, and the propylene yield is highest when the propane to O2 ratio is 1:0.5, which corresponds to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O."
[3] "When molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is used as a source of I2, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid and produces sufficient I2 so that addition of I2 to the feed does not increase the propylene yield."
[4] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the reaction of HI with propyl iodide to make propane and I2, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to make propyl iodide."

1. Iodine-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with halogens, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly from other alkane dehydrogenation processes due to the unique reactivity of propane with halogen species, particularly iodine. In the gas phase, propane conversion increases with increased oxygen concentration, and the propylene yield is highest when the propane to O2 ratio is 1:0.5, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O. When molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is used as a source of iodine, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid, producing sufficient iodine so that adding more iodine to the feed does not increase the propylene yield. The high rate of the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen iodide (HI) is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents reactions that could degrade the propylene yield.

1. 使用碘辅助的方法选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯包括卤化物的氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些方法与其它烷烃脱氢过程存在显著差异，主要由于丙烷与卤素物种（特别是碘）的独特反应性。在气相中，随着氧气浓度的增加，丙烷转化率提高，并且当丙烷与氧气的比例为1:0.5时，丙烯产率最高，这对应于反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O的化学计量比。当使用熔融锂碘（LiI）或锂碘和锂氢氧化合物（LiOH）混合物作为碘源时，氧气与LiI的快速反应产生足够的碘，使得向原料中添加更多碘不会提高丙烯产率。氧气与氢碘酸（HI）的快速反应是高丙烯产率的主要原因。氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了烃类的氧化，而氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了可能导致丙烯产率降低的反应。

The literature describes the halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH) of propane using iodine or molten lithium iodide as a catalyst. The process involves the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous iodine or produced iodine from molten lithium iodide. The main role of iodine is to initiate chain reactions leading to the formation of propyl iodide, which decomposes to form propylene. The presence of oxygen helps in the rapid consumption of iodine and hydrogen iodide, thus preventing the oxidation of hydrocarbons and ensuring high selectivity to propylene. When molten lithium iodide is used, the reaction of oxygen with lithium iodide produces iodine, which is then used in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The high rate of oxygen consumption by hydrogen iodide is suggested to be the main reason for the high propylene yield. The contact time with the molten salt is much shorter than the space time in the gas, allowing for the possibility that some reactions, besides the oxygen reaction with lithium iodide, take place at the liquid surface. The literature also discusses the chemistry of propyl iodide under the reaction conditions used, showing that its decomposition starts at 300°C and its rate increases rapidly as the temperature goes up. This behavior is attributed to the kinetics of the backward reactions being faster than the forward ones at higher temperatures. The literature further explores the effect of space time, the role of propyl iodide, and the combustion reactions, coke formation, and stability in the process.

文献描述了使用碘或熔融锂碘化物作为催化剂的丙烷卤代氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）过程。该过程涉及在存在气体碘或从熔融锂碘化物产生的碘的情况下，丙烷与氧气反应。碘的主要作用是引发链反应，导致丙基碘的形成，它分解为丙烯。氧气的存在有助于快速消耗碘和氢碘酸，从而防止烃类氧化并确保高丙烯选择性。当使用熔融锂碘化物时，氧气与锂碘化物的反应产生碘，然后用于氧化脱氢过程。氧气消耗率由氢碘酸快速消耗被认为是高丙烯产率的主要原因。文献还讨论了熔盐表面可能发生的除氧气与锂碘化物反应之外的其他反应。文献进一步探讨了空间时间、丙基碘的作用、燃烧反应、焦炭形成和稳定性对过程的影响。

1. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In the presence of gaseous I2, propane can be dehydrogenated efficiently. I2 can be introduced as a gas or produced in-situ from molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH. The method employing I2 generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed yielded high propylene production, surpassing those achieved by traditional solid catalysts or industrial dehydrogenation processes without oxygen. 

2. In oxidative dehydrogenation, propane conversion increases with the oxygen concentration. The optimal propane to O2 ratio for maximum propylene yield is 1:0.5, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

3. When using molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH as a source of I2, the rapid reaction of oxygen with LiI produces sufficient I2. Adding I2 to the feed does not enhance propylene yield, suggesting that the high yield is primarily attributed to the swift consumption of oxygen by HI, which prevents hydrocarbon oxidation and the HI reactions with propyl iodide and propylene.

4. In the process, oxygen was introduced into the feed along with propane, while HI was generated during the reaction. The oxygen to HI ratio was too high in the initial phase and insufficient in the latter phase of the reactor. The reason for the high alkene yields when using molten LiI is attributed to the gas-phase I2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation utilizing iodine sourced from the salt.

1. 不同的卤素辅助方法用于选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐方法。在碘蒸气的存在下，可以高效地进行丙烷脱氢。碘可以作为气体引入或从熔融锂碘或熔融锂碘与锂氢氧化物混合物中产生。通过在丙烷和氧气流中添加来自锂碘产生的碘或作为气体添加到流中的碘的方法，实现了高丙烯生产，这超过了传统固体催化剂或无氧气的工业脱氢过程的产量。

2. 在氧化脱氢中，随着氧气浓度的增加，丙烷转化率提高。最优的丙烷与氧气摩尔比为1:0.5，对应于反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O的化学计量。

3. 当使用熔融锂碘或熔融锂碘与锂氢氧化物混合物作为碘源时，氧气与锂碘的快速反应产生足够的碘。向流体中添加碘不会增加丙烯产量，表明高产率主要归因于氧气迅速消耗HI，从而阻止烃类氧化以及HI与丙基碘和丙烯的反应。

4. 在过程中，氧气与丙烷一起引入流体中，同时生成HI。氧气与HI的比例在反应器的初始阶段过高，在后期阶段过低。使用熔融锂碘时获得高烯烃产率的原因归因于气体相碘介导的氧化脱氢，利用从盐中产生的碘。
