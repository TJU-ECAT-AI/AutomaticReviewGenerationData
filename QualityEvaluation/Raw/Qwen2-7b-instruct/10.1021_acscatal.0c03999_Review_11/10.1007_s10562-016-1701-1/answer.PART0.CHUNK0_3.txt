The literature describes the halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH) of propane using iodine or molten lithium iodide as a catalyst. The process involves the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous iodine or produced iodine from molten lithium iodide. The main role of iodine is to initiate chain reactions leading to the formation of propyl iodide, which decomposes to form propylene. The presence of oxygen helps in the rapid consumption of iodine and hydrogen iodide, thus preventing the oxidation of hydrocarbons and ensuring high selectivity to propylene. When molten lithium iodide is used, the reaction of oxygen with lithium iodide produces iodine, which is then used in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The high rate of oxygen consumption by hydrogen iodide is suggested to be the main reason for the high propylene yield. The contact time with the molten salt is much shorter than the space time in the gas, allowing for the possibility that some reactions, besides the oxygen reaction with lithium iodide, take place at the liquid surface. The literature also discusses the chemistry of propyl iodide under the reaction conditions used, showing that its decomposition starts at 300°C and its rate increases rapidly as the temperature goes up. This behavior is attributed to the kinetics of the backward reactions being faster than the forward ones at higher temperatures. The literature further explores the effect of space time, the role of propyl iodide, and the combustion reactions, coke formation, and stability in the process.

文献描述了使用碘或熔融锂碘化物作为催化剂的丙烷卤代氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）过程。该过程涉及在存在气体碘或从熔融锂碘化物产生的碘的情况下，丙烷与氧气反应。碘的主要作用是引发链反应，导致丙基碘的形成，它分解为丙烯。氧气的存在有助于快速消耗碘和氢碘酸，从而防止烃类氧化并确保高丙烯选择性。当使用熔融锂碘化物时，氧气与锂碘化物的反应产生碘，然后用于氧化脱氢过程。氧气消耗率由氢碘酸快速消耗被认为是高丙烯产率的主要原因。文献还讨论了熔盐表面可能发生的除氧气与锂碘化物反应之外的其他反应。文献进一步探讨了空间时间、丙基碘的作用、燃烧反应、焦炭形成和稳定性对过程的影响。
