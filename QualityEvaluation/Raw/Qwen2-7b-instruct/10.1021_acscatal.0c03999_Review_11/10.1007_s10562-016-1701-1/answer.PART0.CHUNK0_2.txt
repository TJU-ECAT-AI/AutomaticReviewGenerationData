[1] "High ODH yields to propylene were achieved by using iodine either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed."
[2] "In the gas phase, propane conversion increases with increased oxygen concentration, and the propylene yield is highest when the propane to O2 ratio is 1:0.5, which corresponds to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O."
[3] "When molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is used as a source of I2, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid and produces sufficient I2 so that addition of I2 to the feed does not increase the propylene yield."
[4] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the reaction of HI with propyl iodide to make propane and I2, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to make propyl iodide."

1. Iodine-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with halogens, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly from other alkane dehydrogenation processes due to the unique reactivity of propane with halogen species, particularly iodine. In the gas phase, propane conversion increases with increased oxygen concentration, and the propylene yield is highest when the propane to O2 ratio is 1:0.5, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O. When molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is used as a source of iodine, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid, producing sufficient iodine so that adding more iodine to the feed does not increase the propylene yield. The high rate of the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen iodide (HI) is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents reactions that could degrade the propylene yield.

1. 使用碘辅助的方法选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯包括卤化物的氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些方法与其它烷烃脱氢过程存在显著差异，主要由于丙烷与卤素物种（特别是碘）的独特反应性。在气相中，随着氧气浓度的增加，丙烷转化率提高，并且当丙烷与氧气的比例为1:0.5时，丙烯产率最高，这对应于反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 -> C3H6 + H2O的化学计量比。当使用熔融锂碘（LiI）或锂碘和锂氢氧化合物（LiOH）混合物作为碘源时，氧气与LiI的快速反应产生足够的碘，使得向原料中添加更多碘不会提高丙烯产率。氧气与氢碘酸（HI）的快速反应是高丙烯产率的主要原因。氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了烃类的氧化，而氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了可能导致丙烯产率降低的反应。
