          [1] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction (1)."

          Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In ODH, propane is mixed with oxygen or carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, aiming for selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted methods involve using halogen atoms (like iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation typically requires oxygen or CO2 to be added to the feed, with the appropriate catalyst ensuring selective reactions with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction. In halogen-assisted processes, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation reaction is instead reacted with a halogen to form a halogen hydride. The halogen is recovered through a Deacon-like reaction, which allows the regeneration of the original halogen atom. The combined reactions of propane dehydrogenation, oxygen addition, and halogen reaction result in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Molten salt methods have been explored as catalysts or promoters in oxidation reactions due to their high heat capacity, heat conductivity, and solvent properties. However, the corrosiveness of molten salts, halogens, and halogen hydrides presents a significant challenge for commercial applications, particularly concerning the cost of corrosion-resistant equipment.

          用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的不同卤素辅助方法包括氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐途径。在氧化脱氢（ODH）中，丙烷与氧气或二氧化碳在催化剂的存在下混合，旨在与脱氢过程产生的氢气进行选择性反应。卤素辅助方法涉及使用卤素原子（如碘）来介导丙烷的氧化脱氢化。氧化脱氢通常需要将氧气或二氧化碳添加到原料中，合适的催化剂确保与脱氢反应产生的氢气进行选择性反应。在卤素辅助过程中，脱氢反应产生的氢气与卤素反应形成卤化氢。通过类似于Deacon的反应，卤素可以从卤化氢中回收，允许再生原卤素原子。脱氢反应、氧气添加和卤素反应的组合导致了丙烷的氧化脱氢化为丙烯。熔融盐方法由于其高热容量、热传导性和溶剂性质而被用作氧化反应的催化剂或促进剂。然而，熔融盐、卤素和卤化氢的腐蚀性构成了商业应用的重大挑战，特别是对于耐腐蚀设备成本的考虑。

          Propylene production via the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous iodine (I2) acting as a gas-phase catalyst was studied. Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated when propane and oxygen come into contact with molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). In both experimental setups, a single-pass propylene yield of 64% was achieved at 500°C and a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm. The primary function of iodine is to initiate chain reactions that lead to the formation of a propyl iodide intermediate, which subsequently decomposes to produce propylene. The study examines the gas phase reaction of propane with oxygen and iodine, as well as the interaction of propane and oxygen with molten lithium iodide. The objective is to maximize propylene yield and elucidate certain aspects of the reaction mechanism. An earlier approach involved combining an alkane mixture with oxygen and molten lithium iodide to facilitate the reaction. When lithium iodide reacts with oxygen, it produces iodine, which then undergoes a gas-phase reaction following the formal scheme (2)(4). Iodine-mediated chemistry in the presence of oxygen has the potential to significantly enhance the conversion of alkanes to alkenes. The utilization of a molten salt might seem unconventional, yet extensive research has been conducted over the years into its application as a catalyst or promoter [812, 1323].

          在存在碘蒸气（I2）作为气相催化剂的情况下，通过丙烷与氧气反应生产丙烯进行了研究。碘可以作为气体引入丙烷-氧气混合物中，或者在丙烷与氧气接触时从熔融锂碘（LiI）或熔融LiI与锂氢氧化物（LiOH）的混合物中产生。在两种实验设置中，在500°C和丙烷分压为0.1 atm的条件下，单程丙烯产率为64%。碘的主要作用是引发链反应，导致形成丙基碘中间体，随后该中间体分解生成丙烯。研究考察了丙烷与氧气和碘的气相反应，以及丙烷与氧气与熔融锂碘的相互作用。目标是最大化丙烯产率并澄清某些反应机制的细节。先前的方法涉及将烷烃混合物与氧气和熔融锂碘结合以促进反应。当锂碘与氧气反应时，它产生碘，然后在气相中遵循正式方案（2）（4）进行反应。在氧气存在的条件下，碘介导的化学反应有可能显著提高烷烃转化为烯烃的转化率。使用熔融盐似乎有些非传统，但多年来已经进行了大量研究，探讨了将其用作催化剂或促进剂的可能性[812, 1323]。

          [3] "High ODH yields to propylene were achieved by using iodine either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed."
          [4] "These two versions provided nearly equivalent yields, which were higher than those achieved by ODH on solid catalysts or by the industrial dehydrogenation processes in the absence of oxygen."
          [5] "In the gas phase, propane conversion increases with increased oxygen concentration, and the propylene yield is highest when the propane to O2 ratio is 1:0.5, which corresponds to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2  C3H6 + H2O."
          [6] "When molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is used as a source of I2, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid and produces sufficient I2 so that addition of I2 to the feed does not increase the propylene yield."
          [7] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the reaction of HI with propyl iodide to make propane and I2, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to make propyl iodide."
          [8] "In the present experiments O2 was introduced in the feed (with propane) and HI was produced as the reaction proceeded along the reactor. The ratio of oxygen to HI is too high in the first half of the reactor and too low in the second half. The reason for high alkene yields when molten LiI is used is likely to be gas-phase I2-mediated ODH using iodine sourced from the salt."

          The study focuses on the high yield of propylene production via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using iodine (I2) as a catalyst. Iodine can be introduced as a gas in the propane-oxygen mixture or generated in-situ from molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a combination of molten LiI and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). High yields of propylene are achieved by utilizing iodine either produced internally from LiI or added as a gas to the propane-oxygen feed. These two methods provided comparable yields, surpassing those obtained through ODH on solid catalysts or industrial dehydrogenation processes without oxygen. In the gas phase, increasing the oxygen concentration enhances propane conversion, with the highest propylene yield occurring when the propane-to-oxygen ratio is 1:0.5, aligning with the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O. When molten lithium iodide or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is utilized as a source of iodine, the rapid reaction of oxygen with LiI generates sufficient iodine, ensuring that the addition of iodine to the feed does not elevate the propylene yield. The high rate of oxygen consumption by hydrogen iodide (HI) is hypothesized to be the primary factor driving the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of HI by oxygen prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the swift consumption of HI by oxygen also hinders the reactions of HI with propyl iodide to form propane and iodine, as well as the reaction of HI with propylene to generate propyl iodide. In the current experiments, oxygen was introduced into the feed along with propane, while HI was synthesized as the reaction progressed through the reactor. The oxygen-to-HI ratio was excessively high in the initial half of the reactor and insufficient in the latter half. The high yields of alkene products when using molten lithium iodide are attributed to gas-phase I2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation utilizing iodine sourced directly from the salt.

          本研究专注于通过使用碘（I2）作为催化剂的氧化脱氢（ODH）来实现高产率的丙烯生产。碘可以作为气体引入丙烷-氧气混合物中，或者从熔融锂碘（LiI）或熔融LiI与锂氢氧化物（LiOH）的混合物中内部产生。通过利用从LiI内部产生或作为气体添加到丙烷-氧气流中的碘，实现了高产率的丙烯生产。这两种方法提供的产率相当，超过了在固态催化剂上进行ODH或在无氧条件下进行工业脱氢化过程的产率。在气相中，增加氧气浓度可以提高丙烷转化率，最高产率出现在丙烷与氧气摩尔比为1:0.5时，这与反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O的化学计量相匹配。当使用熔融锂碘或熔融LiI与LiOH的混合物作为碘源时，快速的氧气与LiI反应产生了足够的碘，因此向流体中添加碘不会增加丙烯产率。氧气与氢碘酸（HI）的快速消耗被认为是高产率的主要原因。氧气对HI的快速消耗阻止了烃类的氧化，同时氧气对HI的快速消耗也阻止了HI与丙基碘反应生成丙烷和碘，以及HI与丙烯反应生成丙基碘。在当前的实验中，氧气与丙烷一起引入流体中，同时HI在反应沿反应器进展时产生。氧气与HI的比率在反应器的前半部分过高，在后半部分过低。使用熔融锂碘时获得高烯烃产率的原因可能是气相I2介导的氧化脱氢，利用直接从盐中获取的碘。
