The document discusses the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO) surfaces through hydrogen abstraction. It mentions that the energy barriers for this process are much smaller (126kJmol−1) when compared to experimental studies (80-160kJmol−1), suggesting that the Li+O. site might not be the active site. The document concludes that the same sites are responsible for the activation of methane on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts. Calculations show that methane binds heterolytically on magnesium oxide (Mg2+O2) sites at steps and corners, and the homolytic release of methyl radicals happens only in the presence of oxygen. The document also provides evidence that the activation barrier for hydrogen abstraction on Li+O. terrace sites is surprisingly low at 126kJmol−1. Additionally, it describes the use of a (MgO)9 cluster as a model for morphological defects on Li-free magnesium oxide catalysts, where the reaction pathway involves the formation of an OH group and a Grignard type Mg-methylate, facilitated by the formation of a superoxide species. The overall process becomes nearly thermal neutral due to the exothermic nature of the superoxide formation and the subsequent release of a methyl radical to the gas phase.

本文讨论了在锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li-doped MgO）表面通过氢解离激活甲烷的过程。提到与实验研究相比，这种过程的能量壁垒要小得多（126kJmol−1），这表明Li+O.位点可能不是活性位点。本文得出结论，无论是Li-doped MgO还是纯MgO催化剂上，相同的位点都负责甲烷的激活。计算显示，甲烷在镁氧化物（Mg2+O2）位点上以异裂方式结合在台阶和角落处，并且只有在氧气存在的条件下，甲基自由基才会释放到气体中。文档还提供了证据表明，Li+O.台阶位点上氢解离的激活壁垒出乎意料地低，为126kJmol−1。此外，它描述了使用（MgO）9簇作为无锂镁氧化物催化剂上形态缺陷的模型，其中反应途径涉及形成OH组分和Grignard类型的Mg-甲基化物，由超氧物种的形成所促进。由于超氧物种形成和随后释放甲基自由基到气体中的过程具有明显的放热性，整个过程几乎达到热中性。
