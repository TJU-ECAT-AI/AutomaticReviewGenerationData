The literature discusses the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide surfaces. It mentions that the energy barrier for hydrogen abstraction by oxygen radical sites in lithium-doped magnesium oxide is much lower (126 kJ/mol) compared to the barriers inferred from experimental studies (80-160 kJ/mol). The activity of a magnesium oxide catalyst prepared by solgel synthesis varies significantly between the initial phase and the steady state of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction. It is found that methane binds heterolytically on magnesium oxide surfaces at steps and corners, and the homolytic release of methyl radicals occurs only in the presence of oxygen. The model calculations support the idea that heterolytic chemisorption of methane on magnesium oxide surfaces, in the presence of oxygen, becomes energetically feasible on morphological defects such as steps or corners, playing a significant role in the OCM process.

文献讨论了在锂掺杂的镁氧化物表面甲烷的激活。它提到，氧自由基位点在锂掺杂的镁氧化物上的氢抽象的能量壁垒要低得多（126 kJ/mol），与从实验研究推断出的壁垒（80-160 kJ/mol）相比。通过溶胶合成制备的镁氧化物催化剂在其OCM反应的初始阶段和稳定状态之间的活性存在显著差异。发现甲烷在镁氧化物表面上以异裂方式结合在台阶、角落等位置，并且只有在氧气存在的条件下，甲烷才能发生同裂解并释放出甲基自由基。模型计算支持的观点是，在镁氧化物表面，氧气的存在下，甲烷在台阶或角落等形态缺陷处进行异裂吸附变得能动性可行，并在OCM过程中发挥重要作用。
