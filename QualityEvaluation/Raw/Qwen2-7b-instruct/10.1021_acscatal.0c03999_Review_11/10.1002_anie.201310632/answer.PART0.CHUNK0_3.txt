The document discusses the activation of methane (CH4) on lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO) surfaces through various methods. It highlights that the energy barriers for hydrogen abstraction at oxygen radical sites on Li-doped MgO are unrealistically low, suggesting that the Li+O. site might not be the active site. Instead, the CH bonds can heterolytically add onto regular MgO ion pairs at morphological defects like steps and corners. The release of methyl radicals into the gas phase occurs only in the presence of oxygen. Temperature-programmed oxidative coupling reactions indicate that the same sites are responsible for activating CH4 on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts. For further kinetic studies, a pure MgO model catalyst was synthesized via a solgel process and characterized using transmission electron microscopy. On both catalysts, oxygen and CH4 conversion into carbon dioxide starts around 410°C, with carbon dioxide being the dominant oxidation product. A model for morphological defects on lithium-free MgO catalysts was adopted as the (MgO)9 cluster.

文献讨论了在锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li掺杂MgO）表面通过各种方法激活甲烷（CH4）。它指出，氧自由基位点上氢抽象的能量壁垒非常低，暗示Li+O.位点可能不是活性位点。相反，CH键可以在形态缺陷如台阶和角落处的常规MgO离子对上异裂。只有在氧气存在下，甲基自由基才会释放到气相中。温度编程下的氧化耦合反应表明，在Li掺杂MgO和纯MgO催化剂上激活CH4的相同位点是负责的。为了进一步的研究动力学，通过溶胶-凝胶过程合成了一个纯MgO模型催化剂，并使用透射电子显微镜进行了表征。在两种催化剂上，氧气和CH4转化为二氧化碳开始于约410°C，二氧化碳是主要的氧化产物。对于形态缺陷的模型，采用（MgO）9簇作为锂自由的MgO催化剂的模型。
