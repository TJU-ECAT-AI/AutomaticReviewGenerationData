The scientific literature provided discusses the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide surfaces through hydrogen abstraction by oxygen radical sites. The energy barriers for this process are significantly lower (126kJ/mol) than those inferred from experimental studies (80-160kJ/mol). The literature also explores the role of lithium doping in increasing the number of active sites, which is attributed to changes in morphology related to the formation of low-coordinate oxygen ions at edges, corners, and kinks. Quantum chemical calculations beyond previous limitations were conducted to determine the active sites, localization of the transition structure, and accuracy of the quantum chemical approach. These calculations revealed that heterolytic chemisorption of methane on magnesium oxide in the presence of oxygen becomes energetically feasible on morphological defects like steps or corners. The literature supports this concept through experimental evidence, including temperature-programmed reaction measurements and transmission electron microscopy. The role of non-reducible oxides as catalysts in methane activation is also discussed, suggesting they facilitate the direct exchange of redox equivalents between reactants rather than providing and receiving electrons.

本文档讨论了锂掺杂镁氧化物表面通过氧自由基位点的氢摘取激活甲烷。这一过程的能量壁垒远低于从实验研究中推断出的壁垒（126kJ/mol与80-160kJ/mol）。文献还探讨了锂掺杂在增加活性位点数量方面的作用，这归因于边缘、角和折痕处形成的低配位氧离子的形态变化。进行了超越以往限制的量子化学计算，以确定活性位点、过渡结构的定位以及量子化学方法的准确性。这些计算表明，在存在氧气的情况下，甲烷在镁氧化物上的异裂吸附在边缘、角落或折痕等形态缺陷上变得能量上可行。文献通过实验证据支持了这一概念，包括温度程序反应测量和透射电子显微镜。非还原性氧化物作为甲烷活化催化剂的作用也被讨论，表明它们通过直接交换反应物之间的还原当量来发挥作用，而不是提供和接收电子。
