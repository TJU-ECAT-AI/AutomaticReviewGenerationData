[1] "Density functional calculations yield energy barriers for H abstraction by oxygen radical sites in Li-doped MgO that are much smaller (126kJmol1) than the barriers inferred from different experimental studies (80160kJmol1)."
[2] "For a MgO catalyst prepared by solgel synthesis, the activity proved to be very different in the initial phase of the OCM reaction and in the steady state."
[3] "In the initial phase of the reaction Li-MgO is far more active and selective in forming C2 coupling products than pure MgO."
[4] "The role of Li-doping is increasing the number of active sites, which is most likely due to changes of the morphology connected with the formation of a larger number of low-coordinate O2 ions at edges, corners, and kinks."
[5] "From temperature-programmed oxidative coupling reactions of methane (OCM), we conclude that the same sites are responsible for the activation of CH4 on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts."
[6] "Our experiments (see also Ref.31)in combination with theoretical studies suggest a different role of non-reducible oxides as catalysts on methane activation."

The literature does not contain information related to the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene using halogen-assisted methods, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide surfaces. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided document.

文献中没有关于使用卤素辅助方法、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯的信息。它专注于在锂掺杂的镁氧化物表面上的甲烷活化。因此，无法根据提供的文档回答问题。
