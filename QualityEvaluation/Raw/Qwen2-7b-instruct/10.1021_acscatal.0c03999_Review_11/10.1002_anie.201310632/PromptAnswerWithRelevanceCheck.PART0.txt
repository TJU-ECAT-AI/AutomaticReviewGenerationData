The scientific literature provided discusses the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide surfaces through hydrogen abstraction by oxygen radical sites. The energy barriers for this process are significantly lower (126kJ/mol) than those inferred from experimental studies (80-160kJ/mol). The literature also explores the role of lithium doping in increasing the number of active sites, which is attributed to changes in morphology related to the formation of low-coordinate oxygen ions at edges, corners, and kinks. Quantum chemical calculations beyond previous limitations were conducted to determine the active sites, localization of the transition structure, and accuracy of the quantum chemical approach. These calculations revealed that heterolytic chemisorption of methane on magnesium oxide in the presence of oxygen becomes energetically feasible on morphological defects like steps or corners. The literature supports this concept through experimental evidence, including temperature-programmed reaction measurements and transmission electron microscopy. The role of non-reducible oxides as catalysts in methane activation is also discussed, suggesting they facilitate the direct exchange of redox equivalents between reactants rather than providing and receiving electrons.

The document does not address the question regarding dehydrogenation of propane to propene with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches, as these topics are not covered in the provided scientific literature.

本文档讨论了锂掺杂镁氧化物表面通过氧自由基位点的氢摘取激活甲烷。这一过程的能量壁垒远低于从实验研究中推断出的壁垒（126kJ/mol与80-160kJ/mol）。文献还探讨了锂掺杂在增加活性位点数量方面的作用，这归因于边缘、角和折痕处形成的低配位氧离子的形态变化。进行了超越以往限制的量子化学计算，以确定活性位点、过渡结构的定位以及量子化学方法的准确性。这些计算表明，在存在氧气的情况下，甲烷在镁氧化物上的异裂吸附在边缘、角落或折痕等形态缺陷上变得能量上可行。文献通过实验证据支持了这一概念，包括温度程序反应测量和透射电子显微镜。非还原性氧化物作为甲烷活化催化剂的作用也被讨论，表明它们通过直接交换反应物之间的还原当量来发挥作用，而不是提供和接收电子。

提供的科学文献没有涉及丙烷通过卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法脱氢到丙烯的问题，因为这些主题在提供的文献中没有被覆盖。

The document discusses the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO) surfaces through hydrogen abstraction. It mentions that the energy barriers for this process are much smaller (126kJmol−1) when compared to experimental studies (80-160kJmol−1), suggesting that the Li+O. site might not be the active site. The document concludes that the same sites are responsible for the activation of methane on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts. Calculations show that methane binds heterolytically on magnesium oxide (Mg2+O2) sites at steps and corners, and the homolytic release of methyl radicals happens only in the presence of oxygen. The document also provides evidence that the activation barrier for hydrogen abstraction on Li+O. terrace sites is surprisingly low at 126kJmol−1. Additionally, it describes the use of a (MgO)9 cluster as a model for morphological defects on Li-free magnesium oxide catalysts, where the reaction pathway involves the formation of an OH group and a Grignard type Mg-methylate, facilitated by the formation of a superoxide species. The overall process becomes nearly thermal neutral due to the exothermic nature of the superoxide formation and the subsequent release of a methyl radical to the gas phase.

本文讨论了在锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li-doped MgO）表面通过氢解离激活甲烷的过程。提到与实验研究相比，这种过程的能量壁垒要小得多（126kJmol−1），这表明Li+O.位点可能不是活性位点。本文得出结论，无论是Li-doped MgO还是纯MgO催化剂上，相同的位点都负责甲烷的激活。计算显示，甲烷在镁氧化物（Mg2+O2）位点上以异裂方式结合在台阶和角落处，并且只有在氧气存在的条件下，甲基自由基才会释放到气体中。文档还提供了证据表明，Li+O.台阶位点上氢解离的激活壁垒出乎意料地低，为126kJmol−1。此外，它描述了使用（MgO）9簇作为无锂镁氧化物催化剂上形态缺陷的模型，其中反应途径涉及形成OH组分和Grignard类型的Mg-甲基化物，由超氧物种的形成所促进。由于超氧物种形成和随后释放甲基自由基到气体中的过程具有明显的放热性，整个过程几乎达到热中性。

It mentions that the energy barrier for hydrogen abstraction by oxygen radical sites in lithium-doped magnesium oxide is much lower (126 kJ/mol) compared to the barriers inferred from experimental studies (80-160 kJ/mol). The activity of a magnesium oxide catalyst prepared by solgel synthesis varies significantly between the initial phase and the steady state of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction. It is found that methane binds heterolytically on magnesium oxide surfaces at steps and corners, and the homolytic release of methyl radicals occurs only in the presence of oxygen. The model calculations support the idea that heterolytic chemisorption of methane on magnesium oxide surfaces, in the presence of oxygen, becomes energetically feasible on morphological defects such as steps or corners, playing a significant role in the OCM process.

The document discusses the activation of methane (CH4) on lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO) surfaces through various methods. It highlights that the energy barriers for hydrogen abstraction at oxygen radical sites on Li-doped MgO are unrealistically low, suggesting that the Li+O. site might not be the active site. Instead, the CH bonds can heterolytically add onto regular MgO ion pairs at morphological defects like steps and corners. The release of methyl radicals into the gas phase occurs only in the presence of oxygen. Temperature-programmed oxidative coupling reactions indicate that the same sites are responsible for activating CH4 on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts. For further kinetic studies, a pure MgO model catalyst was synthesized via a solgel process and characterized using transmission electron microscopy. On both catalysts, oxygen and CH4 conversion into carbon dioxide starts around 410°C, with carbon dioxide being the dominant oxidation product. A model for morphological defects on lithium-free MgO catalysts was adopted as the (MgO)9 cluster.

文献讨论了在锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li掺杂MgO）表面通过各种方法激活甲烷（CH4）。它指出，氧自由基位点上氢抽象的能量壁垒非常低，暗示Li+O.位点可能不是活性位点。相反，CH键可以在形态缺陷如台阶和角落处的常规MgO离子对上异裂。只有在氧气存在下，甲基自由基才会释放到气相中。温度编程下的氧化耦合反应表明，在Li掺杂MgO和纯MgO催化剂上激活CH4的相同位点是负责的。为了进一步的研究动力学，通过溶胶-凝胶过程合成了一个纯MgO模型催化剂，并使用透射电子显微镜进行了表征。在两种催化剂上，氧气和CH4转化为二氧化碳开始于约410°C，二氧化碳是主要的氧化产物。对于形态缺陷的模型，采用（MgO）9簇作为锂自由的MgO催化剂的模型。

The literature does not contain information related to the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene using halogen-assisted methods, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the activation of methane on lithium-doped magnesium oxide surfaces. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided document.
