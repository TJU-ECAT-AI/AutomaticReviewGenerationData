The study focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in both reduced and sulfided states. The reaction with sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to be endothermic, with activity increasing with temperature. The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed high yield and selectivity for propylene formation compared to other methods. However, sulfiding the catalyst did not improve its activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst performed better than the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially at high temperatures where a significant increase in selectivity per pass was observed. Coke formation was higher on the Cr-based catalyst compared to the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The study suggested that oxidative dehydrogenation with SO2 could offer an alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing potential in this context. Hydrogen sulfide and water were detected as byproducts, and the relatively low selectivity to propylene might be due to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

研究集中在使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯，催化剂在还原和硫化状态下进行。与二氧化硫（SO2）反应被认为是吸热的，随着温度升高，活性增加。与其它方法相比，Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示出高产率和选择性丙烯形成。然而，硫化催化剂并未提高其活性或选择性。在高温操作中，还原Pd/Al2O3催化剂表现出优于传统Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂的优点，特别是在每次通过时选择性显著增加。Cr基催化剂上的焦炭形成量高于Pd/Al2O3催化剂。研究表明，使用SO2的氧化脱氢可以克服反应的平衡限制，Pd/Al2O3在这方面具有潜力。检测到氢硫酸和水作为副产品，丙烯选择性较低可能是因为丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。

1. The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. It was found that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst offered higher activity and selectivity towards propylene production compared to the sulfided catalyst. Sulfiding the catalyst did not improve its activity or selectivity. The addition of SO2 to the feed increased the conversion of propane, but the selectivity to propylene decreased significantly.

2. Based on the study, oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provides an alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst shows promise in this regard, offering some hope for enhanced propylene production. However, the low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 to propylene might be attributed to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, as evidenced by the increase in Kp with temperature. The study highlights that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is superior in terms of activity and selectivity for propylene formation, offering advantages over traditional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly at high temperatures where a notable increase in selectivity is observed.

4. The presence of coke on the chroma-alumina catalyst averaged 2-4% of the propane converted, compared to less than 1% for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates better performance of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of resistance to coke deposition.

1. 该研究考察了在Pd/Al2O3催化剂的还原和硫化状态下丙烷向丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。发现还原的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烯产率和选择性方面明显优于硫化催化剂。硫化催化剂并未提高活性或选择性。向进料中添加SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性显著降低。

2. 根据研究，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择。Pd/Al2O3催化剂在这方面显示出希望。然而，Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的低选择性可能归因于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。

3. 丙烷向丙烯的氧化脱氢是一个吸热反应，温度升高时Kp增加。研究指出，还原的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在活性和丙烯选择性方面更优，相对于传统的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂，尤其是在高温操作中，可观察到丙烯选择性的显著增加。

4. 铬铝氧催化剂上的焦炭沉积量平均为丙烷转化的2-4%，而Pd/Al2O3催化剂仅为不到1%。这表明Pd/Al2O3催化剂在防止焦炭沉积方面的性能更好。

The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The results showed that sulfiding the catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and selectivity, especially at higher temperatures, compared to the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst. The study also noted that the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the reaction mixture increased the conversion of propane but resulted in lower selectivity towards propylene compared to pure propane feed. The presence of coke on the chroma-alumina catalyst indicated that the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst had a lower propensity for coke formation, offering potential advantages in high-temperature operations. The study concluded that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provided an alternative approach to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context.

研究探讨了使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程，催化剂在还原和硫化状态下进行了研究。结果显示，硫化催化剂并未提高活性或选择性。还原状态下的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在较高温度下显示出更高的活性和选择性，与常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂相比具有优势。研究还发现，在反应混合物中加入二氧化硫（SO2）提高了丙烷的转化率，但降低了丙烯的选择性，与纯丙烷进料相比。研究还指出，催化剂上的焦炭沉积表明，Pd/Al2O3催化剂对于焦炭形成有较低的倾向，在高温操作中具有潜在的优势。研究得出结论，使用SO2的氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种方法，Pd/Al2O3在这方面显示出希望。

1. The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Al2O3 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states. Pd/AL2O3 was chosen because of its remarkable high yield and selectivity to propylene formation resulting from the dehydrogenation of propane. The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3C3H8 + so2 -> 3C3H6 + H2 + 2H2O. Previous studies have shown that the reaction is endothermic and that the equilibrium constant (Kp) increases with temperature. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst shows moderate activity and high selectivity to propylene at temperatures up to 611°C. However, the sulfided Pd/AL2O3 catalyst shows poor activity despite having a fairly high selectivity of 71%. Sulfiding Pd/AL2O3 did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/AL2O3 catalysts. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increases in selectivity per pass are noticed.
2. The conclusions drawn from this study are that sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, particularly in high temperature operations where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. Additionally, oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction, with Pd/AL2O3 offering some hope in this regard. It was found that SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports this view.

1. 当前的工作是对丙烷-二氧化硫系统在还原和硫化状态下使用Al2O3催化剂进行研究。选择Pd/AL2O3是因为它具有显著的高产率和丙烯形成时从丙烷脱氢的高度选择性。丙烷到丙烯的总体反应可以表示为：3C3H8 + so2 -> 3C3H6 + H2 + 2H2O。先前的研究表明，该反应是吸热的，并且平衡常数（Kp）随温度升高而增加。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂显示出适度的活性和高达611°C时丙烯的高选择性。然而，硫化的Pd/AL2O3催化剂显示出较低的活性，尽管其选择性相当高（71%）。硫化Pd/AL2O3没有改善与还原催化剂相比的活性或选择性。向原料中添加SO2会增加丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性远低于纯丙烷原料得到的结果。首先对还原和硫化0.5% Pd/AL2O3催化剂进行了丙烷脱氢的初步研究。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂相对于常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂在高温操作中提供了一些优势，在这些操作中每通过一次就出现了显著的选择性增加。
2. 本研究得出的结论是，硫化钯催化剂并没有提高活性或选择性。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂相对于常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂在高温操作中提供了一些优势，尤其是在那些每次通过都有显著选择性增加的操作中。此外，使用SO2的氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择，Pd/AL2O3在这方面可能有所希望。发现SO2似乎从烷烃中提取氢，导致生成氢硫酸和水。反应产物中的CO2的存在支持这一观点。

The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) catalyst in both reduced and sulfided states. It compares the performance of the catalysts at different temperatures, showing that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is superior in activity and selectivity to propylene formation. Sulfiding the catalyst does not improve its activity or selectivity. The study also notes that the oxidative dehydrogenation using sulfur dioxide offers an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context. However, the low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 towards propylene might be attributed to propylene being oxidized by sulfur dioxide to water and carbon dioxide.

该研究探讨了在还原态和硫化态下，钯负载于氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂上对丙烷进行氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。它比较了不同温度下催化剂的表现，发现还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烯生成活性和选择性方面优于硫化催化剂。对催化剂进行硫化并未提高其活性或选择性。研究还指出，使用二氧化硫进行氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择，在这方面，Pd/Al2O3显示出一定的希望。然而，Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的选择性较低可能是因为丙烯被二氧化硫氧化为水和二氧化碳。
