The study focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in both reduced and sulfided states. The reaction with sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to be endothermic, with activity increasing with temperature. The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed high yield and selectivity for propylene formation compared to other methods. However, sulfiding the catalyst did not improve its activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst performed better than the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially at high temperatures where a significant increase in selectivity per pass was observed. Coke formation was higher on the Cr-based catalyst compared to the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The study suggested that oxidative dehydrogenation with SO2 could offer an alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing potential in this context. Hydrogen sulfide and water were detected as byproducts, and the relatively low selectivity to propylene might be due to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

研究集中在使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯，催化剂在还原和硫化状态下进行。与二氧化硫（SO2）反应被认为是吸热的，随着温度升高，活性增加。与其它方法相比，Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示出高产率和选择性丙烯形成。然而，硫化催化剂并未提高其活性或选择性。在高温操作中，还原Pd/Al2O3催化剂表现出优于传统Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂的优点，特别是在每次通过时选择性显著增加。Cr基催化剂上的焦炭形成量高于Pd/Al2O3催化剂。研究表明，使用SO2的氧化脱氢可以克服反应的平衡限制，Pd/Al2O3在这方面具有潜力。检测到氢硫酸和水作为副产品，丙烯选择性较低可能是因为丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。
