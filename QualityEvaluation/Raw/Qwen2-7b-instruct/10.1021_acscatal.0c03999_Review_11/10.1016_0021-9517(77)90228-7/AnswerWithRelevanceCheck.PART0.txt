          [1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."
          [2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
          [3] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."
          [4] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
          [5] "The conclusions which could be drawn from this study are: First,sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
          [6] "Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [7] "Third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."
          [8] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

          The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The results showed that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst outperformed the sulfided catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity. Sulfiding the catalyst did not enhance its activity or selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, when utilizing SO2, provided an alternative solution to address the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context. However, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 towards propylene might be due to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

          该研究探讨了在还原态和硫化态下，使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。结果显示，还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂在活性和选择性方面优于硫化催化剂。对催化剂进行硫化并未提升其活性或选择性。使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了解决反应平衡限制的另一种途径，在这方面，Pd/Al2O3展现出一定的前景。然而，Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的相对较低选择性可能是由于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳所致。

          [1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/ALOs catalysts."
          [3] "Sulfiding Pd/Al2O3 did not, therefore, improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
          [4] "The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
          [5] "In a few experiments coke deposited on chroma-alumina was measured and it averaged 2-4% of the propane converted compared with less than 1% for Pd/A1203 catalyst."
          [6] "The presence of CO2 among the reaction products seems to support this view."

          The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The findings indicated that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst provided some benefits over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, particularly in high temperature operations where a notable increase in selectivity per pass was observed. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supported the notion that the oxidative dehydrogenation process might involve the oxidation of propylene by SO2 to produce water and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the study highlighted that the use of SO2 in the reaction mixture increased the conversion of propane but led to a lower selectivity towards propylene compared to using pure propane feed.

          该研究探讨了在还原态和硫化态下，使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。研究结果表明，还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂相对于常规的Crz03-A120rK30脱氢催化剂在高温操作中提供了某些优势，特别是在每次通过时选择性显著增加的情况下。反应产物中存在CO2支持了氧化脱氢过程可能涉及丙烯被SO2氧化生成水和二氧化碳的观点。此外，研究指出，将SO2加入反应物中提高了丙烷的转化率，但与使用纯丙烷进料相比，丙烯的选择性显著降低。
