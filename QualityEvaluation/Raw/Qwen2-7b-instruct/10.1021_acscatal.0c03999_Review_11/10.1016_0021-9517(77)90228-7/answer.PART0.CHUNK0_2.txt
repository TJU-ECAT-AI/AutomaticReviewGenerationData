Cutalytic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene\\
Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature.\\
Propane,hydrogen,nitrogen,oxygen,sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were high purity products.\\
Catalyst,containing 0.50%, wt Pd/A1203 was supplied by Engel- hard (UK) with fairly uniform particles of about & in. in size and surface area of about 250 m/g.\\
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/ALOs catalysts.\\
Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst.\\
The conclusions which could be drawn from this study are: First,sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity.\\
Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst,\\
especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed (see bottom of Table 1).\\

In a few experiments coke deposited on chroma-alumina was measured and it averaged 2-4% of the propane converted compared with less than 1% for Pd/A1,03 catalyst.\\
The third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect.\\
Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions,however, SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed.\\
These were detected by glc analysis.\\
On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.\\
The presence of CO2 among the reaction products seems to support this view.

The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. The results showed that sulfiding the catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and selectivity, especially at higher temperatures, compared to the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst. The study also noted that the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the reaction mixture increased the conversion of propane but resulted in lower selectivity towards propylene compared to pure propane feed. The presence of coke on the chroma-alumina catalyst indicated that the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst had a lower propensity for coke formation, offering potential advantages in high-temperature operations. The study concluded that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provided an alternative approach to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context.

研究探讨了使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程，催化剂在还原和硫化状态下进行了研究。结果显示，硫化催化剂并未提高活性或选择性。还原状态下的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在较高温度下显示出更高的活性和选择性，与常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂相比具有优势。研究还发现，在反应混合物中加入二氧化硫（SO2）提高了丙烷的转化率，但降低了丙烯的选择性，与纯丙烷进料相比。研究还指出，催化剂上的焦炭沉积表明，Pd/Al2O3催化剂对于焦炭形成有较低的倾向，在高温操作中具有潜在的优势。研究得出结论，使用SO2的氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种方法，Pd/Al2O3在这方面显示出希望。
