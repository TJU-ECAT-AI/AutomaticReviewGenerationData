[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."
[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[3] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."
[4] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[5] "The conclusions which could be drawn from this study are: First,sulfiding palla- dium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[6] "Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydro- genation catalyst."
[7] "Third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."
[8] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

1. The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in both reduced and sulfided states. It was found that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst offered higher activity and selectivity towards propylene production compared to the sulfided catalyst. Sulfiding the catalyst did not improve its activity or selectivity. The addition of SO2 to the feed increased the conversion of propane, but the selectivity to propylene decreased significantly.

2. Based on the study, oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provides an alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst shows promise in this regard, offering some hope for enhanced propylene production. However, the low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 to propylene might be attributed to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, as evidenced by the increase in Kp with temperature. The study highlights that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is superior in terms of activity and selectivity for propylene formation, offering advantages over traditional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly at high temperatures where a notable increase in selectivity is observed.

4. The presence of coke on the chroma-alumina catalyst averaged 2-4% of the propane converted, compared to less than 1% for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates better performance of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of resistance to coke deposition.

1. 该研究考察了在Pd/Al2O3催化剂的还原和硫化状态下丙烷向丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。发现还原的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烯产率和选择性方面明显优于硫化催化剂。硫化催化剂并未提高活性或选择性。向进料中添加SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性显著降低。

2. 根据研究，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择。Pd/Al2O3催化剂在这方面显示出希望。然而，Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的低选择性可能归因于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。

3. 丙烷向丙烯的氧化脱氢是一个吸热反应，温度升高时Kp增加。研究指出，还原的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在活性和丙烯选择性方面更优，相对于传统的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂，尤其是在高温操作中，可观察到丙烯选择性的显著增加。

4. 铬铝氧催化剂上的焦炭沉积量平均为丙烷转化的2-4%，而Pd/Al2O3催化剂仅为不到1%。这表明Pd/Al2O3催化剂在防止焦炭沉积方面的性能更好。
