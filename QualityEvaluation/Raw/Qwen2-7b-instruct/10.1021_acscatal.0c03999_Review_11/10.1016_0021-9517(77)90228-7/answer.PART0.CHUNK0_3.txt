1. The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Al2O3 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states. Pd/AL2O3 was chosen because of its remarkable high yield and selectivity to propylene formation resulting from the dehydrogenation of propane. The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3C3H8 + so2 -> 3C3H6 + H2 + 2H2O. Previous studies have shown that the reaction is endothermic and that the equilibrium constant (Kp) increases with temperature. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst shows moderate activity and high selectivity to propylene at temperatures up to 611°C. However, the sulfided Pd/AL2O3 catalyst shows poor activity despite having a fairly high selectivity of 71%. Sulfiding Pd/AL2O3 did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/AL2O3 catalysts. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increases in selectivity per pass are noticed.
2. The conclusions drawn from this study are that sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity. The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, particularly in high temperature operations where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. Additionally, oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction, with Pd/AL2O3 offering some hope in this regard. It was found that SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports this view.

1. 当前的工作是对丙烷-二氧化硫系统在还原和硫化状态下使用Al2O3催化剂进行研究。选择Pd/AL2O3是因为它具有显著的高产率和丙烯形成时从丙烷脱氢的高度选择性。丙烷到丙烯的总体反应可以表示为：3C3H8 + so2 -> 3C3H6 + H2 + 2H2O。先前的研究表明，该反应是吸热的，并且平衡常数（Kp）随温度升高而增加。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂显示出适度的活性和高达611°C时丙烯的高选择性。然而，硫化的Pd/AL2O3催化剂显示出较低的活性，尽管其选择性相当高（71%）。硫化Pd/AL2O3没有改善与还原催化剂相比的活性或选择性。向原料中添加SO2会增加丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性远低于纯丙烷原料得到的结果。首先对还原和硫化0.5% Pd/AL2O3催化剂进行了丙烷脱氢的初步研究。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂相对于常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂在高温操作中提供了一些优势，在这些操作中每通过一次就出现了显著的选择性增加。
2. 本研究得出的结论是，硫化钯催化剂并没有提高活性或选择性。还原的Pd/AL2O3催化剂相对于常规的Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂在高温操作中提供了一些优势，尤其是在那些每次通过都有显著选择性增加的操作中。此外，使用SO2的氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择，Pd/AL2O3在这方面可能有所希望。发现SO2似乎从烷烃中提取氢，导致生成氢硫酸和水。反应产物中的CO2的存在支持这一观点。
