[1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/AL2O3 catalysts."
[3] "Sulfiding Pd/Al2O3 did not, therefore, improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[4] "The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
[5] "In a few experiments coke deposited on chroma-alumina was measured and it averaged 2-4% of the propane converted compared with less than 1% for Pd/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The presence of CO2 among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) catalyst in both reduced and sulfided states. It compares the performance of the catalysts at different temperatures, showing that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is superior in activity and selectivity to propylene formation. Sulfiding the catalyst does not improve its activity or selectivity. The study also notes that the oxidative dehydrogenation using sulfur dioxide offers an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in the reaction, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise in this context. However, the low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 towards propylene might be attributed to propylene being oxidized by sulfur dioxide to water and carbon dioxide.

该研究探讨了在还原态和硫化态下，钯负载于氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂上对丙烷进行氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。它比较了不同温度下催化剂的表现，发现还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烯生成活性和选择性方面优于硫化催化剂。对催化剂进行硫化并未提高其活性或选择性。研究还指出，使用二氧化硫进行氧化脱氢提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种选择，在这方面，Pd/Al2O3显示出一定的希望。然而，Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的选择性较低可能是因为丙烯被二氧化硫氧化为水和二氧化碳。
