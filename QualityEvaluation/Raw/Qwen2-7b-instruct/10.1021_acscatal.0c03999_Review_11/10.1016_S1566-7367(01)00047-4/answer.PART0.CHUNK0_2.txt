[1] "The document describes and compares the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches."

[2] "The reaction conditions for each method are analyzed, and the reactivity of propane in these processes is compared to that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane."
