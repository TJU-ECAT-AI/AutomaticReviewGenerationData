[1] "The delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production in shale gas reservoirs following hydraulic fracturing has been attributed to the release of organic sulfur compounds during the process."
[2] "Hydrolysis of these sulfur-containing compounds, especially those with thiol groups, leads to the formation of H2S over time."
[3] "Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene have been explored."
[4] "These include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches."
[5] "In dehydrogenation with halogens, propane reacts with halogenated species under high temperature and pressure conditions."
[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen or air as an oxidizing agent."
[7] "Oxyhalogenation utilizes halogenated species and oxygen under specific conditions."
[8] "Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides as catalysts."
[9] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes due to its structure and the presence of multiple hydrogen atoms."
[10] "The presence of hydrogen in propane facilitates more extensive dehydrogenation reactions compared to methane and ethane."

Hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds during hydraulic fracturing in shale gas reservoirs leads to the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide production. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Propane's reactivity in these processes is significantly different from that of other alkanes, primarily due to its structure and the presence of multiple hydrogen atoms, which enables more extensive dehydrogenation reactions.

在页岩气藏的水力压裂过程中，有机硫化合物的水解导致氢化物的延迟产生。用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法包括使用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐法。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其它烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）有很大不同，主要是由于其结构以及存在多个氢原子，这使得更广泛的脱氢反应成为可能。
