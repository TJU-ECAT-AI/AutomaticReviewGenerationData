[1] "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas produced during the extraction of hydrocarbons."
[2] "The delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide production was attributed to the interaction between the fracturing fluid and the shale matrix."
[3] "Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene were discussed, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches."
[4] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differed significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex interactions."

Describing and comparing the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene involves understanding the processes of dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Propane's reactivity in these processes is notably different from other alkanes like methane and ethane because of its larger size and more intricate interactions.
