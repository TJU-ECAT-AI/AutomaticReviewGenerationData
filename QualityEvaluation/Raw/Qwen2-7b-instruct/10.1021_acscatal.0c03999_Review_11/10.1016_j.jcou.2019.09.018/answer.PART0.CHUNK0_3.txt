2.1. Materials preparation

The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550 C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight.

Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis methodwet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was con- tacted with solution containing 3.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.

In this study, the preparation of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involved the following steps:

1. Synthesis of AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 by calcination of TEABeta in air at 550°C for 15 hours.
2. Preparation of SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 by treating TEABeta with 13 mol L^-1 HNO3 solution at 80°C for 4 hours, followed by washing with distilled water and drying at 95°C overnight.
3. Obtaining chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts via a two-step post-synthesis method involving wet impregnation. The SiBeta was treated with aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing Cr(NO3)3·9H2O at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 15.2·10^3 mol L^-1, while AlBeta was treated with a solution containing 3.2·10^3 mol L^-1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.

在本研究中，通过以下步骤制备了用于在二氧化碳辅助下进行丙烷脱氢的铬含量Beta沸石催化剂：

1. 通过在空气中于550°C下煅烧四乙基铵Beta（TEABeta）母沸石合成具有17 Si/Al原子比的AlBeta支持材料。
2. 通过将TEABeta处理在80°C的13 mol L^-1 HNO3溶液中4小时，然后用蒸馏水清洗并于95°C下干燥过夜，制备具有1000 Si/Al原子比的SiBeta支持材料。
3. 通过两步后合成方法获得含铬SiBeta催化剂，涉及湿浸渍。对SiBeta用浓度从0.8到15.2·10^3 mol L^-1的Cr(NO3)3·9H2O水溶液处理，而对AlBeta用含3.2·10^3 mol L^-1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O的溶液处理。
