<p>Due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation.</p>
<p>Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties.</p>
<p>The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed.</p>

The document does not specifically describe halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, nor does it compare these methods to oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the development of chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-PDH using dealuminated Beta zeolites. Propane's reactivity in CO2-PDH differs from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the unique interaction between chromium species and CO2, enabling both non-oxidative and oxidative pathways for propene formation.

The CO2-PDH process utilizes chromium oxide-based catalysts, which are dispersed on supports like SiBeta or AlBeta. The dealumination step improves the catalyst's properties, especially in terms of acidity and dispersion, leading to enhanced selectivity towards propene. The presence of redox chromium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves complex mechanisms that include non-oxidative dehydrogenation with Cr(II) or Cr(III) participation and various redox mechanisms involving CO2 as a mild oxidant in an oxidative pathway.

文档没有具体描述卤素辅助方法对丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯，也没有将这些方法与氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法进行比较。它专注于开发用于CO2-PDH的铬氧化物基催化剂，使用去铝化的贝塔沸石。在CO2-PDH过程中，丙烷的反应性与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于铬物种与CO2的独特相互作用，使得非氧化性和氧化途径均能形成丙烯。

CO2-PDH过程利用铬氧化物基催化剂，这些催化剂分散在SiBeta或AlBeta等支持物上。去铝化步骤可以改善催化剂的性能，尤其是在酸性和分散性方面，从而提高丙烯的选择性。红氧化铬物种的存在对于实现CO2-PDH中的高催化性能至关重要。

丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢涉及复杂的机制，包括Cr(II)或Cr(III)参与的非氧化脱氢以及涉及CO2作为温和氧化剂的氧化途径的各种还原性机制。
