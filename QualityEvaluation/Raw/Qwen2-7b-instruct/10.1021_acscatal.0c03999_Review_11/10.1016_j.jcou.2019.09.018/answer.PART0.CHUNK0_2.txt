<p>Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation.</p>
<p>Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.</p>

The document describes a two-step process for preparing Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. In the first step, aluminum is removed from TEABeta zeolite using nitric acid to create an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio. In the second step, chromium is added to the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The study found that the removal of aluminum (dealumination) significantly affects the catalytic properties of the resulting chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. Furthermore, the catalysts showed enhanced propene formation rates when operated in a mode with CO2 present, compared to when CO2 was absent, indicating the importance of CO2 in the catalytic process.

文档描述了制备Cr-含有的Beta沸石催化剂的两步法。第一步是使用硝酸从TEABeta沸石中去除铝，以获得一个高Si/Al比的无铝SiBeta支持体。第二步是通过湿浸渍将铬添加到硅质SiBeta沸石结构中。研究发现，去除铝（脱铝）显著影响了最终得到的铬-含有的Beta沸石催化剂的催化性能。此外，当在有CO2存在的模式下操作时，催化剂表现出增强的丙烯形成速率，与没有CO2的情况相比，这表明CO2在催化过程中的重要性。
