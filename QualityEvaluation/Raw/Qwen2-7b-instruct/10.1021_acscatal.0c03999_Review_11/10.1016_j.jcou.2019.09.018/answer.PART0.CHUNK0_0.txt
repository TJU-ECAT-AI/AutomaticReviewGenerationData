[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

The research focuses on developing active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation, specifically utilizing CO2 in assistance. Beta zeolite is chosen due to its three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and substantial specific surface area, which are essential for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The study involves a two-step post-synthesis process: first, removing aluminum from TEABeta zeolite to achieve an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio. Subsequently, various amounts of chromium are introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield is determined up to 2 wt % of Cr. The dealumination process significantly affects the catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta favoring high selectivity to propene (over 80%), while high acidity of the starting AlBeta leads to propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene increases when using the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst shows a negative impact on the propene formation rate.

研究专注于开发在CO2辅助下促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯的活性和选择性催化剂。选择Beta沸石是因为其三维结构、较大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及所需的大量比表面积，这些对于实现铬氧化物物种的高分散至关重要。研究涉及两步后合成过程：首先，通过硝酸溶液处理TEABeta沸石来去除铝，从而获得无铝的SiBeta支持体，其Si/Al原子比达到1000。随后，通过湿浸渍方法将不同量的铬引入硅质SiBeta沸石结构中。确定了红氧化铬位点的数量与最高至2 wt %的Cr产率之间的相关性。去铝化过程对催化性能有重大影响，低酸度的SiBeta有助于实现高于80%的选择性丙烯，而高酸度的起始AlBeta则导致丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。此外，在丙烷脱氢模式切换时，使用Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂时丙烯生成速率增加，而在使用Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂时观察到丙烯生成速率下降。
