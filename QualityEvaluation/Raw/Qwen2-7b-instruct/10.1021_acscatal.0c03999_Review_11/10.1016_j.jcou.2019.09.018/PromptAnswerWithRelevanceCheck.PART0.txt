The research focuses on developing active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation, specifically utilizing CO2 in assistance. Beta zeolite is chosen due to its three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and substantial specific surface area, which are essential for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The study involves a two-step post-synthesis process: first, removing aluminum from TEABeta zeolite to achieve an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio. Subsequently, various amounts of chromium are introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield is determined up to 2 wt % of Cr. The dealumination process significantly affects the catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta favoring high selectivity to propene (over 80%), while high acidity of the starting AlBeta leads to propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene increases when using the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst shows a negative impact on the propene formation rate.

研究专注于开发在CO2辅助下促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯的活性和选择性催化剂。选择Beta沸石是因为其三维结构、较大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及所需的大量比表面积，这些对于实现铬氧化物物种的高分散至关重要。研究涉及两步后合成过程：首先，通过硝酸溶液处理TEABeta沸石来去除铝，从而获得无铝的SiBeta支持体，其Si/Al原子比达到1000。随后，通过湿浸渍方法将不同量的铬引入硅质SiBeta沸石结构中。确定了红氧化铬位点的数量与最高至2 wt %的Cr产率之间的相关性。去铝化过程对催化性能有重大影响，低酸度的SiBeta有助于实现高于80%的选择性丙烯，而高酸度的起始AlBeta则导致丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。此外，在丙烷脱氢模式切换时，使用Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂时丙烯生成速率增加，而在使用Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂时观察到丙烯生成速率下降。

The document does not specifically describe halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, nor does it compare these methods to oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the development of chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-PDH using dealuminated Beta zeolites. Propane's reactivity in CO2-PDH differs from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the unique interaction between chromium species and CO2, enabling both non-oxidative and oxidative pathways for propene formation.

The CO2-PDH process utilizes chromium oxide-based catalysts, which are dispersed on supports like SiBeta or AlBeta. The dealumination step improves the catalyst's properties, especially in terms of acidity and dispersion, leading to enhanced selectivity towards propene. The presence of redox chromium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves complex mechanisms that include non-oxidative dehydrogenation with Cr(II) or Cr(III) participation and various redox mechanisms involving CO2 as a mild oxidant in an oxidative pathway.

文档没有具体描述卤素辅助方法对丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯，也没有将这些方法与氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法进行比较。它专注于开发用于CO2-PDH的铬氧化物基催化剂，使用去铝化的贝塔沸石。在CO2-PDH过程中，丙烷的反应性与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于铬物种与CO2的独特相互作用，使得非氧化性和氧化途径均能形成丙烯。

CO2-PDH过程利用铬氧化物基催化剂，这些催化剂分散在SiBeta或AlBeta等支持物上。去铝化步骤可以改善催化剂的性能，尤其是在酸性和分散性方面，从而提高丙烯的选择性。红氧化铬物种的存在对于实现CO2-PDH中的高催化性能至关重要。

丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢涉及复杂的机制，包括Cr(II)或Cr(III)参与的非氧化脱氢以及涉及CO2作为温和氧化剂的氧化途径的各种还原性机制。

The document describes a two-step process for preparing Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. In the first step, aluminum is removed from TEABeta zeolite using nitric acid to create an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio. In the second step, chromium is added to the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The study found that the removal of aluminum (dealumination) significantly affects the catalytic properties of the resulting chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. Furthermore, the catalysts showed enhanced propene formation rates when operated in a mode with CO2 present, compared to when CO2 was absent, indicating the importance of CO2 in the catalytic process.
