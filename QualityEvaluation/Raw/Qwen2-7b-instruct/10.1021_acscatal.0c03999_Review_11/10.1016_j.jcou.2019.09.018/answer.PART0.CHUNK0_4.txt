2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550 C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight.
Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis methodwet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was con- tacted with solution containing 3.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.
Then, the separation of the solids from the suspensions were done in evaporator under vacuum of a membrane pump for 2 h in air at 60 C.
Finally, all materials were calcined at 550 C for 6 h. The sample with SiBeta contained 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 7 wt % of Cr were labelled as Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta, Cr2.0SiBeta, Cr5.0SiBeta and Cr7.0SiBeta and this with AlBeta, containing 2 wt % of Cr was labelled as Cr2.0AlBeta.

In the study, Beta zeolites were utilized as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The preparation of the catalysts involved two steps. Firstly, the AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcining tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) in air at 550°C for 15 hours. Subsequently, the SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was derived from TEABeta through treatment with 13 mol/L HNO3 at 80°C for 4 hours, followed by washing with distilled water and drying at 95°C overnight. Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were synthesized using a two-step post-synthesis method involving wet impregnation. The procedure included contacting the SiBeta with an aqueous chromium nitrate solution containing 0.8 to 15.2·10^3 mol/L Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and the AlBeta with a solution containing 3.2·10^3 mol/L Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. The solids were separated from the suspensions using a membrane pump under vacuum at 60°C for 2 hours in air. Finally, all materials were calcined at 550°C for 6 hours. The catalysts labeled with SiBeta contained 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 7 wt% of Cr as Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta, Cr2.0SiBeta, Cr5.0SiBeta, and Cr7.0SiBeta respectively. Meanwhile, the catalyst labeled with AlBeta contained 2 wt% of Cr as Cr2.0AlBeta.

在研究中，使用了Beta沸石作为在二氧化碳辅助下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯的催化剂。催化剂的制备涉及两步。首先，通过在空气中于550°C下煅烧四乙基铵Beta（TEABeta）得到具有Si/Al原子比为17的AlBeta支持体。接着，通过用13 mol/L HNO3处理TEABeta并在80°C下反应4小时来获得具有Si/Al原子比为1000的SiBeta支持体，然后用水清洗并于95°C下干燥过夜。通过湿浸渍方法合成含铬的SiBeta催化剂。该过程包括将SiBeta与含有0.8至15.2·10^3 mol/L Cr(NO3)3·9H2O的水溶液接触以及将AlBeta与含有3.2·10^3 mol/L Cr(NO3)3·9H2O的溶液接触。固体从悬浮液中分离，使用膜泵在60°C下在空气中进行2小时的真空操作。最后，所有材料均在550°C下煅烧6小时。标记为SiBeta的催化剂分别含有0.5、1、2、5和7 wt%的Cr，分别为Cr0.5SiBeta、Cr1.0SiBeta、Cr2.0SiBeta、Cr5.0SiBeta和Cr7.0SiBeta。同时，标记为AlBeta的催化剂含有2 wt%的Cr，名为Cr2.0AlBeta。
