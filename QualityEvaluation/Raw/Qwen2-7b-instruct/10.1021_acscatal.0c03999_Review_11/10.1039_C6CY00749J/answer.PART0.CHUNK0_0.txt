[1] "We examined both the heterolytic and homolytic pathways on Co3O4(111) surface."
[2] "We find that the water formation step is the least energetically favored step and a possible rate-determining step in the overall catalytic cycle."
[3] "The coverage effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the catalytic pathways thus warrants further studies."
[4] "These insights will help understand the role of the surface orientation of the Co3O4 nanocatalysts in improving the selectivity and yield of alkane to alkene conversion through ODH."

The document does not provide information about halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on Co3O4 nanorods. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes or information provided in the document to answer the questions about halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene.

文档没有提供关于使用卤素辅助的方法选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯的信息，包括用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。它专注于在Co3O4纳米棒上进行乙烷的氧化脱氢。因此，文档中没有相关引用或信息来回答有关选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯的卤素辅助方法的问题。
