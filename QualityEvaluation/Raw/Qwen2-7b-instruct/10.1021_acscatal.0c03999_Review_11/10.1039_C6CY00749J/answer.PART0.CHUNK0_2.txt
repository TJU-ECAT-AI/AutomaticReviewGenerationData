The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane on Co3O4 nanorods. It explains that both lattice oxygen (O) and cobalt (Co) can act as active sites in the dehydrogenation process, with the lattice-O pathway being favored. The study identifies water formation as the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle. It also mentions that while both the homolytic and heterolytic pathways might contribute to ethylene formation, quantifying their relative contributions is challenging without kinetic analysis. The document further notes that the activation barrier for the C-H bond cleavage is significant in determining the overall reaction rates.

文档讨论了乙烷在Co3O4纳米棒上的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。它解释说，晶格氧（O）和钴（Co）都可以作为脱氢过程中的活性位点，晶格-O路径被优先考虑。研究发现水形成是催化循环中的决定性步骤。它还提到，虽然同裂解和异裂解途径都可能参与乙烯的形成，但量化它们的相对贡献在没有动力学分析的情况下非常困难。文档进一步指出，C-H键断裂的活化壁垒对于确定整体反应速率至关重要。
