<questions>

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

[1] "We examined both the heterolytic and homolytic pathways on Co3O4(111) surface."
[2] "We find that the water formation step is the least energetically favored step and a possible rate-determining step in the overall catalytic cycle."
[3] "The coverage effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the catalytic pathways thus warrants further studies."
[4] "These insights will help understand the role of the surface orientation of the Co3O4 nanocatalysts in improving the selectivity and yield of alkane to alkene conversion through ODH."

The document does not provide information about halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on Co3O4 nanorods. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes or information provided in the document to answer the questions about halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene.

[1] "Understanding oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on Co3O4 nanorods from density functional theory Victor Fung,1 Franklin (Feng) Tao,2 De-en Jiang1,*"
[2] "We find that both lattice O and Co may participate as active sites in the dehydrogenation, with the lattice-O pathway being favored."
[3] "We find that the water formation step of the catalytic cycle on the pure (111) surface appears to be the RDS, while experiments shows that changing the alkane will change the overall barriers,54 thus suggesting that the C-H activation barrier is significant to the overall rates."
[4] "In reality, it is likely for both pathways to participate in the formation of ethylene; however, without further kinetic analysis it would be very difficult to quantify their respective contributions towards forming the ODH product."
[5] "We find that the water formation step of the catalytic cycle on the pure (111) surface appears to be the RDS, while experiments shows that changing the alkane will change the overall barriers,54 thus suggesting that the C-H activation barrier is significant to the overall rates."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane on Co3O4 nanorods. It explains that both lattice oxygen (O) and cobalt (Co) can act as active sites in the dehydrogenation process, with the lattice-O pathway being favored. The study identifies water formation as the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle. It also mentions that while both the homolytic and heterolytic pathways might contribute to ethylene formation, quantifying their relative contributions is challenging without kinetic analysis. The document further notes that the activation barrier for the C-H bond cleavage is significant in determining the overall reaction rates.

文档讨论了乙烷在Co3O4纳米棒上的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。它解释说，晶格氧（O）和钴（Co）都可以作为脱氢过程中的活性位点，晶格-O路径被优先考虑。研究发现水形成是催化循环中的决定性步骤。它还提到，虽然同裂解和异裂解途径都可能参与乙烯的形成，但量化它们的相对贡献在没有动力学分析的情况下非常困难。文档进一步指出，C-H键断裂的活化壁垒对于确定整体反应速率至关重要。

[1] "We examined both the heterolytic and homolytic pathways on Co3O4(111) surface."
[2] "We found that for ethane, the first step of the reaction occurs via the activation of its C-H bond over either the Co2+ or the OA / OB atoms."
[3] "While the first C-H activation is strongly favored towards the O-activated homolytic pathway, the second C-H activation is in fact more favored towards the heterolytic pathway."
[4] "The vacancy formation energy and Bader charge of the lattice oxygen to be a good descriptor of the catalytic activity of the lattice oxygen."
[5] "We find that the water formation step of the catalytic cycle on the pure (111) surface appears to be the RDS."
[6] "Overall, we found the barriers for the first C-H activation to be lower for the homolytic pathway (0.62 eV), but the barriers for the second C-H activation to be lower for the heterolytic pathway."
[7] "The cleaved hydrogen from C2H6 forms hydroxyl groups on Co3O4(111), which can cluster via hydrogen diffusion."
[8] "Water formation from nearby hydroxyl groups and desorption to leave oxygen vacancy on the surface were found to have a large activation energy (2.02 eV) and is likely to be the rate-determining step."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane on the Co3O4(111) surface involves both homolytic and heterolytic pathways. The first C-H activation prefers the O-activated homolytic pathway, facilitated by the lattice oxygen (OA) with a barrier of 0.62 eV. The second C-H activation is more favorable through the heterolytic pathway, which involves lattice cobalt (Co2+) with barriers ranging from 0.39 to 1.03 eV. Hydroxyl groups are formed from the cleaved hydrogen and can cluster via hydrogen diffusion. Water formation, which requires a large activation energy of 2.02 eV, is identified as the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle.

在Co3O4(111)表面的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中，涉及异裂和同裂途径。第一个C-H活化更倾向于由表面氧原子（OA）促进的异裂途径，具有0.62 eV的壁垒。第二个C-H活化更倾向于通过异裂途径，涉及表面钴（Co2+），壁垒范围从0.39到1.03 eV。从断裂的氢形成的羟基可以进行氢扩散聚集体。水形成被确定为催化循环中的决速步骤，需要高达2.02 eV的活化能。
