The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane on the Co3O4(111) surface involves both homolytic and heterolytic pathways. The first C-H activation prefers the O-activated homolytic pathway, facilitated by the lattice oxygen (OA) with a barrier of 0.62 eV. The second C-H activation is more favorable through the heterolytic pathway, which involves lattice cobalt (Co2+) with barriers ranging from 0.39 to 1.03 eV. Hydroxyl groups are formed from the cleaved hydrogen and can cluster via hydrogen diffusion. Water formation, which requires a large activation energy of 2.02 eV, is identified as the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle.

在Co3O4(111)表面的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中，涉及异裂和同裂途径。第一个C-H活化更倾向于由表面氧原子（OA）促进的异裂途径，具有0.62 eV的壁垒。第二个C-H活化更倾向于通过异裂途径，涉及表面钴（Co2+），壁垒范围从0.39到1.03 eV。从断裂的氢形成的羟基可以进行氢扩散聚集体。水形成被确定为催化循环中的决速步骤，需要高达2.02 eV的活化能。
