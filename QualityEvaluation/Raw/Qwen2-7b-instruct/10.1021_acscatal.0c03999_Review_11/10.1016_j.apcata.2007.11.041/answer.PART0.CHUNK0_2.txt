[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
CH4  CO2 ! 2CO  2H2
(1)"

[2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."

[3] "The dry reforming reaction is accompanied by several side reactions, of which the reverse watergas shift reaction (2), the methane cracking reaction (3) and the Boudouard reaction (4) appears to be the most important:
CO2  H2 ! CO  H2O
(2)
CH4 ! C  2H2
(3)
2CO ! C  CO2
(4)"

[4] "Nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

[5] "The addition of promoters [2,9,12,13]..."

[6] "The preparation method and the pretreatment of the unmodified Applied Catalysis A: General 343 (2008) 1015 A R T I C L E"

[7] "The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation."

[8] "The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."

[9] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."

[10] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

[11] "Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface,increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metalsupport interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles."

[12] "It has been proposed that potassium migrates from the support to the surface of nickel and neutralizes a fraction of the most active sites for the reforming reaction producing, as a consequence, a decrease in methane conversion."

The document describes the CO2 reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas, a process that generates a low H2/CO ratio suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This process is accompanied by side reactions such as the reverse watergas shift, methane cracking, and Boudouard reactions. Nickel is the preferred catalyst for this reaction, but it is prone to deactivation due to carbon deposition on its active centers. Promoters are added to improve the catalyst's activity and selectivity, delay sintering, and prevent carbon deposition. The document also discusses the preparation of a nickel-alumina catalyst via a solgel method, which exhibits high activity and stability in the methane dry reforming reaction. The introduction of small amounts of metals like potassium, calcium, manganese, and tin affects the catalyst's activity and carbon deposition. Potassium incorporation reduces carbon deposition and maintains high stability, while other metals lead to a dramatic reduction in activity and increased carbon deposition. The incorporation of potassium modifies the metal-support interaction, increases reducibility, and alters neither the size nor structure of the nickel particles.

文档描述了二氧化碳重整甲烷产生合成气的过程，该过程产生了低H2/CO比率，适用于费歇尔-特罗希合成网络。此过程伴随有逆水煤气变换、甲烷裂解和布杜瓦反应等副反应。镍是此反应的理想催化剂，但因其活性中心容易被碳沉积而失活。添加助剂可以提高催化剂的活性和选择性、延缓结块并防止碳沉积。文档还讨论了通过溶胶法制备镍铝氧化物催化剂，该催化剂在甲烷干重整反应中表现出高活性和稳定性。向催化剂中加入少量金属如钾、钙、锰、锡等影响催化剂的活性和碳沉积。钾的引入减少了碳沉积，并保持了高稳定性。其他金属导致活性大幅下降和碳沉积显著增加。钾的引入修改了金属-载体相互作用，增加了还原性，并且既没有改变镍颗粒的大小也没有改变结构。
