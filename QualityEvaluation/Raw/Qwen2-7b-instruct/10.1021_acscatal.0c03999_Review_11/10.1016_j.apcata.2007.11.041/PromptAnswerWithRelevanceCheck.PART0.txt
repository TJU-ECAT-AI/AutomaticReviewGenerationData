[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
[2] This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network.
[3] Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction.
[4] However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers.
[5] In relation to the latter variable, it can be mentioned that interesting points are the nature of the promoter, and the amount used.
[6] Hou et al. [3] studied the influence of Ca on the performance of Ni/a-Al2O3 catalysts in the dry reforming reaction, reporting that it depends upon the properties of the support and the amount of added Ca.
[7] The effect of alkali promoters (Na, Li, K) on Ni/MgO was studied by Arena et al. [14], who reported that alkali promoters affect the reducibility, the morphology, the active surface area and the electronic properties of the catalyst.
[8] Stagg et al. [16] report the promoting effect of Sn on Pt catalysts if special preparation methods are used, resulting in the controlled placement of Sn on the Pt particle, minimizing the promotersupport interaction.
[9] In this paper, the effect of the addition of the metals K, Sn, Mn, and Ca to a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst obtained via solgel is studied.
[10] The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation.
[11] The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period.
[12] In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study.
[13] The results obtained in this work with the K-containing catalysts can be explained on the basis of these conclusions.
[14] The analysis of the reaction products (H2 and CO) reveals that the presence of the modifier produces a decrease of the H2/CO ratio (from 0.97 with Ni-Al2O3 to 0.4 with Ni-K-Al2O3).
[15] In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon.
[16] The addition of a small amount of potassium has an important effect in reducing the amount of carbon deposited (from 60 mg C/g cat. for the unmodified catalyst to less than 10 mg C/g cat. for the sample with 0.5 wt.% potassium).

This literature discusses the CO2 reforming of methane, a process that has gained renewed interest due to its potential industrial applications. Nickel is the most suitable catalyst for this reaction, though it is prone to deactivation by carbon deposition. The literature explores the use of promoters, such as calcium, sodium, lithium, potassium, manganese, tin, and calcium, to improve catalyst performance. Promoters can affect the reducibility, morphology, active surface area, and electronic properties of the catalyst. The study focuses on the impact of potassium, tin, manganese, and calcium on a nickel-alumina catalyst prepared via sol-gel method. The unmodified catalyst performs effectively in methane dry reforming, showing low carbon deposition and stable catalytic activity over 30 hours. The addition of 0.5 wt.% of potassium, tin, manganese, and calcium leads to varying outcomes. Potassium addition reduces carbon deposition, maintains constant but slightly decreased activity, while calcium, manganese, and tin cause significant reductions in catalytic activity and substantial carbon deposition. The results suggest that potassium addition affects the catalyst's reducibility, modifies the metal-support interaction, and prevents carbon deposition without altering the nickel particle size or structure.

本文讨论了二氧化碳与甲烷重整反应，该过程近年来引起了新的兴趣，因为它在工业中的潜在作用。镍是最适合这种反应的催化剂，但容易因活性中心上碳沉积而失效。文献研究了钙、钠、锂、钾、锰、锡和钙等促进剂对镍/铝氧化物催化剂的影响。促进剂可以影响催化剂的可还原性、形态、活性表面积和电子性质。研究关注钾、锡、锰和钙对通过溶胶法制备的镍-氧化铝催化剂的影响。未改性的催化剂在甲烷干重整中表现良好，显示出低碳沉积和超过30小时操作期间的稳定催化活性。添加0.5 wt.%的钾、锡、锰和钙导致不同的结果。钾的添加减少了碳沉积，保持了恒定但略有降低的活性，而钙、锰和锡则导致催化活性显著降低和大量积碳。结果表明，钾的添加影响催化剂的可还原性、修改金属-支持相互作用，并防止碳沉积，同时不改变镍颗粒大小或结构。

The document describes the CO2 reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas, a process that generates a low H2/CO ratio suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This process is accompanied by side reactions such as the reverse watergas shift, methane cracking, and Boudouard reactions. Nickel is the preferred catalyst for this reaction, but it is prone to deactivation due to carbon deposition on its active centers. Promoters are added to improve the catalyst's activity and selectivity, delay sintering, and prevent carbon deposition. The document also discusses the preparation of a nickel-alumina catalyst via a solgel method, which exhibits high activity and stability in the methane dry reforming reaction. The introduction of small amounts of metals like potassium, calcium, manganese, and tin affects the catalyst's activity and carbon deposition. Potassium incorporation reduces carbon deposition and maintains high stability, while other metals lead to a dramatic reduction in activity and increased carbon deposition. The incorporation of potassium modifies the metal-support interaction, increases reducibility, and alters neither the size nor structure of the nickel particles.

The study focused on the use of a modified Ni-Al2O3 catalyst for the CO2 reforming of methane. The catalyst was prepared via a solgel method, and the influence of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) was investigated. The unmodified catalyst exhibited high and stable catalytic activity in the methane dry reforming reaction. When the metals were added, the K-modified catalyst showed slightly reduced but constant activity, with lower carbon deposition compared to the original catalyst after 30 hours of operation. The K-modifier helped reduce carbon deposition, maintained stability, and improved reducibility, without affecting the size or structure of nickel particles.
