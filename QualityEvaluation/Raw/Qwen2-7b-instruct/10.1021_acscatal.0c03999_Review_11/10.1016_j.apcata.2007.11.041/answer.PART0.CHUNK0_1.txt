[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
CH4  CO2 ! 2CO  2H2
(1)"

[2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."

[3] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."

[4] "However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

[5] "In relation to the latter variable, it can be mentioned that interesting points are the nature of the promoter, and the amount used."

[6] "Ca improves Ni diffusion, strengthens Ni-Al2O3 interaction and delays Ni sintering."

[7] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst,only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."

[8] "Stagg et al. [16] report the promoting effect of Sn on Pt catalysts if special preparation methods are used, resulting in the controlled placement of Sn on the Pt particle, minimizing the promotersupport interaction."

[9] "The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation."

[10] "For the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."

[11] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."

[12] "In the case of the Ca, Mn and Sn-modified catalysts, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."

[13] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."

[14] "Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface,increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metalsupport interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles."

1. The CO2 reforming of methane, converting it into synthesis gas, has recently gained attention for its potential industrial applications, particularly in generating synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

2. Nickel is the preferred catalyst for this process due to its availability and low cost, but it is susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition on its active sites.

3. Promoters can be used to improve the performance of nickel-based catalysts. For example, calcium can enhance nickel diffusion, strengthen the interaction between nickel and aluminum oxide, and delay sintering.

4. Among the tested promoters, only cobalt, copper, and zirconium showed slight improvements in activity in the dry reforming reaction, whereas others decreased activity.

5. Stagg et al. noted that tin can have a promotional effect on platinum catalysts with specific preparation methods that control tin placement on the particle surface, minimizing promoter-support interaction.

6. The unmodified catalyst demonstrated effective methane dry reforming with minimal carbon deposition and consistent high catalytic activity over 30 hours of operation.

7. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited stable but slightly diminished activity and reduced carbon deposition compared to the unmodified catalyst after 30 hours of operation.

8. In contrast, the calcium, manganese, and tin-modified catalysts showed a significant reduction in catalytic activity and substantial carbon deposition during the study period.

9. The Ca-, Mn-, and Sn-modified catalysts experienced a dramatic decrease in activity and increased carbon deposition over the observation period.

10. The potassium-modified catalyst maintained low carbon deposition and high stability in its catalytic activity throughout 30 hours of operation.

11. Potassium incorporation hindered carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increased reducibility, possibly altered metal-support interaction, and did not alter nickel particle size or structure.

1. 近年来，二氧化碳与甲烷反应生成合成气（干重整）引起了新的关注，尤其是由于产生的合成气具有较低的H2/CO比率，可以优先用于费希尔-特罗普斯合成网络中液态烃的生产。

2. 镍因其可用性和低成本而成为反应的最佳催化剂，但其易因活性中心上碳沉积而失效。

3. 添加剂可以改善镍基催化剂的性能。例如，钙可以增强镍的扩散，强化镍与氧化铝之间的相互作用，并延迟烧结。

4. 在测试的添加剂中，仅钴、铜和锆在干重整反应中显示出轻微的活性提高，而其他添加剂则降低了活性。

5. 斯塔格等人指出，通过特定的制备方法控制锡在铂粒子表面的放置，可以利用锡对铂催化剂产生促进效果，同时最小化促进剂-支持交互作用。

6. 未改性催化剂在甲烷干重整中表现出有效，且碳沉积量低，催化活性在30小时的操作过程中保持稳定。

7. 钾改性催化剂的活动略有降低，但碳沉积量减少，在30小时的操作后与未改性催化剂相比显示出稳定的催化活性。

8. 相反，钙、锰和锡改性催化剂的催化活性显著下降，并且碳沉积量增加，在观察期内。

9. 钙、锰和锡改性催化剂的催化活性显著下降，并且碳沉积量增加，在观察期内。

10. 钾改性催化剂在整个30小时操作过程中维持了低碳沉积量和高稳定性催化活性。

11. 钾的引入阻止了催化剂表面的碳积累，增加了可还原性，可能改变了金属-支持交互作用，并没有改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。
