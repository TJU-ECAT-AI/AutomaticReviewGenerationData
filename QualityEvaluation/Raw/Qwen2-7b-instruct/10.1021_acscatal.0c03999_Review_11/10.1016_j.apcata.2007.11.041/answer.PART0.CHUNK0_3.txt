[1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
[2] "The unmodified catalyst proved to be very active, selective and stable in the methane dry reforming reaction."
[3] "The addition of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."
[4] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."
[5] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

The study focused on the use of a modified Ni-Al2O3 catalyst for the CO2 reforming of methane. The catalyst was prepared via a solgel method, and the influence of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) was investigated. The unmodified catalyst exhibited high and stable catalytic activity in the methane dry reforming reaction. When the metals were added, the K-modified catalyst showed slightly reduced but constant activity, with lower carbon deposition compared to the original catalyst after 30 hours of operation. The K-modifier helped reduce carbon deposition, maintained stability, and improved reducibility, without affecting the size or structure of nickel particles.

该研究主要关注了使用改性Ni-Al2O3催化剂进行CO2重整甲烷的应用。催化剂通过溶胶法制备，研究了钾（K）、钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn）的影响。未改性的催化剂在甲烷干重整反应中表现出高活性和稳定性。当添加金属时，K改性催化剂显示出略低但稳定的活性，并且在30小时运行后碳沉积量比原始催化剂低。K修饰剂有助于减少碳沉积、保持稳定性和改善还原性，而不会影响镍颗粒的大小或结构。
