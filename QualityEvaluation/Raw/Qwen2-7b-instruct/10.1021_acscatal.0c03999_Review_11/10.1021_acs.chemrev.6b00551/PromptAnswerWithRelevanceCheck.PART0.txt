[1] "Halogen-mediated functionalization of hydrocarbons, which has a long history in fine chemical synthesis, has emerged as a particularly attractive approach for the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under mild conditions (Figure 27)."

[2] "The direct halogenation of alkane produces alkyl halides that are deemed as versatile building blocks to synthesize a broad spectrum of commodities following an additional halide elimination step in which the halogen atom is eliminated in the form of HX. (61, 194, 264)"

[3] "Disadvantageously, the maximal halogen efficiency in halogenation is restricted to 50%, with the rest of halogen ending up as HX. Thus, both the halogenation and subsequent transformation of alkyl halides release HX, which has to be recycled in order to close the loop of expensive halogens (Figure 27, top, green)."

[4] "An integrated process for the functionalization of natural gas with bromine was proposed by McFarland and Stucky et al. in 2003. (277-280) A multiple-step conversion from methane to oxygenates (methanol and dimethyl ether, DME) was disclosed in the patent, comprising methane bromination and metal oxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl bromide in separate reactors."

[5] "This process based on the catalysts is quite similar to the EVC route, as both employed the fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for chlorinated byproduct recycling. However, chlorine can be directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, thus the chlorination step is omitted."

[6] "Still, the limited selling option and high cost for neutralizing HCl triggered the industrial and academic research in the past decade to hunt for novel catalysts capable of overcoming the above issues, particularly in relation to chlorine recycling in PU and PC manufactures."

Halogen-mediated functionalization of hydrocarbons, including dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and dehydrogenation with halogens, offers a selective activation of light hydrocarbons under mild conditions. The direct halogenation of alkanes generates alkyl halides, which are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of commodities through additional halide elimination. The efficiency of halogenation is capped at 50%, leaving the remainder as HX, which must be recycled to close the loop of expensive halogens. An integrated process was proposed by McFarland and Stucky for the functionalization of natural gas with bromine, involving separate reactors for methane bromination and the metal oxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl bromide. This process omits the chlorination step, unlike traditional methods. The limited market for HCl and its high neutralization cost have spurred recent research efforts to develop novel catalysts capable of addressing these challenges, particularly for the recycling of chlorine in the production of polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride (PU and PC).

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."
[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."
[3] "A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl."
[4] "Metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation was developed to overcome the drawbacks encountered in the direct iodination of hydrocarbons."
[5] "The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses various methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. These methods include halogen-assisted dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and using molten metal halide salts. 

Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation involves the use of halogens like iodine. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation has been found to give higher propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation methods. A radical reaction mechanism similar to ethylene oxychlorination is proposed for copper-based catalysts, which involves a redox cycle between copper chloride and copper chloride.

Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen to enhance the dehydrogenation process. Metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation is a technique developed to overcome limitations encountered in direct iodination of hydrocarbons. The functions of metal iodides in dehydrogenation are not fully understood yet.

The dehydrogenation of propane differs significantly from that of other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its reactivity and the specific conditions required for efficient conversion. Propane's structure allows for more facile dehydrogenation to propene, potentially due to its larger size and ability to form stronger bonds, which can be broken more easily under certain conditions. This contrasts with methane and ethane, which may require higher temperatures or more specialized catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation effectively.

文档讨论了用于选择性将丙烷转化为丙烯的各种方法。这些方法包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和使用熔融金属卤化物盐。

卤素辅助脱氢涉及使用卤素，如碘。碘介导的脱氢通常能给出比传统脱氢路线更高的丙烯产率。对于铜基催化剂，提出了一种类似于乙烯氧氯化的自由基反应机制，该机制涉及铜氯化物和铜氯化物之间的还原氧化循环。

氧化脱氢利用氧气增强脱氢过程。开发了金属碘化物催化氧化脱氢技术，以克服直接碘化氢化过程中遇到的问题。金属碘化物在脱氢中的作用尚未完全理解。

丙烷的脱氢与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃存在显著差异，这是由于其反应性和实现有效转换所需的特定条件。丙烷的结构允许更方便地脱氢为丙烯，可能是因为其较大的尺寸和能够形成更强的键，这些键更容易在某些条件下被打破。相比之下，甲烷和乙烷可能需要更高的温度或更特殊的催化剂才能有效地进行脱氢。

The halogen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane to propene has been explored through several methods. These include halogen dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions for these methods differ significantly:

1. Halogen dehydrogenation involves using halogen compounds as the catalyst for the reaction. Propane's reactivity in this process is influenced by the specific halogen used, as halogens have different affinities for hydrogen atoms. This method can selectively dehydrogenate propane to propene, but its commercialization has faced challenges.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen in the dehydrogenation process. This method can be more selective and efficient than halogen dehydrogenation, but it also requires higher temperatures and pressures.

3. Oxyhalogenation combines halogen and oxygen to catalyze the dehydrogenation. This method offers potential for higher selectivity and efficiency, but it also faces technical challenges related to catalyst design and process optimization.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve using a molten salt mixture of metal halides as the reaction medium. This method can provide a unique environment for the reaction, potentially improving selectivity and efficiency. However, the use of molten salts introduces additional safety concerns and process complexity.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation. Propane, with its larger alkyl group, requires a higher degree of activation compared to smaller alkanes. This necessitates the use of stronger catalysts and higher energy inputs in the dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, the presence of a double bond in propane allows for more complex reaction pathways, affecting the selectivity towards propene over other products.

1. 卤素脱氢利用卤素化合物作为催化剂进行反应。丙烷在该过程中的反应活性受所用卤素的影响，因为卤素对氢原子有不同的亲和力。这种方法可以选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，但其商业化应用遇到了挑战。

2. 氧化脱氢利用氧气作为脱氢剂。这种方法在选择性和效率方面可能比卤素脱氢更优越，但也需要更高的温度和压力。

3. 氧卤化结合卤素和氧气作为催化剂进行脱氢。这种方法有可能提供更高的选择性和效率，但催化剂设计和过程优化方面的技术挑战依然存在。

4. 熔融金属卤化盐途径涉及使用金属卤化物熔盐混合物作为反应介质。这种方法可能为反应提供独特的环境，从而提高选择性和效率。然而，使用熔盐引入了额外的安全问题和过程复杂性。

丙烷与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应活性存在显著差异，这是由于脱氢过程涉及的具体机制不同。丙烷，由于其较大的烷基团，相对于较小的烷烃需要更高的活化程度。这要求在脱氢过程中使用更强的催化剂和更高的能量输入。此外，丙烷中双键的存在允许更复杂的反应路径，影响丙烯的选择性以及生成其他产品的可能性。

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of bromine or chlorine to break the C-H bonds in propane, forming propene. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen to oxidize propane before dehydrogenation occurs, enhancing the selectivity towards propene. Oxyhalogenation combines the halogenation and dehydrogenation steps in a single process, offering a potentially more efficient route. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides to catalyze the dehydrogenation process. The reaction conditions for each method differ: halogenation typically requires high temperatures and pressures, while oxidative dehydrogenation might use a catalyst and require oxygen. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex structure, which allows for more effective dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a double bond in propene compared to the single bonds in methane and ethane also influences its reactivity differently in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation methods.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include halogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

1. Halogenation involves the reaction of halogens with propane to form intermediate compounds, which are then converted to propene. Propane's reactivity in this process differs from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its larger size and higher boiling point, allowing it to interact more effectively with halogen molecules.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to break the C-H bonds in propane, forming propene. Propane's reactivity in this process is influenced by the catalyst's selectivity, as well as the reaction temperature and pressure, which are optimized for the most efficient conversion.

3. Oxyhalogenation combines the oxidative and halogenation processes, using oxygen and halogen simultaneously to selectively dehydrogenate propane. Propane's reactivity here is governed by the balance between the oxygen and halogen species, affecting the rate and selectivity of the reaction.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of salts containing metal halides in a molten state as a catalyst. Propane's reactivity in these processes is determined by the compatibility of the metal halide with the alkane, as well as the temperature and concentration of the molten salt, which can alter the reaction pathway and product distribution.

Each method has distinct reaction conditions, with halogenation requiring high temperatures and pressures, oxidative dehydrogenation needing a catalyst and controlled oxygen levels, oxyhalogenation balancing oxygen and halogen concentrations, and molten metal halide salt approaches depending on salt composition and temperature. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its chemical properties, specifically its size and boiling point, which influence its interactions with halogen and oxygen species.

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. 

1. **Dehydrogenation with Halogens**: This method involves using halogens such as chlorine or bromine to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propene. The reactivity of propane in this process differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the strength of the carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane. The halogen acts as a mediator, facilitating the breaking of these bonds and conversion to propene.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This method employs oxygen or an oxidant to dehydrogenate propane. The oxygen facilitates the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds without the use of halogens, offering a cleaner process compared to halogen-mediated methods.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This process combines halogenation and dehydrogenation, using halogenated compounds in the presence of oxygen to selectively convert propane to propene. The presence of oxygen enhances the selectivity towards propene, making it a potentially more efficient process compared to pure halogenation.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods involve using molten salts composed of metal halides (such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride) as the reaction medium. The molten salts provide a conductive environment for the dehydrogenation process, allowing for the selective conversion of propane to propene under specific temperature and pressure conditions.

Each method has distinct reaction conditions tailored to optimize the conversion of propane to propene, with differences in temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific catalysts or reactants. The choice of method depends on factors such as energy efficiency, environmental impact, and the desired yield of propene. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to the strength of its carbon-hydrogen bonds, which require more energetic processes to break compared to lighter alkanes like methane and ethane.
