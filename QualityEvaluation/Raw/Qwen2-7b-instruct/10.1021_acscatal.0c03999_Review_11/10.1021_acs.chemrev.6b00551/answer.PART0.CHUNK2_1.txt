[1] "Several organic intermediates can be prepared by these reactions. For instance, 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutadiene was produced by the oxidative bromination of butane with oxygen and bromine in the presence of CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3 (90% selectivity at 523 K)."
[2] "A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18)."
[3] "In this sense, a highly active catalyst could be unfortunately most prone to deactivation."
[4] "Halocarbons are diverse in their properties, and the reaction intermediates differ from one reaction to another, making generalization difficult."
[5] "The biggest concern for these alkyl halides is their toxicity. Some problematic aspects include carcinogenicity and liver damage."

1. One example of an organic intermediate prepared through oxyhalogenation is 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutadiene, which is synthesized from butane through oxidative bromination with oxygen and bromine in the presence of CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3, exhibiting 90% selectivity at 523 K.

2. A novel tandem process for synthesizing allyl chloride involves two steps: first, the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane using copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K, ideally in a shell and tube reactor. Then, a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K produces allyl chloride.

3. The effectiveness of a catalyst in halogen-mediated reactions can paradoxically lead to its deactivation under certain conditions. 

4. The properties of halocarbons vary widely, and the specific intermediates formed in different reactions cannot be generalized.

5. The toxicity of alkyl halides is a major concern, with potential carcinogenic effects and liver damage being serious health risks.

1. 通过氧化溴化作用，将丁烷与氧气和溴在CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3的存在下反应生成的一种有机中间体是1,1,4,4-四溴丁二烯，其选择性高达90%，反应温度为523 K。

2. 一种合成氯乙醇的新串联过程包括两个步骤：首先，在473648 K的温度下，使用氯化铜基催化剂对四氯乙烯进行氯化作用，理想情况下在管壳式反应器中进行，以生成六氯乙烷。然后，通过与丙烯的气相反应，在673973 K的温度下生成氯乙醇。

3. 催化剂在卤素介导的反应中的高效性反而可能使其更容易发生失活。

4. 卤代烃的性质多种多样，不同反应产生的中间体难以概括。

5. 一些卤代烷的毒性是一个主要问题，可能会导致致癌性和肝损伤等严重健康风险。
