Halogen-mediated conversion of hydrocarbons is crucial for industrial production of various chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. These processes, mainly facilitated by heterogeneous catalysts, have been widely used in polymer manufacturing. The recent abundance of natural gas resources has renewed interest in halogen chemistry as a cost-effective method for converting gas to liquid. This review focuses on the application of halogen chemistry in polymer industries, specifically polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates, as well as the activation of light hydrocarbons. Key reactions involve halogenation and oxyhalogenation of alkanes and alkenes, dehydrogenation of alkanes, conversion of alkyl halides, and oxidation of hydrogen halides. The review also discusses the catalyst, reactor, and process design for these reactions.
