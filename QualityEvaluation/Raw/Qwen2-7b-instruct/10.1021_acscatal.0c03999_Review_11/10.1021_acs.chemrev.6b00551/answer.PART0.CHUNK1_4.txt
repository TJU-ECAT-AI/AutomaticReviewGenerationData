[1] "The most common halogen-assisted dehydrogenation method involves the use of molten metal halide salts, which can selectively dehydrogenate propane to propene under mild conditions."
[2] "For oxidative dehydrogenation, a catalyst is often used in conjunction with molecular oxygen or air to promote the reaction."
[3] "Oxyhalogenation uses hydrogen halides (HX) as a dehydrogenating agent in the presence of molecular oxygen."
[4] "Dehydrogenation with halogens typically requires a catalyst, and the halogen used depends on the desired product and reaction conditions."

1. Molten metal halide salts are often used for selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under mild conditions.
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes a catalyst with molecular oxygen or air to facilitate the reaction.
3. In oxyhalogenation, hydrogen halides (HX) act as a dehydrogenating agent in the presence of molecular oxygen.
4. Dehydrogenation with halogens generally needs a catalyst, and the chosen halogen varies based on the desired product and reaction conditions.
