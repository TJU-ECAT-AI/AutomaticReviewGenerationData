Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of bromine or chlorine to break the C-H bonds in propane, forming propene. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen to oxidize propane before dehydrogenation occurs, enhancing the selectivity towards propene. Oxyhalogenation combines the halogenation and dehydrogenation steps in a single process, offering a potentially more efficient route. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides to catalyze the dehydrogenation process. The reaction conditions for each method differ: halogenation typically requires high temperatures and pressures, while oxidative dehydrogenation might use a catalyst and require oxygen. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its larger size and more complex structure, which allows for more effective dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of a double bond in propene compared to the single bonds in methane and ethane also influences its reactivity differently in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation methods.

卤代辅助方法用于选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯包括使用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。卤素脱氢涉及使用溴或氯来打断丙烷中的C-H键，形成丙烯。氧化脱氢通过氧化丙烷再进行脱氢，增强丙烯的选择性。氧卤化将卤化和脱氢步骤结合在一个过程中，可能提供更高效的途径。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含金属卤化物的熔融盐作为催化剂来催化脱氢过程。各种方法的反应条件不同：卤化通常需要高温和高压，而氧化脱氢可能需要氧气和催化剂。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃大不相同，这是由于其更大的尺寸和更复杂的结构，这使得有效的脱氢反应更加有效。与单键相比，丙烯中的双键也影响了其在卤代辅助脱氢方法中的反应性。
