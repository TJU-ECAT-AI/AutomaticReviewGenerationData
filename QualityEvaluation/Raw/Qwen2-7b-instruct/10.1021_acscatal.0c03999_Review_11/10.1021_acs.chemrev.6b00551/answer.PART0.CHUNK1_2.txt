[1] "Disadvantageously, all these synthesis routes exclusively produced stoichiometric HCl (2 mol per mol COCl2) as a byproduct."
[2] "Considering the huge and ever-increasing global demand of these polymers (Figure 5), development of effective technologies for chlorine recycling will make the processes more sustainable."
[3] "Advantageously, the use of HBr has its own advantages over HCl, such as a possibility of offering a higher selectivity of methyl halide since bromination is more selective than chlorination."

1. All synthesis routes for manufacturing polymers exclusively produced stoichiometric amounts of HCl as a byproduct. Recognizing the escalating global demand for these polymers, the development of efficient chlorine recycling technologies would enhance sustainability in these processes.

2. Acknowledging the substantial global demand for polymers, implementing effective technologies for recycling HCl would make the manufacturing processes more sustainable, given the ever-increasing demand.

3. Utilizing HBr offers a higher selectivity for methyl halide production compared to HCl, due to the greater selectivity of bromination over chlorination. This feature makes HBr a more advantageous choice in certain chemical processes.

1. 所有聚合物制造途径均仅产生等摩尔的HCl作为副产品。考虑到这些聚合物需求的急剧增长，开发高效的氯回收技术将使这些过程更具可持续性。

2. 认识到聚合物需求的持续增长，通过实施有效的HCl回收技术，可以使得制造过程更加可持续，以应对不断上升的需求。

3. 相对于HCl，使用HBr在甲基卤化物生产中提供了更高的选择性，因为溴化比氯化具有更高的选择性。这一特性使得HBr成为某些化学过程中更优的选择。
