[1] "The halogen-mediated routes are not new, and since the discovery of halogens in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they are constantly employed in industrial manufacturing."
[2] "Jean-Baptiste Dumas first synthesized tetrachloromethane by the chlorination of marsh gas (consisting predominantly of methane) in 1840 and is often credited for the discovery of the gas-phase halogenation of alkanes."
[3] "Companies such as Roessler & Hasslacher and Hoechst patented the process. (35, 36)"
[4] "However, the contemporary development of high-pressure methanol synthesis from syngas diverted the focus of methane activation from gas-phase chlorination."
[5] "These processes however were associated with methane combustion and incomplete hydrogen chloride conversion."
[6] "This is substantiated by performing the process in two steps: (i) chlorination of hydrocarbons by copper chloride, employed as the chlorinating agent, and (ii) regeneration of the reduced copper chloride by reacting with HCl and O2 or air."
[7] "Interest in the single-stage halogenation and oxyhalogenation continued owing to the simplicity of operation."
[8] "Among these, only the bromine-aided upgrading process was demonstrated at a pilot scale."
[9] "The halogen chemistry, in a broad sense, encompasses the reaction of halogens or halides with a substrate leading to intermediate compounds that are readily converted to commodities."
[10] "The reactivity of halogens in these transformations is largely determined by the valence electrons in the outermost electron shell."
[11] "The term mediator is exclusively used hereafter for halogen or halogen-containing compounds employed in hydrocarbon functionalization as they can be recovered after reaction and reused."
[12] "As one of the oldest synthetic materials, PVC was accidentally discovered from the exposure of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) to light by Henri Victor in 1838."

[19] "A commercial facility for methane chlorination was first started by Farbwerke Hoechst in 1923."
[20] "This stimulated a search for new chemistry and in the late 1920s resulted in the demonstration of a reaction (later known as oxychlorination) of hydrocarbons with HCl and O2 in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts based principally on copper and iron chlorides, (39, 40) which allowed chlorine use with 100% atom efficiency."
[21] "These processes however were associated with methane combustion and incomplete hydrogen chloride conversion."
[22] "It should be emphasized that the implementation of a halogen-mediated process relies on a number of factors, such as the availability and efficiency of utilization of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, management of corrosion issues, etc."

[24] "The synthesis of PVC is achieved by the polymerization of VCM, a chemical intermediate manufactured predominantly for the purpose of PVC."
[25] "Processes and chemistry for the production of VCM vary according to the feedstocks and catalysts (Figure 6)."
[26] "An industrial VCM production originally started in the 1920s through acetylene hydrochlorination over mercuric chloride catalysts, (76) which is still used in countries, such as China, where acetylene can be obtained cost-effectively from abundant coal."
[27] "However, the increasing demand of PVC and rising prices of acetylene coupled to the toxicity of mercury-based catalysts prompted a shift of feedstock in the 1950s to more economic ethylene from petroleum in Europe and the U.S."
[28] "Today, more than 90% of the vinyl chloride produced in the western world is exclusively based on the ethylene route encompassing the balanced process."
[29] "With the incentive of further economizing the PVC production, industry has undertaken considerable effort to replace ethylene by ethane as the key feedstock and to obtain VCM by oxychlorination of ethane in one step and thus to bypass the EDC cracking step."
[30] "PU and PC are the most representative chlorine-free end materials obtained using chlorine chemistry."
[31] "Thanks to its versatility, the PVC demand reached 43.6 Mton in 2015 (Figure 5) and is expected to grow with an annual rate of 3.2% in the future."
