[1] "The reactivity of halogens in these transformations is largely determined by the valence electrons in the outermost electron shell."
[2] "The term mediator is exclusively used hereafter for halogen or halogen-containing compounds employed in hydrocarbon functionalization as they can be recovered after reaction and reused."
[3] "Berthelot isolated methyl chloride from the above process in 1858, which can be readily hydrolyzed to methanol and thus providing an opportunity to utilize methane as a feedstock for chemicals and fuels."
[4] "Although the process was claimed to be very effective for selective halogenation of hydrocarbons, the commercialization was not reached."
[5] "Among these, only the bromine-aided upgrading process was demonstrated at a pilot scale."
[6] "It should be emphasized that the implementation of a halogen-mediated process relies on a number of factors, such as the availability and efficiency of utilization of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, management of corrosion issues, etc."

The reactivity of halogens in hydrocarbon functionalization is primarily dictated by the valence electrons in their outermost electron shell. These halogen-containing compounds, acting as mediators, are capable of being recovered and reused after reactions. Historically, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Berthelot demonstrated the halogenation of methane to produce methyl chloride, which could be hydrolyzed into methanol, offering a means to utilize methane as a feedstock for chemicals. Despite claims of effectiveness, the commercialization of these processes was not achieved. Only the bromine-mediated upgrading process was successfully demonstrated at a pilot scale. The successful implementation of halogen-assisted processes depends on various factors including the efficient use of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, and management of corrosion issues.

卤素在烃功能化反应中的反应性主要由它们外层电子壳中的价电子决定。这些含卤素化合物作为媒介物，在反应后可以回收和再利用。历史上，让-巴蒂斯特·杜马斯和伯特洛从过程中分离出了甲基氯化物，它可以水解成甲醇，提供了一种利用甲烷作为化学品原料的方法。尽管声称有效，但这些过程的商业化并未实现。只有溴辅助升级过程在试点规模上成功演示。卤素辅助过程的成功实施取决于多种因素，包括原料的高效使用、卤素循环技术以及腐蚀问题的管理。
