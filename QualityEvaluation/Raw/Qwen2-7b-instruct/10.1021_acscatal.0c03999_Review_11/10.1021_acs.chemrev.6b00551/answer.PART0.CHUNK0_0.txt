The literature discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The conditions for each method differ significantly. For dehydrogenation with halogens, propane reacts with a halogen catalyst under high temperature and pressure conditions, typically in the presence of a solvent. The reaction is highly exothermic and requires careful control to prevent overheating and catalyst degradation. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas, often in conjunction with a metal oxide catalyst, at elevated temperatures to promote the dehydrogenation process. Oxyhalogenation combines halogenation and dehydrogenation steps, where propane is first halogenated and then the halogenated product is dehydrogenated. This process can be carried out under conditions similar to oxidative dehydrogenation but with the additional halogenation step. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts containing metal halides as the catalyst, typically in a batch or continuous flow reactor at high temperatures. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the presence of the halogen or halide groups, which can activate the alkene double bond and facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

The differences in reactivity stem from the ability of halogens to abstract hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, making them more reactive towards dehydrogenation. Propane's reactivity in these processes is influenced by the type of halogen used, the catalyst employed, and the reaction conditions. For instance, the presence of a halogen catalyst can lead to a more efficient dehydrogenation pathway compared to using a metal oxide catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of molten metal halide salts offers a unique approach to dehydrogenation, potentially allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivities due to the homogeneous nature of the reaction medium.

The reactivity of propane in these halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes is higher than that of methane and ethane because of the stronger activation of the alkene double bond by the halogen groups. This allows for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene, while methane and ethane tend to undergo less selective reactions due to their weaker alkene character and higher stability under the same reaction conditions.

文献讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。每种方法的条件差异显著。卤素脱氢涉及在高温高压条件下使用卤素催化剂与丙烷反应，通常在溶剂存在下进行。该反应高度放热，需要仔细控制以防止过热和催化剂降解。氧化脱氢涉及使用氧气或含氧气体，经常与金属氧化物催化剂结合，在较高温度下促进脱氢过程。氧卤化结合了卤化和脱氢步骤，首先对丙烷进行卤化，然后卤化产物进行脱氢。此过程的条件类似于氧化脱氢，但具有额外的卤化步骤。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用包含金属卤化物的熔融盐作为催化剂，通常在高温下使用批处理或连续流反应器。卤素的反应性使得丙烷在这些过程中比甲烷和乙烷更活跃，因为卤素可以激活烷基双键，并促进脱氢过程。丙烷在这些卤素辅助脱氢过程中的反应性高于甲烷和乙烷，这是由于卤素组的存在，可以激活烷基双键，从而实现选择性脱氢到丙烯。相比之下，甲烷和乙烷在相同的反应条件下倾向于进行更不选择性的反应，因为它们的烷基双键较弱且稳定性更高。

丙烷在这些卤素辅助脱氢过程中的反应性较高，原因是卤素组的存在能够激活烷基双键。这允许选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而甲烷和乙烷由于其较弱的烷基双键特性和更高的稳定性，在相同的反应条件下倾向于进行较少选择性的反应。
