[1] "The chemical industry heavily relies on petroleum as its primary feedstock (Figure 24)."
[2] "The primary constituent of natural gas is methane, accounting for 7599 mol % of the overall composition, followed by ethane (115 mol %) and propane (110 mol %), (70) which can serve as feedstocks for chemical and fuel manufacture, reducing our reliance on oil."
[3] "Halogen-mediated functionalization of hydrocarbons, which has a long history in fine chemical synthesis, has emerged as a particularly attractive approach for the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under mild conditions (Figure 27)."
[4] "For all the above catalysts, the bromination reaction is superior to chlorination to achieve high methyl halide selectivity [S(CH3Br) > 99%]."
[5] "This process is suitable for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene that can be recycled with HCl. In this way, the ethylene byproduct can also be consumed in the oxychlorination reactor, thus enabling a full recycle of the major byproducts."
[6] "However, chlorine can be directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, thus the chlorination step is omitted."
[7] "It was reported that a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 can be achieved under conditions that simulated a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant."
[8] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."
[9] "Besides, owing to the exothermic nature of the process, fluidized-bed reactor technology was conceived, which allowed isothermal operation at reduced temperature."
[10] "The catalyst formulation was modified through additives, such as didymium and/or potassium chlorides, which form molten salts and improve the catalyst stability."
[11] "Still, the limited selling option and high cost for neutralizing HCl triggered the industrial and academic research in the past decade to hunt for novel catalysts capable of overcoming the above issues, particularly in relation to chlorine recycling in PU and PC manufactures."
[12] "Extensive research efforts have culminated in the identification of RuO2-based materials, exhibiting outstanding activity and stability and thus fulfilling the expectations for an industrial catalyst."
[13] "The above review also sheds light on the mechanistic aspects gathered in the literature through advanced in situ and operando methods, such as temporal analysis of products (TAP-2), prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA), ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies, and DFT calculations."
