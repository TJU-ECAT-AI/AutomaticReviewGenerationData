The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide. The results demonstrated that the catalysts were effective for the reaction, and the incorporation of carbon dioxide in the feed enhanced the catalytic activity. The researchers observed a decrease in surface acidity with an increase in potassium loading, leading to an improvement in propylene selectivity. They noted a propane conversion of 31% with a 91% selectivity to propylene using a 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst at 923 K, when the molar ratio of carbon dioxide to propane was 3.6. The 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst proved to perform well for propane dehydrogenation in carbon dioxide. Potassium addition significantly boosted propylene selectivity, and the optimal potassium loading was found to be approximately 0.2 to 0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

研究了在促进Cr/SiO2催化剂上，丙烷在二氧化碳存在下脱氢生成丙烯的过程。结果表明，催化剂对反应有效，并且在原料气中加入二氧化碳可以提升催化活性。研究人员发现，随着钾含量的增加，表面酸性降低，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。他们观察到，在923 K时使用5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2催化剂，当二氧化碳与丙烷的摩尔比为3.6时，丙烷转化率为31%，丙烯选择性为91%。5%Cr/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳环境下对丙烷脱氢表现良好。钾的添加显著提升了丙烯的选择性，最优的钾含量约为0.2至0.4%在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中。
