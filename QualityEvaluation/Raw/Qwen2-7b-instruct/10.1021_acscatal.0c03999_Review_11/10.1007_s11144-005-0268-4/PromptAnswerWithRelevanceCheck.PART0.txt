Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in carbon dioxide was investigated over promoted Cr/SiO2."
[2] "The results showed that the catalysts were effective for the reaction and CO2 in the feed promoted the catalytic activity."
[3] "It was found that the surface acidity decreased with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward propylene."
[4] "A propane conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene over the 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst was observed at 923 K with CO2 /C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6."
[5] "The 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst behaved quite well for the dehydrogenation of propane in CO2."
[6] "The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction."

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide. The results demonstrated that the catalysts were effective for the reaction, and the incorporation of carbon dioxide in the feed enhanced the catalytic activity. The researchers observed a decrease in surface acidity with an increase in potassium loading, leading to an improvement in propylene selectivity. They noted a propane conversion of 31% with a 91% selectivity to propylene using a 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst at 923 K, when the molar ratio of carbon dioxide to propane was 3.6. The 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst proved to perform well for propane dehydrogenation in carbon dioxide. Potassium addition significantly boosted propylene selectivity, and the optimal potassium loading was found to be approximately 0.2 to 0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

研究了在促进Cr/SiO2催化剂上，丙烷在二氧化碳存在下脱氢生成丙烯的过程。结果表明，催化剂对反应有效，并且在原料气中加入二氧化碳可以提升催化活性。研究人员发现，随着钾含量的增加，表面酸性降低，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。他们观察到，在923 K时使用5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2催化剂，当二氧化碳与丙烷的摩尔比为3.6时，丙烷转化率为31%，丙烯选择性为91%。5%Cr/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳环境下对丙烷脱氢表现良好。钾的添加显著提升了丙烯的选择性，最优的钾含量约为0.2至0.4%在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中。

MODIFICATION OF Cr/SiO2 FOR THE DEHYDROGENATION OF PROPANE TO PROPYLENE IN CARBON DIOXIDE.
Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in carbon dioxide was investigated over promoted Cr/SiO2.
It was found that the surface acidity decreased with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward propylene.
A propane conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene over the 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst was observed at 923 K with CO2 /C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.
In situ ESR and UV-Vis DRS measurements indicated that the active centers in the CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species.
One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction.

The document describes the modification of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The use of potassium (K) in the catalyst led to a decrease in surface acidity, which resulted in an increased selectivity towards propylene. At 923 K, a conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene was achieved using a 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst. The active centers in the catalysts were found to be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+ species, and CO2 played a role in oxidizing Cr3+ to these species during the reaction.
