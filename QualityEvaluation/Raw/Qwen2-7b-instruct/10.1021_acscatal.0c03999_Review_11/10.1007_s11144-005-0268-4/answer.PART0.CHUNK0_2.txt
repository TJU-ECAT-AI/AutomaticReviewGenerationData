MODIFICATION OF Cr/SiO2 FOR THE DEHYDROGENATION OF PROPANE TO PROPYLENE IN CARBON DIOXIDE.
Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in carbon dioxide was investigated over promoted Cr/SiO2.
It was found that the surface acidity decreased with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward propylene.
A propane conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene over the 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst was observed at 923 K with CO2 /C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.
In situ ESR and UV-Vis DRS measurements indicated that the active centers in the CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species.
One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction.

The document describes the modification of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The use of potassium (K) in the catalyst led to a decrease in surface acidity, which resulted in an increased selectivity towards propylene. At 923 K, a conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene was achieved using a 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst. The active centers in the catalysts were found to be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+ species, and CO2 played a role in oxidizing Cr3+ to these species during the reaction.

文档描述了在二氧化碳存在下促进Cr/SiO2催化剂用于丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程。钾（K）在催化剂中的使用导致表面酸性降低，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。在923 K时，使用5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2催化剂实现了31%的转化率和91%的丙烯选择性。催化剂中的活性中心被发现与Cr5+或Cr6+物种有关，并且二氧化碳在反应过程中参与了将Cr3+氧化为这些物种的作用。
