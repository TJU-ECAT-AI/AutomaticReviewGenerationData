[1] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[2] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[3] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The document describes a study on the modification of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The researchers found that the addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to the catalysts modified the surface properties, decreasing the redox potential and surface acidity. This led to a decrease in the conversion of propane and an increase in the selectivity towards propylene. The optimal loading of potassium (K) was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts. These optimized catalysts showed a propane conversion of approximately 22-31% and a propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.

该文档描述了一项关于在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢为丙烯的Cr/SiO2催化剂改性研究。研究人员发现，向催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了还原电势和酸性位点。这导致丙烷转化率下降和丙烯选择性提高。钾（K）的最佳负载量被发现在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中约为0.2-0.4%。这些优化的催化剂在923 K时，在CO2/C3H8摩尔比为3.6的情况下，显示了大约22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。
