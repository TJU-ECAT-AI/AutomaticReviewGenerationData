Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in carbon dioxide was investigated over promoted Cr/SiO2.
In situ ESR and UV-Vis DRS measurements [9] indicated that the active centers in the CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species,which might be generated by the oxidation of Cr3+ species.
One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction.
In this work, we investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica supported chromium oxide catalysts modified by alkali and alkaline earth oxides.

The document discusses the modification of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. It highlights the role of CO2 in oxidizing Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ species, which are involved in the active centers of the catalysts. The study investigates how the addition of alkali and alkaline earth oxides affects the structure, surface acidity, and activity of the modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts.
