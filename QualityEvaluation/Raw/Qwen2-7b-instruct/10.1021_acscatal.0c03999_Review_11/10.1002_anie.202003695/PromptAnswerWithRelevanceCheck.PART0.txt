[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[3] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[4] "In contrast, the well-studied vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface."

The document describes a novel mechanistic framework for understanding the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a catalyst. The key aspects of this framework are:

1. The high propylene selectivity during ODH catalyzed by hBN arises from surface-initiated radical reactions that propagate via gas-phase chemistry. This contrasts with vanadium-based catalysts, where surface reactions dominate and lead to lower selectivity.

2. The product distribution can be explained by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their sequential propagation in the gas phase. This mechanism is supported by computational calculations and experimental evidence.

3. For the boron-initiated mechanism, the catalyst plays a critical role in generating reactive HOO. radicals, which activate propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. A fraction of propane reacts directly with the catalyst surface during chain initiation, influencing the distribution of available propyl species in the gas phase.

4. In comparison, vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface. This, combined with stronger interactions of reaction intermediates and products with the catalyst surface, results in a rapid loss of selectivity as propane conversion increases.

文档描述了一种用于理解硼含材料的新型机制框架，其中六方硼氮化物（hBN）作为催化剂用于氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷。该框架的关键方面包括：

1. hBN催化下的高丙烯选择性来源于表面引发的自由基反应，这些反应通过气相化学进行传播。这与以表面反应为主的范德华基催化剂形成鲜明对比，导致选择性较低。

2. 产品分布可以通过在表面上形成自由基并通过气相化学进行传播的组合来解释。这些机制得到了计算分析和实验证据的支持。

3. 对于硼引发的机制，催化剂在生成活性HOO.自由基中起着关键作用，这些自由基激活丙烷在气相中，导致快速自由基传播。直接在催化剂表面反应的丙烷部分影响了气相中可用丙基物种的分布。

4. 相比之下，基于范德华的催化剂主要在表面上激活丙烷的CH键。这与反应中间体和产物与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用相结合，导致随着丙烷转化率的增加，选择性迅速降低。

The literature describes a combined surface and gas-phase reaction network for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using boron-containing materials. This network involves the surface-initiated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. The radicals are primarily HOO. radicals, which abstract hydrogen from propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. The oxyfunctionalization of the boron nitride (BN) surface under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions is facilitated by the gas-phase radical chemistry, not just heating in the presence of oxygen. This contrasts with mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts, where oxidized vanadium species activate propane at the surface, leading to rapid loss of selectivity as propane conversion increases.

文献描述了一种使用硼含材料的丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的表面和气相反应网络。该网络包括表面引发的自由基形成，这些自由基在气相中进行快速传播。主要的自由基是HOO.自由基，它们从气相中的丙烷中抽象氢原子，从而导致快速的自由基传播。在氧化脱氢条件下，通过气相自由基化学促进了硼氮化物（BN）表面的氧功能化，而不是仅通过氧气加热。这与钒基催化剂机制形成鲜明对比，在这些机制中，氧化钒物种在表面激活丙烷，导致丙烷转化增加时选择性迅速下降。

The literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using boron nitride as a catalyst. It highlights that the catalyst's surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their sequential propagation in the gas phase, contributes to the high selectivity of the process. The document discusses the role of water in enhancing reaction rates, the reversible nature of water's effect on the catalyst, and its necessity for the formation of reactive species. Computational studies reveal the dynamics of the catalyst surface, identifying key active sites that can chemisorb and activate oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive species. The role of gas-phase chemistry is also emphasized, suggesting a mixture of surface and gas-phase propane hydrogen abstraction, which results in the formation of a roughly equal amount of i- and n-propyl radicals. The literature also notes the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance, contrasting with mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts. The document concludes with guidelines for developing more selective catalysts for ODH.

[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "For example, if water-induced surface modifications irreversibly lead to more active sites, we would expect steady-state reactivity under dry conditions to increase at a given flow condition. And vice versa, the inhibition of surface species would decrease reactivity, as previously observed for supported vanadium catalysts."
[3] "This model suggests that, under ODH conditions, there may be a mix of surface and gas-phase propane H abstraction, leading to an approximately equimolar amount of i- and n-propyl radicals being formed."
[4] "Indeed, the formation of n-propyl radicals inevitably leads to non-negligible formation of CC cracking products. On the other hand, the more favorable iC3H7/nC3H7 distribution stemming from gas-phase propane H abstraction suggests that optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed, as well as the development of catalysts that can generate HOO. radicals rather than alkyl radicals, may provide additional benefits during ODH."

1. The predominance of dehydrogenation over CC bond cleavage in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the oxygen concentration, as indicated by reaction kinetic studies.
2. Water-induced changes in surface activity can lead to either an increase or decrease in steady-state reactivity, depending on whether it promotes or inhibits surface species, respectively.
3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane under certain conditions might involve a combination of surface and gas-phase activation, resulting in roughly equal amounts of i- and n-propyl radicals.
4. Optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed and developing catalysts capable of generating HOO radicals could enhance the efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly by favoring the formation of i-propyl radicals over n-propyl radicals.

1. The catalyst initiates surface-mediated radical reactions that propagate via gas-phase chemistry, providing a unique mechanism compared to vanadium-based catalysts where surface reactions predominate.
2. The surface oxyfunctionalization of the BN during the ODH process is attributed to the formation of radicals over metastable sites, which then propagate in the gas phase.
