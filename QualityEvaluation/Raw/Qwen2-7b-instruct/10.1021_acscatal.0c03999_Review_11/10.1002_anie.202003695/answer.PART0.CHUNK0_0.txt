[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[3] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[4] "In contrast, the well-studied vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface."

The document describes a novel mechanistic framework for understanding the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a catalyst. The key aspects of this framework are:

1. The high propylene selectivity during ODH catalyzed by hBN arises from surface-initiated radical reactions that propagate via gas-phase chemistry. This contrasts with vanadium-based catalysts, where surface reactions dominate and lead to lower selectivity.

2. The product distribution can be explained by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their sequential propagation in the gas phase. This mechanism is supported by computational calculations and experimental evidence.

3. For the boron-initiated mechanism, the catalyst plays a critical role in generating reactive HOO. radicals, which activate propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. A fraction of propane reacts directly with the catalyst surface during chain initiation, influencing the distribution of available propyl species in the gas phase.

4. In comparison, vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface. This, combined with stronger interactions of reaction intermediates and products with the catalyst surface, results in a rapid loss of selectivity as propane conversion increases.

文档描述了一种用于理解硼含材料的新型机制框架，其中六方硼氮化物（hBN）作为催化剂用于氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷。该框架的关键方面包括：

1. hBN催化下的高丙烯选择性来源于表面引发的自由基反应，这些反应通过气相化学进行传播。这与以表面反应为主的范德华基催化剂形成鲜明对比，导致选择性较低。

2. 产品分布可以通过在表面上形成自由基并通过气相化学进行传播的组合来解释。这些机制得到了计算分析和实验证据的支持。

3. 对于硼引发的机制，催化剂在生成活性HOO.自由基中起着关键作用，这些自由基激活丙烷在气相中，导致快速自由基传播。直接在催化剂表面反应的丙烷部分影响了气相中可用丙基物种的分布。

4. 相比之下，基于范德华的催化剂主要在表面上激活丙烷的CH键。这与反应中间体和产物与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用相结合，导致随着丙烷转化率的增加，选择性迅速降低。
