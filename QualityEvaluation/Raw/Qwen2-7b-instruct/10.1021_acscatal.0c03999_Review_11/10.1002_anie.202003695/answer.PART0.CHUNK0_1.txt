[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[3] "This reaction channel in turn lights off a gas-phase reaction and leads to the oxyfunctionalization of the BN surface under ODH conditions."
[4] "We emphasize that heating BN in the presence of oxygen only does not result in surface oxidation, implying that the oxyfunctionalization goes hand-in-hand with the gas-phase radical chemistry."

The literature describes a combined surface and gas-phase reaction network for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using boron-containing materials. This network involves the surface-initiated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. The radicals are primarily HOO. radicals, which abstract hydrogen from propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. The oxyfunctionalization of the boron nitride (BN) surface under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions is facilitated by the gas-phase radical chemistry, not just heating in the presence of oxygen. This contrasts with mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts, where oxidized vanadium species activate propane at the surface, leading to rapid loss of selectivity as propane conversion increases.

文献描述了一种使用硼含材料的丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的表面和气相反应网络。该网络包括表面引发的自由基形成，这些自由基在气相中进行快速传播。主要的自由基是HOO.自由基，它们从气相中的丙烷中抽象氢原子，从而导致快速的自由基传播。在氧化脱氢条件下，通过气相自由基化学促进了硼氮化物（BN）表面的氧功能化，而不是仅通过氧气加热。这与钒基催化剂机制形成鲜明对比，在这些机制中，氧化钒物种在表面激活丙烷，导致丙烷转化增加时选择性迅速下降。
