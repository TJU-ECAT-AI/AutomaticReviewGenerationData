[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "For example, if water-induced surface modifications irreversibly lead to more active sites, we would expect steady-state reactivity under dry conditions to increase at a given flow condition. And vice versa, the inhibition of surface species would decrease reactivity, as previously observed for supported vanadium catalysts."
[3] "This model suggests that, under ODH conditions, there may be a mix of surface and gas-phase propane H abstraction, leading to an approximately equimolar amount of i- and n-propyl radicals being formed."
[4] "Indeed, the formation of n-propyl radicals inevitably leads to non-negligible formation of CC cracking products. On the other hand, the more favorable iC3H7/nC3H7 distribution stemming from gas-phase propane H abstraction suggests that optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed, as well as the development of catalysts that can generate HOO. radicals rather than alkyl radicals, may provide additional benefits during ODH."

1. The predominance of dehydrogenation over CC bond cleavage in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the oxygen concentration, as indicated by reaction kinetic studies.
2. Water-induced changes in surface activity can lead to either an increase or decrease in steady-state reactivity, depending on whether it promotes or inhibits surface species, respectively.
3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane under certain conditions might involve a combination of surface and gas-phase activation, resulting in roughly equal amounts of i- and n-propyl radicals.
4. Optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed and developing catalysts capable of generating HOO radicals could enhance the efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly by favoring the formation of i-propyl radicals over n-propyl radicals.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷过程中，脱氢作用相对于CC键断裂的主导地位受到氧气浓度的影响。
2. 水引起的表面变化可以导致活性位点的不可逆增加或减少，进而影响稳态反应性。
3. 在特定条件下，氧化脱氢化过程可能同时涉及表面和气相丙烷的活化，产生等量的i-和n-丙基自由基。
4. 优化催化剂床的空间结构以及开发能够生成HOO自由基的催化剂，对于提高氧化脱氢效率尤其有利，尤其是有利于形成i-丙基自由基而非n-丙基自由基。
