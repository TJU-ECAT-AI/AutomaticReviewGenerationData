The literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using boron nitride as a catalyst. It highlights that the catalyst's surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their sequential propagation in the gas phase, contributes to the high selectivity of the process. The document discusses the role of water in enhancing reaction rates, the reversible nature of water's effect on the catalyst, and its necessity for the formation of reactive species. Computational studies reveal the dynamics of the catalyst surface, identifying key active sites that can chemisorb and activate oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive species. The role of gas-phase chemistry is also emphasized, suggesting a mixture of surface and gas-phase propane hydrogen abstraction, which results in the formation of a roughly equal amount of i- and n-propyl radicals. The literature also notes the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance, contrasting with mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts. The document concludes with guidelines for developing more selective catalysts for ODH.
