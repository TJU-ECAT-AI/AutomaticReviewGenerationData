[1] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[2] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its higher reactivity."

2. Halogen dehydrogenation involves reacting propane with a halogen like chlorine, bromine, or iodine to remove hydrogen atoms and create propene. Oxidative dehydrogenation employs oxygen to remove hydrogen atoms from propane, transforming it into propene. Oxyhalogenation combines the use of both halogen and oxygen in the dehydrogenation of propane. Molten metal halide salt methods utilize a molten salt containing a halide ion and a metal cation to assist in the dehydrogenation of propane.
