[1] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%) FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%) TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[2] "In particular, CrPO, whose performance, crystal structure, and morphology are demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, enables to reach propylene yields up to 50%, rivalling the best systems among any existing propane-to-propylene technology."
[3] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of its higher reactivity."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The study found that among the metal phosphates tested, copper phosphate (CuPO) showed the highest activity in propane oxychlorination, followed by vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO). Chromium phosphate (CrPO) was found to be the most selective catalyst, capable of reaching propylene yields of up to 50%, which rivals the best catalysts reported for propane-to-propylene conversion. The stability of CrPO was demonstrated by its ability to maintain high performance for over 60 hours under reaction conditions.

The reason for propane's reactivity difference compared to other alkanes like methane and ethane lies in its higher reactivity. This makes it more susceptible to reactions involving halogen species, leading to more complex pathways and a wider range of products. The presence of a halogen facilitates the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene, making it a key feedstock for propylene production in various industries. The unique reactivity of propane allows for the development of efficient catalysts that can achieve high propene yields through controlled oxychlorination reactions.

描述并比较使用卤素辅助的几种选择性脱氢方法，将丙烷转化为丙烯，包括与卤素的脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应活性差异显著。

研究发现，在测试的金属磷酸盐中，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）在丙烷氧氯化中的活性最高，其次是钒磷酸盐（VPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铬磷酸盐（CrPO）、铁磷酸盐（FePO）、锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）和钛磷酸盐（TiPO）。铬磷酸盐（CrPO）被证明是选择性最好的催化剂，能够达到高达50%的丙烯产率，这与目前报道的任何丙烷到丙烯技术中最好的催化剂相当。CrPO的稳定性通过其在长达60小时的反应时间下保持高性能得到证实。

丙烷与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应活性差异的原因在于其更高的反应活性。这使得它更容易参与涉及卤素物种的反应，导致更复杂的路径和更多种类的产品。卤素的存在促进了丙烷的选择性脱氢至丙烯，使其成为各种工业中丙烯生产的关键原料。丙烷的独特反应性允许开发高效的催化剂，通过控制氧氯化反应实现高丙烯产率。
