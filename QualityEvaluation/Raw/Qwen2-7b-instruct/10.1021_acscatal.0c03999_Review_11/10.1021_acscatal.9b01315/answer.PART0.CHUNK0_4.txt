[1] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%) FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%) TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[2] "The selectivity to C3H6 decreased in the order FePO (98%) CrPO (96%) > MnPO (67%) TiPO (66%) NiPO (65%) CoPO (62%) > CuPO (45%) > VPO (31%)."
[3] "Propane oxychlorination (C3H8 + HCl + O2), propane oxidation (C3H8 + O2), propyl chloride dehydrochlorination (C3H7Cl), and hydrogen chloride oxidation (HCl + O2) were performed at ambient pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor setup."
[4] "The performance were evaluated over the materials that were equilibrated for over 5 h under the reaction environment in order to avoid any potential influence from catalyst restructuring."
[5] "The high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be preserved over a broad range of temperatures (673-773 K) and feed concentration of alkane (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl (1.5-15 vol.)."
[6] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[7] "The selectivity to COx determined during POC at ca. 20% propane conversion, SCOx, was used as a measure of the combustion propensity of the catalysts investigated."

1. The activity of catalysts in propane oxychlorination decreases in the order CuPO > VPO > CoPO > CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO. The selectivity to propylene follows the ranking CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO > CoPO > CuPO > VPO at 5-20% propane conversion.

2. The selectivity to propene (C3H6) decreases in the order FePO > CrPO > MnPO > TiPO > NiPO > CoPO > CuPO > VPO.

3. Propane oxychlorination, propane oxidation, propyl chloride dehydrochlorination, and hydrogen chloride oxidation were carried out using a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor under ambient pressure.

4. The catalysts' performance was assessed after they had been equilibrated for over 5 hours in the reaction environment to avoid any influence from catalyst restructuring.

5. The catalyst CrPO can maintain over 90% selectivity to propene across a broad range of temperatures (673-773 K) and alkane feed concentrations (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl concentrations (1.5-15 vol.).

6. While MnPO has low chlorine evolution capability and comparable combustion propensity to CrPO, its high propane cracking tendency and moderate propyl chloride dehydrochlorination ability limit its propene selectivity in oxychlorination.

7. The selectivity to carbon monoxide (COx) determined during oxychlorination at approximately 20% propane conversion, SCOx, served as a measure of the catalysts' combustion tendency.

1. 催化剂在丙烷氧氯化反应中的活性按顺序递减为CuPO > VPO > CoPO > CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO。丙烯选择性遵循排名CrPO > FePO > MnPO > NiPO > TiPO > CoPO > CuPO > VPO，在5-20%丙烷转化率下。

2. 丙烯（C3H6）的选择性按顺序递减为FePO > CrPO > MnPO > TiPO > NiPO > CoPO > CuPO > VPO。

3. 在常压下，通过连续流动固定床反应器对丙烷氧氯化、丙烷氧化、丙基氯脱氯化和氢氯氧化进行了操作。

4. 在反应环境中平衡超过5小时后，催化剂的性能被评估，以避免任何催化剂重构的影响。

5. 随着温度范围为673-773 K和烷烃进料浓度为1.5-6 vol.％以及盐酸浓度为1.5-15 vol.％，CrPO可以保持超过90％的丙烯选择性。

6. 虽然MnPO的氯化物演化性能最低且燃烧倾向与CrPO相似，但由于其高丙烷裂解倾向和丙基氯脱氯化能力的中等水平，限制了其在氧氯化过程中的丙烯选择性。

7. 在约20%丙烷转化率下进行氧氯化期间确定的碳氧化物（COx）选择性，SCOx，用作催化剂燃烧倾向的度量。
