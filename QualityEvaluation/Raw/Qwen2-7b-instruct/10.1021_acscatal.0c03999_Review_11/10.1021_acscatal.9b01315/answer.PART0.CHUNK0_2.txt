[1] "This article investigates phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for the selective transformation of propane via oxychlorination chemistry to propylene, a pivotal chemical commodity."
[2] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[3] "Four categories of catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO)."
[4] "CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date."
[5] "In particular, CrPO showed no alterations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[6] "Selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination."
[7] "This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

The document describes and compares various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including oxyhalogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its higher reactivity and the fact that it readily reacts with halogens to form chlorinated derivatives. For instance, in oxychlorination chemistry, the phosphates of transition metals act as catalysts for the selective transformation of propane to propylene. The activity of these catalysts decreases in the order of copper phosphate (CuPO), vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO). The selectivity to propylene ranks as chromium phosphate (CrPO) and iron phosphate (FePO) leading, followed by manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), titanium phosphate (TiPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), copper phosphate (CuPO), and vanadium phosphate (VPO). The document identifies four categories of catalysts based on the products they favor: propylene (CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), and carbon oxides (VPO). CrPO is identified as the most selective system for propane oxychlorination, reaching up to 50% propylene yield. This system demonstrates stability over a long-term run, showing no alterations in structure and morphology. The reactivity of the phosphates is explained by their ability to evolve chlorine from the surface, which leads to high selectivity towards propylene when combined with fast dehydrochlorination kinetics and a low propensity for propane cracking and combustion.

本文描述并比较了各种卤素辅助方法，用于选择性脱氢丙烷至丙烯，包括氧化脱氢、氧化脱氢和熔融金属卤化物盐方法。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）存在显著差异，这是由于丙烷更易与卤素反应形成氯化衍生物。例如，在氧氯化化学中，过渡金属的磷酸盐作为催化剂用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。催化剂的活性按以下顺序递减：铜磷酸盐（CuPO）、钒磷酸盐（VPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铬磷酸盐（CrPO）、铁磷酸盐（FePO）、锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）和钛磷酸盐（TiPO）。丙烯选择性排名为铬磷酸盐（CrPO）和铁磷酸盐（FePO）领先，然后是锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）、钛磷酸盐（TiPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO）。本文根据生成的产品将催化剂分为四类：丙烯（CrPO）、裂解产物（MnPO、NiPO、TiPO、CoPO）、氯化碳氢化合物（CuPO）和碳氧化物（VPO）。CrPO 被认定为 POC 最具选择性的系统，达到高达 50% 的丙烯产率。该系统在长期运行中表现出稳定性，结构和形态没有改变。磷酸盐的反应性解释为它们从表面释放氯的能力，这导致高丙烯选择性，当结合快速脱氯化动力学和低丙烷裂解和燃烧倾向时。
