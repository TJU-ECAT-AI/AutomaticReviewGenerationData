<p>Compared to the conventional nonoxidative routes, the so-called oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has many advantages. For example, the ODH is thermodynamically favored even at low temperatures; it does not lead to the formation of coke and lower-molecular weight byproducts such as CO.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) is studied by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion are determined. We show that (i) the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. (ii) Compared to that at the terminal O site, the propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O.</p>
<p>For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface. This might be the reason the supported vanadium catalysts are found to be the most efficient in practice.</p>

The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene, focusing on the role of various surface oxygen species on the V2O5(001) catalyst. It explains that propane's CH bond can be activated by both terminal and bridging oxygen atoms with similar energy costs. At the terminal oxygen site, both radical and oxo-insertion pathways are possible, whereas only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging oxygen site. The propene production is easier at the bridging oxygen site due to the weaker binding of propoxide. The document suggests that for an efficient catalyst, there must be a balance between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ease of releasing propene. This is why supported vanadium catalysts are found to be the most effective in practice.

文献讨论了丙烷在V2O5(001)催化剂上氧化脱氢（ODH）生成丙烯的过程，重点分析了不同表面氧原子物种的作用。它解释说，丙烷的CH键可以在表面的终端氧原子和桥接氧原子上以相似的能量成本被激活。在终端氧原子位置，可能存在两种反应路径：自由基插入和氧化插入。而在桥接氧原子位置，只有氧化插入机制是可行的。在桥接氧原子位置生成丙烯更为容易，因为丙氧基在此处的结合力较弱。文献表明，对于一个高效的催化剂，需要在激活CH键的能力与从表面释放丙烯的易程度之间取得平衡。这也是为什么支持型钒催化剂在实践中表现出最高效率的原因。
