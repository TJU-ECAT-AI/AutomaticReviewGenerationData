The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on a single-crystal V2O5(001) surface using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The CH bond of propane can be activated by both terminal and bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both radical and oxo-insertion pathways are possible for CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. Propene production from propoxide at the bridging O site is easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide. It concludes that a single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst because the terminal O is too active, making it hard to release propene. An efficient catalyst needs to balance the ability to activate the CH bond and the ease of releasing propene.

研究集中在使用周期性的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算在单晶V2O5(001)表面进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）。丙烷的CH键可以在表面的终端和桥接晶格O原子上被激活，激活能相似。在终端O点，CH键激活可能通过自由基和氧化插入两种途径，而在桥接O点，仅氧化插入机制可行。在桥接O点生成丙烯从丙氧基更容易，因为丙氧基在此处的结合较弱。研究得出结论，单晶V2O5(001)不是一个好的催化剂，因为终端O过于活跃，难以释放丙烯。一个高效的催化剂需要在激活CH键的能力与释放丙烯的容易性之间取得平衡。
