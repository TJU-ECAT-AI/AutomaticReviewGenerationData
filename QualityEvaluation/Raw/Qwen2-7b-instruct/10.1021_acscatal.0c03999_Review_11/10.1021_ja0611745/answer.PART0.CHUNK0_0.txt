1. Thermodynamically, the methyl group's CH bond energy is 420 kJ/mol, while the methylene group's is 401 kJ/mol. Experimentally, isotopic studies by Chen et al. found that only the methylene CH bond is involved in the rate-determining step of dehydrogenation.

2. The theoretical study by Gilardoni et al. showed that the formation of i-propoxide is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Calculations revealed that the H atom binds less stably on the O(2) and O(3) sites compared to the O(1) site, with reductions of 7.2 kcal/mol and 0.63 kcal/mol, respectively.

4. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is significantly more favored than the other options.

5. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are viable for CH bond activation.

6. The reaction barriers for methylene CH bond activation are 27.3 kcal/mol on the O(1) site and 30.4 kcal/mol on the O(2) site.

7. Propene can easily be formed from i-propoxide on the O(2) site by releasing a H atom to a nearby O(2) or O(3) atom.

8. Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface shows slightly higher reactivity in CH bond activation compared to the O(2) atom.

1. 从热力学角度，甲基中的CH键能为420kJ/mol，而亚甲基中的CH键能为401kJ/mol。实验上，陈等人的同位素研究发现，只有亚甲基中的CH键在决定性步骤中起作用。

2. 根据吉拉多尼等人的理论研究，i-丙氧基的形成既在热力学上又在动力学上占优势。

3. 计算显示，H原子在O(2)和O(3)点的结合比在O(1)点弱，分别减少了7.2 kcal/mol和0.63 kcal/mol。

4. 在O(2)点，插入氧化机制远比其他选项更受欢迎。

5. 在O(1)点，自由基和插入氧化机制都是CH键激活的可行选择。

6. 甲基CH键激活的反应壁垒分别为O(1)点27.3 kcal/mol和O(2)点30.4 kcal/mol。

7. 从O(2)点的i-丙氧基可以轻易地通过释放一个H原子到附近的O(2)或O(3)原子来形成丙烯。

8. 总体而言，在V2O5(001)表面上，V的范德华氧O(1)在CH键激活方面略高于O(2)原子的活性。
