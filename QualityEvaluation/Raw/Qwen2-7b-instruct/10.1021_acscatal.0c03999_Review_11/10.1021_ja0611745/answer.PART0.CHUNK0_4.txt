1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers several advantages over conventional non-oxidative methods. It is thermodynamically favorable even at low temperatures, and it does not produce coke or lower-molecular weight byproducts like carbon monoxide (CO).

2. Catalyst activity and selectivity depend on their reducibility and basicity. Highly dispersed vanadium is essential for achieving high activity and selectivity. At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, but at higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites start to form.

3. Among the various oxygen sites on the V2O5(001) surface, the adsorption of propane at the O(2) site was the most stable, suggesting it might serve as a precursor for subsequent catalytic reactions.

4. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is significantly favored over other pathways. The O(3) site, however, is inactive in the CH bond activation process.

5. The ease of decomposition of propoxide into propene is notably higher on the O(2) site compared to other sites.

1. 氧化脱氢化(OHD)相对于传统的非氧化方法有许多优势。它在低温下热力学上更可取，且不会产生焦炭和较低分子量副产品如一氧化碳（CO）。

2. 催化剂的活性和选择性取决于其还原性和碱性。高度分散的钒对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。在低负载时，钒呈分子状分散，但在高负载时，开始形成V2O5晶粒。

3. 在V2O5(001)表面的各种氧位点中，丙烷在O(2)位点的吸附最稳定，这表明它可能是后续催化反应的前体。

4. 在O(2)位点，插入氧机制远比其他途径更为优选。而O(3)位点在CH键活化过程中是不活跃的。

5. 与其它位点相比，在O(2)位点将丙氧基分解为丙烯的难度要小得多。
