The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene, focusing on the role of various surface oxygen species on the V2O5(001) catalyst. It explains that propane's CH bond can be activated by both terminal and bridging oxygen atoms with similar energy costs. At the terminal oxygen site, both radical and oxo-insertion pathways are possible, whereas only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging oxygen site. The propene production is easier at the bridging oxygen site due to the weaker binding of propoxide. The document suggests that for an efficient catalyst, there must be a balance between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ease of releasing propene. This is why supported vanadium catalysts are found to be the most effective in practice.

文献讨论了丙烷在V2O5(001)催化剂上氧化脱氢（ODH）生成丙烯的过程，重点分析了不同表面氧原子物种的作用。它解释说，丙烷的CH键可以在表面的终端氧原子和桥接氧原子上以相似的能量成本被激活。在终端氧原子位置，可能存在两种反应路径：自由基插入和氧化插入。而在桥接氧原子位置，只有氧化插入机制是可行的。在桥接氧原子位置生成丙烯更为容易，因为丙氧基在此处的结合力较弱。文献表明，对于一个高效的催化剂，需要在激活CH键的能力与从表面释放丙烯的易程度之间取得平衡。这也是为什么支持型钒催化剂在实践中表现出最高效率的原因。

研究集中在使用周期性的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算在单晶V2O5(001)表面进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）。丙烷的CH键可以在表面的终端和桥接晶格O原子上被激活，激活能相似。在终端O点，CH键激活可能通过自由基和氧化插入两种途径，而在桥接O点，仅氧化插入机制可行。在桥接O点生成丙烯从丙氧基更容易，因为丙氧基在此处的结合较弱。研究得出结论，单晶V2O5(001)不是一个好的催化剂，因为终端O过于活跃，难以释放丙烯。一个高效的催化剂需要在激活CH键的能力与释放丙烯的容易性之间取得平衡。

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers several advantages over conventional non-oxidative methods. It is thermodynamically favorable even at low temperatures, and it does not produce coke or lower-molecular weight byproducts like carbon monoxide (CO).

2. Catalyst activity and selectivity depend on their reducibility and basicity. Highly dispersed vanadium is essential for achieving high activity and selectivity. At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, but at higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites start to form.

3. Among the various oxygen sites on the V2O5(001) surface, the adsorption of propane at the O(2) site was the most stable, suggesting it might serve as a precursor for subsequent catalytic reactions.

4. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is significantly favored over other pathways. The O(3) site, however, is inactive in the CH bond activation process.

5. The ease of decomposition of propoxide into propene is notably higher on the O(2) site compared to other sites.

1. 氧化脱氢化(OHD)相对于传统的非氧化方法有许多优势。它在低温下热力学上更可取，且不会产生焦炭和较低分子量副产品如一氧化碳（CO）。

2. 催化剂的活性和选择性取决于其还原性和碱性。高度分散的钒对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。在低负载时，钒呈分子状分散，但在高负载时，开始形成V2O5晶粒。

3. 在V2O5(001)表面的各种氧位点中，丙烷在O(2)位点的吸附最稳定，这表明它可能是后续催化反应的前体。

4. 在O(2)位点，插入氧机制远比其他途径更为优选。而O(3)位点在CH键活化过程中是不活跃的。

5. 与其它位点相比，在O(2)位点将丙氧基分解为丙烯的难度要小得多。
