The document investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The study determines the energetics and pathways for propane conversion to propene. It is found that the terminal and bridging lattice O atoms on the surface have similar activation energies for activating the CH bond of propane. However, the propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is easier due to weaker binding. Single-crystal V2O5(001) is not an effective catalyst because the terminal O is too active, leading to difficulties in releasing propene. An efficient catalyst needs to balance the ability to activate the CH bond with the ease of releasing propene.

文档使用周期密度泛函理论（DFT）计算研究了单晶V2O5(001)上的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）。研究确定了丙烷转化为丙烯的能量和途径。发现表面的终端氧原子和桥接氧原子具有相似的活性能量来激活丙烷的CH键。然而，在桥接氧位上形成的丙烯醇更容易生成，因为该位置的丙烯醇与表面的结合较弱。单晶V2O5(001)不是一个好的催化剂，因为终端氧过于活跃，导致丙烯难以释放。一个高效的催化剂需要在激活CH键的能力与从表面释放丙烯的能力之间取得平衡。
