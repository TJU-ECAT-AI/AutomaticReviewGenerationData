Reactions of Molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2 are relevant to halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propene. This process typically involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are subsequently oxidized to alkenes. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation provides benefits over traditional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. Oxyhalogenation refers to the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, leading to the formation of an alkene. Molten metal halide salt approaches employ a molten salt bath with a halide ion as the oxidant. Propane exhibits notably higher reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation compared to methane and ethane because of its larger size and more intricate interactions with halogen species.

卤素介导的氧化脱氢反应与熔融LiI与I2、H2O和O2相关。选择性氧化脱氢（ODH）是将丙烷转化为丙烯的关键过程。该过程通常涉及烷基自由基的形成，随后被氧化为烯烃。卤素辅助脱氢在传统催化方法中提供了优势，由于卤素物种的高度反应性。氧卤化物是指烷烃与氧卤化物的反应，导致形成烯烃。熔融金属卤化盐方法使用含卤离子的熔融盐浴作为氧化剂。丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢中的反应活性明显高于甲烷和乙烷，这归因于其更大的尺寸及其与卤素物种的更复杂相互作用。
