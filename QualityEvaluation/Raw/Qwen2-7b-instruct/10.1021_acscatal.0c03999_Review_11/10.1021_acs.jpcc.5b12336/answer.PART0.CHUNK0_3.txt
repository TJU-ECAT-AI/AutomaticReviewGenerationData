Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In these processes, a halogen atom acts as a mediator to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen or its compounds to promote the reaction, while oxyhalogenation involves an alkane reacting with a halogenated oxygen compound. Molten metal halide salt approaches use molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its specific chemical structure. Specific reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of catalysts tailored to each method.
