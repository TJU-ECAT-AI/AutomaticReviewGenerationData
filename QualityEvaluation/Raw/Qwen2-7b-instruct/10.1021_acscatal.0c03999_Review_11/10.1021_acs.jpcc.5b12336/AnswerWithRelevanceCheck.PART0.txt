          Reactions of Molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2 are relevant to halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propene. Typically, this process involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are then oxidized to alkenes. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation provides benefits over traditional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. Oxyhalogenation refers to the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, leading to the formation of an alkene. Molten metal halide salt approaches employ a molten salt bath with a halide ion as the oxidant. Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation is notably higher than that of methane and ethane because of its larger size and more intricate interactions with halogen species.

          卤素介导的氧化脱氢反应与熔融LiI与I2、H2O和O2相关。选择性氧化脱氢（ODH）是将丙烷转化为丙烯的关键过程。该过程通常涉及烷基自由基的形成，随后被氧化为烯烃。卤素辅助脱氢在传统催化方法中提供了优势，由于卤素物种的高度反应性。氧卤化物是指烷烃与氧卤化物的反应，导致形成烯烃。熔融金属卤化盐方法使用含卤离子的熔融盐浴作为氧化剂。丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢中的反应活性明显高于甲烷和乙烷，这归因于其较大的尺寸和与卤素物种更复杂相互作用。

          Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In these processes, a halogen atom acts as a mediator to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen or its compounds to promote the reaction, while oxyhalogenation involves an alkane reacting with a halogenated oxygen compound. Molten metal halide salt approaches use molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its specific chemical structure. Specific reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the use of catalysts tailored to each method.
