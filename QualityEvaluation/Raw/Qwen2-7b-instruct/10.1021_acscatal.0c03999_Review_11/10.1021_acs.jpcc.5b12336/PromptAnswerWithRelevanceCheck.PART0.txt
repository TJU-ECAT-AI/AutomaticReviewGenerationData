Reactions of Molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2 are relevant to halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propene. This process typically involves the formation of alkyl radicals, which are subsequently oxidized to alkenes. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation provides benefits over traditional catalytic methods due to the high reactivity of halogen species. Oxyhalogenation refers to the reaction of an alkane with an oxyhalide, leading to the formation of an alkene. Molten metal halide salt approaches employ a molten salt bath with a halide ion as the oxidant. Propane exhibits notably higher reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation compared to methane and ethane because of its larger size and more intricate interactions with halogen species.

卤素介导的氧化脱氢反应与熔融LiI与I2、H2O和O2相关。选择性氧化脱氢（ODH）是将丙烷转化为丙烯的关键过程。该过程通常涉及烷基自由基的形成，随后被氧化为烯烃。卤素辅助脱氢在传统催化方法中提供了优势，由于卤素物种的高度反应性。氧卤化物是指烷烃与氧卤化物的反应，导致形成烯烃。熔融金属卤化盐方法使用含卤离子的熔融盐浴作为氧化剂。丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢中的反应活性明显高于甲烷和乙烷，这归因于其更大的尺寸及其与卤素物种的更复杂相互作用。

1. Halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane utilizes iodine (I2) to form propene. This process contrasts with oxyhalogenation, which involves oxygen and a halogen source, and the molten metal halide salt approach, where reactions take place in a molten lithium iodide (LiI) environment. Propane exhibits different reactivity compared to methane and ethane because of its larger molecular size and higher boiling point, affecting its interaction with halogen compounds.

1. 在卤素辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中，碘（I2）的存在导致生成丙烯。这与使用氧和卤素化合物的氧卤化过程以及在熔融锂碘（LiI）环境中进行反应的熔融金属卤化物方法不同。由于其较大的分子大小和较高的沸点，丙烷在与卤素化合物的相互作用中表现出与甲烷和乙烷不同的反应性。

2. 卤素辅助的氧化脱氢化主要通过碘（I2）的参与，形成丙烯。氧卤化通常涉及氧气和卤素化合物的使用。在熔融金属卤化物方法中，反应发生在熔融锂碘（LiI）环境中。丙烷在这些卤素辅助过程中的反应性与其甲烷和乙烷相比有显著差异，这归因于其更大的分子尺寸和更高的沸点，影响了它与卤素化合物的相互作用。

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. In these processes, a halogen atom acts as a mediator to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen or its compounds to promote the reaction, while oxyhalogenation involves an alkane reacting with a halogenated oxygen compound. Molten metal halide salt approaches use molten salts containing metal halides as the reaction medium.
