The document provided does not contain information on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Therefore, I am unable to describe and compare these methods based on the information given.
