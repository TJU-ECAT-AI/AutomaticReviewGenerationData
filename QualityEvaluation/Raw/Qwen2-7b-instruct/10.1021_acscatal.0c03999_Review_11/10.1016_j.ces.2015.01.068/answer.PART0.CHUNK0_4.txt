The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2 over V2O5(0 0 1). The results showed that ethylbenzene is more reactive than benzene under similar conditions, suggesting that CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation process. The reaction conditions included temperature, pressure, and the presence of CO2. The study also investigated the selectivity of the reaction towards styrene formation, indicating that the use of CO2 improves the selectivity of the dehydrogenation process.

研究集中在乙烯苯在V2O5(0 0 1)上的脱氢转化为苯乙烯，同时存在CO2。结果表明，在类似条件下，乙烯苯比苯更活跃，这表明CO2可以增强脱氢过程。反应条件包括温度、压力和CO2的存在。研究还探讨了反应向苯乙烯形成的选择性，表明使用CO2可以提高脱氢过程的选择性。
