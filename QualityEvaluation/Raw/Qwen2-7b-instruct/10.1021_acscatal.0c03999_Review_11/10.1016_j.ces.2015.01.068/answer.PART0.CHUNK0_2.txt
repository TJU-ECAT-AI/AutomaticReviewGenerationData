The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using V2O5(0 0 1) as a catalyst. The research involved examining the effects of varying conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the inclusion of CO2 on the reaction. The aim was to optimize these conditions to maximize the production of styrene while minimizing the creation of byproducts. The process begins with ethylbenzene being adsorbed onto the V2O5(0 0 1) surface, followed by the breaking of the C-C bond, leading to the formation of styrene.
