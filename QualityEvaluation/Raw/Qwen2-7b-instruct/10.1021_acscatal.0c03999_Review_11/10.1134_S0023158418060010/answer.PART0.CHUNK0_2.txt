[1] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[2] "In the case of the gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over a negative effect."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The literature does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane. However, it does compare the effects of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, preventing the adsorption of olefins and decreasing propane conversion. In chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases the yield of propylene and stability of operation due to coke and hydrogen oxidation. In gallium systems, CO2 complicates propylene formation and reduces its yield. This is because the presence of reduced gallium oxide species is necessary for propane dehydrogenation, and CO2 oxidizes these species. In summary, propane's reactivity differs from other alkanes due to its unique interaction with CO2 and its dependence on the catalyst type.

描述并比较卤素辅助的各种选择性丙烷脱氢方法，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中相对于甲烷和其他烷烃（如乙烷）的反应性存在显著差异。

文献没有具体讨论使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物或熔融金属卤化盐方法对丙烷进行脱氢。然而，它确实比较了二氧化碳对铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的影响。二氧化碳作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，避免了引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且能够高效利用这种温室气体。在镓系统中，二氧化碳的引入显著复杂了丙烯的形成，并导致其产量下降。在铬系统中，由于焦炭和氢的氧化，二氧化碳的引入增加了丙烯的产率和操作稳定性。这是因为镓氧化物物种的存在对于丙烷脱氢是必要的，而二氧化碳氧化这些物种。简而言之，丙烷的反应性之所以与其他烷烃不同，是因为它与二氧化碳的独特相互作用及其对催化剂类型的高度依赖。
