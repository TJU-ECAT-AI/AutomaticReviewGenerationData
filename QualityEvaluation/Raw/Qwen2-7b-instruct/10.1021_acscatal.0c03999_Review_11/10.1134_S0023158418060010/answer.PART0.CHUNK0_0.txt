[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined."
[2] "It was found that the relatively low acidity of silica gels prevents intense coke deposition and has a positive effect on the stability of catalyst operation."
[3] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[4] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[5] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[6] "This negative effect was more pronounced for the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield."
[7] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[8] "In the case of the gallium oxide catalysts, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."

Propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts was studied with various techniques. The silica gels' low acidity prevents intensive coke deposition, enhancing catalyst stability. However, the dispersion of the active phase on GaOx/SiO2 catalysts is insufficient, leading to low specific activity. Chromium oxide systems showed increased propylene yield and stability when CO2 was introduced, overshadowing negative effects. Gallium oxide catalysts faced a more pronounced negative impact from CO2, decreasing propylene yield. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption. It prevents olefin polymerization and decreases propane conversion. In chromium systems, CO2 oxidation of coke and hydrogen enhances propylene yield and stability.

在铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂上对丙烷脱氢进行了研究，使用了各种技术。硅胶的低酸性防止了大量焦炭沉积，提高了催化剂的稳定性。然而，GaOx/SiO2催化剂上的活性相分散不足，导致特定活性较低。在铬氧化物系统中，在引入CO2后，丙烯产量增加且操作稳定性提高，掩盖了负面影响。镓氧化物催化剂在面对CO2时面临更为显著的负面影响，导致丙烯产量下降。CO2作为氧化剂，对氢和焦炭进行氧化，与烃类竞争吸附。它阻止了烯烃聚合并降低了丙烷的转化率。在铬系统中，CO2氧化焦炭和氢提高了丙烯产量和稳定性。
