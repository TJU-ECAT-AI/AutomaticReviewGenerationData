[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined."
[2] "It was found that the relatively low acidity of silica gels prevents intense coke deposition and has a positive effect on the stability of catalyst operation."
[3] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[4] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[5] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[6] "This negative effect was more pronounced for the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield."
[7] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[8] "In the case of the gallium oxide catalysts, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[9] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts was studied with various techniques. The silica gels' low acidity prevents intensive coke deposition, enhancing catalyst stability. However, the dispersion of the active phase on GaOx/SiO2 catalysts is insufficient, leading to low specific activity. Chromium oxide systems showed increased propylene yield and stability when CO2 was introduced, overshadowing negative effects. Gallium oxide catalysts faced a more pronounced negative impact from CO2, decreasing propylene yield. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption. It prevents olefin polymerization and decreases propane conversion. In chromium systems, CO2 oxidation of coke and hydrogen enhances propylene yield and stability.

在铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂上对丙烷脱氢进行了研究，使用了各种技术。硅胶的低酸性防止了大量焦炭沉积，提高了催化剂的稳定性。然而，GaOx/SiO2催化剂上的活性相分散不足，导致特定活性较低。在铬氧化物系统中，在引入CO2后，丙烯产量增加且操作稳定性提高，掩盖了负面影响。镓氧化物催化剂在面对CO2时面临更为显著的负面影响，导致丙烯产量下降。CO2作为氧化剂，对氢和焦炭进行氧化，与烃类竞争吸附。它阻止了烯烃聚合并降低了丙烷的转化率。在铬系统中，CO2氧化焦炭和氢提高了丙烯产量和稳定性。

<p>Compared to other alkanes such as methane and ethane, propane exhibits significantly different reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes. These processes involve the use of halogens or their compounds to selectively convert propane into propene.</p>
<p>Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation typically involves the use of bromine or chlorine in liquid or vapor form. The reaction conditions often require elevated temperatures and pressures, facilitating the breaking of the C-H bonds in propane molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds to selectively dehydrogenate propane into propene. The reaction conditions usually include temperatures ranging from 500°C to 800°C and pressures from 1 to 10 atmospheres.</p>
<p>Oxyhalogenation combines the use of halogen and oxygen to dehydrogenate propane. This process can be carried out under similar conditions to oxidative dehydrogenation, but it often requires higher temperatures and pressures.</p>
<p>Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of molten salts composed of alkali metal halides. These salts can lower the activation energy required for dehydrogenation, allowing the process to occur at lower temperatures and pressures compared to the previous methods.</p>
<p>The differing reactivity of propane in these processes can be attributed to its larger size and higher boiling point compared to methane and ethane. This leads to stronger C-H bonds, which require more energy to break. Additionally, the presence of multiple C-H bonds in propane allows for more selective dehydrogenation pathways compared to the single C-H bonds in methane and ethane.</p>

The halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include halogen-assisted dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These processes differ significantly from the dehydrogenation of methane and ethane due to the larger size and stronger C-H bonds in propane. Reaction conditions vary across methods, with halogen-assisted dehydrogenation requiring elevated temperatures and pressures, oxidative dehydrogenation operating at temperatures from 500°C to 800°C and pressures from 1 to 10 atmospheres, oxyhalogenation involving higher temperatures and pressures, and molten metal halide salt approaches occurring at lower temperatures and pressures due to the reduced activation energy provided by the molten salts. The selectivity of propane dehydrogenation in these processes is influenced by the molecule's size and the presence of multiple C-H bonds, which allow for more selective pathways compared to the single C-H bonds in methane and ethane.

卤素辅助的方法包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。这些过程与甲烷和乙烷的脱氢作用有显著不同，这归因于丙烷较大的尺寸和更强的C-H键。反应条件根据不同方法而变化，卤素辅助脱氢需要高温和高压，氧化脱氢在500°C到800°C的温度和1到10大气压下进行，氧卤化涉及更高的温度和压力，熔融金属卤化盐方法在较低的温度和压力下进行，因为熔融盐提供了降低活化能的优势。丙烷在这些过程中的选择性脱氢受到分子大小的影响以及存在多个C-H键，这允许比单个C-H键在甲烷和乙烷中存在的更选择性的路径。

Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The literature does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane. However, it does compare the effects of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts. CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, preventing the adsorption of olefins and decreasing propane conversion. In chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases the yield of propylene and stability of operation due to coke and hydrogen oxidation. In gallium systems, CO2 complicates propylene formation and reduces its yield. This is because the presence of reduced gallium oxide species is necessary for propane dehydrogenation, and CO2 oxidizes these species. In summary, propane's reactivity differs from other alkanes due to its unique interaction with CO2 and its dependence on the catalyst type.

描述并比较卤素辅助的各种选择性丙烷脱氢方法，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中相对于甲烷和其他烷烃（如乙烷）的反应性存在显著差异。

文献没有具体讨论使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物或熔融金属卤化盐方法对丙烷进行脱氢。然而，它确实比较了二氧化碳对铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的影响。二氧化碳作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，避免了引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且能够高效利用这种温室气体。在镓系统中，二氧化碳的引入显著复杂了丙烯的形成，并导致其产量下降。在铬系统中，由于焦炭和氢的氧化，二氧化碳的引入增加了丙烯的产率和操作稳定性。这是因为镓氧化物物种的存在对于丙烷脱氢是必要的，而二氧化碳氧化这些物种。简而言之，丙烷的反应性之所以与其他烷烃不同，是因为它与二氧化碳的独特相互作用及其对催化剂类型的高度依赖。

[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propan and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "The introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The document describes the use of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane, showing that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke. It also competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. The introduction of CO2 complicates the formation of propylene and decreases its yield in gallium-based catalysts, while in chromium catalysts, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to CO2 outweighs any negative effects.

<p>In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems.

<p>In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect. This negative effect was more pronounced for the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield.</p>
<p>The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems.</p>
<p>Note that the GaOx/SiO2 systems began to be reduced in the presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 510520, and they were reduced only partially under dehydrogenation conditions (600) because a maximum of H2 absorption on TPR was observed at > 800.</p>

The document discusses the catalytic properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, focusing on the impact of CO2. It highlights that low-acidity silica gels prevent intense coke deposition and positively affect catalyst stability. The study also finds that insufficient dispersity of the active phase leads to low specific activity in GaOx/SiO2 systems. In contrast, the introduction of CO2 increases propylene yield and catalyst stability in CrOx/SiO2 systems, while negatively affecting GaOx/SiO2 systems. The use of low-acidity silicate supports reduces coke formation and enhances catalyst effectiveness. The GaOx/SiO2 systems reduce at temperatures around 510-520°C and are only partially reduced under dehydrogenation conditions due to limited hydrogen absorption at higher temperatures.

本文讨论了GaOx/SiO2和CrOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的催化性质，重点考察了二氧化碳的影响。它强调，低酸性硅胶可以防止大量焦炭沉积，并对催化剂操作稳定性产生积极影响。研究还发现，活性相分散度不足导致GaOx/SiO2系统特定活性较低。相反，在CrOx/SiO2系统中，引入二氧化碳提高了丙烯产量和催化剂稳定性，而对GaOx/SiO2系统的负面影响更为明显，导致丙烯产量下降。使用低酸性硅酸盐支持体可以减少焦炭形成并增强催化剂有效性。GaOx/SiO2系统在约510-520°C时开始还原，并在脱氢条件下仅部分还原，因为高温下氢吸收有限。
