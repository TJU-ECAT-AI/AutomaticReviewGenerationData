<p>The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined.</p>
<p>It was found that the relatively low acidity of silica gels prevents intense coke deposition and has a positive effect on the stability of catalyst operation. At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface.</p>
<p>In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems. It was found that the appearance and growth of catalytic activity with temperature was accompanied by the formation of the reduced forms of gallium oxide, the fraction of which was limited under the conditions of dehydrogenation (600C).</p>
<p>In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect. This negative effect was more pronounced for the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield.</p>
<p>The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems.</p>
<p>Note that the GaOx/SiO2 systems began to be reduced in the presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 510520, and they were reduced only partially under dehydrogenation conditions (600) because a maximum of H2 absorption on TPR was observed at > 800.</p>

The document discusses the catalytic properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, focusing on the impact of CO2. It highlights that low-acidity silica gels prevent intense coke deposition and positively affect catalyst stability. The study also finds that insufficient dispersity of the active phase leads to low specific activity in GaOx/SiO2 systems. In contrast, the introduction of CO2 increases propylene yield and catalyst stability in CrOx/SiO2 systems, while negatively affecting GaOx/SiO2 systems. The use of low-acidity silicate supports reduces coke formation and enhances catalyst effectiveness. The GaOx/SiO2 systems reduce at temperatures around 510-520°C and are only partially reduced under dehydrogenation conditions due to limited hydrogen absorption at higher temperatures.

本文讨论了GaOx/SiO2和CrOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的催化性质，重点考察了二氧化碳的影响。它强调，低酸性硅胶可以防止大量焦炭沉积，并对催化剂操作稳定性产生积极影响。研究还发现，活性相分散度不足导致GaOx/SiO2系统特定活性较低。相反，在CrOx/SiO2系统中，引入二氧化碳提高了丙烯产量和催化剂稳定性，而对GaOx/SiO2系统的负面影响更为明显，导致丙烯产量下降。使用低酸性硅酸盐支持体可以减少焦炭形成并增强催化剂有效性。GaOx/SiO2系统在约510-520°C时开始还原，并在脱氢条件下仅部分还原，因为高温下氢吸收有限。
