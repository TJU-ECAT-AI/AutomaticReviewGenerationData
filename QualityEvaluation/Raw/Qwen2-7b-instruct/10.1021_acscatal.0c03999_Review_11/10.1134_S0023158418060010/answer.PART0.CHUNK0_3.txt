[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propan and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "The introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

1. The document describes the use of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane, showing that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke. It also competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. The introduction of CO2 complicates the formation of propylene and decreases its yield in gallium-based catalysts, while in chromium catalysts, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to CO2 outweighs any negative effects.

1. 文档描述了二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢过程中的使用，显示二氧化碳是氢和焦炭的氧化剂。它还与碳氢化合物竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。向系统中引入二氧化碳会阻碍丙烯的形成并降低其产率，在镓基催化剂中，而铬催化剂中，二氧化碳导致的焦炭和氢的氧化带来的丙烯产率提高和操作稳定性增加，超过了任何负面影响。
