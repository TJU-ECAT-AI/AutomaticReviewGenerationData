[1] "Much of the current debate centers around the nature of the active metal oxide surface species, which, according to Lunsfords suggestion,[30b,32] corresponds to an oxygen-centered radical (Scheme 3)."
[2] "However, no contro- versy exists as to the rate-limiting step of OCM, and the consensus view assigns this role to the initial homolytic scission of the CH bond of methane."
[3] "For example, in the oxidative CH3OH decomposition on Pt(111), according to periodic, self-consistent DFT calculations, the rate-limiting step is now assigned to initial OH bond activation to produce a methoxy-bound intermediate."
[4] "A change in mechanism has also been noted in the electrochemical decomposition of CH3OH on platinum surfaces; a KIE of 3 for the system CH3OH/CD3OH and its absence for the CH3OH/CH3OD couple, together with other data, were interpreted in favor of the hydroxymethyl pathway ( B in Scheme 4)."
[5] "Finally, initial CH rather than OH bond cleavage is computationally predicted to be favored in methanol activation on sub-nanometer Pd clusters."

1. The active surface species in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is believed to be an oxygen-centered radical, as proposed by Lunsford. The primary rate-limiting step is the initial homolytic cleavage of the CH bond in methane.

2. In the context of the oxidative decomposition of methanol on a platinum surface, especially on Pt(111), the rate-determining step is now recognized as the initial activation of the OH bond, leading to the formation of a methoxy-bound intermediate.

3. Electrochemical decomposition of methanol on platinum surfaces has shown a significant difference in the rate-determining step compared to gas-phase reactions. A kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 3 was observed for the CH3OH/CD3OH system, suggesting the hydroxymethyl pathway (B in Scheme 4).

4. Computational studies suggest that in the activation of methanol on sub-nanometer palladium clusters, the initial cleavage of the CH bond rather than the OH bond is energetically favored.

1. 氧化耦合甲烷（OCM）过程中的活性表面物种被认为是氧中心的自由基，这是由Lunsford提出的。主要的速率决定步骤是甲烷中CH键的初始均裂。

2. 在铂表面上的甲醇氧化分解，特别是Pt(111)，现在认为初始激活OH键，产生一个甲氧基绑定的中间体是决定性的步骤。

3. 对于在铂表面上电化学分解甲醇的情况，与气相反应相比，速率决定步骤显示出显著差异。对于CH3OH/CD3OH系统观察到了KIE为3，这表明采用羟基甲基途径（图4中的B）。

4. 计算研究表明，在纳米尺寸钯簇上甲醇的活化时，初始裂解CH键而不是OH键在能量上更为有利。
