<p>The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems.</p>
<p>Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed.</p>
<p>Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.</p>

This study presents a series of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. The ceria material is chosen for its oxygen mobility and storage capacity, which enhances the catalytic performance for the ODH pathway. High Fe/Ce ratios lead to increased stability and promising performance for up to 20 hours. The deactivation mechanisms for the catalysts include coke deposition on the surface for low Fe loading catalysts and CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals for high Fe loading catalysts.
