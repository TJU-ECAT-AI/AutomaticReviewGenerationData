The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS).

This paper discusses the development of Fe-doped ceria catalysts for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The catalysts were synthesized via a co-precipitation method, calcined at 600°C, and characterized using various techniques. The catalytic performance was tested in a fixed bed reactor with propane, CO2, and nitrogen as reactants. The reaction conditions, including temperature and flow rates, were varied to optimize the conversion and selectivity of propane to propylene.

[1] "Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."
[2] "Vast availability of low molecular weight alkanes due to the recent shale gas revolution is considered as a game-changing opportunity towards the potential development of on-purpose production processes."
[3] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere."
[4] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[5] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[6] "With CO2 being a soft oxidant,it was found that reduced Cr species can be partially re-oxidized to higher oxidative states."
[7] "Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."
[8] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."
[9] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites."

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. However, the specific reaction conditions for each method are not explicitly detailed in the provided literature. 

Dehydrogenation with halogens typically involves heating propane in the presence of a halogen, leading to the removal of hydrogen atoms and the formation of propene. The reaction conditions might include high temperatures and the presence of a catalyst that facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) uses oxygen or a weaker oxidant like carbon dioxide (CO2) to selectively convert propane to propene. This process often requires higher temperatures than dehydrogenation with halogens but benefits from the lower risk of over-oxidation and coke formation associated with oxygen. The reaction conditions for ODH involve propane, oxygen or CO2, and a catalyst that promotes the desired dehydrogenation reactions while inhibiting unwanted side reactions.

Oxyhalogenation combines halogen and oxygen to oxidize propane to propene, potentially offering a compromise between the harsh conditions of halogen-only processes and the selectivity issues of pure oxygen processes. The specific conditions depend on the balance between halogen and oxygen and the catalyst employed.

Molten metal halide salt approaches utilize salts of halogenated metals in a molten state to catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. These processes might involve complex reaction conditions, including the use of a specific salt and a defined melting point for optimal catalytic activity.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the different chemical properties and reactivities of the reactants and catalysts involved. Propane, with its larger size and more stable carbon-hydrogen bonds, requires higher temperatures and more specific catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation efficiently. The selectivity and efficiency of these processes are influenced by factors such as catalyst type, reaction temperature, and the nature of the oxidant used.

In summary, while the document outlines the general concepts of these dehydrogenation methods, it does not provide detailed reaction conditions for each approach. The differences in reactivity stem from the unique characteristics of propane and the requirements of the catalytic systems used in each process.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。然而，这些方法的具体反应条件在提供的文献中并未详细说明。

卤素脱氢通常涉及在卤素存在的条件下加热丙烷，导致氢原子的去除并形成丙烯。反应条件可能包括高温和促进脱氢过程的催化剂。

氧化脱氢（ODH）使用氧气或较弱的氧化剂如二氧化碳（CO2）来选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。这一过程往往需要比卤素脱氢更高的温度，但受益于避免深氧化和焦炭形成的风险，与纯氧过程相比具有更好的选择性。ODH反应条件涉及丙烷、氧气或CO2以及促进所需脱氢反应同时抑制不希望的副反应的催化剂。

氧卤化结合卤素和氧气氧化丙烷生成丙烯，可能提供卤素仅用过程和纯氧过程选择性问题之间的折衷。具体条件取决于卤素和氧气之间的平衡以及所使用的催化剂。

熔融金属卤化盐方法利用熔融卤化金属盐作为催化剂催化丙烷脱氢。这些过程可能涉及复杂的反应条件，包括特定盐的使用及其熔点，以获得最佳的催化活性。

丙烷与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的反应性存在显著差异，这归因于反应物和所用催化剂的特性和差异。由于丙烷较大的尺寸和更稳定的碳-氢键，需要更高的温度和更特定的催化剂才能有效地进行脱氢。这些过程的选择性和效率受催化剂类型、反应温度和所用氧化剂性质的影响因素。

综上所述，虽然文档概述了这些脱氢方法的一般概念，但它并未提供每个方法的具体反应条件。这些差异源自丙烷的独特特性和所用催化系统的特定要求。

The literature discusses the investigation of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using a series of Fe-doped ceria (CeO2) catalysts. These catalysts were synthesized via a co-precipitation method, and calcination at 600°C was found to benefit the catalysts by providing higher specific surface area and forming a Fe-Ce solid solution instead of separate cerianite-hematite phases. The study involved using a fixed bed quartz tube reactor packed with the catalysts, and the catalytic performance was assessed under varying temperatures from 450°C to 600°C. The reactions were conducted in a gas environment containing propane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The catalytic activity was determined by calculating reactant conversion, selectivity, and yield to the main product and by-products. The study highlights the structural implications of Fe doping on the ceria catalysts, which impact the catalytic performance and stability in propane ODH reactions.

However, the document does not provide information on the halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the use of Fe-doped ceria catalysts for propane ODH in the presence of CO2. Therefore, it is not possible to describe and compare these various halogen-assisted methods based on the provided information.
