<p>Catalytic Performance and Stability of Fe-Doped CeO2 in Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation Using Carbon Dioxide as Oxidant Hedun Wang a and George Tsilomelekis* a</p>
<p>Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed.</p>
<p>Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading.</p>
<p>Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.</p>

The study focuses on the use of Fe-doped ceria catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide as the oxidant. High Fe/Ce ratios enhance the propane oxidative dehydrogenation pathway while suppressing propane cracking. Catalysts with moderate Fe loading showed stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. The deactivation mechanisms for low Fe catalysts involve coke deposition on the surface, whereas high Fe loading catalysts deactivate due to CeO2 sintering and Fe migration forming nanocrystals.

本研究关注使用Fe掺杂铈氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下进行丙烷氧化脱氢。高Fe/Ce比提高了丙烷氧化脱氢途径，同时抑制了丙烷裂解。负载适度Fe的催化剂显示了稳定的丙烷转化和长达20小时的高丙烯选择性。低Fe催化剂的失活机制涉及表面焦炭沉积，而高Fe负载催化剂由于CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体导致失活。
