The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS).

The effect of oxide supports was also investigated by the same research group highlighting the CeO2 as the most promising support26 due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission.

To that end, we introduce Fe3+, which is proved to be active for propane dehydrogenation23, 29-30 as well as CO2 activation21, 23, 31, into ceria lattice with a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios.

The catalytic activity was evaluated in a fixed bed quartz tube reactor (4mm ID) packed with 200mg catalyst diluted in 1000 mg of quartz sand (ACROS Organics 40-100 mesh).

This paper discusses the development of Fe-doped ceria catalysts for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The catalysts were synthesized via a co-precipitation method, calcined at 600°C, and characterized using various techniques. The catalytic performance was tested in a fixed bed reactor with propane, CO2, and nitrogen as reactants. The reaction conditions, including temperature and flow rates, were varied to optimize the conversion and selectivity of propane to propylene.
