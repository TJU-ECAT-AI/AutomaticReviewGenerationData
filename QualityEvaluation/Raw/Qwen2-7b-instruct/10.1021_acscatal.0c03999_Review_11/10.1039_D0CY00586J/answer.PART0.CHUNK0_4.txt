Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.

The literature discusses the investigation of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using a series of Fe-doped ceria (CeO2) catalysts. These catalysts were synthesized via a co-precipitation method, and calcination at 600°C was found to benefit the catalysts by providing higher specific surface area and forming a Fe-Ce solid solution instead of separate cerianite-hematite phases. The study involved using a fixed bed quartz tube reactor packed with the catalysts, and the catalytic performance was assessed under varying temperatures from 450°C to 600°C. The reactions were conducted in a gas environment containing propane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The catalytic activity was determined by calculating reactant conversion, selectivity, and yield to the main product and by-products. The study highlights the structural implications of Fe doping on the ceria catalysts, which impact the catalytic performance and stability in propane ODH reactions.

However, the document does not provide information on the halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It focuses on the use of Fe-doped ceria catalysts for propane ODH in the presence of CO2. Therefore, it is not possible to describe and compare these various halogen-assisted methods based on the provided information.

文献讨论了在二氧化碳存在下，利用一系列Fe掺杂的铈氧化物（CeO2）催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的研究。这些催化剂通过共沉淀法合成，并发现在600°C的煅烧有助于提高催化剂的比表面积，并形成Fe-Ce固溶体，而不是单独的铈亚铁酸盐和赤铁矿相。研究涉及使用直径为4mm的石英管固定床反应器填充催化剂，并与石英砂混合（ACROS有机公司，40-100目）。在450°C至600°C的温度范围内评估了催化活性，气体环境包含丙烷、二氧化碳和氮气。通过计算反应物转化率、选择性和主要产物及副产物的产率来确定催化活性。研究强调了Fe掺杂对铈催化剂结构的影响，这影响了丙烷ODH反应的催化性能和稳定性。

然而，所提供的信息没有提供关于卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯的信息，包括用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐方法。它专注于在二氧化碳存在的条件下使用Fe掺杂铈催化剂进行丙烷ODH。因此，无法基于提供的信息描述和比较这些各种卤素辅助方法。
