[1] "Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane."
[2] "The fast nature of these re-oxidation pathways renders their dynamics inaccessible to direct experimental inquiry from the kinetic behavior of steady-state ODH catalysis."
[3] "Re-oxidation rate constants can be indirectly probed through their in-situ UV visible spectra during the transient formation and consumption of reduced centers in response to changes in reductant to oxidant ratios in the reactant streams."
[4] "Previous studies of propane ODH on supported VOx-based catalysts indicate that re-oxidation first-order rate constants are 103105 times larger than for the kinetically-relevant reduction steps."
[5] "The low surface densities of two-electron reduced centers and their energetically-unfavorable pairing lead to the isolation of such centers during ODH reactions."

1.Propane reacts differently from other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes.
2.The quick nature of these re-oxidation pathways makes them hard to study with regular kinetic methods.
3.We can learn about re-oxidation rates indirectly by looking at UV light changes in real-time.
4.Studies of propane being processed by VOx catalysts show that re-oxidation happens much faster than the main reactions.
5.Low numbers and tricky pairing of certain active sites make these sites hard to find during propane processing.

1.丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性有很大不同。
2.这些快速的氧化还原过程的动态特性使得我们无法通过稳定的催化反应来直接研究它们的活性。
3.我们可以通过实时观察紫外线的变化，间接了解氧化还原速率。
4.之前的研究显示，在使用VOx基催化剂处理丙烷时，氧化还原的第一阶速率常数比主要反应快10的3到5次方倍。
5.活性位点的数量低且配对不容易，导致在丙烷处理过程中很难发现这些位点。
