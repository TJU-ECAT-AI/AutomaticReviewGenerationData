Dioxygen activation routes in Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles catalyzed by metal oxides Stephanie Kwon a, Prashant Deshlahra b, Enrique Iglesia a,a Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States b Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, United States a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 23 February 2018 Revised 23 April 2018 Accepted 17 May 2018 Keywords: Oxidative dehydrogenation Redox cycle Oxidation catalysis Dioxygen activation Density functional theory Polyoxometalate Epoxidation a b s t r a c t Catalytic redox cycles involve dioxygen activation via peroxo (OO) or H2O2 species, denoted as inner- sphere and outer-sphere routes respectively, for metal-oxo catalysts solvated by liquids. On solid oxides, O2 activation is typically more facile than the reduction part of redox cycles, making kinetic inquiries dif- ficult at steady-state. These steps are examined here for oxidative alkanol dehydrogenation (ODH) by scavenging OO species with C3H6 to form epoxides and by energies and barriers from density functional theory. Alkanols react with O-atoms (O) in oxides to form vicinal OH pairs that eliminate H2O to form OO at O-vacancies formed or react with O2 to give H2O2. OO reacts with alkanols to re-form O via steps favored over OO migrations, otherwise required to oxidize non-vicinal vacancies. C3H6 epoxidizes by reaction with OO with rates that increase with C3H6 pressure, but reach constant values as all OO spe- cies react with C3H6 at high C3H6/alkanol ratios. Asymptotic epoxidation/ODH rate ratios are smaller than unity, because outer-sphere routes that shuttle O-atoms via H2O2(g) are favored over endoergic vacancy formation required for inner-sphere routes. The relative contributions of these two routes are influenced by H2O, because vacancies, required to form OO, react with H2O to form OH pairs and H2O2. OO- mediated routes and epoxidation become favored at low coverages of reduced centers, prevalent for less reactive alkanols and lower alkanol/O2 ratios, because H2O2 then reacts preferentially with O (forming OO), instead of vacancies (forming O/H2O). Such kinetic shunts between two routes compensate for lower barriers required to form H2O2 than OO. These re-oxidation routes prefer molecular donor (H2O2) or acceptor (alkanol) to perform stepwise two-electron oxidations by dioxygen, instead of kinet- ically demanding O-atom migrations. The quantitative descriptions, derived from theory and experiment on Mo-based polyoxometalate clusters with known structures, bring together the dioxygen chemistry in liquid-phase oxidations, including electro-catalysis and monooxygenase enzymes, and oxide surfaces into a common framework, while suggesting a practical process for epoxidation by kinetically coupling with ODH reaction. 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Answer: The document discusses the kinetic mechanisms involved in the Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles, particularly focusing on the activation of dioxygen (O2) and its role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanols and the subsequent epoxidation of alkenes. The O2 activation can occur via two main pathways: inner-sphere and outer-sphere routes. The inner-sphere route involves the formation of bound peroxo (OO*) species, whereas the outer-sphere route leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The latter pathway is favored due to its lower activation barriers and the ability to shuttle oxygen atoms efficiently through the gas phase. The document further explains that the relative contributions of these pathways are influenced by factors such as the presence of water, the type and reactivity of the alkanol, and the pressure of the reactants. The document suggests that by coupling the ODH and epoxidation reactions, a practical process for epoxidation can be achieved without the need for expensive oxidants like H2O2 molecules.

文档讨论了Mars-van Krevelen还原周期中二氧碳（O2）激活及其在烷醇氧化脱氢（ODH）和随后烯烃氧化反应中的作用的动态机制。O2激活可以通过两种主要途径进行：内层球面路径和外层球面路径。内层球面路径涉及形成绑定过氧（OO*）物种，而外层球面路径导致形成过氧化氢（H2O2）。后者由于其较低的活化壁垒和能够通过气相高效转移氧原子的能力而被优先考虑。文档进一步解释说，这些途径的相对贡献受到因素的影响，例如水的存在、烷醇的类型和反应性以及反应物的压力。文档建议通过将ODH和氧化反应耦合起来，可以实现一种实用的氧化反应过程，无需昂贵的氧化剂如H2O2分子。

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene encompass dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These processes differ in the reagents used, with dehydrogenation with halogens employing halogen compounds to break carbon-hydrogen bonds. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen to facilitate the reaction, while oxyhalogenation combines halogen and oxygen to enhance the dehydrogenation. Molten metal halide salt approaches utilize a molten salt mixture containing metal halides as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation process. Each method has distinct reaction conditions tailored to the specific reagent, catalyst, and process parameters.

1. The re-oxidation pathways involved in Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles catalyzed by metal oxides are too rapid to be directly observed through the kinetic behavior of steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysis. Their dynamics can be indirectly inferred by analyzing the transient formation and consumption of reduced centers, which are monitored through in-situ UV visible spectroscopy during changes in reductant to oxidant ratios in the reactant streams.

2. The ratio of epoxidation rates to ODH rates (rEpox/rODH) is shown as a function of C3H6 pressure in Figure 4. This ratio indicates the extent to which epoxidation events occur relative to ODH events, providing insights into the mechanisms of re-oxidation pathways.

3. The conclusions regarding the role of reduced centers in the re-oxidation pathways are also reflected in the ratio of epoxidation rates to ODH rates (rEpox/rODH). This ratio remains much smaller than unity, even at high C3H6/CH3OH ratios, suggesting that epoxidation events are less prevalent than ODH events.

4. The epoxidation rates increase with C3H6 pressure and only reach constant values for C3H8/CH3OH ratios significantly greater than unity, as depicted in Figure 3a. This observation is consistent with the predominance of re-oxidation pathways that exclude the formation of electrophilic bound peroxo (OO*) species.

1. 这些再氧化途径在金属氧化物催化的Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化循环中的快速特性使得从稳态氧化脱氢（ODH）催化动力学行为直接观察它们的动力学变得不可行。它们的动力学可以通过分析反应流中还原剂与氧化剂比变化时形成的和消耗的还原中心的瞬态形成和消耗，间接通过原位紫外可见光谱进行推测。

2. 图4显示了C3H6压力下环氧化速率与ODH速率之比（rEpox/rODH）的变化。这个比率表明了环氧化事件相对于ODH事件的频率，提供了了解再氧化途径机制的见解。

3. 关于还原中心在再氧化途径中作用的结论也体现在环氧化速率与ODH速率之比（rEpox/rODH）。这个比率保持在远小于一，即使在高C3H6/CH3OH比的情况下也是如此，这表明环氧化事件不如ODH事件常见。

4. 环氧化速率随C3H6压力增加，并且只有在C3H8/CH3OH比显著大于一的情况下才达到恒定值，如图3a所示。这一观察结果与避免形成亲电性结合过氧化（OO*）物种的主要再氧化途径的主导地位是一致的。
