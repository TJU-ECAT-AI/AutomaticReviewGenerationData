[1] "The fast nature of these re-oxidation pathways renders their dynamics inaccessible to direct experimental inquiry from the kinetic behavior of steady-state ODH catalysis [3]."
[2] "Re-oxidation rate constants can be indirectly probed through their in-situ UV visible spectra during the transient formation and consumption of reduced centers in response to changes in reductant to oxidant ratios in the reactant streams [19]."
[3] "Such conclusions are also evident from the ratio of the rates of epoxidation and ODH (rEpox/rODH), shown as a function of C3H6 pressure (035 kPa; 453 K) in Fig. 4."
[4] "These conclusions are consistent with epoxidation rates that increase with increasing C3H6 pressure and reach con- stant values only for C3H8/CH3OH ratios much larger than unity (Fig. 3a)."

1. The re-oxidation pathways involved in Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles catalyzed by metal oxides are too rapid to be directly observed through the kinetic behavior of steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysis. Their dynamics can be indirectly inferred by analyzing the transient formation and consumption of reduced centers, which are monitored through in-situ UV visible spectroscopy during changes in reductant to oxidant ratios in the reactant streams.

2. The ratio of epoxidation rates to ODH rates (rEpox/rODH) is shown as a function of C3H6 pressure in Figure 4. This ratio indicates the extent to which epoxidation events occur relative to ODH events, providing insights into the mechanisms of re-oxidation pathways.

3. The conclusions regarding the role of reduced centers in the re-oxidation pathways are also reflected in the ratio of epoxidation rates to ODH rates (rEpox/rODH). This ratio remains much smaller than unity, even at high C3H6/CH3OH ratios, suggesting that epoxidation events are less prevalent than ODH events.

4. The epoxidation rates increase with C3H6 pressure and only reach constant values for C3H8/CH3OH ratios significantly greater than unity, as depicted in Figure 3a. This observation is consistent with the predominance of re-oxidation pathways that exclude the formation of electrophilic bound peroxo (OO*) species.

1. 这些再氧化途径在金属氧化物催化的Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化循环中的快速特性使得从稳态氧化脱氢（ODH）催化动力学行为直接观察它们的动力学变得不可行。它们的动力学可以通过分析反应流中还原剂与氧化剂比变化时形成的和消耗的还原中心的瞬态形成和消耗，间接通过原位紫外可见光谱进行推测。

2. 图4显示了C3H6压力下环氧化速率与ODH速率之比（rEpox/rODH）的变化。这个比率表明了环氧化事件相对于ODH事件的频率，提供了了解再氧化途径机制的见解。

3. 关于还原中心在再氧化途径中作用的结论也体现在环氧化速率与ODH速率之比（rEpox/rODH）。这个比率保持在远小于一，即使在高C3H6/CH3OH比的情况下也是如此，这表明环氧化事件不如ODH事件常见。

4. 环氧化速率随C3H6压力增加，并且只有在C3H8/CH3OH比显著大于一的情况下才达到恒定值，如图3a所示。这一观察结果与避免形成亲电性结合过氧化（OO*）物种的主要再氧化途径的主导地位是一致的。
