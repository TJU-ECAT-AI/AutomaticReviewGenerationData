1. DFT-derived free energies are utilized to estimate kinetic constants for elementary steps via the transition state theory formalism. The relationship between the difference in free energies between the transition state (TS) and its precursor, denoted by DG, is expressed as k = kBT h exp(DG/RT). Here, kB represents Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant, and R is the gas constant. Equilibrated step thermodynamic constants are linked to their standard free energy changes for the reaction (DG), which can be expressed as K = exp(-DG/RT).

1. 原子层计算得出的自由能用于估计过渡态理论中的基本步骤的动能常数。过渡态（TS）与其前体之间的自由能差，表示为DG，可以表示为k = kBT h exp(DG/RT)。kB是玻尔兹曼常数，h是普朗克常数，R是气体常数。平衡步骤的热力学常数与反应的标准自由能变化相关联，可以表示为K = exp(-DG/RT)。

The relative contributions from inner and outer sphere O2 activation routes (steps 4a and 4b; Scheme 3) do not depend on the total number of reduced centers present during steady-state ODH catalysis because both routes require one reduced center (* or H/OH*) for O2 activation (Eq. (11)).

3. The contributions from inner and outer sphere oxygen activation routes (steps 4a and 4b; Scheme 3) do not rely on the total amount of reduced centers during steady-state ODH catalysis. Both routes necessitate one reduced center (* or H/OH*) for oxygen activation (Eq. (11)).

H2O2 consumption via reactions with reduced or oxidized centers (steps 6a and 6b; Scheme 3) influences rEpox/rODH ratios because reactions with reduced centers avoid the formation of OO* and thus epoxidation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. The consumption of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through reactions with reduced or oxidized centers (steps 6a and 6b; Scheme 3) impacts the ratio of epoxidation to ODH rates (rEpox/rODH). This is because reactions with reduced centers prevent the creation of OO* intermediates, thereby avoiding epoxidation.
