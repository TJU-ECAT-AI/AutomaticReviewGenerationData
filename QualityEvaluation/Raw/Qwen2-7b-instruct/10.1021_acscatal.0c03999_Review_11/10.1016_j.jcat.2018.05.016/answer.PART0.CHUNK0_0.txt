Dioxygen activation routes in Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles catalyzed by metal oxides Stephanie Kwon a, Prashant Deshlahra b, Enrique Iglesia a,a Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States b Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, United States a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 23 February 2018 Revised 23 April 2018 Accepted 17 May 2018 Keywords: Oxidative dehydrogenation Redox cycle Oxidation catalysis Dioxygen activation Density functional theory Polyoxometalate Epoxidation a b s t r a c t Catalytic redox cycles involve dioxygen activation via peroxo (OO) or H2O2 species, denoted as inner- sphere and outer-sphere routes respectively, for metal-oxo catalysts solvated by liquids. On solid oxides, O2 activation is typically more facile than the reduction part of redox cycles, making kinetic inquiries dif- ficult at steady-state. These steps are examined here for oxidative alkanol dehydrogenation (ODH) by scavenging OO species with C3H6 to form epoxides and by energies and barriers from density functional theory. Alkanols react with O-atoms (O) in oxides to form vicinal OH pairs that eliminate H2O to form OO at O-vacancies formed or react with O2 to give H2O2. OO reacts with alkanols to re-form O via steps favored over OO migrations, otherwise required to oxidize non-vicinal vacancies. C3H6 epoxidizes by reaction with OO with rates that increase with C3H6 pressure, but reach constant values as all OO spe- cies react with C3H6 at high C3H6/alkanol ratios. Asymptotic epoxidation/ODH rate ratios are smaller than unity, because outer-sphere routes that shuttle O-atoms via H2O2(g) are favored over endoergic vacancy formation required for inner-sphere routes. The relative contributions of these two routes are influenced by H2O, because vacancies, required to form OO, react with H2O to form OH pairs and H2O2. OO- mediated routes and epoxidation become favored at low coverages of reduced centers, prevalent for less reactive alkanols and lower alkanol/O2 ratios, because H2O2 then reacts preferentially with O (forming OO), instead of vacancies (forming O/H2O). Such kinetic shunts between two routes compensate for lower barriers required to form H2O2 than OO. These re-oxidation routes prefer molecular donor (H2O2) or acceptor (alkanol) to perform stepwise two-electron oxidations by dioxygen, instead of kinet- ically demanding O-atom migrations. The quantitative descriptions, derived from theory and experiment on Mo-based polyoxometalate clusters with known structures, bring together the dioxygen chemistry in liquid-phase oxidations, including electro-catalysis and monooxygenase enzymes, and oxide surfaces into a common framework, while suggesting a practical process for epoxidation by kinetically coupling with ODH reaction. 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Answer: The document discusses the kinetic mechanisms involved in the Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles, particularly focusing on the activation of dioxygen (O2) and its role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanols and the subsequent epoxidation of alkenes. The O2 activation can occur via two main pathways: inner-sphere and outer-sphere routes. The inner-sphere route involves the formation of bound peroxo (OO*) species, whereas the outer-sphere route leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The latter pathway is favored due to its lower activation barriers and the ability to shuttle oxygen atoms efficiently through the gas phase. The document further explains that the relative contributions of these pathways are influenced by factors such as the presence of water, the type and reactivity of the alkanol, and the pressure of the reactants. The document suggests that by coupling the ODH and epoxidation reactions, a practical process for epoxidation can be achieved without the need for expensive oxidants like H2O2 molecules.

文档讨论了Mars-van Krevelen还原周期中二氧碳（O2）激活及其在烷醇氧化脱氢（ODH）和随后烯烃氧化反应中的作用的动态机制。O2激活可以通过两种主要途径进行：内层球面路径和外层球面路径。内层球面路径涉及形成绑定过氧（OO*）物种，而外层球面路径导致形成过氧化氢（H2O2）。后者由于其较低的活化壁垒和能够通过气相高效转移氧原子的能力而被优先考虑。文档进一步解释说，这些途径的相对贡献受到因素的影响，例如水的存在、烷醇的类型和反应性以及反应物的压力。文档建议通过将ODH和氧化反应耦合起来，可以实现一种实用的氧化反应过程，无需昂贵的氧化剂如H2O2分子。
