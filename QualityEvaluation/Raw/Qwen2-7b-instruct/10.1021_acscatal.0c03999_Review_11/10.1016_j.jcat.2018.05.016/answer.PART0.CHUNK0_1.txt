Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene encompass dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These processes differ in the reagents used, with dehydrogenation with halogens employing halogen compounds to break carbon-hydrogen bonds. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen to facilitate the reaction, while oxyhalogenation combines halogen and oxygen to enhance the dehydrogenation. Molten metal halide salt approaches utilize a molten salt mixture containing metal halides as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation process. Each method has distinct reaction conditions tailored to the specific reagent, catalyst, and process parameters.
