The study discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of HCl, utilizing CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals as catalysts. This process contrasts with the reactivity of propane compared to other alkanes, particularly methane and ethane, due to its specific molecular structure and interaction with the catalyst.
