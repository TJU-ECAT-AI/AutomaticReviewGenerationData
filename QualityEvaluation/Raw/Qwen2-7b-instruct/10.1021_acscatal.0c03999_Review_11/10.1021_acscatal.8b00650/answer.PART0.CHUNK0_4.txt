1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process converts propane to propylene using HCl catalyzed by CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals. This method employs molecular oxygen as an oxidant, offering better selectivity than conventional dehydrogenation (DH) processes. ODH typically requires higher temperatures and pressures compared to DH. Propane's reactivity varies from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its size and boiling point.
2. Halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation to propene encompass dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches.

1. 氧化脱氢化（ODH）过程利用CeO2和NiO改性CeO2纳米晶催化剂催化丙烷转化为丙烯，使用HCl。与传统脱氢化（DH）过程相比，此方法采用分子氧作为氧化剂，提供了更好的选择性。ODH通常需要比DH更高的温度和压力。由于其大小和沸点，丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性存在显著差异。
2. 丙烷脱氢为丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐法。
