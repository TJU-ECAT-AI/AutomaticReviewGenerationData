[1] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[2] "Propane reacts readily with halogens, producing propyl halides. A subsequent elimination process produces propylene and hydrogen halides."
[3] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."
[4] "Propane conversion with bromine alone increases with reaction temperature and finally reaches a constant value of approximately 66%."
[5] "Interestingly, and in contrast, in the presence of I2, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity increase with reaction temperature."
[6] "The results are particularly promising for developing a low-temperature on-purpose, high-yield propylene technology."
[7] "Compared to the less-selective bromine process and the high-temperature, expensive iodine process, a dual halogen process involving both bromine and iodine displays the advantages of both halogens."

The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method has distinct reaction conditions:

1. **Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation**: This process involves the direct reaction of propane with halogens like bromine or iodine. The reaction conditions are typically high temperatures, as halogens require more energy to abstract hydrogen from propane molecules. Bromine is less selective towards propene, while iodine is more selective but requires higher temperatures.

2. **Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)**: This method uses oxidants such as air or oxygen to drive the dehydration of propane to propene. However, the process is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products, leading to a maximum reported yield of about 30%.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This approach combines halogenation and dehydration reactions. The halogen helps in the initial formation of propyl halides, followed by the elimination to produce propene. Halogens like bromine are used due to their reactivity with propane.

4. **Molten metal halide salt approaches**: These methods involve the use of molten salts containing halides (such as LiBr or KBr) to catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. These salts can operate at lower temperatures than pure halogen processes but still require elevated temperatures to achieve efficient propene production.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its larger molecular size and more complex interactions with halogens. Methane and ethane tend to react more readily with halogens but are less selective for propene production. Ethane, in particular, is more easily transported and used in steam crackers for ethylene production, making it less suitable for direct propene production via halogenation.

The dual halogen process using bromine and iodine in combination offers several advantages. It provides a high single-pass yield of up to 80% propene, surpassing the limitations of using bromine or iodine alone. This process operates at moderate temperatures, making it more industrially viable and potentially cheaper than traditional methods. Moreover, the underlying chemistry could extend to the synthesis of other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons, offering a versatile platform for petrochemical production.

这些卤素辅助方法包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法，每种方法都有不同的反应条件：

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：这一过程涉及丙烷与卤素（如溴或碘）的直接反应。反应条件通常是高温，因为卤素需要更多的能量来从丙烷分子中提取氢。溴在选择性向丙烯方面不如碘，而碘的选择性更高，但需要更高的温度。

2. **氧化脱氢（ODH）**：这种方法使用氧气或空气作为氧化剂驱动丙烷脱水形成丙烯。然而，由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧产物，导致丙烯的最大报道产率为约30%。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法结合了卤化和脱氢反应。卤素帮助初始形成丙基卤化物，随后通过消除产生丙烯。像溴这样的卤素被用于与丙烷反应。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法涉及使用包含卤化物的熔融盐（如LiBr或KBr）作为催化剂催化丙烷脱氢。这些盐可以在较低温度下操作，但仍需要较高温度以实现高效的丙烯生产。

丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷相比表现出显著的不同反应性。甲烷和乙烷更容易与卤素反应，但对于丙烯生产的选择性较低。特别是乙烷因其易于运输而在蒸汽裂解中用作乙烯生产，这使其不太适合通过卤化直接生产丙烯。

双卤素过程使用溴和碘的组合提供多种优势。它提供了高达80%的单次产率丙烯，超过了单独使用溴或碘的方法的局限。这个过程在适中的温度下运行，使它在工业上更可行且可能更便宜于传统方法。此外，该底层化学原理可以扩展到合成其他商业上可欲的不饱和碳氢化合物，为石油化学生产提供灵活的平台。
