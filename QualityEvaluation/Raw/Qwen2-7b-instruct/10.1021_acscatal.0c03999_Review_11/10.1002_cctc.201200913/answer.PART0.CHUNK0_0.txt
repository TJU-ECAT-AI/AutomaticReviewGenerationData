[1] "The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%."
[2] "Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."
[3] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br."
[4] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."
[5] "The underlying chemistry might be extended to the synthesis of many other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons."

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, comparing them with oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The key points are:

1. **Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation**: This method uses halogens like bromine and iodine. Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective for propane over other alkanes. Iodine is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is expensive.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This process converts propane to propene by oxidizing it, but it suffers from the issue of consecutive oxidation to oxygenated products, limiting the yield to about 30%.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This involves the use of halogen compounds in the dehydrogenation process, aiming to enhance selectivity and yield compared to pure halogen methods.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods use salts of molten metals and halides for dehydrogenation, offering a potentially cleaner and more efficient process.

5. **Propane's Reactivity**: Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its ability to form stable halogenated derivatives, which can be more easily converted to propene compared to methane or ethane.

6. **Bromine-Iodine Mixtures**: The study highlights the effectiveness of using a mixture of bromine and iodine, where a low concentration of iodine (up to 20%) can achieve a high single-pass yield of up to 80% at moderate temperatures, overcoming the limitations of pure halogen methods.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，与氧化脱氢化、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法进行了比较。关键点如下：

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：此方法使用卤素如溴和碘。溴是一种更活泼的氧化剂，但对丙烷的选择性较低，相对于其他烷烃。碘具有高度选择性，但需要很高的反应温度，并且成本昂贵。

2. **氧化脱氢化**：此过程通过氧化将丙烷转化为丙烯，但由于连续氧化到氧化产物的问题，导致最高产率约为30%。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法涉及在脱氢过程中使用卤化物，旨在与纯卤素方法相比提高选择性和产率。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法使用熔融金属和卤化物的盐进行脱氢，可能提供更清洁和更高效的工艺。

5. **丙烷的反应性**：丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃的反应性存在显著差异，因为它能够形成稳定的卤代衍生物，这比甲烷或乙烷更容易转化为丙烯。

6. **溴-碘混合物**：研究强调了使用溴和碘的混合物的有效性，其中碘的低浓度（不超过20%）可以在中等温度下实现高达80%的单次产率，克服了单一卤素方法的局限性。
