[1] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[2] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."
[3] "Compared to the less-selective bromine process and the high-temperature, expensive iodine process, a dual halogen process involving both bromine and iodine displays the advantages of both halogens."

The document describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The traditional oxidative dehydrogenation process is limited to about 30% propene yield due to the consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products. In contrast, the dual halogen process using a mixture of bromine and iodine at low iodine content (up to 20%) achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate reaction temperatures below 800K. This method combines the advantages of both bromine and iodine, offering a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology that is more economically viable than using either halogen alone. The underlying chemistry of this process might also extend to the synthesis of other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons.

文档描述了多种卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯。传统的氧化脱氢过程仅能实现约30%的丙烯产率，主要由于丙烯连续氧化为氧代产物。相比之下，使用溴和碘的混合物作为氧化剂（碘含量不超过20%），在较低的反应温度（低于800K）下，可以达到高达80%的一次通过产率C3H6+C3H7X。这种方法结合了溴和碘的优点，提供了一种低温、高产率的丙烯生产技术，比单独使用任一卤素更为经济可行。该过程的基本化学原理可能还可以扩展到合成其他商业上重要的不饱和烃。
