[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation is a promising way to produce olefins, diolefins and aromatics."
[2] "The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%."
[3] "Halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations."
[4] "Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I."
[5] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br."
[6] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. These include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method uses halogens as oxidants in the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation involves the reaction of propane with halogens like bromine and iodine to produce propene and hydrogen halides. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes additional oxygen or air to drive the reaction, while oxyhalogenation combines halogenation with dehydrogenation. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of salts containing metal halides for the dehydrogenation process. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its specific chemical structure and interaction with halogens. Methane and ethane do not react as readily with halogens or undergo dehydrogenation as efficiently as propane does.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法。这些包括卤素辅助脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化物辅助脱氢和熔融金属卤化盐方法。每种方法都使用卤素作为脱氢过程中的氧化剂。卤素辅助脱氢涉及丙烷与溴、碘等卤素反应生成丙烯和卤化氢的过程。氧化脱氢利用额外的氧气或空气驱动反应，而氧卤化物辅助脱氢结合了卤化和脱氢。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含金属卤化物的盐进行脱氢过程。丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷大不相同，这是由于其特定的化学结构及其与卤素的相互作用。甲烷和乙烷不如丙烷容易与卤素反应或经历脱氢。
