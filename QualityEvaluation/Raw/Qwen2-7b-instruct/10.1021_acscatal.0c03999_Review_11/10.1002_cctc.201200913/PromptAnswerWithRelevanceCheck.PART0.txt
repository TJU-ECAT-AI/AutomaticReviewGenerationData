The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, comparing them with oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The key points are:

1. **Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation**: This method uses halogens like bromine and iodine. Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective for propane over other alkanes. Iodine is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is expensive.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This process converts propane to propene by oxidizing it, but it suffers from the issue of consecutive oxidation to oxygenated products, limiting the yield to about 30%.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This involves the use of halogen compounds in the dehydrogenation process, aiming to enhance selectivity and yield compared to pure halogen methods.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods use salts of molten metals and halides for dehydrogenation, offering a potentially cleaner and more efficient process.

5. **Propane's Reactivity**: Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its ability to form stable halogenated derivatives, which can be more easily converted to propene compared to methane or ethane.

6. **Bromine-Iodine Mixtures**: The study highlights the effectiveness of using a mixture of bromine and iodine, where a low concentration of iodine (up to 20%) can achieve a high single-pass yield of up to 80% at moderate temperatures, overcoming the limitations of pure halogen methods.

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：此方法使用卤素如溴和碘。溴是一种更活泼的氧化剂，但对丙烷的选择性较低，相对于其他烷烃。碘具有高度选择性，但需要很高的反应温度，并且成本昂贵。

2. **氧化脱氢化**：此过程通过氧化将丙烷转化为丙烯，但由于连续氧化到氧化产物的问题，导致最高产率约为30%。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法涉及在脱氢过程中使用卤化物，旨在与纯卤素方法相比提高选择性和产率。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法使用熔融金属和卤化物的盐进行脱氢，可能提供更清洁和更高效的工艺。

5. **丙烷的反应性**：丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃的反应性存在显著差异，因为它能够形成稳定的卤代衍生物，这比甲烷或乙烷更容易转化为丙烯。

6. **溴-碘混合物**：研究强调了使用溴和碘的混合物的有效性，其中碘的低浓度（不超过20%）可以在中等温度下实现高达80%的单次产率，克服了单一卤素方法的局限性。

[1] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[2] "Propane reacts readily with halogens, producing propyl halides. A subsequent elimination process produces propylene and hydrogen halides."
[3] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."
[4] "Propane conversion with bromine alone increases with reaction temperature and finally reaches a constant value of approximately 66%."
[5] "Interestingly, and in contrast, in the presence of I2, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity increase with reaction temperature."
[6] "The results are particularly promising for developing a low-temperature on-purpose, high-yield propylene technology."
[7] "Compared to the less-selective bromine process and the high-temperature, expensive iodine process, a dual halogen process involving both bromine and iodine displays the advantages of both halogens."

The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method has distinct reaction conditions:

1. **Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation**: This process involves the direct reaction of propane with halogens like bromine or iodine. The reaction conditions are typically high temperatures, as halogens require more energy to abstract hydrogen from propane molecules. Bromine is less selective towards propene, while iodine is more selective but requires higher temperatures.

2. **Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)**: This method uses oxidants such as air or oxygen to drive the dehydration of propane to propene. However, the process is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products, leading to a maximum reported yield of about 30%.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This approach combines halogenation and dehydration reactions. The halogen helps in the initial formation of propyl halides, followed by the elimination to produce propene. Halogens like bromine are used due to their reactivity with propane.

4. **Molten metal halide salt approaches**: These methods involve the use of molten salts containing halides (such as LiBr or KBr) to catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. These salts can operate at lower temperatures than pure halogen processes but still require elevated temperatures to achieve efficient propene production.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to its larger molecular size and more complex interactions with halogens. Methane and ethane tend to react more readily with halogens but are less selective for propene production. Ethane, in particular, is more easily transported and used in steam crackers for ethylene production, making it less suitable for direct propene production via halogenation.

The dual halogen process using bromine and iodine in combination offers several advantages. It provides a high single-pass yield of up to 80% propene, surpassing the limitations of using bromine or iodine alone. This process operates at moderate temperatures, making it more industrially viable and potentially cheaper than traditional methods. Moreover, the underlying chemistry could extend to the synthesis of other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons, offering a versatile platform for petrochemical production.

这些卤素辅助方法包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法，每种方法都有不同的反应条件：

1. **卤素辅助脱氢**：这一过程涉及丙烷与卤素（如溴或碘）的直接反应。反应条件通常是高温，因为卤素需要更多的能量来从丙烷分子中提取氢。溴在选择性向丙烯方面不如碘，而碘的选择性更高，但需要更高的温度。

2. **氧化脱氢（ODH）**：这种方法使用氧气或空气作为氧化剂驱动丙烷脱水形成丙烯。然而，由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧产物，导致丙烯的最大报道产率为约30%。

3. **氧卤化**：这种方法结合了卤化和脱氢反应。卤素帮助初始形成丙基卤化物，随后通过消除产生丙烯。像溴这样的卤素被用于与丙烷反应。

4. **熔融金属卤化盐方法**：这些方法涉及使用包含卤化物的熔融盐（如LiBr或KBr）作为催化剂催化丙烷脱氢。这些盐可以在较低温度下操作，但仍需要较高温度以实现高效的丙烯生产。

丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷相比表现出显著的不同反应性。甲烷和乙烷更容易与卤素反应，但对于丙烯生产的选择性较低。特别是乙烷因其易于运输而在蒸汽裂解中用作乙烯生产，这使其不太适合通过卤化直接生产丙烯。

双卤素过程使用溴和碘的组合提供多种优势。它提供了高达80%的单次产率丙烯，超过了单独使用溴或碘的方法的局限。这个过程在适中的温度下运行，使它在工业上更可行且可能更便宜于传统方法。此外，该底层化学原理可以扩展到合成其他商业上可欲的不饱和碳氢化合物，为石油化学生产提供灵活的平台。

These include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method uses halogens as oxidants in the dehydrogenation process. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation involves the reaction of propane with halogens like bromine and iodine to produce propene and hydrogen halides. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes additional oxygen or air to drive the reaction, while oxyhalogenation combines halogenation with dehydrogenation. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of salts containing metal halides for the dehydrogenation process. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its specific chemical structure and interaction with halogens. Methane and ethane do not react as readily with halogens or undergo dehydrogenation as efficiently as propane does.

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its specific chemical properties and the ability of halogens to selectively interact with it. 

Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of bromine and iodine to convert propane into propene. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen or other oxidants to convert propane into propene, but this method suffers from the limitation of consecutive oxidation leading to lower yields. Oxyhalogenation involves the use of halogenated compounds, while molten metal halide salts offer a different approach to dehydrogenation. The document highlights that the use of bromine alone has limitations, primarily due to the formation of polybrominated products and the difficulty in separating propene from other byproducts. 

The presence of iodine in the bromine-based process improves the selectivity and yield, reaching up to 80% single-pass yield at moderate temperatures. This dual halogen process combines the benefits of both bromine and iodine, offering a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology. The underlying chemistry can potentially be extended to the synthesis of other unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.

In summary, propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes differs from other alkanes due to its specific interactions with halogens, leading to the formation of propene. The addition of iodine to the bromine process enhances the selectivity and yield, making it a promising method for propene production at lower temperatures.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐途径。丙烷在这些过程中与其它烷烃的反应活性存在显著差异，这是由于其特定的化学性质以及卤素对其的特定相互作用。

使用卤素进行脱氢涉及利用溴和碘将丙烷转化为丙烯。氧化脱氢利用氧气或其他氧化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，但这种方法的主要限制在于连续氧化导致较低的产率。氧卤化涉及到卤化物的使用，而熔融金属卤化盐提供了一种不同的脱氢方法。文档强调，仅使用溴可能有局限性，主要是由于形成多溴化产物以及从其他副产品中分离丙烯的困难。

向溴基过程添加碘可以改善选择性和产率，达到80%的一次通过产率，在较低温度下。这种双卤素过程结合了溴和碘的优点，提供了低温、高产率的丙烯技术。潜在地，这种基础化学原理可以扩展到合成其他不饱和烃，包括烯烃、二烯烃和芳香烃。

简而言之，由于丙烷与卤素之间的特定相互作用，导致生成丙烯，因此丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢化过程中与其他烷烃的反应活性存在差异。向溴基过程添加碘可以增强选择性和产率，使其成为在较低温度下制备丙烯的有前景的方法。
