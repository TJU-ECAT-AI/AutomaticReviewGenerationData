<p>Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price.</p>
<p>However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.</p>
<p>The chemistry described in this work is a new pathway that increases the previous best yield of 30% for propane conversion to propylene to 80%.</p>
<p>A small amount of I2 (I2/Br2 ratio no greater than 2:8) results in up to 80% single-pass C3H6+C3H7X yield at 798K.</p>

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its specific chemical properties and the ability of halogens to selectively interact with it. 

Dehydrogenation with halogens involves the use of bromine and iodine to convert propane into propene. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes oxygen or other oxidants to convert propane into propene, but this method suffers from the limitation of consecutive oxidation leading to lower yields. Oxyhalogenation involves the use of halogenated compounds, while molten metal halide salts offer a different approach to dehydrogenation. The document highlights that the use of bromine alone has limitations, primarily due to the formation of polybrominated products and the difficulty in separating propene from other byproducts. 

The presence of iodine in the bromine-based process improves the selectivity and yield, reaching up to 80% single-pass yield at moderate temperatures. This dual halogen process combines the benefits of both bromine and iodine, offering a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology. The underlying chemistry can potentially be extended to the synthesis of other unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.

In summary, propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes differs from other alkanes due to its specific interactions with halogens, leading to the formation of propene. The addition of iodine to the bromine process enhances the selectivity and yield, making it a promising method for propene production at lower temperatures.

文档讨论了用于选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐途径。丙烷在这些过程中与其它烷烃的反应活性存在显著差异，这是由于其特定的化学性质以及卤素对其的特定相互作用。

使用卤素进行脱氢涉及利用溴和碘将丙烷转化为丙烯。氧化脱氢利用氧气或其他氧化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，但这种方法的主要限制在于连续氧化导致较低的产率。氧卤化涉及到卤化物的使用，而熔融金属卤化盐提供了一种不同的脱氢方法。文档强调，仅使用溴可能有局限性，主要是由于形成多溴化产物以及从其他副产品中分离丙烯的困难。

向溴基过程添加碘可以改善选择性和产率，达到80%的一次通过产率，在较低温度下。这种双卤素过程结合了溴和碘的优点，提供了低温、高产率的丙烯技术。潜在地，这种基础化学原理可以扩展到合成其他不饱和烃，包括烯烃、二烯烃和芳香烃。

简而言之，由于丙烷与卤素之间的特定相互作用，导致生成丙烯，因此丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢化过程中与其他烷烃的反应活性存在差异。向溴基过程添加碘可以增强选择性和产率，使其成为在较低温度下制备丙烯的有前景的方法。
