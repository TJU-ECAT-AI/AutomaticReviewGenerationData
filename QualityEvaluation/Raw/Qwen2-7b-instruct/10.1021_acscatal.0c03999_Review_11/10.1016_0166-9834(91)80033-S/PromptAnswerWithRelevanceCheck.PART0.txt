1. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Dehydrogenation with halogens, particularly iodine, has been explored for its ability to selectively convert light alkanes. Oxidative dehydrogenation, facilitated by halogenated compounds, is often performed in the presence of oxygen. Molten metal halide salts, such as lithium hydroxide and lithium iodide, serve as catalysts for these reactions, allowing for higher yields at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation processes. The radical nature of these reactions is well-established, with the formation of radicals leading to various products depending on reaction conditions.

2. The reactivity of propane in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the ability of halogen compounds, especially iodine, to selectively oxidize propane molecules. The presence of oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation processes further enhances the reactivity of propane, allowing for the production of propene and other products like benzene. The use of molten metal halide salts facilitates these reactions by providing a stable environment for the interaction between halogen species and alkane molecules.

3. The process of propane dehydrogenation involves the transformation of propane molecules into propene and other products through radical-based reactions. In the presence of halogen compounds, such as iodine, and oxygen, the reaction conditions are optimized for propene production, with the possibility of further conversion of propene to benzene. The reactivity of propane is enhanced by the formation of radicals, which can lead to the formation of various products based on the reaction conditions and the presence of catalysts like molten metal halide salts.

1. 不同的卤素辅助方法，如卤素分解、氧化分解、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法，用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。尤其是碘，之前由Shell和Petro-Tex探索过卤素辅助的轻烷烃分解。氧化分解在氧气的存在下，通过卤化物促进，通常可以以较低温度获得更高的产量。熔融金属卤化盐，如锂氢氧化物和锂碘化物，作为催化剂，允许在直接分解过程温度更低的情况下进行这些反应。这些反应的自由基性质已经被广泛确认，根据反应条件的不同，形成的自由基导致形成不同的产物。

2. 丙烷在卤素辅助分解过程中与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应性差异显著，主要是由于卤素化合物，特别是碘，能够选择性地氧化丙烷分子的能力。在氧化分解过程中氧气的存在进一步增强了丙烷的反应性，允许生产丙烯和其他产品，如苯。熔融金属卤化盐的使用通过提供卤素物种与烷烃分子相互作用的稳定环境，促进了这些反应，从而优化了丙烯的生产，同时存在进一步将丙烯转化为苯的可能性。

3. 丙烷分解的过程涉及丙烷分子通过基于自由基的反应转化为丙烯和其他产物。在卤素化合物（如碘）和氧气的存在下，通过调整反应条件来优化丙烯的生产，从而可能进一步将丙烯转化为苯。丙烷的反应性通过形成自由基得到增强，这可能导致基于反应条件和催化剂（如熔融金属卤化盐）存在的不同产物的形成。

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly in terms of their reaction conditions. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves direct reactions between propane and halogen gases, typically requiring high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes halogen gases in the presence of oxygen, often facilitated by catalysts, allowing for higher yields at lower temperatures. Oxyhalogenation refers to the process of reacting propane with oxygen in the presence of halogen compounds, potentially leading to a variety of products depending on the halogen and reaction conditions. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing a halide salt as a solvent and reagent, offering a unique environment for alkane dehydrogenation. 

2. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger molecular size and more complex structure. Larger alkanes like methane and ethane generally require higher temperatures and/or stronger catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation reactions effectively. This is because larger molecules have more intermolecular interactions that hinder their reactivity. In contrast, propane's intermediate size allows it to be more readily converted to propene under certain conditions, such as those provided by halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation methods. 

3. The key differences in conditions for each method are as follows: 
   - Dehydrogenation with halogens requires high temperatures and direct gas-to-gas reactions. 
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen and typically operates at lower temperatures, with catalysts enhancing selectivity. 
   - Oxyhalogenation involves oxygen and halogen compounds, potentially offering a balance between yield and selectivity across a range of reaction conditions. 
   - Molten metal halide salt approaches offer a unique environment with a molten salt bath, which can be tailored for alkane dehydrogenation under various conditions.

1. 烷卤化、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法是丙烷选择性转化为丙烯的方法。这些方法在反应条件上有显著差异。卤素气体直接与丙烷反应的烷卤化通常需要高温。氧化脱氢在卤素气体存在下使用氧气，经常通过催化剂促进，允许在较低温度下获得更高的产率。氧卤化涉及在卤素化合物存在的条件下使用氧气进行反应，根据卤素和反应条件的不同，可能产生各种产品。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含卤化盐的熔融盐浴作为溶剂和试剂，为烷烃脱氢提供独特的环境。

2. 丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性有显著差异，主要是由于其较大的分子大小和更复杂的结构。较大分子如甲烷和乙烷通常需要更高的温度或更强的催化剂来有效地进行脱氢反应。这是因为大分子具有更多的分子间相互作用，阻碍了它们的反应性。相比之下，丙烷的中等大小使其能够在某些条件下更容易地转化为丙烯，例如通过卤素辅助氧化脱氢方法提供的条件。

3. 每种方法的关键差异条件如下：
   - 卤素气体直接与丙烷反应的烷卤化需要高温，并且是气相反应。
   - 氧化脱氢使用氧气并通常在较低温度下操作，催化剂提高了选择性。
   - 氧卤化涉及氧气和卤素化合物，可能在一系列反应条件下提供产量和选择性的平衡。
   - 熔融金属卤化盐方法提供了一种独特的环境，即熔融盐浴，可以根据不同的条件进行调整以进行烷烃脱氢。

1. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions for each method differ significantly. For instance, oxidative dehydrogenation typically offers higher yields at lower temperatures compared to other methods. Solid catalysts like vanadium/magnesia catalysts often yield around 20% conversion with 60% selectivity. Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen allows for feasible production of either propene or benzene.

2. The dehydrogenation process was conducted using a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt at 666°C with varying proportions of propane to air. As the air-to-propane ratio increased, the production of CO, benzene, and iodinated hydrocarbons also increased. 

3. Under certain conditions, only small amounts of iodinated products were detected, alongside the production of some benzene. 

4. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations suggest that lower temperatures lead to higher propene selectivities. In the studied system, benzene emerged as the final product due to the high concentrations of radicals encountered.

5. Comparisons to previous studies on butane at 823 K revealed that the reaction rates could be estimated based on similar reactions. For example, the reaction rate for butane was found to be approximately 19% conversion after 1 second, corresponding to an estimate of 1/5.2 conversion after the same time period.

1. 不同卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。每种方法的反应条件存在显著差异。例如，氧化脱氢通常在较低温度下提供更高的产率。固体催化剂如钒/镁催化剂的转化率通常约为20%，选择性为60%。通过优化碘/氢碘酸催化氧化脱氢过程中的氧气，可以实现丙烯或苯的生产。

2. 在666°C下，使用不同丙烷与空气比例的锂水合物/锂碘盐熔体进行了脱氢实验。随着空气与丙烷比例的增加，产生的二氧化碳、苯和碘化烃的量也相应增加。

3. 在某些条件下，仅检测到少量碘化产品，同时产生少量苯。

4. 热力学和动力学考虑表明，在较低温度下可以获得较高的丙烯选择性。在研究系统中，由于遇到的自由基浓度较高，苯成为最终产物。

5. 根据之前对丁烷在823K下的研究结果，可以估计反应速率。例如，丁烷的反应速率估算在1秒后约为19%转化率，对应于在相同时间内约1/5.2的转化率。

The document discusses various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. These include direct dehydrogenation using solid catalysts like vanadium/magnesia, which typically offer a 20% conversion with 60% selectivity. Another method involves oxidative dehydrogenation with halogens, particularly iodine, which was explored by Shell and Petro-Tex. Oxidative dehydrogenation allows for higher yields at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation. 

The document highlights that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane. Specifically, the reactivity of propane in halogen-assisted methods is influenced by factors such as the temperature, the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals, and the presence of catalysts like lithium hydroxide and lithium iodide. Low temperatures favor higher propene selectivities, while the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals affects propene reactivity. 

The document also mentions that optimizing the system for propene or benzene production is feasible. This is because the reactions involving propane, iodine, and oxygen can lead to the formation of propene or its further conversion to benzene via coupling reactions. These differences in reactivity and the ability to optimize the system for specific products highlight the unique characteristics of propane in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes compared to other alkanes.
