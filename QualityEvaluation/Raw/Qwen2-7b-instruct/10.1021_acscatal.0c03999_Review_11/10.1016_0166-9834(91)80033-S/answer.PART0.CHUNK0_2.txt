<p>The objective of this work has been the study of an alternative route for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane.</p>
<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation may give a higher yield at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>Typically, solid catalysts like vanadium/magnesia catalysts give ca. 20% conversion with 60% selectivity [1].</p>
<p>Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen for propene or benzene production is feasible.</p>
<p>Dehydrogenation was performed in 2.8 wt.-% LiOH.H,O/LiI at 666C with propane : air mixtures varying from 1: 1 to 1: 4.</p>
<p>We see that the main effect of increasing the air/propane ratio is to produce more CO,</p>
<p>As can be seen from the table some benzene is produced, but very low amounts of iodinated products are detected under these conditions.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations indicate that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities.</p>
<p>At the relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, benzene is the ultimate product.</p>

1. Various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The reaction conditions for each method differ significantly. For instance, oxidative dehydrogenation typically offers higher yields at lower temperatures compared to other methods. Solid catalysts like vanadium/magnesia catalysts often yield around 20% conversion with 60% selectivity. Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen allows for feasible production of either propene or benzene.

2. The dehydrogenation process was conducted using a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt at 666°C with varying proportions of propane to air. As the air-to-propane ratio increased, the production of CO, benzene, and iodinated hydrocarbons also increased. 

3. Under certain conditions, only small amounts of iodinated products were detected, alongside the production of some benzene. 

4. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations suggest that lower temperatures lead to higher propene selectivities. In the studied system, benzene emerged as the final product due to the high concentrations of radicals encountered.

5. Comparisons to previous studies on butane at 823 K revealed that the reaction rates could be estimated based on similar reactions. For example, the reaction rate for butane was found to be approximately 19% conversion after 1 second, corresponding to an estimate of 1/5.2 conversion after the same time period.

1. 不同卤素辅助方法用于选择性脱氢丙烷到丙烯包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。每种方法的反应条件存在显著差异。例如，氧化脱氢通常在较低温度下提供更高的产率。固体催化剂如钒/镁催化剂的转化率通常约为20%，选择性为60%。通过优化碘/氢碘酸催化氧化脱氢过程中的氧气，可以实现丙烯或苯的生产。

2. 在666°C下，使用不同丙烷与空气比例的锂水合物/锂碘盐熔体进行了脱氢实验。随着空气与丙烷比例的增加，产生的二氧化碳、苯和碘化烃的量也相应增加。

3. 在某些条件下，仅检测到少量碘化产品，同时产生少量苯。

4. 热力学和动力学考虑表明，在较低温度下可以获得较高的丙烯选择性。在研究系统中，由于遇到的自由基浓度较高，苯成为最终产物。

5. 根据之前对丁烷在823K下的研究结果，可以估计反应速率。例如，丁烷的反应速率估算在1秒后约为19%转化率，对应于在相同时间内约1/5.2的转化率。
