1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. These methods differ significantly in terms of their reaction conditions. Dehydrogenation with halogens involves direct reactions between propane and halogen gases, typically requiring high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes halogen gases in the presence of oxygen, often facilitated by catalysts, allowing for higher yields at lower temperatures. Oxyhalogenation refers to the process of reacting propane with oxygen in the presence of halogen compounds, potentially leading to a variety of products depending on the halogen and reaction conditions. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve the use of a molten salt bath containing a halide salt as a solvent and reagent, offering a unique environment for alkane dehydrogenation. 

2. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to its larger molecular size and more complex structure. Larger alkanes like methane and ethane generally require higher temperatures and/or stronger catalysts to undergo dehydrogenation reactions effectively. This is because larger molecules have more intermolecular interactions that hinder their reactivity. In contrast, propane's intermediate size allows it to be more readily converted to propene under certain conditions, such as those provided by halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation methods. 

3. The key differences in conditions for each method are as follows: 
   - Dehydrogenation with halogens requires high temperatures and direct gas-to-gas reactions. 
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen and typically operates at lower temperatures, with catalysts enhancing selectivity. 
   - Oxyhalogenation involves oxygen and halogen compounds, potentially offering a balance between yield and selectivity across a range of reaction conditions. 
   - Molten metal halide salt approaches offer a unique environment with a molten salt bath, which can be tailored for alkane dehydrogenation under various conditions.

1. 烷卤化、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法是丙烷选择性转化为丙烯的方法。这些方法在反应条件上有显著差异。卤素气体直接与丙烷反应的烷卤化通常需要高温。氧化脱氢在卤素气体存在下使用氧气，经常通过催化剂促进，允许在较低温度下获得更高的产率。氧卤化涉及在卤素化合物存在的条件下使用氧气进行反应，根据卤素和反应条件的不同，可能产生各种产品。熔融金属卤化盐方法涉及使用含卤化盐的熔融盐浴作为溶剂和试剂，为烷烃脱氢提供独特的环境。

2. 丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性有显著差异，主要是由于其较大的分子大小和更复杂的结构。较大分子如甲烷和乙烷通常需要更高的温度或更强的催化剂来有效地进行脱氢反应。这是因为大分子具有更多的分子间相互作用，阻碍了它们的反应性。相比之下，丙烷的中等大小使其能够在某些条件下更容易地转化为丙烯，例如通过卤素辅助氧化脱氢方法提供的条件。

3. 每种方法的关键差异条件如下：
   - 卤素气体直接与丙烷反应的烷卤化需要高温，并且是气相反应。
   - 氧化脱氢使用氧气并通常在较低温度下操作，催化剂提高了选择性。
   - 氧卤化涉及氧气和卤素化合物，可能在一系列反应条件下提供产量和选择性的平衡。
   - 熔融金属卤化盐方法提供了一种独特的环境，即熔融盐浴，可以根据不同的条件进行调整以进行烷烃脱氢。
