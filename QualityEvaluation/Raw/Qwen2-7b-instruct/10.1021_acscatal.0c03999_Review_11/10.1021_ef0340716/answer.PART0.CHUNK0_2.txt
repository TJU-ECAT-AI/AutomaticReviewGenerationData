<p>It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels.</p>
<p>The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest.</p>
<p>In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that enhanced capacities in the area of chemical catalysis could have a significant role in addressing the global atmospheric CO2 problem. Conversion and utilization of CO2 (as well as methane, CH4) are important subjects in the field of C1 chemistry.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, a great number of papers have been published on the direct conversion of CH4, particularly on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons (ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4)) by O2.</p>
<p>The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 35), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view.</p>
<p>CO2, as an oxidant, has several advantages over O2. First, CO will be the only byproduct in this case (see reactions 7 and 8 later in this work). Second, unlike O2, CO2 will not induce gas-phase radical reactions. In other words, the reactions of CH4 and CO2 to produce C2 hydrocarbons will mainly be controlled by heterogeneous catalysis.</p>
<p>Some investigations have been conducted in the past few years, and progress is being achieved in catalyst development. In the presence of CO2, these reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene.</p>
<p>CO2 has also been observed to be an effective oxidant in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4), the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons (methane (CH4), C2H6, and propane (C3H8)) to benzene (C6H6), and the ODH of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene.</p>
<p>For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property dominates the catalytic activity. In those reactions, CO2 can have different roles, depending on the catalyst systems and reactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO2 can produce active oxygen species;</li>
<li>CO2 reoxidizes the reduced oxides, forming the redox cycle;</li>
<li>CO2 oxidizes the carbon species, reducing coking.</li>
</ul>

The document discusses various methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene using halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method is distinct in terms of reaction conditions and the reason for propane's differing reactivity compared to other alkanes.

1. **Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation**: This method involves using halogens to facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane. The reaction conditions are likely to be specific to the halogen used, but generally, this approach aims to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from propane molecules to form propene. The reactivity of propane in this context differs from other alkanes due to the unique interaction between propane and halogens, which can lead to selective dehydrogenation.

2. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This refers to the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of oxygen or another oxidizing agent. The conditions for this process could include high temperatures and specific catalysts to ensure selective conversion to propene. The reactivity of propane in oxidative dehydrogenation is characterized by the ability to convert propane to propene without significant side reactions, making it more selective compared to other alkanes.

3. **Oxyhalogenation**: This term suggests a process that combines halogen and oxygen in a single step to dehydrogenate propane. The reaction conditions would involve a specific balance between halogen and oxygen to achieve the desired conversion. The reactivity of propane here would be influenced by the effectiveness of the combined oxidizing agents in selectively dehydrogenating the molecule.

4. **Molten Metal Halide Salt Approaches**: These methods employ molten salts containing metal halides as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conditions for this process might include high temperatures and specific compositions of the molten salts. The reactivity of propane in this context is characterized by its ability to undergo dehydrogenation in the molten environment, which can differ significantly from reactions in aqueous or gas phases due to the unique physical properties of the molten salts.

The document highlights that propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to factors such as the specific reaction conditions, the nature of the catalysts used, and the interactions between propane and the oxidizing agents or catalysts. Each method employs different reaction conditions and mechanisms, which contribute to the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The reactivity differences stem from the unique chemical properties of propane and the tailored conditions required for each method to achieve selective conversion.
