[1] "For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property dominates the catalytic activity."
[2] "The actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis is 75%55% in the temperature range of 680720 C."
[3] "The addition of sulfate changes the bulk and surface properties of Cr2O3/SiO2, promoting the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ and favoring the catalytic conversion."
[4] "The promotion of Mn to the Fe/silicalite-2 catalyst results from the great prohibition of coke formation on the Fe-Mn/silicalite-2 catalyst surfaces."
[5] "The addition of CO2 was observed to suppress the coke deposition during the aromatization of C3H8."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.
