[1] "In the past two decades, there has been a strong interest to study the ODH of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane), rather than the direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, because of the potential commercial interest to utilize alkanes effectively."
[2] "For the ODH of propane to propene, some typical reactions, including dehydrogenation, ODH, and reforming reactions, might proceed on catalysts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane's dehydrogenation to propene can occur through several pathways. It includes direct dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and reforming reactions. These processes often take place on various catalysts designed to facilitate the conversion efficiently.
