The document discusses a density functional theory study focusing on carbon dioxide activation and dissociation on ceria (110), particularly examining the role of oxygen vacancies in this process. The computational methods used involve density functional theory, which reveals that CO2 adsorption on both stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110) surfaces have different electronic structures. The study also finds that ceria functions effectively as a catalyst for CO2 activation, and CO2 dissociation on the reduced ceria (110) surface happens through specific pathways that involve oxygen vacancies.

本文件研究了碳氧化物在氧化铈(110)上的激活和分解，特别关注氧空位在此过程中的作用。所采用的计算方法基于密度泛函理论。研究结果表明，等量的和还原的氧化铈(110)表面的二氧化碳吸附表现出不同的电子结构。研究还发现，氧化铈作为CO2激活的有效催化剂，且在还原的氧化铈(110)表面上的二氧化碳分解通过涉及氧空位的特定途径发生。
