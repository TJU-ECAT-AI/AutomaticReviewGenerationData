Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The document discusses a density functional theory study focusing on carbon dioxide activation and dissociation on ceria (110), particularly examining the role of oxygen vacancies in this process. The computational methods used involve density functional theory, which reveals that CO2 adsorption on both stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110) surfaces have different electronic structures. The study also finds that ceria functions effectively as a catalyst for CO2 activation, and CO2 dissociation on the reduced ceria (110) surface happens through specific pathways that involve oxygen vacancies.
