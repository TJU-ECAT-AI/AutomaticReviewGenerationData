The study focused on the density functional theory analysis of carbon dioxide activation and dissociation on ceria (110). It explored several aspects including oxygen vacancy formation on the surface, CO2 adsorption under both stoichiometric and reduced conditions, electronic properties of ceria as a catalyst for CO2 activation, and the process of CO2 dissociation on a reduced ceria (110) surface.
