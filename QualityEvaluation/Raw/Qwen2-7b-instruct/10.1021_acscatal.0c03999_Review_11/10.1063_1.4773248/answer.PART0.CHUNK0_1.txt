This study utilized density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the process of carbon dioxide activation and dissociation on ceria (110). It also examined the oxygen vacancy formation on the ceria surface, analyzed the electronic properties of ceria as a catalyst for CO2 activation, and studied the CO2 dissociation on a reduced ceria (110) surface.
