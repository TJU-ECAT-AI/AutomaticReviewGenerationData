[1] "The lattice oxygen site was found to activate CH4 by heterolytic CH bond splitting to yield the CH3 and H+ fragments, which bind to the Lewis acid site (bridge Lab) and Brnsted base site (top Ot), respectively."
[2] "Although the CH3 fragment binds quite strongly to the surface in the presence of the H+ fragment, molecular O2 can facilitate its desorption especially at relatively low reaction temperatures leading to the formation of an O2• species."
[3] "The O2• species can further activate CH4 by direct hydrogen abstraction, producing the second CH3 radical."
[4] "Comparing the free energy barriers of CH3 radical formation at the O2 and O2• sites, we found the O2• site to be kinetically favorable for selective conversion of CH4 into the CH3 radical."
[5] "For CH4 activation at the O22 site,direct insertion of an O atom into the CH bond leads to the formation of CH3OH."
[6] "However, CH3OH is much less stable than CH4 under the OCM conditions, and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to form CO2 in three CH activation steps."
[7] "Whereas dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at this site can result in CO formation."
[8] "Thus, our study suggests that surface O22 species are responsible for CH4 complete oxidation in the OCM reaction, where the first CH bond activation is the rate-determining step."
[9] "From our predicted pathway for CH4 selective oxidation in the OCM reaction, C2 selectivity is predicted to be 67% in the absence of competing reactions."

The study investigates the selective and complete oxidation of methane (CH4) using a La2O3 catalyst. The lattice oxygen (O2) site on the catalyst surface activates CH4 through heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond, generating CH3 and H+ fragments. Molecular oxygen (O2) assists in the desorption of the CH3 fragment, forming an O2• species. The O2• species further reacts with CH4 by direct hydrogen abstraction, creating another CH3 radical. The O2• site is found to be kinetically more favorable for selective conversion of CH4 into CH3 radicals. At the O22 site, an oxygen atom directly inserts into the CH bond, forming CH3OH. However, CH3OH is less stable under OCM conditions and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to produce CO2 through a series of activation steps. Dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at the O22 site can result in the formation of CO. Therefore, the O22 site is responsible for complete oxidation of CH4 in the OCM reaction, with the initial CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. The predicted pathway for selective oxidation of CH4 suggests a 67% selectivity for C2 products in the absence of competing reactions.

该研究利用La2O3催化剂研究了甲烷（CH4）的选择性和完全氧化。催化剂表面的晶格氧（O2）位点通过异裂断裂CH键激活CH4，产生CH3和H+片段。分子氧气（O2）协助CH3片段的脱附，形成O2•物种。O2•物种进一步与CH4反应，通过直接氢抽象生成另一个CH3自由基。O2•位点对于选择性将CH4转化为CH3自由基更为有利。在O22位点，一个氧原子直接插入到CH键中，形成CH3OH。然而，在OCM条件下，CH3OH的稳定性较差，并且可以在O22位点进一步氧化形成CO2，通过一系列活化步骤。在O22位点的CH2O中间体脱氢可以导致CO的形成。因此，O22位点负责OCM反应中CH4的完全氧化，初始CH键的活化是速率决定步骤。预测的CH4选择性氧化路径表明，在不存在竞争反应的情况下，C2产物的产率约为67%。

<p>Our proposed reaction mechanism agrees well with the experimental results of Karakaya et al.,44 who made model-based interpretation of spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles measured in a laboratory-scale packed-bed reactor over a La2O3/CeO2 nanofabric catalyst.</p>
<p>With a CH4/O2 ratio of 9 in the feed, the O2 concentration was found to decrease rapidly due to CH4 consumption when the gas mixture entered the catalyst bed. In addition, the C2H4 and C2H6 profiles rise more slowly than those of CO2 and H2O, indicating that CH4 combustion occurs prior to the oxidative coupling and C2 product formation.</p>
<p>When CH4 passes through the La2O3 catalyst, oxygen is mostly consumed in the early stage of the reactor accompanied by a rapid increase of catalyst bed temperature; the temperature then falls off in the middle to latter stages of the reactor.</p>
<p>For the over-oxidation of CH4, we propose a possible mechanism based on its initial oxidation to CH3OH at the O22 site, followed by subsequent oxidations to CH2O and HCOOH before CO2 formation.</p>

The proposed reaction mechanism aligns with experimental findings by Karakaya et al., who analyzed spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles in a lab-scale packed-bed reactor using a La2O3/CeO2 nanofabric catalyst. High CH4 consumption leads to a rapid decrease in O2 concentration, with CO2 and H2O profiles rising faster than those of C2H4 and C2H6, indicating that CH4 combustion precedes oxidative coupling and C2 product formation. Oxygen consumption in the early reactor stages causes a sharp increase in catalyst bed temperature, which then declines in the middle to later stages. For CH4 over-oxidation, a mechanism is proposed starting with CH3OH formation at the O22 site, followed by oxidations to CH2O and HCOOH before CO2 production. The reaction network is better suited for low to moderate O2 conversion rates. Elementary steps can be categorized based on adsorbate adsorption strength, with different rates of occurrence. Reliable identification of reaction pathways and rate-determining steps requires detailed microkinetic simulations with accurate energetics. Studies aim to uncover other low-index La2O3 surface steps and develop a microkinetic model. Sequential oxidation of CH3OH by the O22 site involves modest energy barriers, and CH4 activation at the lattice oxygen site is highly endothermic.

提出的反应机制与卡拉卡亚等人的实验结果相吻合，他们分析了在使用La2O3/CeO2纳米织物催化剂的实验室规模填料床反应器中的空间解析浓度和温度轮廓。高甲烷消耗导致氧气浓度迅速下降，二氧化碳和水的轮廓上升速度比丙烯和丙烷快，这表明甲烷燃烧发生在氧化耦合和C2产物形成之前。早期反应器阶段的氧气消耗导致催化剂床温度急剧增加，随后在中期到后期阶段下降。对于甲烷过氧化，提出了一个机制，从O22位点开始氧化生成CH3OH，然后依次氧化生成CH2O、HCOOH最终生成CO2。对于低至适度的氧气转化率，反应网络更适合。根据吸附剂吸附强度的不同，可以将基本步骤分为三类，不同步发生率。可靠地识别反应途径和速率决定步骤需要详细的微观动力学模拟，并且具有准确的能量。研究旨在揭示其他低指数La2O3表面步骤，并建立基于原理解析方法的宏观动力学模型。通过O22位点顺序氧化CH3OH涉及较小的能量壁垒，而甲烷在Lattice氧位点上的激活是高度吸热的。

1. The lattice oxygen (O2) site on the stoichiometric La2O3 surface splits the CH bond of CH4 heterolytically, generating CH3 and H+ fragments that bind to the surface's Lewis acid (La3+) and Brnsted base (O2) sites, respectively. 

2. The presence of the H+ fragment allows the CH3 fragment to bind strongly to the La2O3 surface, while O2 adsorption promotes its desorption as a gaseous CH3 radical at lower reaction temperatures.

3. The O2• site on the La2O3 surface is more reactive than the O2 site for CH4 activation, facilitating the selective conversion of CH4 into the CH3 radical.

4. At the O22 site, direct insertion of an O atom into the CH bond results in the formation of CH3OH. 

5. However, CH3OH is less stable under OCM conditions, and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to form CO2 through multiple activation steps.

1. 石榴石结构La2O3表面的氧原子（O2）位点通过异裂性地断裂CH键，产生CH3和H+碎片，这些碎片分别结合到表面的Lewis酸（La3+）和Brnsted碱（O2）位点上。

2. 当存在H+片段时，CH3片段会强烈地结合到La2O3表面上，而O2吸附促进了其在较低反应温度下作为气态CH3自由基的脱附。

3. 相比之下，O2•位点在La2O3表面上对于甲烷的活性更高，能够促进甲烷选择性转化为CH3自由基。

4. 在O22位点，直接将一个O原子插入到CH键中导致生成CH3OH。

5. 然而，在OCM条件下，CH3OH的稳定性较差，可以进一步被O22位点氧化形成CO2，通过多个激活步骤实现。
