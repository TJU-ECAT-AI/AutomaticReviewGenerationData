1. The lattice oxygen (O2) site on the stoichiometric La2O3 surface splits the CH bond of CH4 heterolytically, generating CH3 and H+ fragments that bind to the surface's Lewis acid (La3+) and Brnsted base (O2) sites, respectively. 

2. The presence of the H+ fragment allows the CH3 fragment to bind strongly to the La2O3 surface, while O2 adsorption promotes its desorption as a gaseous CH3 radical at lower reaction temperatures.

3. The O2• site on the La2O3 surface is more reactive than the O2 site for CH4 activation, facilitating the selective conversion of CH4 into the CH3 radical.

4. At the O22 site, direct insertion of an O atom into the CH bond results in the formation of CH3OH. 

5. However, CH3OH is less stable under OCM conditions, and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to form CO2 through multiple activation steps.

1. 石榴石结构La2O3表面的氧原子（O2）位点通过异裂性地断裂CH键，产生CH3和H+碎片，这些碎片分别结合到表面的Lewis酸（La3+）和Brnsted碱（O2）位点上。

2. 当存在H+片段时，CH3片段会强烈地结合到La2O3表面上，而O2吸附促进了其在较低反应温度下作为气态CH3自由基的脱附。

3. 相比之下，O2•位点在La2O3表面上对于甲烷的活性更高，能够促进甲烷选择性转化为CH3自由基。

4. 在O22位点，直接将一个O原子插入到CH键中导致生成CH3OH。

5. 然而，在OCM条件下，CH3OH的稳定性较差，可以进一步被O22位点氧化形成CO2，通过多个激活步骤实现。
