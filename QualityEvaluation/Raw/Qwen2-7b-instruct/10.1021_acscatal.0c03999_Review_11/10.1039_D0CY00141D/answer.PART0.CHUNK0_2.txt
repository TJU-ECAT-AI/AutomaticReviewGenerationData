<p>Our proposed reaction mechanism agrees well with the experimental results of Karakaya et al.,44 who made model-based interpretation of spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles measured in a laboratory-scale packed-bed reactor over a La2O3/CeO2 nanofabric catalyst.</p>
<p>With a CH4/O2 ratio of 9 in the feed, the O2 concentration was found to decrease rapidly due to CH4 consumption when the gas mixture entered the catalyst bed. In addition, the C2H4 and C2H6 profiles rise more slowly than those of CO2 and H2O, indicating that CH4 combustion occurs prior to the oxidative coupling and C2 product formation.</p>
<p>When CH4 passes through the La2O3 catalyst, oxygen is mostly consumed in the early stage of the reactor accompanied by a rapid increase of catalyst bed temperature; the temperature then falls off in the middle to latter stages of the reactor.</p>
<p>For the over-oxidation of CH4, we propose a possible mechanism based on its initial oxidation to CH3OH at the O22 site, followed by subsequent oxidations to CH2O and HCOOH before CO2 formation.</p>
<p>Our proposed reaction network is likely more suitable at low to modest O2 conversion rate.</p>
<p>Depending on the adsorption strength of the various adsorbates involved in the elementary steps, the elementary steps shown in Table 1 can be divided into three categories.</p>
<p>The first category includes ES1, ES3, ES5, and ES12, which involves the reaction of a weakly adsorbed molecular species.</p>
<p>The second category includes ES7, ES9, and ES10, which are characterized by adsorbates of modest adsorption strength at 0 K.</p>
<p>The third category includes ES4 and ES6, which are purely surface reactions with strongly surface-bound species.</p>
<p>More reliable identification of the preferable reaction pathway and the RDS in complex catalytic reactions requires detailed microkinetic simulations at realistic conditions using accurate energetics.</p>
<p>Our ongoing studies aim at revealing the possible elementary steps on other low-index La2O3 surfaces, as well as building a reliable microkinetic model based on our first principles studies on the OCM reaction.</p>
<p>Our calculations show that the sequential oxidation of CH3OH by the O22 site involves modest energy barriers of no more than 165 kJ mol1.</p>
<p>With our proposed reaction mechanism, CH4 is first activated at the lattice oxygen site on the La2O3(001) surface, which is highly endothermic with a high energy barrier.</p>

The proposed reaction mechanism aligns with experimental findings by Karakaya et al., who analyzed spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles in a lab-scale packed-bed reactor using a La2O3/CeO2 nanofabric catalyst. High CH4 consumption leads to a rapid decrease in O2 concentration, with CO2 and H2O profiles rising faster than those of C2H4 and C2H6, indicating that CH4 combustion precedes oxidative coupling and C2 product formation. Oxygen consumption in the early reactor stages causes a sharp increase in catalyst bed temperature, which then declines in the middle to later stages. For CH4 over-oxidation, a mechanism is proposed starting with CH3OH formation at the O22 site, followed by oxidations to CH2O and HCOOH before CO2 production. The reaction network is better suited for low to moderate O2 conversion rates. Elementary steps can be categorized based on adsorbate adsorption strength, with different rates of occurrence. Reliable identification of reaction pathways and rate-determining steps requires detailed microkinetic simulations with accurate energetics. Studies aim to uncover other low-index La2O3 surface steps and develop a microkinetic model. Sequential oxidation of CH3OH by the O22 site involves modest energy barriers, and CH4 activation at the lattice oxygen site is highly endothermic.

提出的反应机制与卡拉卡亚等人的实验结果相吻合，他们分析了在使用La2O3/CeO2纳米织物催化剂的实验室规模填料床反应器中的空间解析浓度和温度轮廓。高甲烷消耗导致氧气浓度迅速下降，二氧化碳和水的轮廓上升速度比丙烯和丙烷快，这表明甲烷燃烧发生在氧化耦合和C2产物形成之前。早期反应器阶段的氧气消耗导致催化剂床温度急剧增加，随后在中期到后期阶段下降。对于甲烷过氧化，提出了一个机制，从O22位点开始氧化生成CH3OH，然后依次氧化生成CH2O、HCOOH最终生成CO2。对于低至适度的氧气转化率，反应网络更适合。根据吸附剂吸附强度的不同，可以将基本步骤分为三类，不同步发生率。可靠地识别反应途径和速率决定步骤需要详细的微观动力学模拟，并且具有准确的能量。研究旨在揭示其他低指数La2O3表面步骤，并建立基于原理解析方法的宏观动力学模型。通过O22位点顺序氧化CH3OH涉及较小的能量壁垒，而甲烷在Lattice氧位点上的激活是高度吸热的。
