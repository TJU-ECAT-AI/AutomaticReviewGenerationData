[1] "The lattice oxygen site was found to activate CH4 by heterolytic CH bond splitting to yield the CH3 and H+ fragments, which bind to the Lewis acid site (bridge Lab) and Brnsted base site (top Ot), respectively."
[2] "Although the CH3 fragment binds quite strongly to the surface in the presence of the H+ fragment, molecular O2 can facilitate its desorption especially at relatively low reaction temperatures leading to the formation of an O2• species."
[3] "The O2• species can further activate CH4 by direct hydrogen abstraction, producing the second CH3 radical."
[4] "Comparing the free energy barriers of CH3 radical formation at the O2 and O2• sites, we found the O2• site to be kinetically favorable for selective conversion of CH4 into the CH3 radical."
[5] "For CH4 activation at the O22 site,direct insertion of an O atom into the CH bond leads to the formation of CH3OH."
[6] "However, CH3OH is much less stable than CH4 under the OCM conditions, and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to form CO2 in three CH activation steps."
[7] "Whereas dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at this site can result in CO formation."
[8] "Thus, our study suggests that surface O22 species are responsible for CH4 complete oxidation in the OCM reaction, where the first CH bond activation is the rate-determining step."
[9] "From our predicted pathway for CH4 selective oxidation in the OCM reaction, C2 selectivity is predicted to be 67% in the absence of competing reactions."

The study investigates the selective and complete oxidation of methane (CH4) using a La2O3 catalyst. The lattice oxygen (O2) site on the catalyst surface activates CH4 through heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond, generating CH3 and H+ fragments. Molecular oxygen (O2) assists in the desorption of the CH3 fragment, forming an O2• species. The O2• species further reacts with CH4 by direct hydrogen abstraction, creating another CH3 radical. The O2• site is found to be kinetically more favorable for selective conversion of CH4 into CH3 radicals. At the O22 site, an oxygen atom directly inserts into the CH bond, forming CH3OH. However, CH3OH is less stable under OCM conditions and can be further oxidized by the O22 site to produce CO2 through a series of activation steps. Dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at the O22 site can result in the formation of CO. Therefore, the O22 site is responsible for complete oxidation of CH4 in the OCM reaction, with the initial CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. The predicted pathway for selective oxidation of CH4 suggests a 67% selectivity for C2 products in the absence of competing reactions.

该研究利用La2O3催化剂研究了甲烷（CH4）的选择性和完全氧化。催化剂表面的晶格氧（O2）位点通过异裂断裂CH键激活CH4，产生CH3和H+片段。分子氧气（O2）协助CH3片段的脱附，形成O2•物种。O2•物种进一步与CH4反应，通过直接氢抽象生成另一个CH3自由基。O2•位点对于选择性将CH4转化为CH3自由基更为有利。在O22位点，一个氧原子直接插入到CH键中，形成CH3OH。然而，在OCM条件下，CH3OH的稳定性较差，并且可以在O22位点进一步氧化形成CO2，通过一系列活化步骤。在O22位点的CH2O中间体脱氢可以导致CO的形成。因此，O22位点负责OCM反应中CH4的完全氧化，初始CH键的活化是速率决定步骤。预测的CH4选择性氧化路径表明，在不存在竞争反应的情况下，C2产物的产率约为67%。
