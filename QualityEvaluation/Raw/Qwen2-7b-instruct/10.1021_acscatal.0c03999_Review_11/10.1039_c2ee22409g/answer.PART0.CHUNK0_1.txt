<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.</p>
<p>The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibited superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehy- drogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere.</p>
<p>A comparison of the conversions and selectivity under CO2 and N2 streams showed the superior activity of FeNaZ and Fe3O4 in a CO2 stream whereas, in the case of the commercial catalyst, the catalytic performance was better in an N2 stream.</p>
<p>Studies by Sugino et al. have reported the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over iron supported on alkali or alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, Ca, Ba and K) impregnated on activated carbon. The highest yield of styrene (40.45%) with more than 90% selectivity with a specific activity of 2% was observed over a lithium-impregnated carbon support, which was comparatively higher than other alkali-impregnated supports.</p>
<p>Alkali or alkaline earth metals can act as promoters and enhance the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions under an optimum ratio of carbon dioxide to the substrate.</p>
<p>Studies by Guerrero-Ruiz et al. provided evidence of oxygen exchange between the metal oxide and carbon dioxide in relation to the activity in the dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>Acidbase bifunctionality plays an important role in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Support materials play a significant role as they not only provide a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also overcome diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface.</p>
<p>Among the oxidative coupling of methane with CO2, rare earth catalysts, such as yttrium, lanthanum and samarium, showed higher C2 selectivities of about 30%.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Initial investigations over the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes were performed by Krylov et al. over various metal oxides systems.</p>
<p>Very few studies have been reported in the literature for the ODH of n-butane where CO2 is used as an oxidant.</p>
<p>Recently, Park et al. investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane with CO2 over VOx/SnO2ZrO2, which exhibited excellent performance with 22.34% conversion of n-butane with 36.63% selectivity for the C4 olefins.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be regarded as a promoter in a catalytic system when its co-presence influences the kinetics, conversion, selectivity, product distribution or all of these factors.</p>
<p>The role of CO2 over the metal-based system was found to be the formation of peroxycarbonate species, which are considered to be more active (even compared to hydrogen peroxide) in oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>There is a lot of scope and challenges for catalyst development in these areas.</p>
<p>At present, research on oxidative dehydrogenation is mainly focused on acidbase and redox catalysts, which are limited to the bench-scale.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the research utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter at the laboratory level can be regarded as underpinning future technologies that can bring changes in the world economy by adapting the current industrial processes.</p>

1. The utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis has emerged as a promising concept for industrial applications, aiming to mitigate CO2 levels and facilitate the development of economical and energy-efficient syntheses of various chemicals. Its non-toxic, economic, and mild oxidizing properties make it an attractive option for use in several reactions.

2. The studies on the behavior of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant were initiated in the 1990s and laid the groundwork for contemporary soft oxidant systems. This includes the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene, which was found to proceed via a path involving the dissociation of CO2 molecules into CO and surface oxygen.

3. The utilization of carbon dioxide in soft oxidant systems contributes to the acceleration of reaction rates and enhancing selectivity. It also facilitates the removal of hydrogen through coupling with a reverse water gas shift reaction, which helps overcome the thermodynamic limitations in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The role of surface/lattice oxygen species in oxidative dehydrogenation is crucial, as they play an important part in the donation of oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate. The presence of these oxygen species helps maintain the redox balance in the reaction.

5. The redox properties of materials are pivotal in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, acting as mediators for the transfer of oxygen from CO2 to hydrocarbons. The metal oxide first interacts with the hydrocarbon, leading to oxidative dehydrogenation with the partial reduction of the metal oxide.

6. The support materials are instrumental in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, providing a high surface area, immobilization, and porosity. They also help overcome diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites accessible to reactants.

7. The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 is an alternative approach to utilizing methane, mainly used as a clean-burning fuel. The addition of CO2 to this reaction enhances the selectivity towards C2H6 and C2H4 products, albeit at the cost of a decreased conversion due to the poisoning of centers responsible for methane activation.

8. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2 is seen as a new technology that could revolutionize the manufacturing of organic chemicals, offering the potential for higher olefin yields from smaller volumes of alkanes.

9. The promotional effects of carbon dioxide have been demonstrated in various catalytic systems, including the formation of peroxycarbonate species that mimic monoxygenases, enhancing oxidation reactions' activity.

10. The current research on oxidative dehydrogenation is centered around acid-base and redox catalysts, which are currently limited to laboratory-scale studies. Future advancements aim to tackle challenges such as increasing CO2 conversions while minimizing coke deposition and improving catalyst performance per pass.

11. The envisioned future technologies leveraging carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter could transform the world economy by adapting existing industrial processes, leading to energy savings, cost reductions, and the mitigation of increasing CO2 levels.</EnglishVersionAnswer>
