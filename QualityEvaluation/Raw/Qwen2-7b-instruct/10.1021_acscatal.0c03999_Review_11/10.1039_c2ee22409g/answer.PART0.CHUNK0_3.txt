<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.1013 The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative</p>
<p>The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals. The objective of this review is to trace the emergence, application and understanding of these systems, which clearly depict the role of CO2 and an activator, as well as to discuss the catalyst properties, the role of surface oxygen species and mechanistic pathways.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.19 Apart from the abstraction of H atoms and providing surface oxygen, the significance of CO2 in the reaction shows several other beneficial features, such as acceleration of the reaction rate by changing the dehydrogenation pathway in an oxidative manner23 and enhancing the selectivity.24 CO2 also alleviates the chemical equilibrium in ODH by the effective removal of H2 through coupling with a reverse water gas shift reaction (eqn (1)).11,25</p>
<p>Based upon these observations, we may imagine that the acti- vation of CO2 on a surface may be by electron transfer from a surface to the CO2 molecule which, in turn, could lead to the occupation of this orbital via the formation of CO2 , which is a bent anion in its equilibrium geometry. If the charge transfer moves from the CO2 molecule to the surface, we would have to consider the formation of a CO2 cation, which would remain in the linear geometry. It is considerable to state that an energeti- cally favoured reaction will involve the anionic species. All other processes require energies that are orders of magnitude larger than those involving CO2.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al.44 with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species. In a further study, they demonstrated the effect of surface hydroxyls on selective CO2 hydrogenation over an Ni4 cluster supported on g-Al2O3.45 This study revealed that the reaction energy and activation barrier for formate formation are
0.23 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively, whereas those for CO
formation are 0.48 eV and 2.13 eV, respectively.45 This showed that the formate formation is preferred kinetically and CO formation is thermodynamically favorable.</p>
