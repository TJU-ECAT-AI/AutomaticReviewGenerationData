<p>Carbon dioxide has been the subject of interest in the scientific community. Over the past few decades, contemporary research has been focused on the sequestration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere due to its culpable greenhouse effect and global warming.</p>
<p>The abundant availability, non-toxic, economic, and mild oxidizing properties of CO2 has resulted in immense interest in its use as an oxidant in several reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of CH4 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkyl aromatics.</p>
<p>Utilization of CO2 globally is envisioned by scientists as a necessity that could contribute not only to the mitigation of CO2 atmospheric levels, but also towards the economic, renewable, and environmentally friendly synthesis of value-added products.</p>
<p>In view of these points, there is a requirement of an alternative technological method for the utilization of CO2.</p>
<p>One such technology, which is enjoying rapid growth, relates to the behavioral aspects of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations.</p>
