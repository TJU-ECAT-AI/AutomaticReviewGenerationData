The document does not provide specific details on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. Therefore, an analysis of such methods cannot be directly extracted from the given text. However, typically, halogen-assisted methods for dehydrogenation involve the use of elements such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Propane's reactivity in these processes would differ from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the larger size of propane molecules, which allows for more favorable interactions with halogen species. The reaction conditions would depend on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts. For instance, dehydrogenation with halogens might occur under high temperature and pressure, while oxyhalogenation could involve the use of halogen compounds in the presence of oxygen. The specifics of these methods and their comparative analysis are not provided in the document.

<p>The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals. The objective of this review is to trace the emergence, application and understanding of these systems, which clearly depict the role of CO2 and an activator, as well as to discuss the catalyst properties, the role of surface oxygen species and mechanistic pathways.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.19 Apart from the abstraction of H atoms and providing surface oxygen, the significance of CO2 in the reaction shows several other beneficial features, such as acceleration of the reaction rate by changing the dehydrogenation pathway in an oxidative manner23 and enhancing the selectivity.24 CO2 also alleviates the chemical equilibrium in ODH by the effective removal of H2 through coupling with a reverse water gas shift reaction (eqn (1)).11,25</p>
<p>Based upon these observations, we may imagine that the acti- vation of CO2 on a surface may be by electron transfer from a surface to the CO2 molecule which, in turn, could lead to the occupation of this orbital via the formation of CO2 , which is a bent anion in its equilibrium geometry. If the charge transfer moves from the CO2 molecule to the surface, we would have to consider the formation of a CO2 cation, which would remain in the linear geometry. It is considerable to state that an energeti- cally favoured reaction will involve the anionic species. All other processes require energies that are orders of magnitude larger than those involving CO2.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al.44 with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species. In a further study, they demonstrated the effect of surface hydroxyls on selective CO2 hydrogenation over an Ni4 cluster supported on g-Al2O3.45 This study revealed that the reaction energy and activation barrier for formate formation are
0.23 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively, whereas those for CO
formation are 0.48 eV and 2.13 eV, respectively.45 This showed that the formate formation is preferred kinetically and CO formation is thermodynamically favorable.</p>

<p>Propane reacts with water at elevated temperatures to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a reforming reaction.</p>
<p>The alternative approach with regards to its utilization is by oxidative coupling to form C2H6 and C2H4 using O2 as an oxidant, which is limited largely by the undesirable formation of CO2 and CO as by-products, which results in a decrease of the selectivity toward coupling products.</p>
<p>The overall reaction and thermodynamics for CH4 oxidative coupling to C2H6 and C2H4 under CO2 can be represented by the following equations:</p>
<p>2CH4 + CO2 / C2H6 + CO + H2O DH  62.1 KJ mol1(11)</p>
<p>2CH4 + 2CO2 / C2H4 + 2CO + 2H2O

<p>In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields.</p>
<p>The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 over catalytic systems will not only proceed in a completely oxidative manner, but also partially by a simple dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane is very demanding due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry.</p>
