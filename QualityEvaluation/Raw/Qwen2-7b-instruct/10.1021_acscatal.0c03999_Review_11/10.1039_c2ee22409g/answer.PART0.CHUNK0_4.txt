<p>Propane reacts with water at elevated temperatures to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a reforming reaction.</p>
<p>The alternative approach with regards to its utilization is by oxidative coupling to form C2H6 and C2H4 using O2 as an oxidant, which is limited largely by the undesirable formation of CO2 and CO as by-products, which results in a decrease of the selectivity toward coupling products.</p>
<p>The overall reaction and thermodynamics for CH4 oxidative coupling to C2H6 and C2H4 under CO2 can be represented by the following equations:</p>
<p>2CH4 + CO2 / C2H6 + CO + H2O DH  62.1 KJ mol1(11)</p>
<p>2CH4 + 2CO2 / C2H4 + 2CO + 2H2O
DH  196.2 KJ mol1 (12)</p>
<p>In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields.</p>
<p>The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 over catalytic systems will not only proceed in a completely oxidative manner, but also partially by a simple dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane is very demanding due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry.</p>
<p>The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 increases the selectivity toward C2H6 and C2H4.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkyl aromatics is representative processes to produce important monomers for synthetic polymers.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be regarded as a promoter in a catalytic system when its co-presence influences the kinetics, conversion,selectivity, product distribution or all of these factors.</p>
<p>Initial investigations on the behavioral aspects of carbon dioxide as a modulator of the oxidative properties of dioxygen in the presence of transition metal systems were performed by Aresta et al.</p>
<p>The profound effect of CO2 was the suppression of the burning of p-xylene as depicted in Table 10.</p>

1. Propane can be utilized through oxidative coupling with CO2 to form C2H6 and C2H4, but this process is limited by the formation of CO2 and CO as by-products, which reduces the selectivity towards coupling products. 

2. The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 can increase the selectivity for C2H6 and C2H4 products.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene often involves the use of halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Each method has distinct reaction conditions. For example, halogen-assisted dehydrogenation typically requires high temperatures and specific halogen catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation uses molecular oxygen as the oxidant and can be endothermic or exothermic depending on the alkane. Molten metal halide salt approaches involve salts that facilitate the dehydrogenation process at elevated temperatures. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its larger size and higher boiling point, allowing for more complex interactions with the catalysts and reactants.

4. The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 increases the selectivity for C2H6 and C2H4 products.

5. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkyl aromatics produces important monomers for synthetic polymers, such as styrene from ethyl benzene.

6. Carbon dioxide can enhance the performance of certain catalytic systems, acting as a promoter that influences reaction kinetics, conversion, selectivity, and product distribution.

7. The promotional effect of carbon dioxide was observed in the oxidation of cyclic olefins by molecular oxygen, particularly in conditions below sub-critical CO2.

8. The development of technologies utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter aims to mitigate CO2 levels, produce chemicals economically, and sustainably, addressing global concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon cycle.

9. The use of carbon dioxide in catalytic systems has opened avenues for alternative industrial processes that could reduce costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy consumption.

10. Challenges for the industrial implementation of these processes include increasing CO2 conversions with minimal coke deposition, improving catalytic performances per pass, and ensuring thermal stability of the catalysts.

11. The oxidative coupling of methane and the oxidative dehydrogenation of various alkanes, alkyl aromatics, and hydrocarbons represent promising areas for future advancements in chemical industry practices.
