[1] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene."
[2] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[4] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."
[5] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

The effect of reaction conditions and time on the stream on the coke formed during propane dehydrogenation was studied. The formation of coke on the first two peaks in the TPO profiles was found to increase with temperature and propene partial pressure. Conversely, hydrogen suppressed the formation of coke. The amount of coke attributed to the third peak increased with temperature and propane partial pressure. Over time, the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 hours, whereas the second peak continued to increase. Hydrogen was highly effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation, but it could not remove the coke already formed on the catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，反应条件和时间对形成的焦炭进行了研究。第一和第二峰在TPO谱中的焦炭形成量随温度和丙烯分压增加而增加。然而，氢气抑制了焦炭的形成。第三峰归因的焦炭量随温度和丙烷分压增加而增加。随着时间的推移，第一个峰在大约15小时后达到恒定水平，而第二个峰仍然增加。氢气在防止催化剂上形成焦炭和失活方面非常有效，但不能去除已形成的焦炭。
