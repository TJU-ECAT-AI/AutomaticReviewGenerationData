[1] "Deactivation of Ethane and Ethene Formation"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the deactivation of ethane and ethene formation during propane dehydrogenation under different reaction conditions. It shows that the ethane formation deactivates much faster than propane dehydrogenation and that the ethene formation activity cannot be correlated with the amount of coke, unlike propane dehydrogenation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
文档阐述了在不同反应条件下，丙烷脱氢过程中乙烷和乙烯形成失活的情况。结果显示，乙烷形成比丙烷脱氢更快地失活，而乙烯形成活性与焦炭量之间无法建立相关性，这与丙烷脱氢不同。

[1] "Linear Models of the Type"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Linear models of the type y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b12x1x2 were tested to analyze the relationship between the amount of coke and the reaction conditions. These models were used to determine the impact of factors such as gas flow rates and temperature on coke formation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
采用类型为y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b12x1x2的线性模型来分析焦炭量与反应条件之间的关系。这些模型被用来确定气体流速、温度等因素对焦炭形成的影响。

[1] "We Suggest the Following Explanation"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The text suggests an explanation for the slow deactivation of ethane and ethene formation during propane dehydrogenation. It states that ethene is primarily formed through cracking on the carrier, leading to slower deactivation compared to the propane dehydrogenation process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
文本提出了一个解释，在丙烷脱氢过程中，乙烷和乙烯形成失活缓慢的原因。它指出，乙烯主要通过载体上的裂解形成，导致失活速度比丙烷脱氢过程慢。

[1] "Hydrogen Has Proven to Be Very Efficient"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen has demonstrated its effectiveness in maintaining catalyst activity and inhibiting coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. However, it is not capable of removing significant amounts of coke that have already been formed on the catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氢在丙烷脱氢过程中已被证明能够非常有效地维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭形成。然而，它无法去除已经形成在催化剂上的大量焦炭。

[1] "Deconvolution Using Gaussian Curves Assuming Two or Three Different Types of Coke"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves assuming two or three different types of coke. This method provided excellent results for all experiments except for those with higher coke loadings, where one broad peak was observed due to insufficient oxygen or mass transfer limitations.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
使用高斯曲线对TPO谱图进行了分解，假设存在两种或三种不同类型的焦炭。这种方法为所有实验提供了出色的结果，除了焦炭负载较高时的实验，此时由于氧气不足或质量传输限制观察到了一个宽泛的峰值。
