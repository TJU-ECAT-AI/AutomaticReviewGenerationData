[1] "The addition of tin to a platinum catalyst has proved to be an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "The monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has received considerable attention in the last few decades. The goal in most investigations carried out with Pt and PtSn catalysts has been to study the performance in the reforming process."
[3] "However, dehydrogenation of light paraffins is commercially done at a relatively high temperature, 770--900 K (6), and the deactivation rate and coke formation may differ from those in experiments conducted at lower temperatures."
[4] "When tin is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, an increased total amount of coke is usually found (1, 4, 5, 14, 15)."
[5] "The issues we have tried to address in this study are: how will the deactivation change over time and with altered reaction conditions; are different types of coke formed; and if so, does the ratio between the types depend on the conditions; and how does the coke influence the catalyst."

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, specifically propane, using a platinum catalyst with tin added. The tin addition increases the total amount of coke formed, which can deactivate the catalyst. The study aims to understand how deactivation changes over time, whether different types of coke are formed, and how the coke influences the catalyst. 

The reaction conditions for these processes involve a high temperature, typically around 770--900 K for propane dehydrogenation. The document does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does mention that the reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to factors such as the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst, which affects the formation of coke and deactivation of the catalyst.

To answer the question completely, the document would need to provide detailed information on the reaction conditions for each of these methods and explain the specific differences in reactivity between propane and other alkanes in these processes. The document focuses primarily on the dehydrogenation of propane using a platinum catalyst with tin addition, rather than comparing it to other methods or alkanes.

描述并比较各种卤素辅助方法在选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯中的应用，包括使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃存在显著差异。

文档讨论了使用铂催化剂添加锡对轻烷烃进行脱氢。添加锡会增加形成的焦炭总量，从而导致催化剂失活。研究旨在了解失活随时间变化的方式以及反应条件的变化；是否形成不同类型的焦炭；如果形成，类型的比例是否取决于条件；焦炭如何影响催化剂。

这些过程的反应条件通常涉及较高温度，对于丙烷脱氢大约为770-900 K。文档并未具体讨论使用卤素、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法。然而，它确实提到，丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）的反应性存在显著差异，原因可能包括铂催化剂中添加锡的影响，这会影响焦炭的形成和催化剂的失活。

为了完全回答问题，文档需要提供每种方法的具体反应条件信息，并解释丙烷与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃在这些过程中的反应性差异。文档主要关注使用添加锡的铂催化剂进行丙烷脱氢，而不是与其他方法或烷烃进行比较。
