The Effect of Reaction Conditions and Time on Stream on the Coke Formed during Propane Dehydrogenation

Received October 30, 1995; revised August 2, 1996; accepted August 5, 1996

Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas composition have been varied.

Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions.

The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation. The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.

A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst. This coke is formed in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the TPO experiments. The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route.

The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased.

Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.

The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The addition of tin to a platinum catalyst has proved to be an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions (15). Therefore, the bimetallic platinum-tin catalyst has received considerable attention in the last few decades. The goal in most investigations carried out with Pt and PtSn catalysts has been to study the performance in the reforming process. However, dehydrogenation of light paraffins is commercially done at a relatively high temperature, 770–900 K (6), and the deactivation rate and coke formation may differ from those in experiments conducted at lower temperatures.

Many authors have studied the effect of tin in the formation and composition of the coke by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) (5, 7–13). The different peaks found in the TPO profiles have been proposed to be coke with different locations and different composition.

The effect of the catalyst composition, for example loading of tin, on the coke formed has been investigated in great detail (9). When tin is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, an increased total amount of coke is usually found (1, 4, 5, 14, 15). The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the coke and the relation of the different peaks in the TPO profiles have also been analyzed, but often with contradicting results (5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16).

The issues we have tried to address in this study are: how will the deactivation change over time and with altered reaction conditions; are different types of coke formed; and if so, does the ratio between the types depend on the conditions; and how does the coke influence the catalyst.

In this paper we present two different studies of deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalysts, where the coke has been deposited using different reaction conditions. In the first study, the reaction conditions were held constant except for the deactivation time. In the second set of experiments, deactivation time has been kept constant but reaction conditions such as flows and temperatures have been changed.

The study examines the effect of various reaction conditions and time on stream on the coke formed during propane dehydrogenation. It uses temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) to identify three types of coke: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The formation of the first two types of coke peaks increases with temperature and propene partial pressure, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of the third type of coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model suggests that a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, formed in parallel with the coke seen in the first two peaks. The experiments reveal that the first peak reaches a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second one continues to increase. Hydrogen efficiently prevents coke formation and deactivation but cannot remove already formed coke on the catalyst. The study discusses the hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "We suggest the following explanation for the ethane and ethene formation results. Ethene is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier. The slow deactivation is caused by coke accumulated on the active sites."
[2] "On the Pt catalyst a part of the ethene is formed on the metal, but this process deactivates quickly."
[3] "The ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal."
[4] "Ethane is not formed on the carrier except very early in the experiments."
[5] "The observation that the ethane formation deactivates faster than the propane dehydrogenation can be explained if we considerthattheformerprocessistakingplaceonlargerensembles than the latter (3335) and that coke also is formed preferentially on these sites (34, 36, 37)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The formation of ethane and ethene during propane dehydrogenation is influenced by the distribution of reactions on the catalyst. Ethene primarily forms through cracking on the carrier, leading to a slower deactivation due to coke accumulation on active sites. On the Pt catalyst, a portion of ethene forms on the metal, but this process quickly deactivates. Ethane formation occurs via hydrogenolysis of propane and hydrogenation of ethene, both occurring on the metal. Ethane does not form significantly on the carrier except at the beginning of the reactions. The faster deactivation of ethane compared to propane dehydrogenation is explained by ethane formation taking place on larger ensembles and coke forming preferentially on these sites.

对于丙烷脱氢过程中乙烷和乙烯的形成，反应分布对催化剂的影响至关重要。乙烯主要通过载体上的裂解形成，导致由于活性位点上积聚的焦炭而形成较慢的失活。在Pt催化剂上，部分乙烯在金属上形成，但这一过程很快就会失效。乙烷的形成是通过丙烷的氢解和乙烯的氢化实现的，两者都在金属上发生。除了实验开始阶段，乙烷并不在载体上大量形成。与丙烷脱氢相比，乙烷形成更快失效的原因在于，乙烷形成发生在更大的团簇上，并且焦炭更倾向于在这些位置形成。

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, specifically propane, using a platinum catalyst with tin added. The tin addition increases the total amount of coke formed, which can deactivate the catalyst. The study aims to understand how deactivation changes over time, whether different types of coke are formed, and how the coke influences the catalyst. 

The reaction conditions for these processes involve a high temperature, typically around 770--900 K for propane dehydrogenation. The document does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. However, it does mention that the reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to factors such as the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst, which affects the formation of coke and deactivation of the catalyst.

To answer the question completely, the document would need to provide detailed information on the reaction conditions for each of these methods and explain the specific differences in reactivity between propane and other alkanes in these processes. The document focuses primarily on the dehydrogenation of propane using a platinum catalyst with tin addition, rather than comparing it to other methods or alkanes.
