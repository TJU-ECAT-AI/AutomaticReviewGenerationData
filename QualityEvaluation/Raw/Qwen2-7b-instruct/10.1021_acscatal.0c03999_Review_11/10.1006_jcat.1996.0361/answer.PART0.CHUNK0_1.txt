[1] "We suggest the following explanation for the ethane and ethene formation results. Ethene is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier. The slow deactivation is caused by coke accumulated on the active sites."
[2] "On the Pt catalyst a part of the ethene is formed on the metal, but this process deactivates quickly."
[3] "The ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal."
[4] "Ethane is not formed on the carrier except very early in the experiments."
[5] "The observation that the ethane formation deactivates faster than the propane dehydrogenation can be explained if we considerthattheformerprocessistakingplaceonlargerensembles than the latter (3335) and that coke also is formed preferentially on these sites (34, 36, 37)."

The formation of ethane and ethene during propane dehydrogenation is influenced by the distribution of reactions on the catalyst. Ethene primarily forms through cracking on the carrier, leading to a slower deactivation due to coke accumulation on active sites. On the Pt catalyst, a portion of ethene forms on the metal, but this process quickly deactivates. Ethane formation occurs via hydrogenolysis of propane and hydrogenation of ethene, both occurring on the metal. Ethane does not form significantly on the carrier except at the beginning of the reactions. The faster deactivation of ethane compared to propane dehydrogenation is explained by ethane formation taking place on larger ensembles and coke forming preferentially on these sites.

对于丙烷脱氢过程中乙烷和乙烯的形成，反应分布对催化剂的影响至关重要。乙烯主要通过载体上的裂解形成，导致由于活性位点上积聚的焦炭而形成较慢的失活。在Pt催化剂上，部分乙烯在金属上形成，但这一过程很快就会失效。乙烷的形成是通过丙烷的氢解和乙烯的氢化实现的，两者都在金属上发生。除了实验开始阶段，乙烷并不在载体上大量形成。与丙烷脱氢相比，乙烷形成更快失效的原因在于，乙烷形成发生在更大的团簇上，并且焦炭更倾向于在这些位置形成。
