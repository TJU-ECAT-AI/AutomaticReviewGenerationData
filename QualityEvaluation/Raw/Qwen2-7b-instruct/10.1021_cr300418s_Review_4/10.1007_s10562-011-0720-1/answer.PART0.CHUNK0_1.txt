<p>Our view on this subject and continued support of the formate mechanism is described in a recent research account [28].</p>
<p>Although carboxylates have recently been suggested as alternative surface intermediates to formates/carbonates, it should be noted that the species has not been identified by infrared spectroscopy, which is not a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>Special emphasis is placed on using time resolved EXAFS and XANES, a technique that has been successfully applied for examining the oxygen storage and release properties of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides [30].</p>
<p>For each run, the catalyst was first activated at 350C in 50 ml/min of 33% H2 (balance He) for 2 h and then cooled to 130C.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a bend was observed in the decomposition curve for the Y-doped sample, indicating that a fraction (i.e., in fact, a higher fraction) of the formates decomposed more rapidly.</p>
<p>The trend was as follows: Zn-doped (249.0 min) > undoped Pt/ceria (80.4 min) > La-doped (56.2 min) > Hf-doped (37.1 min) > Y-doped (36.0 min) > Ba-doped (24.8 min).</p>
<p>These results are in good agreement with the results of other studies [2326, 3337], that the oxide support has a strong influence on the WGS activity.</p>

1. Time-resolved EXAFS and XANES were emphasized as a technique for studying the oxygen storage and release properties of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides, as detailed in a recent research account [28].

2. Carboxylates have been proposed as alternative surface intermediates to formates/carbonates in the water-gas shift reaction, but they have not been confirmed through infrared spectroscopy.

3. Nitrogen physisorption was used to measure the BET surface area and porosity of the catalyst supports and loaded catalysts.

4. The formate decomposition half-lives varied among the different catalysts, with Zn-doped catalyst showing the longest half-life.

5. The results aligned with the trend of catalyst activity, which followed the order: Ba > Y > Hf > La > undoped ceria > Zn.

6. The oxide support had a significant impact on the water-gas shift activity, according to several other studies [2326, 3337].

2. 近年来有人提出，羧酸盐可能是水气转换反应中的替代表面中间体，但它们通过红外光谱法尚未被确认。

3. 氮物理吸附用于测量催化剂支撑材料和支持催化剂的比表面积和孔隙率。

4. 形态分解半衰期在不同催化剂之间有所不同，其中Zn掺杂催化剂显示出最长的半衰期。

5. 结果与催化剂活性趋势一致，顺序为：Ba > Y > Hf > La > 未掺杂氧化铈 > Zn。
