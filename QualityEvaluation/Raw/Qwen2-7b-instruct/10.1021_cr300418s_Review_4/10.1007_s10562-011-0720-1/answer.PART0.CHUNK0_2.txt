<p>High surface area mixed oxide solid solutions of CexMe1x O y were prepared via a homogenous precipitation of cerium and nitrate salt of the dopant, using NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%, 2040 mesh beads) as the precipitating agent.</p>
<p>The nature of the dopants and their influence on catalyst reducibility, formate mobility, and WGS activity, are discussed.</p>
<p>In situ H2-TPR XAFS studies were performed at the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MR-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Results of catalytic performance tests obtained over the Pt/Ce-Me-O catalysts are presented in Figure 4, where the conversion of CO (X CO) is plotted as a function of reaction temperature.</p>
<p>The dopants have different effects on catalytic behavior of the modified Pt/CeO2 catalysts. It is observed that doping of Pt/ceria with Y, Hf, La and especially Ba, results in a shift of the conversion curves toward lower reaction temperatures, compared to the undoped catalyst.</p>
<p>The half-lives were found to vary inversely with CO conversion levels, suggesting that the decomposition of an associated intermediate such as formate may indeed be responsible for WGS catalysis.</p>

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include homogenous precipitation, in situ H2-TPR XAFS studies, and catalytic performance tests. Homogenous precipitation ensures the even distribution of dopants within the metal oxide structure. In situ H2-TPR XAFS studies provide insights into the reduction process and the extent of reduction of ceria, which is influenced by the dopants. Catalytic performance tests, specifically the water-gas shift reaction, assess the activity of the catalysts under various conditions, revealing the impact of dopants on formate mobility and overall catalytic efficiency.
