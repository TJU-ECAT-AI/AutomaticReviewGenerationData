<p>The addition of dopants to ceria do facilitate catalyst reduction, increasing extents of both surface shell and bulk reduction of ceria, and allowing bridging OH group formation to occur at lower temperature.</p>
<p>CO adsorption was used to probe the active bridging OH groups to form formates.</p>
<p>DRIFTS measurements of the transient decomposition of formates in steam at low temperature and low H2O concentration suggest that formate half-life follows the trend Zn > undoped ceria > La > Hf > Y > Ba, indicating that the formate decomposition rate is enhanced by the addition of most of the dopants tested.</p>
<p>Low temperature watergas shift activity showed good agreement with this trend, with activity following the order: Ba > Y > Hf > La > undoped ceria > Zn.</p>

1. TPR-XANES measurements demonstrated that dopants enhance the reducibility of ceria catalysts, enabling the formation of bridging OH groups at lower temperatures.
2. CO adsorption was utilized to identify the active bridging OH groups, which then form formates.
3. DRIFTS analysis revealed that the half-life of formate decomposition decreases with increasing dopant addition, suggesting an acceleration of formate decomposition rates.
4. The catalytic performance of the Pt/ceria catalysts aligns with the formate decomposition trend, indicating that dopants significantly improve the WGS rate by enhancing O-mobility of O-bound intermediates.

1. TPR-XANES测量表明，掺杂剂可以增强铈催化剂的可还原性，使桥接OH基团在较低温度下形成。
2. CO吸附被用来探查活性桥接OH基团，然后形成碳酸盐。
3. DRIFTS分析显示，随着掺杂剂添加量的增加，碳酸盐分解半衰期减少，表明碳酸盐分解速率加快。
4. Pt/铈催化剂的催化性能与碳酸盐分解趋势一致，表明掺杂剂显著提高了低温水气变换率，通过提高O键合中间体（例如碳酸盐）的O流动性。
