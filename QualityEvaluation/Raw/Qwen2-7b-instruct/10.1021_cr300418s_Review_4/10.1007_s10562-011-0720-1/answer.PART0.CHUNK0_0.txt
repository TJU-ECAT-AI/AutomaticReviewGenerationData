<p>Our view on this subject and continued support of the formate mechanism is described in a recent research account [28].</p>
<p>Special emphasis is placed on using time resolved EXAFS and XANES, a technique that has been successfully applied for examining the oxygen storage and release properties of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides [30].</p>
<p>In situ TPR-XANES investigations of a series of Pt/ceria catalysts having different Pt loadings and Ca doped Pt/ceria catalysts definitively identified that once Pt oxide reduction occurs, reduction of the ceria surface shell follows.</p>
<p>The XANES line shapes of Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states are very different.</p>
<p>Results of fitting procedure are shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>The trend was as follows: Zn-doped (249.0 min) > undoped Pt/ceria (80.4 min) > La-doped (56.2 min) > Hf-doped (37.1 min) > Y-doped (36.0 min) > Ba-doped (24.8 min).</p>
