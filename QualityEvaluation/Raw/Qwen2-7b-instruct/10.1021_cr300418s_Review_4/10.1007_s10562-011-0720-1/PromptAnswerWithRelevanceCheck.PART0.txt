<p>Our view on this subject and continued support of the formate mechanism is described in a recent research account [28].</p>
<p>Although carboxylates have recently been suggested as alternative surface intermediates to formates/carbonates, it should be noted that the species has not been identified by infrared spectroscopy, which is not a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>Special emphasis is placed on using time resolved EXAFS and XANES, a technique that has been successfully applied for examining the oxygen storage and release properties of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides [30].</p>
<p>For each run, the catalyst was first activated at 350C in 50 ml/min of 33% H2 (balance He) for 2 h and then cooled to 130C.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a bend was observed in the decomposition curve for the Y-doped sample, indicating that a fraction (i.e., in fact, a higher fraction) of the formates decomposed more rapidly.</p>
<p>The trend was as follows: Zn-doped (249.0 min) > undoped Pt/ceria (80.4 min) > La-doped (56.2 min) > Hf-doped (37.1 min) > Y-doped (36.0 min) > Ba-doped (24.8 min).</p>
<p>These results are in good agreement with the results of other studies [2326, 3337], that the oxide support has a strong influence on the WGS activity.</p>

1. The document discusses the impact of dopants on the reducibility, formate mobility, and WGS activity of metal oxide catalysts. It uses in situ TPR-XANES studies to monitor catalyst reduction and DRIFTS measurements to analyze the transient decomposition of formates. The results indicate that adding dopants enhances the WGS rate by facilitating catalyst activation and increasing the oxygen mobility of O-bound intermediates.

2. The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ TPR-XANES studies and DRIFTS measurements. These techniques help establish the relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by examining the reduction process and the mobility of O-bound intermediates.

3. The document presents a comparative analysis of Pt/ceria catalysts doped with various cations (Ba, La, Y, Hf, and Zn) using TPR-XANES and transient formate decomposition studies. It finds that adding dopants facilitates catalyst reduction, increases the extents of both surface shell and bulk reduction of ceria, and allows bridging OH group formation at lower temperatures. The CO adsorption was used to probe the active bridging OH groups to form formates. The DRIFTS measurements of the transient decomposition of formates in steam at low temperature and low H2O concentration suggest that formate half-life varies inversely with CO conversion levels, indicating enhanced formate decomposition rates with the addition of dopants.

4. The conclusions drawn from the study indicate that dopant addition can significantly improve the WGS rate by enhancing catalyst activation and increasing the oxygen mobility of O-bound associated intermediates. This leads to lower amounts of Pt and Ce being required in the formulation to achieve comparable levels of activity.

1. 文档讨论了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化剂的可还原性、形成酸的移动性和低温度水气转移反应活性的影响。它使用原位透射电子光谱近边吸收（TPR-XANES）研究来监测催化剂的还原过程，并通过差分反射傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFTS）测量分析了形成酸的瞬态分解。结果表明，添加掺杂剂可以提高WGS速率，通过促进催化剂激活和增加氧的移动性来实现O键合中间体。

2. 验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括原位TPR-XANES研究和DRIFTS测量。这些技术通过检查还原过程和O键合中间体的移动性，帮助建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间的关系。

3. 文档进行了一项掺杂有各种离子（Ba、La、Y、Hf和Zn）的Pt/ceria催化剂的比较分析，使用TPR-XANES和瞬态形成酸分解研究。它发现添加掺杂剂可以促进催化剂的还原，增加铈表面壳层和基体的还原程度，并允许在较低温度下形成桥接OH基团。使用CO吸附来探查活性桥接OH基团以形成形成酸。DRIFTS测量在低温和低H2O浓度下蒸汽中形成的酸的瞬态分解表明，形成酸半衰期与CO转化率成反比，表明掺杂剂的加入增强了形成酸分解速率。
