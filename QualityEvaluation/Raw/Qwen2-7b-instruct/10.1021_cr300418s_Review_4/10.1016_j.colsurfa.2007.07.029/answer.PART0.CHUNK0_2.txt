[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support."
[2] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[3] "The presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches that are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the composition, structure, and phase formation of the catalysts. SEM imaging helps visualize the morphology and crystal aggregation modes during the annealing process. Textural analysis through N2 sorption isotherms reveals the pore structure and connectivity, which are essential for understanding the transport properties of reactants and products within the porous catalyst matrix. The XRD patterns indicate the presence and relative amounts of various crystalline phases, which are influenced by the type and combination of dopants. This comprehensive approach allows researchers to correlate the microstructure and composition of the catalysts with their catalytic performance, ensuring that the observed enhancements are indeed due to the dopants rather than other factors.
