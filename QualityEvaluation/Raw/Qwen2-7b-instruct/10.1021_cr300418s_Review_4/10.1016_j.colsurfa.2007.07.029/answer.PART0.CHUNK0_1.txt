[1] "The zirconia crystallization temperature is affected by the nature and combination of the metallic doping."
[2] "The presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."
[3] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[4] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

1. Various characterization techniques, including thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), textural analysis by N2 sorption isotherms, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are essential for confirming the successful incorporation and even distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These methodologies allow for the assessment of structural changes induced by dopants and their correlation with enhanced catalytic activity, while also excluding alternative explanations for observed effects.

2. The nature and combination of the metallic dopants significantly influence the crystallization temperature of zirconia. The doping agents affect the crystalline phase formation, with the La-Mn combination favoring the monoclinic phase and La-Fe doping promoting the tetragonal structure.

3. Although the specific surface areas of the catalysts are relatively low, the large cavity sizes contribute to efficient transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of zirconia during catalytic tests, thereby facilitating the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene.

4. The La-Fe doped zirconia catalyst exhibits superior performance in the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene, primarily due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase, which enables better resistance to high concentration flows and facilitates efficient catalytic activity.

1. 多种表征方法，包括热分析（DTA/TGA）、红外光谱（FT-IR）、X射线衍射（XRD）、N2吸附等温线的纹理分析和扫描电子显微镜（SEM），对于确认金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂元素的成功引入和均匀分布至关重要。这些方法允许评估掺杂剂引起的结构变化与增强催化活性之间的关系，并排除其他可能的解释。

2. 金属掺杂物的性质和组合显著影响了氧化锆的结晶温度。掺杂剂影响晶相形成，La-Mn组合促进单斜相，而La-Fe掺杂促进四方结构。

3. 尽管催化剂的比表面积相对较低，但较大的孔隙大小有助于通过氧化锆的多孔结构有效传输反应物和产物，在催化测试中促进三氯乙烯的催化燃烧。

4. 具有主要四方氧化锆相的La-Fe掺杂氧化锆催化剂在三氯乙烯催化燃烧方面表现出优越性能，主要是由于这种相的存在，能够更好地抵抗高浓度流体，并促进有效的催化活性。
