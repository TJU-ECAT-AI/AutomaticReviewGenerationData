1. The solgel method has gained significant interest in the synthesis of metallic catalysts due to the even distribution of active metals resulting from mixing components at the atomic level. This ensures a uniform dispersion of active metals on the catalyst support.

2. The crystalline phase produced through the solgel technique is contingent upon the initial metallic precursor utilized.

3. The ZrO2 monoclinic phase is favored at 800°C when using a combination of lanthanum and manganese as dopants, while a tetragonal structure is promoted by lanthanum and iron doping.

4. The morphology of the gel particles is affected by the nature of the dopant metal, which can be visually assessed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

5. The nitrogen (N2) sorption analysis unveiled the creation of porous materials.

6. The La-Fe doped zirconia catalyst maintained its functionality despite high concentrations of trichloroethylene and increased temperature.

7. The catalytic tests demonstrated that the tetragonal phase of zirconia, stabilized by lanthanum and iron dopants, significantly enhanced the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene.
