<quotes>
[1] "This long awaited book has finally arrived in print."
[2] "The first two chapters,one on EXAFS theory by E. A. Stern and the second on XANES theory by P. J. Durham, are both very read- able."
[3] "The real heart of the book, however, consists of Chapters 3-6 (and Chapter 10 for those interested in SEXAFS)."
[4] "They cover the subject with honesty and completeness,even pointing out the pitfalls, and, in most cases, how to avoid them."
[5] "In spite of this lack, I would recommend, even insist,that anyone considering an x-ray absorption experiment be familiar with the material in this book."

The book "X-Ray Absorption" edited by D. C. Koningsberger and R. Prins is a valuable resource for researchers in the field. It provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, applications, and techniques of EXAFS, XANES, and SEXAFS. The first two chapters, by E. A. Stern on EXAFS theory and P. J. Durham on XANES theory, are particularly readable. The heart of the book, comprising Chapters 3-6, offers detailed and honest coverage of experimental techniques and data analysis, addressing potential pitfalls and providing guidance on how to avoid them. Despite being somewhat outdated due to its delay in publication, the book is highly recommended for anyone planning an x-ray absorption experiment.

[1] "This long awaited book has finally arrived in print. It is appropriately subtitled Principles, Applications and Techniques of EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES, and consists of a collection of chapters written by various well-known experts in the respective areas."
[2] "The first two chapters,one on EXAFS theory by E. A. Stern and the second on XANES theory by P. J. Durham, are both very read- able. They not only cover the theory well but also relate the various equations and approximations to the physical process."
[3] "The real heart of the book, however, consists of Chapters 3-6 (and Chapter 10 for those interested in SEXAFS). These chapters cover the experimental techniques and data analysis. They are remarkable in that they cover the subject with honesty and completeness,even pointing out the pitfalls, and, in most cases, how to avoid them."
[4] "My only criticism of the book is that it was so long delayed. The information is now somewhat dated in that it does not cover the latest developments in data acquisition and analysis, especially the rapid curved wave and multiple scattering calculations now available."
