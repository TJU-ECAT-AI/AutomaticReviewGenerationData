[1] "This long awaited book has finally arrived in print. It is appropriately subtitled Principles, Applications and Techniques of EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES, and consists of a collection of chapters written by various well-known experts in the respective areas."
[2] "The first two chapters,one on EXAFS theory by E. A. Stern and the second on XANES theory by P. J. Durham, are both very read- able. They not only cover the theory well but also relate the various equations and approximations to the physical process."
[3] "The real heart of the book, however, consists of Chapters 3-6 (and Chapter 10 for those interested in SEXAFS). These chapters cover the experimental techniques and data analysis. They are remarkable in that they cover the subject with honesty and completeness,even pointing out the pitfalls, and, in most cases, how to avoid them."
[4] "My only criticism of the book is that it was so long delayed. The information is now somewhat dated in that it does not cover the latest developments in data acquisition and analysis, especially the rapid curved wave and multiple scattering calculations now available."

The book "X-Ray Absorption" edited by D. C. Koningsberger and R. Prins provides comprehensive coverage of principles, applications, and techniques of EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES. It features chapters written by leading experts in their respective fields. The first two chapters cover EXAFS and XANES theories, presenting the concepts clearly and relating equations to physical processes. The core of the book consists of Chapters 3-6, which delve into experimental techniques and data analysis, offering honest and complete guidance while acknowledging potential pitfalls and methods to circumvent them. However, the reviewer notes that the book's information is somewhat outdated due to its delay in publication, as it does not encompass recent advancements in data acquisition and analysis, such as rapid curved wave and multiple scattering calculations.

《X射线吸收》一书由D. C. Koningsberger和R. Prins编辑，提供了EXAFS、SEXAFS和XANES原理、应用和技术的全面覆盖。它包含了各个领域知名专家撰写的章节。前两章分别介绍了EXAFS和XANES理论，以清晰的方式阐述概念，并将各种方程式与物理过程联系起来。该书的核心部分是第3-6章（对有兴趣了解SEXAFS的人，第10章也是一个不错的选择），这部分深入探讨了实验技术和数据分析，以诚实和完整的方式覆盖主题，同时指出潜在的陷阱并提供避免方法。然而，评论者指出，由于该书出版延迟，其信息有些过时，因为它没有涵盖最近的数据获取和分析进展，如快速弯曲波和多重散射计算。
