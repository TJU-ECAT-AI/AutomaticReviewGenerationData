1. Introduction
In heterogeneous catalysis, reactions take place at the outer- most atomic layer of solid catalysts. Therefore, the availability of a technique that analyzes the chemical composition of this layer is of crucial importance in the fundamental study of catalysis as well as in the optimization of industrial catalysts. Low Energy Ion Scattering is a unique tool that provides quantitative composi- tional information about the outermost atomic layer of a material.
For many years, important contributions to the application of LEIS to catalytic materials have been made by the groups of Cocke, Hercules and Houalla, Taglauer and Kno zinger, Hoflund, Gru nert and Brongersma. See reviews [13] and other references to the literature [47]. A problem of LEIS is the damage to the samples by the bombarding ions. The development of High Sensitivity-LEIS has enabled the use of such low ion doses that the damage is negligible,while the mass resolution has been improved. This has given a new impulse to the application to catalysts.
HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS (ESCA) since the informa- tion depth for XPS is several nanometers (20 layers) whereas HS- LEIS is specific for the outermost atomic layer. HS-LEIS also compares favorably to SIMS, since quantification of HS-LEIS results is straightforward.
The principle behind the LEIS technique is depicted in Fig. 1. A noble gas ion with a known primary energy Ei is aimed at the surface. The incident ion beam is perpendicular to the surface.
There, this ion collides with a surface atom in a binary collision. The energy of the backscattered ion (Ef) is determined by the classic laws of mechanics (conservation of momentum and conservation of energy) and is given by Ef  k2 m2 m1 ;u
Ei (1) In this, m1 and m2 are the masses of the primary ion and scattering surface atom, respectively, while u is the back scattering angle (determined by the geometry of the instrument). In the HS- LEIS experiment, u, m1 and Ei are known and Ef is measured with a dedicated energy analyzer. The factor k2 is a known function of m2/ m1 and u. The k2 function increases monotonously from 0 for m2/ m1 = 1 to 1 for m2/m1 ! 1 (if u > 908). Thus, the mass of the scattering surface atom can be calculated from Eq. (1). Only surface atoms with a mass higher than the mass of the primary ion can be measured since the primary ion will scatter in the forward direction if it scatters from very light atoms. In the derivation of Eq. (1) it has been assumed that the target atom is at rest. It has been shown before that, although the vibrational energy of the surface atoms is orders of magnitude smaller than the primary energy of the ion, Doppler broadening will give a detectable increase in the peakwidth [8].

High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample. On a heterogeneous catalyst, this outermost atomic layer is the precise location where the catalytic processes take place. Based on the principles of classical mechanics, HS-LEIS determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface. Examples with pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported metal oxide catalyst samples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity, the ease of quantification, the availability of information about layers immediately beneath the surface (relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst) as well as the potential for High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to the short analysis times. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, the HS-LEIS spectra are recorded with different primary ions since the HS-LEIS analyst is free to choose the primary ion. The spectra with 4He+ ions will give the best information in terms of mass resolution and sensitivity for lighter surface atoms. In general, elements with masses in the range from 12 to 60 amu can be positively identified with 4He+. It is perfectly possible to use 4He+ ions for higher masses, but element identification will be problematic. For example, if it is known that a sample contains only Pt, Co and alumina then analysis with 4He+ ions will be sufficient, since in that case higher mass resolution is not required. However, when a positive identification for unknown heavier surface atoms is needed, the mass resolution can be improved by using 20Ne+ ions.
A typical HS-LEIS spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The sample is a mixed oxide catalyst, cleaned with atomic oxygen (to remove hydrocarbons from exposure to atmosphere) prior to analysis. The surface is analyzed with 3 keV 4He+ ions (Fig. 2a). Peaks for oxygen (m = 16 amu), aluminum (27 amu) and vanadium (51 amu) can be recognized in the spectrum, as well as a peak at 2500 eV. This high energy peak is due to elements that are too heavy to separate with 4He+. By switching to 3 keV 20Ne+ ions (Fig. 2b) the elements in this peak can be separated and are identified as molybdenum (96 amu) and tellurium (118 amu). If needed, 40Ar+ ions can be used to discriminate between even heavier surface atoms. Similarly, 3He+ ions are preferred for the analysis of very light elements (<20 amu).
2. Sensitivity and sputter damage
HS-LEIS is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conven- tional LEIS. In HS-LEIS, the scattered ions are collected from all azimuth angles and the HS-LEIS analyzer is imaging the ions onto a position sensitive detector. The latter makes it possible to simultaneously detect scattered ions of different energies. As a result, the ratio of the LEIS signal to the primary ion current is orders of magnitude higher in HS-LEIS. As a consequence of this enormous increase in sensitivity it is possible to perform Static
LEIS. Good LEIS spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a
monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface. An example of Static LEIS spectra of a dehydrated supported MoO3/TiO2 catalyst containing a two-dimensional monolayer of surface MoOx species on the TiO2 support is shown in Fig. 3 together with the reference spectra of pure MoO3 and TiO2 samples [9]. For each of the spectra only 0.2% of a monolayer was sputtered from the surface. This is generally considered to be well below the static limit.
3. Quantification
As long as the experimental conditions are chosen with care (Ei cannot be too low, u is large and no grazing angles are used), for a given primary ion, primary ion energy and scattering surface atom,the HS-LEIS peak is proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms [3]. This means that quantification is straightfor- ward. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms. Thus, when a pure reference of the element is analyzed, peak areas from the unknown samples can be expressed Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the ion scattering process. The energy, Ei, and mass m1 of the primary ion are controlled in the experiment. The scattering angle, u,is fixed for the instrument geometry. The final energy, Ef, is measured, which yields the mass of the surface atom, m2.

The last peak consists of contributions from Mo and Te that cannot be separated with 3 keV 4He+ ions. In the 3 keV 20Ne+ spectrum of (b), these peaks are clearly separated.

198 as fractions of the peak area for the pure element yielding surface fractions for the unknown samples.
Another typical procedure makes use of a calibration plot. The area of one peak is plotted as a function of the area of another peak for a number of samples. If there are no other elements to consider and if Vegards law holds (i.e., there is no significant excess volume of mixing), these data points will form a straight line. The calibration plot for the Static LEIS spectra from Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4. From the spectrum and the references, it is determined that the Mo/Ti ratio for the dehydrated supported MoO3/TiO2 catalyst surface is 44/56. This surface composition is consistent with the surface Mo density of 4.6 Mo atoms/nm2 for the supported MoO3/ TiO2 catalyst relative to 8 Mo atoms/nm2 for pure MoO3 [9,10]. The HS-LEIS detection of exposed TiOx sites from the underlying TiO2 support also reflects the generally lower surface density of supported metal oxide phases at monolayer coverage relative to that found in their corresponding unsupported pure oxides.
Fig. 4 is an example of a calibration plot, containing data points for the dehydrated supported MoO3/TiO2 catalyst sample and two pure references. In many cases, it is not necessary to use pure
