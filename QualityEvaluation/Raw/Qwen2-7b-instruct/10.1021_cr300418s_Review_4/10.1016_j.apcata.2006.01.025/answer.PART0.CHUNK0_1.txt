1. A series of ceria-zirconia binary oxides were prepared by dissolving cerium nitrate and zirconyl nitrate in aqueous solution, using urea as a precipitating agent, and ammonium hydroxide to ensure complete precipitation. The BET surface area varied from 108 to 156 m<sup>2</sup>/g, with uniform average pore volume.

2. XPS analysis showed an increasing trend in area with Zr loading, but the relationship was not linear. Surface concentrations of Zr and Ce were in agreement with EXAFS data, suggesting solid solution formation between Ce and Zr.

3. TPR profiles revealed that Zr addition facilitated the bulk reduction step, shifting the peak maximum to lower temperatures. The surface shell reduction process was split into two features, one occurring at lower temperatures with increasing Zr levels.

4. EXAFS spectra indicated a peak at 3.63-3.75 Å for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample, supporting the presence of solid mixing between Ce and Zr.

5. DRIFTS spectra confirmed that CO adsorption leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands. The formate CH stretching region increased with Zr addition, showing more formates on the zirconia-rich surface.

6. The formate decomposition rate was enhanced by Zr addition, reaching a peak at about 50% Zr loading. The overall decomposition rate was proportional to the number of active sites multiplied by their turnover rate.

7. Switching tests demonstrated that the Pt/ceria-zirconia catalyst was less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by carbon dioxide, with about an 8-10% greater recovery after switching off carbon dioxide.

1. 一系列铈锆二元氧化物通过溶解铈硝酸盐和锆氧基硝酸盐在水溶液中，使用尿素作为沉淀剂，并用氨水确保完全沉淀来制备。BET表面积从108到156 m<sup>2</sup>/g，平均孔体积保持均匀。

2. XPS分析显示随着锆加载量的增加，面积呈上升趋势，但关系非线性。Ce和Zr的表面浓度与EXAFS数据相符，表明Ce和Zr之间存在固溶体形成。

3. TPR谱图表明Zr添加促进了基体还原步骤，使峰值最大值向更低温度移动。表面壳层还原过程分为两个特征，随着Zr含量的增加，一个在较低温度下发生。

4. EXAFS谱图显示Ce0.75Zr0.25O2样品中有3.63-3.75 Å的峰，支持Ce和Zr之间的固溶体混合存在。

5. DRIFTS谱图证实CO吸附导致与桥接OH基团反应产生表面形式酸基团。随着Zr添加，形式酸CH拉伸区域增加，表明更多形式酸在锆酸盐富集表面上。

6. 形式酸分解速率由Zr添加增强，在约50% Zr负载时达到峰值。总体分解速率与活性位点的数量成正比，乘以其分解速率。

7. 切换测试显示Pt/铈锆催化剂对二氧化碳不可逆失活的敏感度较低，切换后二氧化碳后，其恢复能力提高了约8-10%。
