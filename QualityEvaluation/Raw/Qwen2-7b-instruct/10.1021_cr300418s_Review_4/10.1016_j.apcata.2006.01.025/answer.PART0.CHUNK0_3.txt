The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and activity studies using a fixed bed reactor system. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing insights into the surface composition, structure, and activity of the catalysts.
