[1] "Along with preparation of ceria and zirconia, four ceria zirconia binary oxides were also prepared,including Ce0.90Zr0.10, Ce0.75Zr0.25, Ce0.50Zr0.50, and Ce0.25Zr0.75."
[2] "The XPS experiments were monitored with a Thermo VG Scientific Minilab. Mg Ka X-ray (kinetic energy 1273 eV) were used with a dual cathode X-ray gun."
[3] "The surface areas ranged from 108 to 156 m2/g, while the average pore volume remained quite uniform."
[4] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
[5] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing."
[6] "As shown by comparison between Fig. 4A and B, the surface reduction is shifted from about 250 to 200 8C"
[7] "Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5AC show that, after the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in agreement with earlier studies."
[8] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
[9] "We consider three possible explanations for the enhanced rates observed on the Pt/ceriazirconia catalysts relative to the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia catalysts."
[10] "Our results are in striking contrast to those findings."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. **Preparation of Metal Oxides**: Four ceria zirconia binary oxides were prepared, specifically Ce0.90Zr0.10, Ce0.75Zr0.25, Ce0.50Zr0.50, and Ce0.25Zr0.75, to test their properties.

2. **X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)**: Utilized to monitor the XPS experiments, employing Mg Ka X-ray with a dual cathode X-ray gun for the analysis.

3. **BET Surface Area Measurements**: Conducted to measure the surface areas of the samples ranging from 108 to 156 m2/g, maintaining a consistent average pore volume.

4. **Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)**: Used to explore the possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia, evidenced by a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude spectrum for the ZrCe interaction.

5. **Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR)**: Assessed the surface shell reduction of the partially reducible oxide, revealing that the temperature shifts with the addition of Zr.

6. **X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES)**: Provided insights into the extent of surface reduction, showing a shift in the surface reduction temperature for the binary oxides.

7. **Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS)**: Demonstrated the formation of surface formate bands after the adsorption of CO, confirming earlier studies.

8. **Water-gas Shift Activity Tests**: Indicated that the WGS rates were higher for Zr-doped cerium catalysts promoted with Pt compared to undoped catalysts.

9. **Kinetic Explanations**: Proposed three possible explanations for the enhanced rates observed on the Pt/ceriazirconia catalysts, involving changes in the number of defect sites, hydrogen abstraction rates, and oxygen mobility.

10. **Contrast with Previous Findings**: Highlighted the significant differences in results compared to previous studies, particularly regarding the formate mechanism and redox model implications.

These methods collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.
