[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 811 survey redox and acid-base properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[3] "Chapters 1315 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis."
[4] "Chapters 17 and 18 target total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions, respectively."
[5] "Photocatalysis for splitting water is covered in Chapters 19 and 20 for TiO2-based systems and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides, respectively."
[6] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides, and Chapter 22 is a discussion of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts are described in the book Metal Oxides: Chemistry and Applications. These methods include:

1. Electronic properties, magnetic properties, and optical properties of metal oxides, as discussed in Chapter 6.
2. Redox and acid-base properties of catalyst systems, including zeolites, covered in Chapters 8-11.
3. Alkane reactions on metal oxides, such as propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, detailed in Chapters 13-15.
4. Total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions, addressed in Chapters 17 and 18.
5. Photocatalysis for splitting water, explored in Chapters 19 and 20 for TiO2-based systems and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides.
6. Selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons on metal oxides, covered in Chapter 21.
7. Semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors, discussed in Chapter 22.

These chapters provide valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of metal oxides and their applications in catalysis, which are essential for understanding the relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. They also help in ruling out alternative explanations by offering comprehensive coverage of the chemistry and applications of metal oxides.
