[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "This volume comprises 23 chapters, 15 of which are focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides."
[3] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[4] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides."
[5] "Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors."
[6] "This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis."
[7] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader."
[8] "This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction."
[9] "Overall, this volume contains many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis."
[10] "A wealth of references are given with each chapter, providing a valuable starting point for those new to each area of focus."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, and resonant X-ray scattering. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing insights into the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and optical properties of metal oxides. However, the presentation of some chapters might not be suitable for all readers, especially those primarily interested in catalysis, due to the rapid launch into advanced concepts such as second quantization approaches and the focus on specific phenomena like orbital ordering in manganites. The volume provides many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis, and includes a wealth of references for each chapter to aid newcomers in understanding each area of focus.
