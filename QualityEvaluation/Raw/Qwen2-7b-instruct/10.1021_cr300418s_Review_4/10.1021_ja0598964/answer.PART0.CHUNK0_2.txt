[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis."
[3] "This volume comprises 23 chapters, 15 of which are focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy. These techniques are essential for addressing the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations. They allow for the detailed examination of metal valence states and surface composition, which are critical for understanding the catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces.
