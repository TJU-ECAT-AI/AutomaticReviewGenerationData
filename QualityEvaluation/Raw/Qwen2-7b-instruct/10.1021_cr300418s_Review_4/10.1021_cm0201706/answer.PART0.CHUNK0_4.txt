<p>The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels. During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min. Thus, the oxide formed at high temperature is quenched in the process. Evolution of a large amount of gases during the process is responsible for fine crystallite formation in the range 2535 nm.</p>
<p>In combustion synthesized Cu/CeO2, either the Cu2+ ions should get separated into copper oxide species from the support or the Cu2+ ions should get incorporated into the ceria lattice. If there is an ionic substitution of Cu2+ ions for Ce4+ sites in the CeO2 lattice, an oxide ion vacancy should be created in order to maintain the charge neutrality due to lower valent ionic substitution in addition to a decrease of the lattice parameter. Rietveld analysis of Cu/CeO2 catalysts has clearly indicated the formation of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ with oxide ion vacancy.</p>
<p>High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns. The structure could be refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ  0.13 and 0.16) in the fluorite structure with 58% oxide ion vacancy.</p>
<p>EPR and XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. Redox potentials of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix are lower than those in CuO.</p>
<p>EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion.</p>
<p>The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively.</p>
<p>H2 uptake over 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 occurs at a lower temperature compared to that for pure CuO, indicating the promoting effect of CeO2.</p>

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations. 

XRD helps refine the structure of the catalyst and identify the absence of CuO phase, confirming the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution. TEM provides insights into the morphology and size of the catalyst particles, indicating a decrease in crystallite sizes in Cu/CeO2 compared to pure CeO2. EPR and XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix and the +2 oxidation state of Cu, respectively. CV measurements reveal the direct redox behavior of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix, supporting the catalytic activity enhancement. EXAFS analysis shows the local structure around Cu2+ ions, including the coordination number and bond distances, providing evidence for the stabilization of Cu2+ ions in the Ce4+ site.

H2 uptake studies further confirm the promoting effect of CeO2 on Cu2+ ion reduction at lower temperatures, indicating the synergistic involvement of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple in enhancing the catalytic performance.

用于验证掺杂剂成功融入和均匀分布于金属氧化物催化剂中的关键表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）光谱、X射线光电子光谱（XPS）、循环伏安法（CV）和扩展X射线精细结构（EXAFS）光谱。这些技术共同解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间的明确关系，并排除替代解释的挑战。

XRD有助于细化催化剂的结构并识别CuO相的缺失，确认形成Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体。TEM提供了催化剂颗粒形态和大小的信息，显示Cu/CeO2中晶粒尺寸相对于纯CeO2有所减小。EPR和XPS研究证实了CeO2矩阵中Cu2+物种的存在以及Cu的+2氧化态。CV测量揭示了CeO2矩阵中Cu物种的直接氧化还原行为，支持催化性能增强。EXAFS分析展示了Cu2+离子周围的局部结构，包括配位数和键距，提供了在Ce4+位点稳定Cu2+离子的证据。

H2吸附研究表明，5原子% Cu/CeO2在较低温度下发生H2吸附，表明CeO2对Cu2+离子还原的促进作用，这与Ce4+/Ce3+氧化还原偶的协同作用相关联，从而增强了催化性能。
