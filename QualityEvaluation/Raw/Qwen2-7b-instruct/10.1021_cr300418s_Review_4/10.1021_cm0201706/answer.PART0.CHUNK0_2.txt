The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels. During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min. Thus, the oxide formed at high temperature is quenched in the process. Evolution of a large amount of gases during the process is responsible for fine crystallite formation in the range 2535 nm.

Answer: The combustion synthesis method rapidly heats an aqueous solution containing metal salts and hydrazine-based fuels. This results in temperatures reaching up to 1000 C for a short duration, followed by cooling to 300 C within a minute. The high-temperature oxide is quenched, leading to the formation of fine crystallites in the 25-35 nm range due to the evolution of gases during the process.

The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy.

High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns. The structure could be refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ  0.13 and 0.16) in the fluorite structure with 58% oxide ion vacancy. High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2. EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. Redox potentials of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix are lower than those in CuO. EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO. The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively.

Answer: High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 catalysts failed to reveal CuO lines. The structures of these catalysts were refined as Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ ≥ 0.13 and 0.16) with a fluorite structure and 58% oxide ion vacancy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) did not detect CuO particles in the 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 catalyst. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. The redox potentials of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix are lower than those in CuO. EXAFS studies revealed an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at 1.96 Å, indicating an O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length is shorter compared to that in CuO. The second and third shells around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts consist of Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at 3.15 Å, respectively.

1. 燃烧合成方法快速加热包含金属盐和基于肼燃料的水溶液。在此过程中，温度在短时间内达到约1000°C，并在1分钟内冷却至300°C。高温氧化物被迅速冷却，导致25-35纳米范围内的细晶形成，这归因于过程中的大量气体产生。
   
2. 对Cu/CeO2催化剂进行了X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）光谱、X射线光电子光谱（XPS）、循环伏安法（CV）和扩展X射线精细结构（EXAFS）光谱的全面表征，以研究Cu的结构和化学环境。
   
3. 高分辨率X射线衍射研究表明，3和5原子%的Cu/CeO2催化剂中未显示CuO线。这些催化剂可以细化为Ce1-xCuxO2-δ（x=0.03和0.05；δ≥0.13和0.16）的氟化物结构，具有58%的氧离子空位。高分辨率TEM没有在5原子%的Cu/CeO2催化剂中发现CuO颗粒。EPR和XPS研究证实了CeO2矩阵中存在Cu2+物种。CeO2矩阵中Cu物种的还原电势低于CuO。EXAFS研究显示，第一层Cu2+离子周围的平均配位数为3，在1.96 Å处，表明周围存在O2-离子空位。与CuO相比，CuO键长较短。催化剂中Cu2+离子的第二和第三层由Cu2+O2-Cu2+（2.92 Å）和Cu2+O2-Ce4+（3.15 Å）组成。
   
4. 催化剂样品中未观察到Cu-O配位壳体在2.78和3.07 Å，表明Cu2+离子在Cu/CeO2催化剂中的性质不同于CuO。
   
5. Cu2+离子在CeO2矩阵中的还原电势降低是由于Ce4+/Ce3+还原对的协同作用。
   
6. Cu/CeO2催化剂中3.15 Å的键距离对应于Cu2+O2-Ce4+相关性。
