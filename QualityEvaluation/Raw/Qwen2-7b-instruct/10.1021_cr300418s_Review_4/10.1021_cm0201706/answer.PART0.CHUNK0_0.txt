<p>The combustion method involves rapid heating of an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of corresponding metal salts and hydrazine based fuels. During the combustion, the temperature reached for a short period (3060 s) is about 1000 C, and it cooled to 300 C in <1 min. Thus, the oxide formed at high temperature is quenched in the process. Evolution of a large amount of gases during the process is responsible for fine crystallite formation in the range 2535 nm.</p>
<p>In combustion synthesized Cu/CeO2, either the Cu2+ ions should get separated into copper oxide species from the support or the Cu2+ ions should get incorporated into the ceria lattice. If there is an ionic substitution of Cu2+ ions for Ce4+ sites in the CeO2 lattice, an oxide ion vacancy should be created in order to maintain the charge neutrality due to lower valent ionic substitution in addition to a decrease of the lattice parameter. Rietveld analysis of Cu/CeO2 catalysts has clearly indicated the formation of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ with oxide ion vacancy.</p>
<p>Examination of the X-ray diffraction data for the catalysts shows that the diffraction lines due to CuO are not detected, even when the 2θ region (3050) is expanded where CuO peaks are expected. Peaks due to Cu2O are also not detected.</p>
<p>TEM images of the catalysts are similar to pure CeO2 images, and there is no agglomerated CuO observed in the case of the Cu/CeO2 crystallite surface.</p>
<p>EPR studies show that the spectra of the catalysts contain Cu2+ species in a ceria matrix.</p>
<p>XPS studies reveal that the surface concentration of Cu is 32% in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2.</p>
<p>The EXAFS studies clearly indicate Cu2+ ion stabilization in Ce4+ sites in the form of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution.</p>
<p>The structural studies of Cu/CeO2 in comparison with pure CeO2 demonstrate that, in the combustion synthesized Cu/CeO2 catalysts, Cu2+ ions are incorporated into the CeO2 nanoparticles in the form of Ce1-xCuxO2-δ.</p>

The combustion synthesis method is a rapid heating process that generates a large amount of gases, resulting in the formation of fine crystallites in the range of 25 to 35 nm. This method allows for the incorporation of Cu2+ ions into the CeO2 lattice through ionic substitution, creating an oxide ion vacancy to maintain charge neutrality. The presence of Cu2+ ions stabilizes in the Ce4+ sites, forming a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution. XPS analysis reveals a higher surface concentration of Cu in the catalysts. The structural studies confirm the incorporation of Cu2+ ions into the CeO2 nanoparticles, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
