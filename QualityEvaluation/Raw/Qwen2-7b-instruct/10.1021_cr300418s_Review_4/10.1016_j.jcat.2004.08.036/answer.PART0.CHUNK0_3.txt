[1] "The EPR spectra recorded at 77 K consist in all cases essentially in the overlapping of two signals."
[2] "Concerning the quantitative aspects, the overall amount of paramagnetic species detected is 158.8, 167.1, and 178.1 mol g−1, for MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4 samples, respectively, which correspond to about 3% of the total amount of Mo."
[3] "The addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composition and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spectra."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). These techniques collectively address the challenges by providing detailed insights into the structural changes, dopant distribution, and electronic properties of the catalysts. XRD helps identify the crystalline phases, SEM-EDX reveals the morphology and local inhomogeneities, EPR detects paramagnetic species, XPS analyzes surface chemistry, and XANES offers information on the coordination environment of dopants.

The incorporation of potassium into MoVSb oxide catalysts does not significantly alter the bulk composition, nature of V2p or Mo3d spectra, but it does affect the Sb3d spectra, suggesting an oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ on the catalyst surface, which could relate to the enhanced catalytic performance.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）结合能量色散X射线分析（EDX）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）。这些技术共同解决了挑战，提供了关于结构变化、掺杂分布和催化剂性质的详细见解。XRD有助于识别结晶相，SEM-EDX揭示了形态和局部不均匀性，EPR检测了顺磁物种，XPS分析了表面化学，而XANES提供了掺杂剂配合环境的信息。

将钾引入MoVSb氧化物催化剂中，并不会显著改变基体组成，或V2p或Mo3d光谱的性质，但Sb3d光谱的变化表明Sb3+在催化剂表面上被氧化为Sb5+，这可能与增强的催化性能有关。
