[1] "A slight decrease of the surface area is observed upon the incorporation of potassium in the MoVSbO catalyst (Ta- ble 1), indicating that neither the incorporation of potassium by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of MoVSb-based catalysts."
[2] "The introduction of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not produce strong changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no significant differences are found in the positions of the bands between sam- ples with variable K content."
[3] "The morphology of the catalysts has been studied by scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX)."
[4] "The overall amount of paramagnetic species detected is 158.8, 167.1, and 178.1 mol g−1, for MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4 samples, respectively, which correspond to about 3% of the total amount of Mo."
[5] "The FWHM values of the Mo3d peaks are similar in all samples and can be fitted with two components at BE = 232.7 and 231.7 eV for the Mo3d5/2 peak, which can be assigned to Mo6+ and Mo5+ species."
[6] "The Sb3d3/2 line is sensitively higher in the K-doped samples than in the samples without potassium (1.95 and 1.70 eV, respectively), which could be related to the presence of another species or to differential charging of the samples."

1. The incorporation of potassium in MoVSbO catalysts leads to a slight decrease in surface area, suggesting that the surface area is minimally affected by potassium impregnation or a subsequent nitrogen heat treatment.

2. The addition of potassium does not significantly alter the bulk structure of the MoVSb catalyst, as evidenced by the unchanged positions of the bands across samples with varying potassium contents.

3. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was utilized to study the morphology of the catalysts.

4. The total amount of paramagnetic species detected in the catalysts is approximately 3% of the total molybdenum content.

5. The manganese-3d peaks exhibit similar full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values across all samples, which can be attributed to two components at 232.7 and 231.7 eV, corresponding to molybdenum hexavalent and pentavalent species.

6. The sensitivity increase in the antimony-3d3/2 line in potassium-doped samples compared to undoped samples might indicate the presence of another species or differential charging of the samples.

1. 在MoVSbO催化剂中掺入钾导致表面积略有减少，表明通过浸渍法引入钾或在氮气中进行二次热处理对MoVSb基催化剂的比表面积影响不大。

2. 钾的添加没有显著改变催化剂的主体结构，因为不同钾含量样品中的波谱位置没有明显差异。

3. 扫描电子显微镜结合能量色散X射线分析（EDX）被用来研究催化剂的形态。

4. 在催化剂中检测到的总顺磁物种量约为钼总量的大约3%。

5. 锰-3d峰的全宽度半最大值（FWHM）值在所有样本中相似，可以归因于两个成分，分别位于232.7和231.7 eV，对应六价和五价钼。

6. 钾掺杂样品中抗坏血酸-3d3/2线的敏感性增加与未掺杂样品相比，可能表示存在另一种物种或样品的电荷分布不均。
