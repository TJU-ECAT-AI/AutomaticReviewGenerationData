[1] "A slight decrease of the surface area is observed upon the incorporation of potassium in the MoVSbO catalyst (Ta-ble 1), indicating that neither the incorporation of potassium by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of MoVSb-based catalysts."
[2] "The introduction of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not produce strong changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no significant differences are found in the positions of the bands between sam- ples with variable K content."
[3] "Binding energies at peak maximum and peak half widths (FWHM) of the V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, and K2p3/2 core-level lines in the XPS spectra of the MVS, MVSK-2,and MVSK-4 samples, as well as the surface metal atomic ratio determined from XPS data, are given in Table 2."
[4] "While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composi- tion and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spec- tra (Fig. 4)."

1. Incorporating potassium into MoVSbO catalysts leads to a slight decrease in surface area, indicating that the surface area is not significantly affected by potassium incorporation or subsequent treatments. The bulk of the catalyst remains unchanged upon potassium addition.

2. Potassium incorporation does not result in substantial alterations to the catalyst's structure, as evidenced by the retention of band positions across samples with varying potassium contents.

3. The document provides detailed information on the binding energies and atomic ratios derived from XPS spectra, including those of vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), antimony (Sb), and potassium (K).

4. While potassium addition does not notably impact the surface composition or nature of vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) species, it affects antimony (Sb) species. Specifically, potassium incorporation tends to oxidize Sb3+ to Sb5+, albeit to a lesser extent compared to a catalyst calcinated in air followed by nitrogen.

1. 在将钾引入MoVSbO催化剂中时，表面积略有下降，表明通过浸渍引入钾或在氮气中进行二次热处理一小时对MoVSb基催化剂的比表面积影响不大。催化剂的主体在钾添加后保持不变。

2. 钾的添加没有导致催化剂结构发生重大变化，因为不同钾含量样品的谱带位置均保持一致，表明其内部结构保持稳定。

3. 文档提供了从XPS谱图中获得的详细信息，包括钒（V）、钼（Mo）、锑（Sb）和钾（K）的结合能和原子比率。

4. 尽管钾添加对钼和钒的表面组成和性质影响不大，但它对锑（Sb）物种产生了一定的影响。具体来说，钾的添加倾向于氧化Sb3+到Sb5+，但程度低于先在空气中煅烧再在氮气中煅烧的催化剂。
