[1] "XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is shown in Fig. 1a. The appearance of peaks at 2θ = 22.3, 25.8, 28.3, 36.3, 45.0, and 50.0 can be attributed to the presence of a Sb3+-containing compound like Sb4Mo10O30"
[2] "The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is shown in Fig. 1a."
[3] "The introduction of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not produce strong changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no significant differences are found in the positions of the bands between sam- ples with variable K content."

1. The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst includes peaks at 2θ = 22.3, 25.8, 28.3, 36.3, 45.0, and 50.0, indicative of the presence of a Sb3+-containing compound such as Sb4Mo10O30.
2. The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is illustrated in Figure 1a.
3. The incorporation of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not lead to substantial alterations in the catalyst's bulk, as evidenced by the lack of notable differences in the positions of the bands across samples with varying K content.
4. XRD patterns for undoped and potassium-doped MoVSbO catalysts are depicted in Figures 1a and b.
5. The morphology of the catalysts was examined using scanning electron microscopy combined with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX).

1. 未掺杂的MoVSbO催化剂的XRD图包含在2θ = 22.3、25.8、28.3、36.3、45.0和50.0处的峰，这可归因于一种包含Sb3+的化合物的存在，如Sb4Mo10O30。
2. 未掺杂的MoVSbO催化剂的XRD图在图1a中展示。
3. 在不同钾含量样品中，催化剂的基体并未因钾的引入而发生显著变化，这一点从位置无明显差异的谱线中可以观察到。
4. 图1a和b展示了未掺杂和钾掺杂的MoVSbO催化剂的XRD图案。
5. 催化剂的形态通过扫描电子显微镜结合X射线能量色散分析（EDX）进行了研究。
