[1] "A slight decrease of the surface area is observed upon the incorporation of potassium in the MoVSbO catalyst (Ta-ble 1), indicating that neither the incorporation of potassium by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of MoVSb-based catalysts."
[2] "The introduction of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not produce strong changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no significant differences are found in the positions of the bands between sam- ples with variable K content."
[3] "Binding energies at peak maximum and peak half widths (FWHM) of the V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, and K2p3/2 core-level lines in the XPS spectra of the MVS, MVSK-2,and MVSK-4 samples, as well as the surface metal atomic ratio determined from XPS data, are given in Table 2."
[4] "While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composi- tion and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spec- tra (Fig. 4)."

1. Incorporating potassium into MoVSbO catalysts leads to a slight decrease in surface area, indicating that the surface area is not significantly affected by potassium incorporation or subsequent treatments. The bulk of the catalyst remains unchanged upon potassium addition.

2. Potassium incorporation does not result in substantial alterations to the catalyst's structure, as evidenced by the retention of band positions across samples with varying potassium contents.

3. The document provides detailed information on the binding energies and atomic ratios derived from XPS spectra, including those of vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), antimony (Sb), and potassium (K).

4. While potassium addition does not notably impact the surface composition or nature of vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) species, it affects antimony (Sb) species. Specifically, potassium incorporation tends to oxidize Sb3+ to Sb5+, albeit to a lesser extent compared to a catalyst calcinated in air followed by nitrogen.

1. 在将钾引入MoVSbO催化剂中时，表面积略有下降，表明通过浸渍引入钾或在氮气中进行二次热处理一小时对MoVSb基催化剂的比表面积影响不大。催化剂的主体在钾添加后保持不变。

2. 钾的添加没有导致催化剂结构发生重大变化，因为不同钾含量样品的谱带位置均保持一致，表明其内部结构保持稳定。

3. 文档提供了从XPS谱图中获得的详细信息，包括钒（V）、钼（Mo）、锑（Sb）和钾（K）的结合能和原子比率。

4. 尽管钾添加对钼和钒的表面组成和性质影响不大，但它对锑（Sb）物种产生了一定的影响。具体来说，钾的添加倾向于氧化Sb3+到Sb5+，但程度低于先在空气中煅烧再在氮气中煅烧的催化剂。

4. The total amount of paramagnetic species detected in the catalysts is approximately 3% of the total molybdenum content.

5. The manganese-3d peaks exhibit similar full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values across all samples, which can be attributed to two components at 232.7 and 231.7 eV, corresponding to molybdenum hexavalent and pentavalent species.

6. The sensitivity increase in the antimony-3d3/2 line in potassium-doped samples compared to undoped samples might indicate the presence of another species or differential charging of the samples.

[1] "The EPR spectra recorded at 77 K consist in all cases essentially in the overlapping of two signals."
[2] "Concerning the quantitative aspects, the overall amount of paramagnetic species detected is 158.8, 167.1, and 178.1 mol g−1, for MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4 samples, respectively, which correspond to about 3% of the total amount of Mo."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). These techniques collectively address the challenges by providing detailed insights into the structural changes, dopant distribution, and electronic properties of the catalysts. XRD helps identify the crystalline phases, SEM-EDX reveals the morphology and local inhomogeneities, EPR detects paramagnetic species, XPS analyzes surface chemistry, and XANES offers information on the coordination environment of dopants.

The incorporation of potassium into MoVSb oxide catalysts does not significantly alter the bulk composition, nature of V2p or Mo3d spectra, but it does affect the Sb3d spectra, suggesting an oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ on the catalyst surface, which could relate to the enhanced catalytic performance.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）结合能量色散X射线分析（EDX）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）。这些技术共同解决了挑战，提供了关于结构变化、掺杂分布和催化剂性质的详细见解。XRD有助于识别结晶相，SEM-EDX揭示了形态和局部不均匀性，EPR检测了顺磁物种，XPS分析了表面化学，而XANES提供了掺杂剂配合环境的信息。

将钾引入MoVSb氧化物催化剂中，并不会显著改变基体组成，或V2p或Mo3d光谱的性质，但Sb3d光谱的变化表明Sb3+在催化剂表面上被氧化为Sb5+，这可能与增强的催化性能有关。
