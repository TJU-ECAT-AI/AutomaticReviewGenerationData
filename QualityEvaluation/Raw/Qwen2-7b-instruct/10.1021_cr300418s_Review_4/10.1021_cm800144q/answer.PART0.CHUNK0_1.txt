[1] "The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)."
[2] "These techniques allow for the establishment of a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the dopant distribution, phase purity, and crystal structure."
[3] "By combining these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations for observed enhancements in catalytic activity, ensuring that the improvements are indeed due to the dopants and not other factors such as impurities or structural defects."
