The key characterization methods and analytical approaches for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include nonhydrolytic sol-gel synthesis, which allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the catalyst. These methods address the challenge of establishing a clear link between the presence of dopants, structural modifications, and enhanced catalytic performance. They also help rule out alternative explanations for the observed improvements in activity and selectivity, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
