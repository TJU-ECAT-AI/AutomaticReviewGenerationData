[1] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[2] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[3] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[4] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[5] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb Ospecies than nonselective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[6] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[7] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C."

1. 在合成催化剂中检测到了Ni和Zr之间的强烈相互作用。
2. 添加的Zr可以进入NiO晶格并导致晶格参数的增加。
3. 通过ZrONi桥接键的电子转移，Ni的电荷被提高。
4. 这些晶格参数的变化和Ni的电荷增加在减少还原性和吸附氧物种分布方面起着重要作用。
5. 活性位点Ni倾向于吸附O物种而不是非选择性氧气物种O2，这有利于乙烯选择性的增加。
6. Ni浓度的降低减少了乙烷转化率。
7. 最佳的乙二醇生产催化剂是10% NiZrO，在430 C时可获得40%的产率和66%的选择性。
