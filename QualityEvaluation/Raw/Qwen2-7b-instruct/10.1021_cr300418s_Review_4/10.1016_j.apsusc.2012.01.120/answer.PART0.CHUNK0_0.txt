[1] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[2] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[3] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[4] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[5] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb Ospecies than nonselective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[6] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[7] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C."

1. The synthesis of NiZrO catalysts revealed a strong interaction between nickel (Ni) and zirconium (Zr).
2. Incorporation of Zr enabled its entry into the NiO lattice, resulting in an increase in cell parameter.
3. Electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage raised the valence of Ni.
4. These alterations in Ni's properties were thought to impact the catalyst's reducibility and oxygen species distribution.
5. The active Ni sites favored the adsorption of oxygen species over non-selective ones, enhancing ethylene selectivity.
6. Reduced Ni concentration led to decreased ethane conversion.
7. The optimal yield of ethylene was 40% with 66% selectivity on a 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C.

1. 合成的NiZrO催化剂显示出Ni和Zr之间强烈的相互作用。
2. Zr的引入使其能够进入NiO晶格，导致晶胞参数增加。
3. 通过ZrONi桥接键的电子转移提高了Ni的电荷状态。
4. 这些Ni性质的变化被认为影响了催化剂的可还原性和吸附氧物种的分布。
5. 活性Ni位点倾向于吸附氧物种而非非选择性氧分子O2，这有利于乙烯选择性的提高。
6. Ni浓度的降低导致了乙烷转化率的下降。
7. 在430 C时，10% NiZrO催化剂的最佳乙烯产率为40%，选择性为66%。
