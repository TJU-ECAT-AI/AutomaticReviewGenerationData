The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing insights into the catalyst's morphology, surface area, crystal structure, electronic states, and surface chemistry. This helps in understanding how the dopants interact with the matrix material, alter the surface properties, and influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The analysis of the changes in the XRD patterns, the surface area, the binding energies in XPS, and the oxygen desorption profiles in O2-TPD experiments allows researchers to correlate the structural modifications with the improved catalytic behavior, ensuring that the observed enhancements are not due to other factors.

The XRD patterns provide information on the crystallinity and phase composition of the catalysts, indicating the presence and distribution of dopants within the metal oxide lattice. SEM offers visual confirmation of the particle size and morphology, which affects the reactivity and stability of the catalysts. HRTEM provides detailed structural information at the atomic scale, revealing the interplay between the dopants and the host material. BET surface area analysis quantifies the surface area, which is crucial for understanding the number of active sites available for catalytic reactions. XPS elucidates the chemical states of the elements on the catalyst surface, offering insights into the bonding environment and the electronic properties that govern the catalytic activity. Lastly, O2-TPD experiments provide information on the nature and distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, which are key reactants in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. By analyzing the changes in the O/O2 ratio, researchers can determine how the dopants influence the selectivity towards desired products like ethylene.
