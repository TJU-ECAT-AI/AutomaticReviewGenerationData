Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on the comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it mentions that density functional theory (DFT) and in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) investigations were utilized to study gold/ceria-zirconia low-temperature water gas shift catalysts. These techniques aimed to identify the nature of the active form of gold, addressing the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance.

答案：文献中没有提供验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的具体表征方法和分析手段。然而，它提到使用密度泛函理论（DFT）和原位X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）研究了低温水煤气变换用金/铈-锆催化剂。这些技术旨在确定活性形式的金的性质，以解决确定掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间明确关系的挑战。
