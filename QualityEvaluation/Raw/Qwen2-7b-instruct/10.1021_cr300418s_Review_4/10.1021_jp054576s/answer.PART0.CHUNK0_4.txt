The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches that are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include Density Functional Theory (DFT) and In Situ EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) investigation. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by identifying the nature of the active form of gold, which is critical for understanding the mechanism behind improved catalytic activity.
