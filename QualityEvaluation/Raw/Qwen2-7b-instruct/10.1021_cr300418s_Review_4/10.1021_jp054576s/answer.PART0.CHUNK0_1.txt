The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include Density Functional Theory (DFT) and In Situ EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure). These methods help in understanding the nature of the active form of gold in the catalyst system, which addresses the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. By using these techniques, researchers can rule out alternative explanations and confirm the role of dopants in improving the catalyst's performance.
