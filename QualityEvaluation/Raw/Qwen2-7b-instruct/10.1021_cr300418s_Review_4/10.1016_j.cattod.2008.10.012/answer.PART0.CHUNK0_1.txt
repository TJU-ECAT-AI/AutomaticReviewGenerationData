[1] "HS-LEIS is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample."
[2] "Based on the principles of classical mechanics, HS-LEIS determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface."
[3] "Examples with pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported metal oxide catalyst samples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity, the ease of quantification, the availability of information about layers immediately beneath the surface (relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst) as well as the potential for High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to the short analysis times."
[4] "Good LEIS spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface."
[5] "As long as the experimental conditions are chosen with care (Ei cannot be too low, u is large and no grazing angles are used), for a given primary ion, primary ion energy and scattering surface atom, the HS-LEIS peak is proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS). HS-LEIS allows for the determination of the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface, providing insights into the outermost atomic layer of a sample. This technique offers sensitivity, ease of quantification, and information about layers beneath the surface, which is particularly useful for understanding the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst. HS-LEIS is capable of analyzing various types of samples, including pure oxides, mixed oxides, and supported metal oxide catalysts, demonstrating its versatility. Additionally, HS-LEIS enables High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to its short analysis times. Furthermore, HS-LEIS can obtain good spectra while minimizing sputtering damage to the sample surface, with less than 0.5% of a monolayer being sputtered during the analysis. The method also allows for straightforward quantification, as the HS-LEIS peak is proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms, provided that certain experimental conditions are met.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括高灵敏度低能离子散射（HS-LEIS）。HS-LEIS通过测量从表面散射的离子的能量来确定表面原子的质量，从而提供样品最外层原子层的信息。该技术提供了敏感性、量化简便性和对表面下层信息的获取，这特别适用于理解催化剂表面活性催化成分的分散情况。HS-LEIS适用于纯氧化物、混合氧化物和支持金属氧化物催化剂等各种类型样品的分析，展示了其多功能性。此外，HS-LEIS还支持高通量实验（HTE），因为它具有较短的分析时间。此外，HS-LEIS能够在保持良好的谱图的同时最小化对样品表面的蚀刻损伤，只需在分析过程中从表面蚀刻掉小于0.5%的单分子层。该方法也允许简便的定量，因为HS-LEIS峰与散射表面原子的数量成正比，前提是满足一定的实验条件。
