[1] "HS-LEIS is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample. On a heterogeneous catalyst, this outermost atomic layer is the precise location where the catalytic processes take place."
[2] "Examples with pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported metal oxide catalyst samples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity, the ease of quantification, the availability of information about layers immediately beneath the surface (relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst) as well as the potential for High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to the short analysis times."
[3] "Quantification is straightforward. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS). HS-LEIS allows for the precise measurement of the outermost atomic layer, which is the site of catalytic processes. This technique offers sensitivity, ease of quantification, and information about layers beneath the surface, which is relevant for assessing the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, HS-LEIS facilitates High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to its short analysis times. Quantification is also straightforward, enabling the expression of surface fractions of dopants as peak areas relative to pure element peaks.

对于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功引入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括高敏感性低能量离子散射（HS-LEIS）。HS-LEIS允许精确测量外层原子层，这是催化过程发生的地方。该技术提供敏感度、量化简便性和关于表面下层的信息，这与评估催化剂表面活性催化成分的分散有关。此外，HS-LEIS促进了高通量实验（HTE），因为其分析时间短。量化也非常直接，可以将表面掺杂元素的比例表示为相对于纯元素峰的峰面积。
