[1] "HS-LEIS is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample. On a heterogeneous catalyst, this outermost atomic layer is the precise location where the catalytic processes take place."
[2] "Examples with pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported metal oxide catalyst samples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity, the ease of quantification, the availability of information about layers immediately beneath the surface (relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst) as well as the potential for High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to the short analysis times."
[3] "Quantification is straightforward. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms."
[4] "Another typical procedure makes use of a calibration plot. The area of one peak is plotted as a function of the area of another peak for a number of samples."

Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS). HS-LEIS allows for the examination of the outermost atomic layer, providing insights into the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the catalyst surface. This technique offers sensitivity, ease of quantification, and the ability to gather information about layers beneath the surface. Additionally, HS-LEIS enables High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to its short analysis times. Quantification of dopants and their distribution can be achieved through straightforward background subtraction, peak integration, and calibration plots, which correlate the area of one peak with another for multiple samples.

验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括高灵敏度低能离子散射（HS-LEIS）。HS-LEIS允许对最外层原子层进行检查，提供关于催化剂表面活性催化成分分散的信息。该技术提供了敏感性、量化简便性和收集表面下层信息的能力。此外，HS-LEIS还支持高通量实验（HTE），因为其分析时间短。通过直接背景减除、峰值积分和校准图，可以实现掺杂剂及其分布的定量，其中一种峰值区域与另一种峰值区域之间存在多个样本的函数关系。
