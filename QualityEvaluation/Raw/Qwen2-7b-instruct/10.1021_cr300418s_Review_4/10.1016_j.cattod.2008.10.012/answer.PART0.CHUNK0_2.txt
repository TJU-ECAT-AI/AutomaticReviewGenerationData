[1] "High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample."
[2] "On a heterogeneous catalyst, this outermost atomic layer is the precise location where the catalytic processes take place."
[3] "Based on the principles of classical mechanics, HS-LEIS determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface."
[4] "Examples with pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported metal oxide catalyst samples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity, the ease of quantification, the availability of information about layers immediately beneath the surface (relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst) as well as the potential for High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) due to the short analysis times."
[5] "As long as the experimental conditions are chosen with care (Ei cannot be too low, u is large and no grazing angles are used), for a given primary ion, primary ion energy and scattering surface atom, the HS-LEIS peak is proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms [3]."
[6] "This means that quantification is straightforward. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts involve the use of High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS). HS-LEIS allows for the determination of the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions scattered from the surface, providing sensitivity, ease of quantification, and information about layers beneath the surface. The technique is particularly useful for identifying the dispersion of active catalytic components on the surface of the catalyst, facilitating the assessment of dopant incorporation and distribution. Additionally, HS-LEIS enables the calculation of surface fractions through straightforward quantification, which is essential for establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. This method helps in ruling out alternative explanations by providing precise information on the surface composition and structure.

对于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法，高灵敏度低能离子散射（HS-LEIS）起着至关重要的作用。HS-LEIS通过测量从表面散射的离子的能量来确定表面原子的质量，提供敏感性、易于定量以及关于表面下方层的信息。该技术特别适用于识别催化剂表面上活性催化成分的分散情况，有助于评估掺杂剂的掺入和分布。此外，HS-LEIS允许通过简单的量化步骤计算表面元素的比例，这对于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间明确关系至关重要。这种方法有助于排除其他解释，通过提供对表面组成和结构的精确信息。
