[1] "HS-LEIS is a sensitive analysis technique for the outermost atomic layer of a sample. On a heterogeneous catalyst, this outermost atomic layer is the precise location where the catalytic processes take place."
[2] "Quantification is straightforward. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms."
[3] "Good LEIS spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface."
[4] "The HS-LEIS detection of exposed TiOx sites from the underlying TiO2 support also reflects the generally lower surface density of supported metal oxide phases at monolayer coverage relative to that found in their corresponding unsupported pure oxides."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts involve utilizing High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) to analyze the outermost atomic layer of the catalyst. This technique allows for direct observation of the catalytic processes taking place precisely at the surface. Quantification through HS-LEIS is straightforward, involving background subtraction, peak integration, and the proportionality of peak areas to the surface fraction of atoms. This method enables precise measurement of dopant presence, structural changes, and their impact on catalytic performance, ensuring that observed enhancements are directly attributed to the dopants rather than alternative factors. Additionally, HS-LEIS can detect subtle changes in surface density, such as those in supported metal oxide phases compared to their unsupported counterparts, providing insights into the effectiveness of dopants in modifying the catalyst's structure and enhancing its performance.
