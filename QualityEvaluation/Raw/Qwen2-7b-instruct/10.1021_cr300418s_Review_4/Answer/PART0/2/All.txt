Notably, the starting temperature for oxygen exchange is slightly greater than the temperature at which oxidative dehydrogenation takes place on Ni MeO oxides. A direct correlation exists between the surface rate of 16O exchange in TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in ODH activity tests, demonstrating that the monitored oxygen species actively participate in the ethane activation and conversion process. Moreover, there is a clear inverse relationship between the capacity of the catalyst to accommodate non-stoichiometric oxygen and its ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene, with higher dopant valence correlating to enhanced selectivity.", "Chinese": "将掺杂剂引入NiO结构，类似于O2-TPD实验，既改变了交换氧物种的数量，也影响了其移动性。混合氧化物的氧脱附谱图与纯NiO相比表现出显著变化。每克催化剂脱附的氧量以毫克为单位，在表1中列出。值得注意的是，氧交换的起始温度略高于Ni MeO氧化物上发生氧化脱氢的温度。在TPIE实验中表面交换率与ODH活性测试中乙烷消耗率之间的直接关系证明了监测到的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化过程中的积极参与作用。此外，催化剂容纳非化学计量氧的能力与其选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的反比关系，高掺杂剂电荷值与提高选择性相关。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004"},
