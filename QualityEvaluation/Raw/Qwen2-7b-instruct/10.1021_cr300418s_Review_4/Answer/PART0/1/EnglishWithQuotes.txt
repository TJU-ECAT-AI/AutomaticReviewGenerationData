{"Quotes": "\"[1] The dopants easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. This substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry.\n          [2] Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor.\n          [3] The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion.\n          [4] The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above.\"", "English": "The dopants easily integrate into the NiO lattice and create solid solutions, irrespective of the valence of the foreign element and with a comparable ionic radius to Ni2+. The substitution process, triggered upon introducing the foreign elements, is accountable for the variation in nickel oxides' non-stoichiometry. Results from temperature-programmed oxygen desorption and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange methods align with the principle of controlled valence, affirming that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) boosts the non-stoichiometric oxygen content in NiO, whereas higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) function as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration and the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor. A linear connection exists between the rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests, confirming the active involvement of monitored oxygen species in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism. The evident inverse relationship between the non-stoichiometric oxygen capacity of the catalysts and their ability to selectively convert ethane substrates to ethylene, with these values decreasing as the valence of the foreign cation increases, strongly supports the aforementioned findings.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004"},
