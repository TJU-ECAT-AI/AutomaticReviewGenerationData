          "[1] The dopants easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. This substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry.
          [2] Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor.
          [3] The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion.
          [4] The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

          The dopants easily integrate into the NiO lattice and create solid solutions, irrespective of the valence of the foreign element and with a comparable ionic radius to Ni2+. The substitution process, triggered upon introducing the foreign elements, is accountable for the variation in nickel oxides' non-stoichiometry. Results from temperature-programmed oxygen desorption and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange methods align with the principle of controlled valence, affirming that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) boosts the non-stoichiometric oxygen content in NiO, whereas higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) function as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration and the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor. A linear connection exists between the rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests, confirming the active involvement of monitored oxygen species in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism. The evident inverse relationship between the non-stoichiometric oxygen capacity of the catalysts and their ability to selectively convert ethane substrates to ethylene, with these values decreasing as the valence of the foreign cation increases, strongly supports the aforementioned findings.

          外来元素轻松地融入NiO晶格中形成固溶体，无论外来元素的电荷值和Ni2+离子半径相近。引入外来元素引发的替换过程负责镍氧化物非等比性的变化。温度程序化氧脱附和温度程序化同位素氧交换方法的结果与控制电荷原理一致，确认了向NiO引入低于或等于Ni的电荷值（Li1+, Mg2+）的离子能增加非等比氧含量，而较高电荷值的离子（Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+）作为电子供体，减少正p+空穴浓度，从而降低NiO受体的亲电O原子。TPIE实验中监测到的16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中乙烷消耗速率之间的线性关系证实了监测到的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化机制中的积极参与作用。催化剂容纳的非等比氧能力与其选择性将乙烷底物转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的反比关系，随着外来阳离子电荷值的增加，这两个值呈下降趋势，这有力地支持了上述发现。

          "[1] The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species.
          [2] Indeed, the oxy- gen desorption profiles change dramatically in the mixed oxides compared to pure NiO.
          [3] The amount of oxygen desorbed, expressed in mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1.
          [4] It should be commented here that the onset temperature for the oxygen exchange is slightly higher than the temperature where oxidative dehydrogenation occurs on the Ni MeO oxides.
          [5] The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion.
          [6] There is a clear inverse relationship between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen the catalyst accommodates and its ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene, with higher dopant valence leading to increased selectivity."

          The introduction of dopants into the NiO structure alters, similar to the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species. The oxy- gen desorption profiles in mixed oxides exhibit dramatic changes compared to pure NiO. The amount of desorbed oxygen, quantified in milligrams per gram of catalyst, is listed in Table 1. Notably, the starting temperature for oxygen exchange is slightly greater than the temperature at which oxidative dehydrogenation takes place on Ni MeO oxides. A direct correlation exists between the surface rate of 16O exchange in TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in ODH activity tests, demonstrating that the monitored oxygen species actively participate in the ethane activation and conversion process. Moreover, there is a clear inverse relationship between the capacity of the catalyst to accommodate non-stoichiometric oxygen and its ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene, with higher dopant valence correlating to enhanced selectivity.

          将掺杂剂引入NiO结构，类似于O2-TPD实验，既改变了交换氧物种的数量，也影响了其移动性。混合氧化物的氧脱附谱图与纯NiO相比表现出显著变化。每克催化剂脱附的氧量以毫克为单位，在表1中列出。值得注意的是，氧交换的起始温度略高于Ni MeO氧化物上发生氧化脱氢的温度。在TPIE实验中表面交换率与ODH活性测试中乙烷消耗率之间的直接关系证明了监测到的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化过程中的积极参与作用。此外，催化剂容纳非化学计量氧的能力与其选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的反比关系，高掺杂剂电荷值与提高选择性相关。
