Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches, such as electron microscopy (EM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy, are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the dopant incorporation, crystal structure, chemical composition, and vibrational modes of the materials.

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include BET surface area measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing insights into the surface composition, structure, and activity of the catalysts.

1. BET surface area measurements showed a range from 108 to 156 m2/g, with a relatively uniform average pore volume across all catalysts.
2. XPS analysis indicated an increasing trend in area with Zr loading, although the relationship was not linear.
3. The surface concentrations of Zr and Ce were found to be in agreement with EXAFS data, providing evidence for solid solution formation between the elements.
4. TPR profiles revealed that the bulk reduction step was aided by Zr addition, leading to a shift in the peak maximum to lower temperatures.
5. EXAFS spectra displayed a peak at 3.63-3.75 Å for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample, suggesting a solid mixing between Ce and Zr.
6. DRIFTS spectra illustrated that CO adsorption results in reactions with bridging OH groups to create surface formate bands.
7. The formate CH stretching region exhibited a notable increase with Zr addition, indicating a higher concentration of formates on the zirconia-rich surface.
8. The formate decomposition rate was accelerated by Zr addition, reaching its peak at approximately 50% Zr loading.
