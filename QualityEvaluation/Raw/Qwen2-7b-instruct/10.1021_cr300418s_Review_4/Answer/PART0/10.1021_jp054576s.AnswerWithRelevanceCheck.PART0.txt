          Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and In Situ EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These techniques help in understanding the nature of the active form of gold in the catalyst system, addressing the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. By using these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations and confirm the role of dopants in improving the catalyst's performance.
