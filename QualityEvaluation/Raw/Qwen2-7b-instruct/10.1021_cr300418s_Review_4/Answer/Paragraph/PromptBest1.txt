            For instance, studies have shown that dopants easily integrate into the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. The substitution process occurring upon the introduction of foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides' non-stoichiometry. Techniques like temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence cations act as electron donors, influencing the catalyst's performance.

            Furthermore, the use of comprehensive characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy, alongside analytical approaches like DFT and In Situ EXAFS, provides insights into the structural modifications and enhanced catalytic performance.
