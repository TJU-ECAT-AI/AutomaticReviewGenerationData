[1] "A detailed characterization of the NiCe mixed oxides has been performed by XRD, EXAFS, DFT, and Raman studies."
[2] "XRD shows that the solubility limit of a Ce  Ni exchange in ceria is in the range of 1012%."
[3] "EXAFS analysis shows a strongly distorted first shell for NiO contributions and NiNi correlations with a diminishing intensity as compared with bulk NiO."
[4] "In the sample Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y, the majority of the Ni is forming a solid solution, whereas in a sample with a higher Ni content (20%), there is also present a segregated phase of NiO."
[5] "Results of in situ TR-XRD indicate that the strong Ce  O  Ni interactions present in the mixed-metal oxide delay the reduction of the nickel cations by hydrogen up to temperatures above 400 C."
[6] "Finally, the Ce1x NixO2y systems were tested as catalysts for the WGS reaction."

Comprehensive characterization methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), density functional theory (DFT), and Raman spectroscopy are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These techniques address the challenges by elucidating the structural changes, identifying the presence and nature of dopants, and understanding their interactions within the matrix. XRD helps determine the solubility limit and phase purity, while EXAFS provides insights into local coordination environments. DFT calculations predict lattice parameters and charge distributions, offering theoretical support for experimental observations. Raman spectroscopy quantifies the size of domains and confining effects. In situ techniques like TR-XRD track dynamic processes during reaction, revealing the evolution of phases and interactions. These methods collectively establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance, while ruling out alternative explanations through comparative analysis.
