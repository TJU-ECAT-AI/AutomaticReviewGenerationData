1. The XRD study indicates that the solubility limit for a Ce Ni exchange in ceria is approximately 10-12%.
2. The hydrogen reduction process in Ce1x NixO2y mixed-metal oxides involves the reduction of Ce4+ species to Ce3+, alongside Ni0 formation.
3. The strong interactions between Ce, O, and Ni in the mixed-metal oxide lead to a delayed hydrogen reduction process, reaching temperatures above 400 C.
4. The catalysts demonstrated significant hydrogen production at 300 C during the water gas shift reaction.
5. In situ DRIFT studies revealed the formation of formates, key intermediates in the water gas shift reaction, along with carbonates and methane species.
