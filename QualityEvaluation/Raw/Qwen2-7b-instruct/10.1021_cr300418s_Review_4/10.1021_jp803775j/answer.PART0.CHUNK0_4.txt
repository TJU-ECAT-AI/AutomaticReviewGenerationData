[1] "Electrodeposition of α-Fe2O3 doped with Mo or Cr as photoanodes for photocatalytic water splitting."
[2] "Critical for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts, various characterization methods and analytical approaches are employed. These encompass electron microscopy (EM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy."
[3] "These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the dopant incorporation, crystal structure, chemical composition, and vibrational modes of the materials."
[4] "Alternative explanations are ruled out through comprehensive analysis, ensuring the observed enhancements in catalytic activity are directly attributed to the dopants."
