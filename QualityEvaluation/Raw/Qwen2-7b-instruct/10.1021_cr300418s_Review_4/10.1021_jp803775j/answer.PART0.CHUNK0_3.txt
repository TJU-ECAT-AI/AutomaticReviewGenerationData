Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy, are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These techniques provide insights into the structure of the materials, the presence and distribution of dopants, and any structural changes that occur due to doping. By analyzing these aspects, researchers can establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. This helps in understanding the mechanisms behind improved performance and rules out alternative explanations that might affect the results.
