[1] "Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ containing oxide contaminations in a wide temperature window. Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance. The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[2] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[3] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[4] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is probably due to segregation of the impurities to the surface. However, it cannot be ruled out that enhanced segregation of Y2O3 contributes to this effect."
[5] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
</quotes>

Answer: 
1. The characterization methods crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts involve X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for bulk composition analysis, and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) for surface composition analysis. These techniques help establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing data on the dopant concentration and distribution across the catalyst's surface and bulk, thus allowing researchers to rule out alternative explanations.

Answer: 
2. The surface composition of YSZ rather than its bulk composition determines its catalytic performance in the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. This is evident from the consistent 12-2 mol% Y2O3 content observed on the surface of calcined YSZ regardless of the Y2O3 concentration in the bulk or the calcination temperature, indicating the successful incorporation and uniform distribution of Y2O3.

Answer: 
3. Increasing the calcination temperature leads to the creation of more active sites per unit area on the surface of YSZ. This is because higher temperatures facilitate the modification of the surface structure, enhancing the catalytic activity.

Answer: 
4. The collapse in activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides upon sintering is likely due to the segregation of these impurities to the surface. While the effect could be attributed to enhanced segregation of Y2O3, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis conclusively.

Answer: 
5. Concurrently, heterogeneous reactions occur alongside homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950°C during the partial oxidation of methane over YSZ. This coexistence suggests a complex interplay between surface and bulk reactions, contributing to the overall catalytic performance.

1. 验证掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功整合和均匀分布的关键表征方法包括X射线荧光（XRF）进行基体组成分析，以及低能离子散射（LEIS）进行表面组成分析。这些技术通过提供关于掺杂剂在催化剂表面和基体中的浓度和分布的数据，帮助建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间的清晰关系，从而允许研究者排除替代解释。

2. YSZ的表面组成而不是其基体组成决定了甲烷部分氧化合成气的催化性能。这从煅烧后YSZ表面始终含有12-2 mol% Y2O3的现象可以看出，无论基体中Y2O3的浓度或煅烧温度如何，表明Y2O3的成功整合和均匀分布。

3. 提高煅烧温度会导致YSZ单位面积上生成更多活性位点。这是因为高温有助于表面结构的修改，增强催化活性。

4. 烧结导致含地碱氧化物痕迹的YSZ活性下降的原因可能是杂质在表面的聚集。尽管这一效果可能归因于Y2O3增强的聚集，但需要进一步研究来明确这一点。

5. 在YSZ上进行甲烷部分氧化时，温度高于950°C时同时发生表面和内部反应。这种共存表明表面和内部反应之间复杂的相互作用，共同贡献了整体催化性能。
