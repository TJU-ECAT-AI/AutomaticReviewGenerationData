[1] "The catalytic performance of YSZ catalysts is strongly influenced by the surface composition."
[2] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[3] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[4] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[5] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."

1. The surface composition plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of YSZ catalysts. 

2. The outermost surface of calcined YSZ consistently contains 12-2 mol% Y2O3 regardless of the bulk composition and calcination temperature, indicating the importance of surface segregation.

3. Higher calcination temperatures lead to an increase in the number of active sites per unit area.

4. The activity of YSZ catalysts decreases when traces of alkali oxides are present due to sintering, which could be linked to the segregation of these impurities.

5. At temperatures above 950 C, both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions coexist during the catalytic partial oxidation of methane.

1. YSZ催化剂的催化性能主要受表面组成的影响。

2. 烧结后的YSZ外层表面始终含有12-2摩尔%的Y2O3，无论基体组成和烧结温度如何，这表明表面分离的重要性。

3. 提高烧结温度可以增加每平方米单位面积内的活性位点数量。

4.YSZ催化剂在含有微量碱性氧化物的情况下，由于烧结导致活性下降，这可能与这些杂质的分离有关。

5. 在950°C以上的温度下，甲烷部分氧化过程中同时存在异相反应和均相反应。
