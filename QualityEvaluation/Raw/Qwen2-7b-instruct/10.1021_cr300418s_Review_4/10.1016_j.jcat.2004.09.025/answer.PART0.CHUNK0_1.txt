[1] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[2] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[4] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is probably due to segregation of the impurities to the surface."
[5] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
[6] "Nevertheless, thermody- namic equilibrium is not even approached, even at very high temperatures, because of insufficient reforming activity."

1. Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 can generate active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
2. The catalytic performance of YSZ is primarily determined by the composition of its outermost surface.
3. The outermost surface of calcined YSZ maintains a consistent composition of 12 ± 2 mol% Y2O3, regardless of bulk composition or calcination temperature.
4. Sintering of YSZ containing alkali oxide contaminants can diminish its activity due to the segregation of these impurities to the surface.
5. At temperatures above 950°C, both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions coexist during the partial oxidation of methane over YSZ.
6. Even at high temperatures, thermodynamic equilibrium is not achieved due to the limited reforming activity of YSZ.

1.Y2O3掺杂到ZrO2中可以产生活性位点，从而提高催化性能。
2.YSZ的催化性能主要由其外表面的组成决定。
3.在煅烧后的YSZ表面上，无论基体组成或煅烧温度如何，表面始终含有12±2 mol%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分离导致的。
4.YSZ中含有碱土氧化物杂质时，通过热处理会使活性下降，原因可能是这些杂质被分到了表面。
5.在950°C以上的温度下，甲烷的部分氧化过程中，YSZ上同时存在异相反应和均相反应。
6.即使在高温下，也未能达到热力学平衡，原因是YSZ的重整活性不足。
