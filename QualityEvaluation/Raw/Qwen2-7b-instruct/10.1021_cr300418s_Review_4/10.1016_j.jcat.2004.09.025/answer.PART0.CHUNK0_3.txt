[1] "Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ containing oxide contaminations in a wide temperature window."
[2] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[4] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[5] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[6] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[7] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
[8] "The catalytic performance of YSZ can be improved by a rise in the reaction temperature to 950 C and above, due to dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions."
[9] "Nevertheless, thermodynamic equilibrium is not even approached, even at very high temperatures, because of insufficient reforming activity."

1. The study investigated the catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas across a range of temperatures, encompassing ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ with oxide contaminants.
2. Incorporating Y2O3 into ZrO2 produces active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
3. The catalyst's performance is primarily dictated by the composition of its outermost surface.
4. The surface of calcined YSZ maintains a constant 12 ± 2 mol% Y2O3 concentration, irrespective of the bulk composition and calcination temperature, assuming the catalyst isn't contaminated.
5. Higher temperatures increase the number of active sites per square meter.
6. Sintering diminishes the catalytic activity of YSZ with small traces of alkali oxides.
7. At temperatures above 950 C, CPOM over YSZ involves concurrent heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.
8. Boosting the reaction temperature to 950 C and above can improve YSZ's catalytic performance due to dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions.
9. Thermodynamic equilibrium is unattainable at high temperatures because of inadequate reforming activity.

1. 研究了在宽温度范围内，对甲烷部分氧化合成气的催化作用，涉及ZrO2、纯YSZ和含有氧化物污染物的YSZ。
2. 将Y2O3掺入到ZrO2中能生成活性位点，从而提高催化性能。
3. 催化剂的性能主要由其外表面的组成决定。
4. 加热后，YSZ表面维持着12±2摩尔%的Y2O3浓度，这与基体成分和煅烧温度无关，前提是催化剂不受污染。
5. 更高的温度可以增加每平方米上的活性位点数量。
6. 对于含少量碱金属氧化物的YSZ，烧结会导致其催化活性下降。
7. 在950°C以上的温度下，YSZ上进行的CPOM同时伴随着异相反应和均相反应。
8. 将反应温度提升至950°C及以上，通过干重整、蒸汽重整和逆水煤气变换反应，可以改善YSZ的催化性能。
9. 即使在高温下，也难以达到热力学平衡，因为重整活性不足。
