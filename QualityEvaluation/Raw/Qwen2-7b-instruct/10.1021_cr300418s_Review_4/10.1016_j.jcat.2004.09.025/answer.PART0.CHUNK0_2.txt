[1] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[2] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[4] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[5] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."

1. Incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts can be verified through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) techniques. These methods help establish a clear link between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while excluding alternative explanations.
2. The success of dopants in improving catalytic performance relies on their ability to create active sites, which is evidenced by the text.
3. The catalytic performance of YSZ is determined by the composition of its outermost surface, which is independent of the bulk composition and calcination temperature, as long as the catalyst is not contaminated.
4. Sintering causes a decline in the activity of YSZ catalysts that contain traces of alkali oxides, potentially due to enhanced segregation of impurities to the surface.
5. At temperatures above 950°C, partial oxidation of methane over YSZ involves concurrent heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.

1. 验证掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的整合和均匀分布可以通过X射线荧光（XRF）和低能离子散射（LEIS）技术进行。这些方法有助于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间的明确联系，并排除其他可能的解释。
2. YSZ的催化性能通过其表面活性位点的形成得到改善，这是文本中提到的关键。
3. YSZ的催化性能由其外层表面的组成决定，这一组成不受基体组成和煅烧温度的影响，只要催化剂没有被污染，表面总是包含12±2摩尔%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分离造成的。
4. 当含有地碱氧化物的YSZ在高温下发生烧结时，会导致催化活性下降，这可能是由于杂质在表面的富集造成的。
5. 在950°C以上的温度下，甲烷的部分氧化在YSZ上同时涉及异相反应和均相反应。
