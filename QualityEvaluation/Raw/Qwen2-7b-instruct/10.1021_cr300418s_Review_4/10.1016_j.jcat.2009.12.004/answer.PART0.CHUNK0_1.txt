[1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."
[2] "Indeed, the oxy- gen desorption profiles change dramatically in the mixed oxides compared to pure NiO."
[3] "The amount of oxygen desorbed, expressed in mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1."
[4] "It should be commented here that the onset temperature for the oxygen exchange is slightly higher than the temperature where oxidative dehydrogenation occurs on the Ni MeO oxides."
[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
[6] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

1. The incorporation and distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts are verified through techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE). These methods help establish a clear connection between dopant presence, structural modifications, enhanced catalytic performance, and rule out alternative explanations by examining changes in oxygen species, their quantity, mobility, and participation in the reaction mechanism.
