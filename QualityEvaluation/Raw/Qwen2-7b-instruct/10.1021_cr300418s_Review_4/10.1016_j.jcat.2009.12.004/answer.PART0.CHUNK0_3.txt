2.1. "The introduction of other than Nb metals also significantly modifies the reduction profiles, as shown in Fig 4. While Nb was found to ease the reduction of NiONi bonds, shifting the reduction temperature at lower values, all other metals seem to inhibit the reduction process compared to pure NiO."
2.2. "Indeed, the oxy- gen desorption profiles change dramatically in the mixed oxides compared to pure NiO. The incorporation of Li1+ in NiO results in a second oxygen species desorbed at significantly lower temperature (380 C compared to 700 C for pure NiO), indicating the formation of a second very active form of oxygen."
2.3. "As the valence of the doping metals increases from +3 to +5, a progressive reduction in the amount of desorbed oxygen is recorded, while a shift in the temperature of desorption is also observed."
2.4. "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
2.5. "Overall, the oxygen TPD-O2 experiments clearly support and confirm the notion that the doping metals insert the NiO lattice and successfully form NiMeO solid solutions. The quantitative results are consistent with the principle of controlled valence [32], since the dissolution of lower than nickel valence cations (Li1+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

1. The reduction profiles of the mixed NiMeO oxides were significantly altered by the presence of dopants other than Nb. While Nb facilitated the reduction of NiONi bonds at lower temperatures, other dopants inhibited the reduction process compared to pure NiO.

2. Incorporating Li1+ in NiO led to the formation of a second oxygen species that desorbed at a much lower temperature (380°C) compared to pure NiO (700°C), indicating a more active oxygen species.

3. As the valence of the dopants increased from +3 to +5, there was a decrease in the amount of desorbed oxygen and a shift in the temperature of desorption across the mixed NiMeO oxides.

4. A direct correlation was found between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests, affirming that the monitored oxygen species actively participated in the ethane activation and conversion process.

5. The oxygen TPD-O2 experiments provided clear evidence that the dopants successfully integrated into the NiO lattice to form NiMeO solid solutions. Quantitative outcomes aligned with the principle of controlled valence, suggesting that lower valence dopants (Li1+) increased non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence dopants (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) acted as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ holes and electrophilic oxygen radicals in NiO.

1. 除了Nb之外的掺杂元素显著改变了还原图谱。Nb促进了NiONi键的还原，使其温度降低，而其他掺杂元素抑制了与纯NiO相比的还原过程。

2. 在NiO中加入Li1+导致形成一个在380°C（远低于纯NiO的700°C）脱附的第二氧物种，这表明存在更活跃的氧物种。

3. 随着掺杂金属电荷从+3增加到+5，混合NiMeO氧化物中的脱附氧的量和脱附温度发生了减少和位移。

4. 在TPIE实验中监测的16O交换速率和ODH活性测试中乙烯消耗的表面速率之间建立了直接联系，确认了监测到的氧物种在乙烷激活和转化过程中的积极参与。

5. 氧TDP-O2实验清楚地证明了掺杂元素成功地整合到了NiO晶格中形成了NiMeO固溶体。定量结果与控制电荷原则一致，表明低电荷掺杂剂（Li1+）增加了NiO中的非化学计量氧，而高电荷掺杂剂（Al3+、Ga3+、Ti4+、Nb5+、Ta5+）作为电子供体作用，减少了正p+空穴和NiO受体的亲电氧自由基。
