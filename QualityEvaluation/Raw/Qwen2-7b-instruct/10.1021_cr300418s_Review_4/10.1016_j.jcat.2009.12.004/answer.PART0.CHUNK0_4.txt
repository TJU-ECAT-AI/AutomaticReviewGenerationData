The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. Evaporation method for preparing a series of mixed NiMeO oxides with a predetermined atomic ratio of Me/Ni.
2. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments to study the reduction characteristics of the catalysts, providing insights into the structural changes during reduction.
3. Oxygen desorption properties through O2-TPD measurements, which help quantify the amount of oxygen in the catalyst and identify the type of oxygen species present.
4. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experiments (TPIE) to further investigate the nature and density of oxygen species available for activation on the catalyst surfaces.

These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations. By systematically characterizing the catalysts, researchers can correlate the doping effects on the material's structure and functionality, leading to optimized catalyst design for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括：

1. 通过蒸发法准备一系列具有预定Me/Ni原子比的混合NiMeO氧化物。
2. 温度程序化还原（TPR）实验，研究催化剂的还原特性，提供结构变化期间的信息。
3. 通过O2-TPD测量研究氧气脱附性质，帮助量化催化剂中的氧含量并识别存在的氧物种类型。
4. 温度程序化同位素氧交换实验（TPIE），进一步调查催化剂表面可激活的氧物种的性质和密度。

这些技术共同解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，并排除了替代解释。通过系统表征催化剂，研究人员可以将掺杂效果与材料结构和功能相关联，从而实现优化催化剂设计以进行乙烷氧化性脱氢。
