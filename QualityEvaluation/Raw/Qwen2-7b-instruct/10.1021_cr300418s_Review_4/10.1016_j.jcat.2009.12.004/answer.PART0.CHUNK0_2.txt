2.1. "The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temperature."
2.2. "The introduction of other than Nb metals also significantly modifies the reduction profiles, as shown in Fig 4. While Nb was found to ease the reduction of NiONi bonds, shifting the reduction temperature at lower values, all other metals seem to inhibit the reduction process compared to pure NiO."
2.3. "The amount of oxygen desorption, expressed in mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1."
2.4. "The profiles of oxygen desorption with increasing temperature are compiled in Fig. 5 for all NiMeO oxides, plus that of reference NiO and NiNbO."
2.5. "The oxygen balance in all experiments amounted to 95-98% and hence, the amount of oxygen consumed for any irreversible adsorption or desorption was not significant."
2.6. "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

1. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were measured by tracking the hydrogen signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer while incrementally increasing temperature.
2. The introduction of various metals except Nb altered the reduction profiles. Nb facilitated the reduction of NiONi bonds, lowering the reduction temperature, whereas other metals inhibited the reduction process compared to pure NiO.
3. The amount of desorbed oxygen was quantified in milligrams per gram of catalyst and recorded in Table 1.
4. The oxygen desorption profiles for all NiMeO catalysts were plotted in Figure 5, alongside NiO and NiNbO reference materials.
5. The oxygen balance in all experiments was 95-98%, indicating insignificant oxygen consumption for irreversible adsorption or desorption.
6. The correlation between the surface rate of 16O exchange during TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption during activity tests proved that the observed oxygen species actively participated in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism.

1. 温度程序化还原（TPR）图谱通过跟踪氢信号并使用四极质谱仪在温度线性增加时测量。
2. 除了Nb之外，引入的各种金属改变了还原图谱。Nb促进了NiONi键的还原，降低了还原温度，而其他金属抑制了与纯NiO相比的还原过程。
3. 每克催化剂释放的氧量以毫克为单位，并记录在表1中。
4. 所有NiMeO催化剂的氧脱附曲线在图5中被绘制出来，同时包含NiO和NiNbO参考材料。
5. 实验中的氧平衡为95-98%，表明不可逆吸附或脱附过程中消耗的氧量不显著。
6. 16O交换速率的表面率在TPIE实验期间与活性测试中乙烷消耗的表面率之间的线性关系证明了监测到的氧物种在乙烷激活和转换机制中的积极参与作用。
