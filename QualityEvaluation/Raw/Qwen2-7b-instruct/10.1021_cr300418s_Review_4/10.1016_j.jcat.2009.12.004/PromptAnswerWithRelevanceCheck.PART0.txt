[1] "The dopants easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. This substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry."
[2] "Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."
[3] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
[4] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The dopants easily integrate into the NiO lattice and create solid solutions, regardless of the valence of the foreign element and with a comparable ionic radius to Ni2+. The substitution process caused by the introduction of foreign elements appears to be accountable for the rise or fall in the non-stoichiometry of nickel oxides. 

2. The outcomes from the temperature-programmed oxygen desorption and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange methods align with the concept of controlled valence. They definitively affirm that incorporating lower or equal valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) in NiO leads to an increase in non-stoichiometric oxygen, whereas higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) serve as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ holes and thus the electrophilic O radicals in NiO.

3. A direct correlation has been established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests. This confirms that the monitored oxygen species actively participate in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism.

4. There is a clear connection between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen in the catalysts and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene, with these two metrics following an inverse trend as the valence of the dopant increases.

1. 外来元素轻松地融入NiO晶格中形成固溶体，无论外来元素的电荷值和Ni2+离子半径相近。引入外来元素导致的NiO晶体替代过程似乎负责镍氧化物非等比性的增加或减少。

2. 温度程序化氧脱附和温度程序化同位素氧交换方法的结果与控制电荷原理一致。它们明确证实了向NiO引入低于或等于Ni的电荷值（Li1+, Mg2+）的离子会增加非等比氧含量，而较高电荷值的离子（Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+）作为电子供体，减少了正p+空穴浓度，从而降低NiO接受者的亲电O原子。

3. 在TPIE实验中监测到的16O交换速率与ODH活性测试中表面消耗乙烷速率之间建立了直接联系。这证实了监测到的氧物种在乙烷活化和转换机制中的积极作用。

4. 非等比氧含量在催化剂中的存在与选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在清晰的关联，随着掺杂剂电荷值的增加，这两个指标呈现反向趋势。

2.2. "Indeed, the oxy- gen desorption profiles change dramatically in the mixed oxides compared to pure NiO. The incorporation of Li1+ in NiO results in a second oxygen species desorbed at significantly lower temperature (380 C compared to 700 C for pure NiO), indicating the formation of a second very active form of oxygen."
2.3. "As the valence of the doping metals increases from +3 to +5, a progressive reduction in the amount of desorbed oxygen is recorded, while a shift in the temperature of desorption is also observed."
2.4. "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
2.5. "Overall, the oxygen TPD-O2 experiments clearly support and confirm the notion that the doping metals insert the NiO lattice and successfully form NiMeO solid solutions. The quantitative results are consistent with the principle of controlled valence [32], since the dissolution of lower than nickel valence cations (Li1+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

1. The reduction profiles of the mixed NiMeO oxides were significantly altered by the presence of dopants other than Nb. While Nb facilitated the reduction of NiONi bonds at lower temperatures, other dopants inhibited the reduction process compared to pure NiO.

2. Incorporating Li1+ in NiO led to the formation of a second oxygen species that desorbed at a much lower temperature (380°C) compared to pure NiO (700°C), indicating a more active oxygen species.

3. As the valence of the dopants increased from +3 to +5, there was a decrease in the amount of desorbed oxygen and a shift in the temperature of desorption across the mixed NiMeO oxides.

4. A direct correlation was found between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests, affirming that the monitored oxygen species actively participated in the ethane activation and conversion process.

5. The oxygen TPD-O2 experiments provided clear evidence that the dopants successfully integrated into the NiO lattice to form NiMeO solid solutions. Quantitative outcomes aligned with the principle of controlled valence, suggesting that lower valence dopants (Li1+) increased non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence dopants (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) acted as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ holes and electrophilic oxygen radicals in NiO.

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. Evaporation method for preparing a series of mixed NiMeO oxides with a predetermined atomic ratio of Me/Ni.
2. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments to study the reduction characteristics of the catalysts, providing insights into the structural changes during reduction.
