1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). These techniques address the challenges by providing spatially resolved information on dopant presence and structural changes, thus enabling a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural alterations, and enhanced catalytic performance. Additionally, these methods can help rule out alternative explanations by offering detailed insights into the local environment and coordination of dopants within the metal oxide matrix.

2. The white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method is a widely used technique for linking electron energy-loss spectra to the formal oxidation states of transition metal ions. However, it requires careful measurement of the core-loss edge position and has limitations in providing a strict one-to-one correspondence with oxidation states, particularly for iron. This method is subject to biases related to sample thickness and integration window size, which can affect its accuracy.

3. The ELNES fitting method, which relies on accurate peak positions, is generally valid for measuring transition metal oxidation states. This method can be applied to a variety of metal oxide compounds, including those with mixed valences, and can offer more accurate and precise results compared to the white-line ratio method.

[1] "Transition metals (TMs) in oxide materials are known to adopt many different oxidation states, which leads to a wide range of chemical and physical properties of the TM complex oxides."
[2] "Oxidation states can be accurately measured by redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction but these techniques are material dependent and provide information averaged over the whole sample."
[3] "To obtain spatially selective information, several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[4] "In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge."
[5] "Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range, it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state."
[6] "Besides that, the excitation edge energy position of the TM is also correlated to its oxidation state. In general, the excitation edges shift to a higher energy-loss for a higher oxidation state."
[7] "The ELNES of OK, V-L2,3, Mn-L2,3 and Fe-L2,3 edges are shown in Fig. 2 for TM oxides with different oxidation states and for metallic Fe."
[8] "For Mn ions with the same oxidation state, the ELNES looks very similar for different compounds at the available energy resolution."
[9] "The OK edge onset position of V oxides is difficult to observe since it overlaps with the continuum region of the V-L2,3 edge."
[10] "The OK edge onset of Sr2Fe2O5 is much lower than that of the other Fe3 compounds."
[11] "The Mn-L2 peaks from Mn oxides are also relatively more intense for higher oxidation states, indicating a decrease of the L3/L2 white-line ratio."
[12] "The white-line ratio also sensitively depends on the size and position of the integration window due to the subtle differences in the ELNES shape of the different compounds."

[18] "The OK edge onset involves the contribution from all bonds, implying that it reflects the geometry of the metal-oxygen bonding rather than the oxidation state of the TMs."
[19] "The edge onset difference method assumes that the oxygen and TM have the same final state, which in general is not true because the density of states are localized."
[20] "The two-parameter method uses the fact that both the white-line ratio and the L3 edge position depend in some way on the nominal oxidation state."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction. These techniques address the challenges by providing spatially selective information on dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations through detailed analysis of the excitation spectra and oxidation state determination.

2. The white-line ratio method has no strict one-to-one correspondence with the oxidation state of transition metals. It provides information on the detailed shape of the L2,3 excitation edge but is sensitive to sample thickness and the exact measurement procedure, making unambiguous oxidation state determination difficult.

3. The excitation edge energy position of transition metals correlates with their oxidation state. Higher oxidation states lead to higher energy-loss for the excitation edges. This chemical shift is useful for determining oxidation states but requires careful calibration to avoid misinterpretation.

4. The ELNES of the OK, V-L2,3, Mn-L2,3, and Fe-L2,3 edges are shown for TM oxides with different oxidation states. Mn-L2 peaks become more intense with higher oxidation states, indicating a decrease in the L3/L2 white-line ratio. The OK edge onset position is challenging to observe due to overlapping with the V-L2,3 edge.

5. The OK edge onset of Sr2Fe2O5 is lower than that of other Fe3 compounds, suggesting differences in coordination geometry. The L3 edge onset for Mn3O4 overlaps with MnO and MnV2O4, indicating a limitation in estimating the average oxidation state of mixed valence compounds using this method.

6. The white-line ratio method is sensitive to the size and position of the integration window, affecting its reliability. The white-line ratio of Sr2Fe2O5 differs from other Fe3 samples, possibly due to the high spin state of Fe in this compound.

7. The onset energies of the V-, Mn-, and Fe-L3 edges increase with the formal oxidation states of the respective metals. This linear relationship facilitates the estimation of oxidation states through the ELNES fitting method.

8. The onset of Fe3.8 in BaFeO2.9 is similar to Fe3, indicating that the spectrum is a linear combination of Fe3 and Fe4 signals, suggesting non-stoichiometry in this compound.

9. The absolute peak position method provides a more reliable way to quantify oxidation states of V/Mn in their oxides by measuring the energy-loss of excitations, which is closely related to the energy levels of the inner-shell electrons and final states.

10. The edge onset method offers better precision compared to traditional methods, enabling accurate determination of oxidation states by identifying the inflection point of the initial rise at the threshold of the excitation edge.

11. The OK edge onset is related to the geometry of metal-oxygen bonding rather than the oxidation state of the transition metals. This highlights the complexity of interpreting ELNES data in terms of oxidation states.

12. The edge onset difference method assumes that the oxygen and transition metal have the same final state, which is not universally true due to localized density of states. This method works in some cases but faces limitations when applied to mixed valence compounds or materials with distinct electronic properties.

13. The two-parameter method combines the white-line ratio and L3 edge position to estimate the nominal oxidation state, but its effectiveness depends on the validity of the individual methods used.

14. The ELNES fitting method is successfully employed to measure the oxidation states of various transition metals, including V, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Ce, by fitting the experimental spectra to reference spectra of known oxidation states. This method requires accurate peak positions and appropriate reference spectra for successful application.

2. 白线比方法与过渡金属的氧化状态之间没有严格的一一对应关系。它提供了L2,3激发边缘形状的信息，但对样品厚度和测量程序敏感，使得氧化状态的确定变得困难。

3. 过渡金属的激发边缘能级位置与其氧化状态相关。氧化状态越高，激发边缘的能量损失越大。这种化学位移对于确定氧化状态很有用，但需要仔细校准以避免误解。

4. 对TM氧化物不同氧化状态下的OK、V-L2,3、Mn-L2,3和Fe-L2,3边缘的ELNES进行展示。随着氧化状态的增加，Mn-L2峰值变得更强烈，表明L3/L2白线比降低。观察到OK边缘的起始位置难以观察，因为它与V-L2,3边缘重叠。

5. Sr2Fe2O5的OK边缘起始位置低于其他Fe3化合物的起始位置，这可能归因于不同的配位几何结构。Mn3O4的L3边缘起始与MnO和MnV2O4的重叠，指示了混合价化合物中估计平均氧化状态的限制。

6. 随着金属的正式氧化状态的增加，V、Mn和Fe的L3边缘起始呈现出线性关系。这为通过ELNES拟合方法估计氧化状态提供了便利。

7. BaFeO2.9中Fe3.8的起始与Fe3相同，这表明该谱线是Fe3和Fe4信号的线性组合，暗示了此化合物的非等摩尔性。

8. 绝对峰值位置方法通过测量内壳电子和最终状态的能量水平来量化V/Mn在它们的氧化物中的氧化状态，提供了一种更可靠的方法。

9. 边缘起始方法与传统的相比具有更高的精度，通过识别激发边缘阈值处的折点来准确确定氧化状态。

10. OK边缘起始与过渡金属的氧键几何结构而非氧化状态有关，这突出了仅从ELNES数据推断氧化状态的复杂性。

11. 边缘起始差异方法假设氧和过渡金属具有相同的最终状态，这并非普遍适用，因为密度状态是局部化的。这种方法在某些情况下工作，但在应用到混合价化合物或具有明显电子性质的材料时面临限制。

12. 两个参数方法结合白线比和L3边缘位置来估算名义氧化状态，但其有效性依赖于所使用的单个方法的有效性。

13. ELNES拟合方法成功应用于测量V、Ti、Mn、Fe和Ce等过渡金属的氧化状态，通过将实验光谱拟合到已知氧化状态的参考光谱。此方法需要准确的峰值位置和适当的参考光谱才能成功应用。

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), which can provide detailed information on the local structure and composition, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which enables atomic resolution imaging and analysis. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing precise information on the dopant distribution, crystal structure, and electronic properties. They also help rule out alternative explanations by confirming the dopant's location and interaction with the matrix material.

2. The white-line ratio method is a popular approach for determining the oxidation states of transition metals in metal oxide catalysts. However, it has limitations, particularly in its lack of a strict one-to-one correspondence with the oxidation state, especially for iron, and its sensitivity to sample thickness and integration window size. This method requires careful calibration and consideration of multiple parameters to provide accurate results.

3. The L2,3 edge onset method, which involves measuring the energy-loss of excitations to determine the peak onset, offers a straightforward way to quantify the oxidation states of transition metals. This method is less prone to resolution dependence and provides more precise results compared to the white-line ratio method. It also helps distinguish between different oxidation states in mixed-valence compounds.

4. The edge onset difference method utilizes the difference between the onset energy of the OK edge and the L3 edge to infer the oxidation state. While this method can be useful for identifying oxidation states under certain conditions, it assumes that the oxygen and transition metal have the same final state, which is often not the case due to the localized nature of the density of states. This limitation restricts the applicability of the method.

5. The two-parameter method combines the white-line ratio and the L3 edge position to estimate the nominal oxidation state. However, its performance is dependent on the validity of the individual methods. This approach can provide insights into the relationship between the white-line ratio, edge position, and the actual oxidation state, but its accuracy is contingent upon the reliability of the data and the underlying assumptions.

6. The ELNES fitting method employs high-resolution L edge electron energy-loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) data to measure the oxidation states of transition metals. This method relies on fitting the experimental spectra to reference spectra of known oxidation states, which allows for accurate determination of the oxidation state even in the presence of mixed valence compounds. The choice of reference spectra is critical for the success of this technique.
