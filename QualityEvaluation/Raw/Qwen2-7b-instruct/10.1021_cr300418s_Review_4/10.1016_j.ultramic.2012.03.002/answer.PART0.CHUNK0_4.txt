[1] "Transition metal L2;3 electron energy-loss spectra for a wide range of V-, Mn- and Fe-based oxides were recorded and carefully analyzed for their correlation with the formal oxidation states of the transition metal ions."
[2] "The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years."
[3] "Several procedures exist, and undoubtedly the most popular is a procedure called the white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method."
[4] "Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range, it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state."
[5] "The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments."
[6] "In order to precisely and systematically measure the absolute core-loss edge position, an automated acquisition script is developed to repeatedly acquire the low-loss and core-loss spectra of OK and TML2,3 edges consecutively."
[7] "The onset energies of the V-, Mn-, Fe-L3 edge are plotted as a function of their formal oxidation states."
[8] "The edge onset difference method assumes that the oxygen and TM have the same final state, which in general is not true because the density of states are localized."
[9] "The two-parameter method combines the white-line ratio and the L3 edge position to estimate the nominal oxidation state from experiments."
[10] "The ELNES fitting method uses high resolution L edge ELNES data to measure the oxidation states of transition metals."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), which can provide detailed information on the local structure and composition, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which enables atomic resolution imaging and analysis. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing precise information on the dopant distribution, crystal structure, and electronic properties. They also help rule out alternative explanations by confirming the dopant's location and interaction with the matrix material.

2. The white-line ratio method is a popular approach for determining the oxidation states of transition metals in metal oxide catalysts. However, it has limitations, particularly in its lack of a strict one-to-one correspondence with the oxidation state, especially for iron, and its sensitivity to sample thickness and integration window size. This method requires careful calibration and consideration of multiple parameters to provide accurate results.

3. The L2,3 edge onset method, which involves measuring the energy-loss of excitations to determine the peak onset, offers a straightforward way to quantify the oxidation states of transition metals. This method is less prone to resolution dependence and provides more precise results compared to the white-line ratio method. It also helps distinguish between different oxidation states in mixed-valence compounds.

4. The edge onset difference method utilizes the difference between the onset energy of the OK edge and the L3 edge to infer the oxidation state. While this method can be useful for identifying oxidation states under certain conditions, it assumes that the oxygen and transition metal have the same final state, which is often not the case due to the localized nature of the density of states. This limitation restricts the applicability of the method.

5. The two-parameter method combines the white-line ratio and the L3 edge position to estimate the nominal oxidation state. However, its performance is dependent on the validity of the individual methods. This approach can provide insights into the relationship between the white-line ratio, edge position, and the actual oxidation state, but its accuracy is contingent upon the reliability of the data and the underlying assumptions.

6. The ELNES fitting method employs high-resolution L edge electron energy-loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) data to measure the oxidation states of transition metals. This method relies on fitting the experimental spectra to reference spectra of known oxidation states, which allows for accurate determination of the oxidation state even in the presence of mixed valence compounds. The choice of reference spectra is critical for the success of this technique.

1. 验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功引入和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括电子能量损失光谱（EELS），它可以提供局部结构和组成的详细信息，以及扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM），它允许原子分辨率成像和分析。这些技术通过提供精确的信息来解决建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间关系的挑战，并且通过确认掺杂剂的位置及其与基体材料的相互作用来排除其他解释。

2. 白线比率方法是确定过渡金属在金属氧化物催化剂中的氧化状态的一种流行方法。然而，该方法在铁等元素的氧化态范围有限的情况下，其与实际氧化态的一一对应关系并不严格，尤其是对于铁，而且对样品厚度和积分窗口大小敏感。这种方法需要仔细校准并考虑多个参数以提供准确的结果。

3. L2,3边缘峰起始方法涉及测量激发能量损失以确定峰值起始点，提供了一种简单的方法来定量过渡金属的氧化状态。与白线比率方法相比，此方法较少受分辨率依赖性的影响，并提供了更精确的结果。它也有助于区分混合价化合物中的不同氧化状态。

4. 边缘起始差异方法利用OK边缘和L3边缘的起始能量差来推断氧化状态。虽然这种方法在特定条件下可用于识别氧化状态，但其假设氧和过渡金属具有相同的最终状态，这通常是不正确的，因为密度的局域性质。这种限制限制了该方法的应用。

5. 二参数方法结合白线比率和L3边缘位置来估计名义氧化状态。但是，其性能依赖于个体方法的有效性。这种方法可以提供关于白线比率、边缘位置和实际氧化状态之间关系的见解，但其准确性取决于数据的可靠性及其基本假设。

6. ELNES拟合方法采用高分辨率L边缘电子能量损失近边光谱（ELNES）数据来测量过渡金属的氧化状态。此方法依赖于将实验谱拟合到已知氧化状态的参考谱，即使在存在混合价化合物的情况下也能实现准确的氧化状态测定。选择参考谱对于此技术的成功至关重要。
