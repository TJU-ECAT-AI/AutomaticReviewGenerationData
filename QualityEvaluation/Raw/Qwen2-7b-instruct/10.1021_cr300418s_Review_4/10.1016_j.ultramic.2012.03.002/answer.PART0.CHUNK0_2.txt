[1] "Transition metals (TMs) in oxide materials are known to adopt many different oxidation states, which leads to a wide range of chemical and physical properties of the TM complex oxides."
[2] "Oxidation states can be accurately measured by redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction but these techniques are material dependent and provide information averaged over the whole sample."
[3] "To obtain spatially selective information, several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[4] "In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge."
[5] "Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range, it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state."
[6] "Besides that, the excitation edge energy position of the TM is also correlated to its oxidation state. In general, the excitation edges shift to a higher energy-loss for a higher oxidation state."
[7] "The ELNES of OK, V-L2,3, Mn-L2,3 and Fe-L2,3 edges are shown in Fig. 2 for TM oxides with different oxidation states and for metallic Fe."
[8] "For Mn ions with the same oxidation state, the ELNES looks very similar for different compounds at the available energy resolution."
[9] "The OK edge onset position of V oxides is difficult to observe since it overlaps with the continuum region of the V-L2,3 edge."
[10] "The OK edge onset of Sr2Fe2O5 is much lower than that of the other Fe3 compounds."
[11] "The Mn-L2 peaks from Mn oxides are also relatively more intense for higher oxidation states, indicating a decrease of the L3/L2 white-line ratio."
[12] "The white-line ratio also sensitively depends on the size and position of the integration window due to the subtle differences in the ELNES shape of the different compounds."
[13] "The white-line ratio of Sr2Fe2O5 is considerably lower than that of the other Fe3 samples."
[14] "The onset energies of the V-, Mn-, Fe-L3 edge are plotted as a function of their formal oxidation states."
[15] "The onset of Fe3.8 in BaFeO2.9 is at the same level as Fe3."
[16] "The absolute peak position method measures the energy-loss of excitations, which is closely related to the energy level of the inner-shell electrons and the final states."
[17] "The edge onset method has a much better precision with our presented routine (lower error bar)."
[18] "The OK edge onset involves the contribution from all bonds, implying that it reflects the geometry of the metal-oxygen bonding rather than the oxidation state of the TMs."
[19] "The edge onset difference method assumes that the oxygen and TM have the same final state, which in general is not true because the density of states are localized."
[20] "The two-parameter method uses the fact that both the white-line ratio and the L3 edge position depend in some way on the nominal oxidation state."
[21] "The performance of the two-parameter method is dependent on the validity of the individual methods."
[22] "The ELNES fitting method is successfully used to measure the oxidation states of V, Ti, Mn, Fe and Ce."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction. These techniques address the challenges by providing spatially selective information on dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations through detailed analysis of the excitation spectra and oxidation state determination.

2. The white-line ratio method has no strict one-to-one correspondence with the oxidation state of transition metals. It provides information on the detailed shape of the L2,3 excitation edge but is sensitive to sample thickness and the exact measurement procedure, making unambiguous oxidation state determination difficult.

3. The excitation edge energy position of transition metals correlates with their oxidation state. Higher oxidation states lead to higher energy-loss for the excitation edges. This chemical shift is useful for determining oxidation states but requires careful calibration to avoid misinterpretation.

4. The ELNES of the OK, V-L2,3, Mn-L2,3, and Fe-L2,3 edges are shown for TM oxides with different oxidation states. Mn-L2 peaks become more intense with higher oxidation states, indicating a decrease in the L3/L2 white-line ratio. The OK edge onset position is challenging to observe due to overlapping with the V-L2,3 edge.

5. The OK edge onset of Sr2Fe2O5 is lower than that of other Fe3 compounds, suggesting differences in coordination geometry. The L3 edge onset for Mn3O4 overlaps with MnO and MnV2O4, indicating a limitation in estimating the average oxidation state of mixed valence compounds using this method.

6. The white-line ratio method is sensitive to the size and position of the integration window, affecting its reliability. The white-line ratio of Sr2Fe2O5 differs from other Fe3 samples, possibly due to the high spin state of Fe in this compound.

7. The onset energies of the V-, Mn-, and Fe-L3 edges increase with the formal oxidation states of the respective metals. This linear relationship facilitates the estimation of oxidation states through the ELNES fitting method.

8. The onset of Fe3.8 in BaFeO2.9 is similar to Fe3, indicating that the spectrum is a linear combination of Fe3 and Fe4 signals, suggesting non-stoichiometry in this compound.

9. The absolute peak position method provides a more reliable way to quantify oxidation states of V/Mn in their oxides by measuring the energy-loss of excitations, which is closely related to the energy levels of the inner-shell electrons and final states.

10. The edge onset method offers better precision compared to traditional methods, enabling accurate determination of oxidation states by identifying the inflection point of the initial rise at the threshold of the excitation edge.

11. The OK edge onset is related to the geometry of metal-oxygen bonding rather than the oxidation state of the transition metals. This highlights the complexity of interpreting ELNES data in terms of oxidation states.

12. The edge onset difference method assumes that the oxygen and transition metal have the same final state, which is not universally true due to localized density of states. This method works in some cases but faces limitations when applied to mixed valence compounds or materials with distinct electronic properties.

13. The two-parameter method combines the white-line ratio and L3 edge position to estimate the nominal oxidation state, but its effectiveness depends on the validity of the individual methods used.

14. The ELNES fitting method is successfully employed to measure the oxidation states of various transition metals, including V, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Ce, by fitting the experimental spectra to reference spectra of known oxidation states. This method requires accurate peak positions and appropriate reference spectra for successful application.
