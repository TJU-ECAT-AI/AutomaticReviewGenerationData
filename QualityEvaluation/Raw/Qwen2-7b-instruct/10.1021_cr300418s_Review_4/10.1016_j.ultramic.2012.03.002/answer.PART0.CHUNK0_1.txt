[1] "Transition metal L2;3 electron energy-loss spectra for a wide range of V-, Mn- and Fe-based oxides were recorded and carefully analyzed for their correlation with the formal oxidation states of the transition metal ions."
[2] "Both the ELNES fitting method and the chemical shift method have the advantage of a wide application range and good consistency but require special attention to accurately measure the core-loss edge position."
[3] "The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments."
[4] "In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge."
[5] "This quantitative and spatially resolved analytical method for investigating TM oxidation states is of great interest for catalytic [35],mineralogical [23,24,36] and electro-chemical [37,38] applications."
[6] "Several procedures exist, and undoubtedly the most popular is a procedure called the white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method."
[7] "Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range [23,24,36,44], it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state [37,45]."
[8] "The ELNES fitting method to measure TM oxidation states is generally valid especially when accurate peak positions are used (except when the spin state changes)."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). These techniques address the challenges by providing spatially resolved information on dopant presence and structural changes, thus enabling a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural alterations, and enhanced catalytic performance. Additionally, these methods can help rule out alternative explanations by offering detailed insights into the local environment and coordination of dopants within the metal oxide matrix.

2. The white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method is a widely used technique for linking electron energy-loss spectra to the formal oxidation states of transition metal ions. However, it requires careful measurement of the core-loss edge position and has limitations in providing a strict one-to-one correspondence with oxidation states, particularly for iron. This method is subject to biases related to sample thickness and integration window size, which can affect its accuracy.

3. The ELNES fitting method, which relies on accurate peak positions, is generally valid for measuring transition metal oxidation states. This method can be applied to a variety of metal oxide compounds, including those with mixed valences, and can offer more accurate and precise results compared to the white-line ratio method.

1. 验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功整合和均匀分布的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括电子能量损失光谱（EELS）、X射线吸收光谱（XAS）和扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）。这些技术通过提供有关掺杂剂存在和结构变化的空间分辨信息，从而能够明确地建立掺杂剂存在、结构改变与催化性能增强之间的关系，并能排除其他可能的解释。此外，这些方法还能通过提供对掺杂剂在金属氧化物基质中的局部环境和配位的详细见解，来帮助排除其他可能性。

2. 白线比或L2,3比率方法是广泛使用的一种技术，用于将电子能量损失谱与过渡金属离子的正式氧化状态联系起来。然而，这种方法需要仔细测量核心损耗边缘的位置，并且在提供与氧化状态严格一一对应方面有限制，尤其是对于铁而言。该方法受到样本厚度和积分窗口大小的影响，这会影响其准确性。

3. 依赖于准确峰位置的ELNES拟合方法通常适用于测量过渡金属的氧化状态。这种方法可以应用于各种金属氧化物化合物，包括具有混合价态的化合物，并且可以提供与白线比方法相比更准确和精确的结果。
