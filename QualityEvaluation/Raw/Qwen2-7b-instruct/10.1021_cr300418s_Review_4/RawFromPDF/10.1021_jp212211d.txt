Abstract
Precious metal incorporated into stable lattices like perovskites can be envisaged as an alternative catalysts to address deactivation problems. Here we report the barium cerate perovskite doped with varying amounts of Pt as catalysts for the water–gas shift reaction whereby ionic Pt is evidenced to be active. It is found that maximum CO conversion occurs above 325 °C and increases more than 2-fold after the first cycle. XPS analysis shows that after the first cycle, more ionic Pt species are present on the surface of the catalyst. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies also indicate the presence of oxygen vacancies that increases with increasing Pt substitution.

Introduction
Noble metal particles supported on oxides have been the mainstay of industrially important heterogeneous catalytic processes. (1, 2) The dispersion, size, and morphology of the active nanoparticles play a pivotal role in controlling the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. (3, 4) Reactions catalyzed on metal surfaces are evidenced to proceed via various adsorption mechanisms and consequently depend on the structure of the exposed crystal planes and sites on the nanoparticles available for adsorption of reactant molecules. Under these circumstances, it is well-understood that agglomeration or sintering under reducing reaction conditions or high temperatures can lead to altering of the surface structure and hence deteriorate catalytic properties. (5-7) This problem has been plaguing many catalytic processes, the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) being foremost among them. WGSR is an intermediate CO clean up step in fuel processing for generating hydrogen feed for fuel cells, whereby not only CO concentration is reduced but hydrogen content in the feed also is enriched by its reaction with water.
Even a slight deactivation of the WGSR catalyst may have dire consequences in downstream utilization modules like fuel cells or Pt electrodes, which get poisoned by small fluctuations in CO concentration. Pt and Au supported on CeO2 are reported to be highly active for WGSR. (8-11) A mechanism involving oxygen vacancies and storage capacity of CeO2 in conjunction with CO adsorption on Pt nanoparticles surfaces has been proposed. (12, 13) However, severe sintering on stream and subsequent deactivation also is reported in such supported catalyst systems. One of the mechanisms of deactivation in these catalysts is proposed to be the metal sintering effect. (14-17) Hence an alternative catalyst system that is resistant to agglomeration and sintering is highly desirable. In this context, it is worth mentioning the seminal work of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and co-workers which proved, by selective leaching studies, that the active species in WGSR in noble metal (NM) supported on CeO2 is the cationic NMδ+. (18-21) Recently, alkali-stabilized Pt hydroxyl species supported on SiO2 was reported to be highly active for low-temperature WGS reaction. (22) As a logical extension, we can envisage noble metal cations doped in stable lattice types like perovskites to be active in a similar way. Moreover, pathways of sintering encountered in conventional supported catalysts can be minimized in such systems by simply space-separating the active centers. Some attempts at this have been made earlier in perovskite as well as in fluorite systems. (23-25) In all these systems, however, lattice sites are stabilized only under oxidizing conditions, and face-centered cubic (fcc) nanoparticles of the noble metal egress out of lattice sites under reducing conditions, giving rise to “breathing” compounds. (26-28) This phenomenon is advantageous for controlling the NM particle sizes. In this scenario, we have been trying to address this problem in a slightly different way, viz, to stabilize the noble metal in cationic form even under reducing conditions by selecting the appropriate perovskite lattice. The logic followed is that since cationic species are shown to be active in WGSR, isolating such species in sufficient concentration in the lattice sites should lead to an active yet sinter-resistant catalyst. We selected BaCeO3 as the parent perovskite due to various reasons: (i) it is a well-studied proton conductor and works under the mechanism of water adsorption and proton formation, which may aid in the water–gas shift reaction; (29) (ii) Ce is an efficient redox system and can therefore tolerate a high degree of substitution; and (iii) it is tolerant to high concentrations of vacancies, which help in the water-splitting step. Since Pt supported on CeO2 is reported to be highly active for WGS, we decided to dope Pt in the octahedral Ce position. Here we report the structural evaluation of the BaCe1-xPtxO3-δ system by various characterization methods and in situ studies, in relation to the WGS reaction. This catalyst system was found to isolate efficiently cationic Pt species that are stable under reducing conditions.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of BaCe1-xPtxO3-δ
Pt-doped and undoped BaCeO3 were prepared by the citrate-gel method. Citric acid monohydrate (0.012 mol) (Merck) was added to an aqueous mixture of barium nitrate (0.003 mol) (Aldrich) and ceric ammonium nitrate (0.003 mol) (Aldrich) for the synthesis of undoped BaCeO3. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 by dropwise addition of ammonium hydroxide. This mixture was heated at 90 °C to evaporate water, and the resulting gel was heated at 400 °C to remove organic and other volatile components. The powder obtained was ground well and calcined at 900 °C for 6 h. For the Pt-doped sample, appropriate concentrations of tetrammine platinum nitrate (Aldrich) were added along with the nitrate solutions.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of all the samples was carried out in a PANalytical X’pert Pro dual goniometer diffractometer working under 40 kV and 30 mA. The radiation used was Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) with a Ni filter, and the data collection was carried out using a flat holder in Bragg–Brentano geometry with 1° slit at the source and receiving sides. An X’celerator solid-state detector with a scan speed of 0.012° min–1 was employed. Powder XRD refinement was done using Rietveld method by means of the GSAS-EXPGUI program. Initially, background and scale factors were refined followed by cell parameters and positional parameters. Variable temperature in situ XRD experiments were carried out in an Anton-Paar XRK900 reactor under 10% and 20% H2. The XRD patterns in the 2θ range 18°–90° and 38°–44° were collected with scan speeds of 0.012° min–1 and 0.006° min–1, respectively. Neutron diffraction experiments were carried out at room temperature on the profile analysis spectrometer T1015 attached to a Dhruva reactor. Neutrons of a constant wavelength of 1.2443 Å were used as the probe, and the scattered neutrons were detected using an array of five 3He linear position sensitive detectors covering a range of 6°–137°. The neutron data were analyzed using FullProf software. The model consisted of BaCeO3 in space group Pnma and an impurity phase of CeO2 in the case of 2% and 4% samples, whereas the 6% sample is analyzed by including BaCO3 phase as well. The refinement started with the scale factor and proceeded through the lattice parameters, shape factors, atomic positions, thermal factors, and occupancies. Finally, the oxygen occupancy is varied along with all the other parameters to get the final fit. FEI Tecnai TF-30 electron microscope, operating at 300 kV, was used for HRTEM sample observations. Samples for HRTEM were prepared by evaporating a drop of the suspension of the sample in isopropanol onto a carbon-coated copper mesh 200 grid. The amount of Pt present in the samples was estimated by ICP-AES (Spectro Arcos, FHS-12). The materials were dissolved in aqua regia prior to the analysis. The XPS measurements were carried out using a multiprobe system (Omicron Nanotechnology, Germany) equipped with a dual Mg/Al X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer operating in constant analyzer energy (CAE) mode. The spectra were obtained with pass energy of 50 eV for survey scan and individual scans; a Mg Kα X-ray source was operated at 300 W and 15 kV. The base pressure in the analyzing chamber was maintained at 1 × 10–10 mbar. For the quantification of the elements, relative sensitivity factors (RSF) provided by the manufacturer were used. For adventitious carbon, 284.9 eV was taken as the reference binding energy for charge correction.
Catalytic Testing
Evaluation of catalytic activity was carried out in a vertical, down flow, fixed bed metal reactor placed inside a furnace (BTRS, Autoclave Engineers). All the runs were carried out under atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of 250–400 °C. About 0.5 cm3 of the catalyst in the particle size range of 10–20 mesh was loaded into the tubular reactor of length 24 cm and internal diameter 0.9 cm that has a thermowell inserted to the center of the catalyst bed. The temperature of the catalyst bed was continuously monitored with the help of a Cr–Al thermocouple. A reformate composition of 39.8% H2, 34.9% N2, 10.2% CO, and 15.2% CO2 with a steam to CO ratio of 4.5 was used at a gas hour space velocity (GHSV) of 5000 h–1. Water was sent to the reactor using an ISCO model 500D syringe pump, which was preheated and converted to steam by an inbuilt oven in the reactor. In a typical experiment, the temperature was gradually increased to 250 °C with a constant heating rate of 2 °C min–1 under N2. Activity was measured at intervals of 25 °C. At each temperature, the reformate mixture and steam were allowed to pass through the catalyst for 0.5 h. After each set of measurements, the reactor system was allowed to cool to room temperature under air and again the process was repeated for the second cycle. The gases were analyzed using a NUCON gas chromatograph equipped with a Carbosphere column and a thermal conductivity detector.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structural Characterization
The strategy employed in this approach is to isolate catalytically active centers in stable lattice sites to explore minimizing agglomeration and consequent deactivation. Usually, oxides like BaCeO3 perovskite are synthesized by high temperature solid-state synthesis methods. However, since the interest in the present work was in catalysis, lower-temperature solution-based synthesis methods needed to be explored. The citric acid combustion method with barium and cerium nitrates and tetrammine platinum nitrate as precursors was found to result in the desired compounds with reasonable purity, as shown by XRD analysis, which will be discussed later. Pt molar concentrations in BaCeO3 was progressively increased to 2, 4, and 6% leading to final compositions of BaCe1-xPtxO3-δ (x = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06) equivalent to 1.19, 2.38, and 3.56 Pt wt %, respectively. We focused on lower Pt concentrations to understand the catalytic activity in relation to the range of Pt in supported CeO2 catalysts. ICP analysis of the three samples confirmed the concentrations of Pt to be more or less similar to the theoretical values (1.02, 2.11, and 3.17 wt %, respectively).

XRD patterns of BaCeO3 in which varying concentrations of Pt are incorporated are represented in Figure 1. Patterns of parent BaCeO3 as well as 0.8 wt % Pt impregnated BaCeO3 also are given for comparison. BaCeO3 is reported to crystallize in an orthorhombic phase and the peaks of the Pt-doped and undoped BaCeO3 matched with those of the reported orthorhombic phase (JCPDS 82-2425). However, peaks of phases BaCO3 and CeO2 are also detectable in all the samples. In order to remove the BaCO3 impurity, the sample was washed several times with dilute HNO3. However, on heating to 400 °C in open air, the impurity phase reappeared, showing that the material is sensitive to atmospheric CO2 (Supporting Information). This propensity for Ba-containing perovskites and related compounds for forming BaCO3 under atmospheric CO2 conditions is well-recorded. (30-32) Remarkably, peaks corresponding to Pt metal are not observed in the patterns of the doped materials. To verify whether Pt in this concentration level is discernible by XRD, BaCeO3 was impregnated with 0.8 wt % Pt by conventional methods to ensure the presence of fcc Pt particles and the XRD pattern indeed shows the presence of Pt metal. This is evidence that, even if present at this concentration, Pt can be detected by XRD and implies that, in the BaCe1-xPtxO3-δ compounds, Pt ions are incorporated in the lattice and not present in metallic form. Also, to estimate the maximum concentration of ionic Pt that can be stabilized in this structure, BaCe1-xPtxO3-δ, where x = 0.08 and 0.1 (corresponding to 4.73 and 5.89 wt % Pt), were also synthesized. PXRD patterns (Supporting Information) of these compounds show that metallic Pt extrudes out of the lattice sites at a doping of 10 mol %. A semiquantitative phase analysis evidenced only ∼0.3 wt % of metallic Pt impurity.
As mentioned earlier, BaCeO3 has an orthorhombic structure with space group Pnma. (33) Alio- and isovalent substitution of Y and Zr in BaCeO3 is reported to lead to slight deviations from orthorhombic symmetry at room temperature as a consequence of varying degrees of octahedral tilting. BaCeYO3-δ crystallizes in monoclinic I2/m, and Zr doping at low concentrations retains the space group, while at higher concentrations it changes to rhombohedral symmetry. (34, 35) However, at the level of substitution in our system, there is a high probability of the structure being retained in the original space group. Nevertheless, the XRD patterns were compared with those simulated for the various possible space groups, and they were found to have the best fit with space group Pnma. So this structure was chosen for further structural refinement. A quantitative phase analysis by full pattern fitting by the Rietveld method using the GSAS suit of programs (36) indicated that the impurity phases are present in trace quantities (Table 1). Detailed refinement and atomic parameters are given in the Supporting Information. Occupancies of Pt in all the three samples were fixed on the basis of the elemental analysis, and oxygen occupancies were not refined.

A possible incorporation of Pt(II) in place of Ce(IV) has structural consequences visible in XRD. The ionic size of Ce(IV) in octahedral coordination is 1.01 Å. When replaced by Pt(II), the site geometry can be expected to be square planar subsequent to creation of oxygen vacancies for charge balance. Similar substitution by Pd in the system reported the presence of square planar geometry for the B site. (23) The crystallographic data evidence a decrease in unit cell volume with increase in Pt concentration, which is a direct result of substitution of Ce(IV) with Pt(II) in square planar geometry (0.74 Å). However, the effect of oxygen vacancies on this parameter also cannot be ruled out. In all these observations, oxygen atomic positions play an important role and their accurate measurement is imperative in clearly understanding the extent of vacancies created. Neutron diffraction (ND) is a better tool compared to XRD for this, due to the higher scattering cross section of neutrons for oxygen. Hence, ND experiments were carried out in all the three samples, and the data were refined using the Fullprof suite of programs. (37) The refinement and atomic parameters are tabulated in Table 2 and the refinement fits are represented in Figure 2A. Here, oxygen occupancies also were refined and the atomic positions of all the atoms and cell parameters were found to corroborate XRD refinement results. As in a typical perovskite structure, CeO6 octahedra share their corners to form the framework, and the volume of the BO6 octahedra gradually decreases as Pt concentration increases, clearly indicative of an increased substitution of Pt in the Ce site (Figure 2C). As expected, the extent of oxygen deficiency also was found to increase as Pt substitution increases, and interestingly, more oxygen vacancies were created in O2 sites along the ac plane. This indicates the presence of Pt–O square planar bonds along [101] planes. With increase in Pt substitution, however, the oxygen vacancies created deviate more from the theoretical values. This can be attributed to a combined effect of increased concentrations of Ce(III), Pt(II), and oxygen vacancies, which may also be the reason for the nonlinear decrease in cell volume as well as octahedral volume. HRTEM studies revealed the presence of irregularly shaped particles of size less than 100 nm. Analysis over a spread of images showed only the lattice planes of perovskite, and no evidence of metallic Pt could be seen. A similar analysis by electron diffraction also showed diffraction from the perovskite phase exclusively. A representative image is given in Figure 3.

Catalytic Activity and Structural Correlation
Shift reactors employing Pt/CeO2 encounter deactivation problems mostly during the shutdown and switch-on procedures. Various factors contribute to this, including the highly reducing atmosphere during reaction, leading to noble metal sintering, and exposure to air at low temperatures, leading to carbonate formation on the support surface. (38, 39) Condensation of steam during cooling in the shutdown step, forming surface hydroxyls, also is proposed to be detrimental. (40) To study the activity and evolution of active species during recycling, this series of catalysts was tested for two cycles of the WGS reaction. The catalysts were found to be reasonably active for WGS in the first cycle. As expected, the activity increased with increase in Pt substitution. After the first cycle, the catalyst was allowed to cool under air flow to room temperature. The WGS testing was repeated for one more cycle. The activity was found to increase by a remarkable 2-fold for the second cycle (Figure 4). As a representative example, we carried out a third cycle of the WGS reaction for the 2 mol % sample (BaCe0.98Pt0.02O3-δ), and the activity was found to remain same for the third cycle (Figure 4A).

BaCeO3 is reported to decompose into carbonates and oxides in CO2-rich atmospheres at temperatures below 800 °C. (41) However, under the conditions and temperature employed in WGSR, we did not observe any such structural instability. Moreover, XRD studies on the spent catalysts recovered under inert atmosphere did not show any indication of metallic Pt (Supporting Information). As mentioned earlier, similar instances of Pd substitution in perovskite and other solid lattices led to stabilization of the noble metal in ionic form in the lattice under oxidizing conditions, but under reducing conditions, metallic particles egress out of the lattice. In such systems, the active species are understood to be metallic particles. However, in our catalyst system, the active species are probably ionic species. A true picture emerged in in situ XRD studies under highly reducing conditions (10% H2/N2) at varying temperatures (Figure 5). The region of 2θ where the peak corresponding to the most intense [111] crystal plane is usually detected was swept in a slow scan (Figure 5D) to check for the presence of Pt. Very interestingly, even under this condition, no peaks corresponding to fcc Pt metal could be detected. Moreover, all the three materials seemed very stable under H2 until 600 °C. In addition, HRTEM studies of these reduced samples did not show the presence of Pt metal particles, and no segregation of Pt metal was observed even at 900 °C under 20% H2/N2 (Supporting Information).
We also carried out in situ XRD experiments under H2 on 8 and 10 mol % samples. The former sample was stable without any segregation of Pt metal. In case of 10 mol % sample, a semiquantitative phase analysis showed a small increase of metallic Pt impurity to 0.6 wt %. Interestingly, this indicates that the limit of solid solubility of Pt in the perovskite is ∼9.5 mol %, this concentration of Pt in the framework is highly stabilized, and any more doping leads to extrusion of extra Pt.

Figure 6. Pt-4f XP spectra of 2 mol % Pt-doped BaCeO3 (a) before, (b) after the first cycle, and (c) after the second cycle of the WGS reaction.
To understand further the species present in the fresh catalyst as well as its evolution during the shut down cycles, surface characterization of a representative sample of BaCe0.98Pt0.02O3-δ and the corresponding spent catalysts was carried out (Figure 6). The Pt-4f spectrum showed a peak at 72.4 eV corresponding to Pt(II); however, the surface concentration of the species seemed quite low. Also, no peak corresponding to metallic Pt (71 eV) was observed in the spectrum. Predominantly Pt(IV) (74.6 eV) was found on the surface after the first shutdown along with a minor Pt(II) component increasing the overall surface concentration of Pt. After the second cycle, the amount of Pt(II) species on the surface again increases at the expense of Pt(IV), the overall concentration staying more or less the same. The enhanced activity of the catalyst for the second cycle of WGSR may be attributed to the enrichment of the cationic platinum on the surface. Importantly, it is to be noted that, in spite of severe reduction conditions of WGS reaction, no metallic platinum was found in XPS studies. This is an important indication that supports the incorporation of ionic Pt into the BaCeO3 lattice. A change in oxidation state between Pt(II) and Pt(IV) between shutdown cycles may also be due to interaction of atmospheric components during shutdown. Ce-3d spectra for fresh and spent catalysts were also recorded. Although the spectra look complicated at the outset, a ratio of intensity of Ce(IV) peak at 916 eV and Ce(III) peak at 886 eV gives an idea of the changes that are occurring (Figure 7). The Ce(IV)/Ce(III) ratio decreases after the first shutdown compared to fresh catalyst, highlighting significant reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III). (42) In contrast, the trend reverses after the second shutdown. Indeed, the above changes are in exact correspondence to that of the changes observed in Pt-4f spectra. This indicates a mechanism in which the oxygen vacancies created near Pt and Ce sites affect the activity in tandem. The fact that stable ionic species could be detected also points to mechanistic aspects similar to those reported in the selectively leached noble metal catalysts. (9, 18-20)

Conclusions
Ionic Pt species are evidenced to be stabilized in BaCeO3 perovskite lattice points. Structural characterization points to features corresponding to the substitution of Pt(II) in Ce(IV) sites like (i) linear decrease in cell volume and BO6 octahedral volume and (ii) decrease in oxygen occupancies, indicating an increase in oxygen vacancies with increase in Pt concentration. XRD and XPS studies followed the evolution of Pt species during the reaction as well as shutdown and switch-on procedures in a shift reactor. Metallic species are not identified in spent catalysts recovered under WGS conditions as well as after exposure to air during shutdown. Interestingly, after the first shutdown, a surface enrichment of ionic Pt species is observed, major component being Pt(IV) with a corresponding reduction in Ce(IV) surface concentration. After the second cycle, Pt(IV) seems to have been reduced to Pt(II) with a synergistic oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV). BaCeO3 can be proposed to be an ideal perovskite lattice to stabilize ionic Pt, keeping it not only active but also sinter resistant under WGSR conditions. Thorough studies to understand the mechanism with respect to various shutdown conditions will shed more light on to this important reaction and are underway.
