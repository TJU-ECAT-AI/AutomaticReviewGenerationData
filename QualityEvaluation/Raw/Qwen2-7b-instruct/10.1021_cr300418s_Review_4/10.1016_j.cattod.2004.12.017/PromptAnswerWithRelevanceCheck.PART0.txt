To comprehensively characterize the incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts, several key methods and approaches are crucial. These include operando methodology, which combines spectroscopic measurements with simultaneous online catalytic activity and selectivity evaluations. This ensures that the structural and kinetic data gathered are directly relevant to the catalytic system under investigation. The optimal spectroscopic cell for operando studies is designed to mimic conventional catalytic reactor conditions, providing comparable performance data. Utilizing multiple complementary spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), offers deeper insights into the nature of surface active sites, reaction intermediates, and adsorption sites. This multifaceted approach helps establish a clear link between dopant presence, structural modifications, and enhanced catalytic performance, while eliminating alternative explanations.
