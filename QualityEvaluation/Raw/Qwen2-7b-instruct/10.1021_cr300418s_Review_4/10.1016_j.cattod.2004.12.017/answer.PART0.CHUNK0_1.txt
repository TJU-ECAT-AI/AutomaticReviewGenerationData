Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ spectroscopic studies, operando methodology, and simultaneous online measurement of catalytic activity/selectivity values. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing real-time information about the catalytic structure and surface species under controlled environments. They ensure that the structural information obtained is relevant to the realistic catalytic reaction conditions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the structureactivity/selectivity relationships. The design of the spectroscopic reaction cell and the choice of spectroscopic techniques must enable the generation of catalytic performance data analogous to those achieved with conventional catalytic reactors, ensuring that the data reflects the actual performance of the catalyst under operational conditions.
