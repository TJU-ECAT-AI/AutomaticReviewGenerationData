[1] "The electronic and molecular structures of catalytic active sites and surface intermediates are currently characterized by a large collection of spectroscopic techniques. Sometimes under vacuum conditions with model catalytic systems and in other cases under in situ conditions in the presence of chemical probe molecules, reactive environments (reduction, oxidation, etc.) or reaction conditions."
[2] "It is critical that the design of the spectroscopic reaction cell, the catalytic reactor, also allows for the generation of catalytic performance data that is analogous to those achieved with conventional catalytic reactors."
[3] "The term operando provides a single word that underlines the simultaneous evaluation of both structure (catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermediates) and catalytic activity/selectivity."
[4] "Operando methodology is a combined spectroscopic measurement and simultaneous online measurement of catalytic activity/selectivity values during catalytic reaction studies."

To comprehensively characterize the incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts, spectroscopic methods such as Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis-DRS, IR spectroscopy, and EPR spectroscopy are crucial. These techniques address the challenges by providing information on the oxidation states of supported oxides, the nature of chemisorbed species, and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions. They help establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. By combining these methods, researchers can correct Raman signal intensity, understand oxidation states, and gather information about the adsorption sites of surface reaction intermediates on the catalyst. This multifaceted approach enables a detailed understanding of the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic materials under different reaction conditions.
