The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include a combination of spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis-DRS, and IR spectroscopy. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing molecular and atomic level insights into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships. The operando methodology, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous online measurement of catalytic activity, further aids in understanding the real-time dynamics of dopant incorporation and its impact on the catalyst's properties under reaction conditions. The use of multiple techniques complements each other, offering a more detailed understanding of the catalytic system's behavior.
