The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include operando methodology, which combines spectroscopic measurements with simultaneous online catalytic activity and selectivity evaluations. This approach addresses the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by ensuring that the structural information obtained is relevant to the realistic catalytic reaction conditions. The use of several complementary spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman, UVvis-DRS, IR, and EPR, provides detailed insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst. These techniques also help in understanding the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts, correcting Raman signal intensity, and ruling out alternative explanations for enhanced catalytic performance.
