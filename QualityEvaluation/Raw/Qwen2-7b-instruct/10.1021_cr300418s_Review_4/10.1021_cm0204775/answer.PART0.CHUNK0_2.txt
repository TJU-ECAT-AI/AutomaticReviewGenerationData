[1] "In the present study, the solution combustion method provides CeO2 supported Pt catalysts in a single step. In combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2, Pt should be separated either into Pt metal clusters or Pt oxides from oxide support or Pt ion should be incorporated in the CeO2 lattice."
[2] "The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR)."
[3] "Rietveld refinement confirms the formation of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in Pt/CeO2 and absence of platinum oxide phases."
[4] "TEM studies show that very few Pt particles are present in the as-prepared catalysts, which are further decreased on heat treatment."
[5] "XPS studies show that Pt is in +2 and +4 states in 1% Pt/CeO2 with a small amount of metal and on heating Pt2+ is stabilized at the cost of Pt4+ ions."
[6] "EXAFS analysis clearly indicates a direct Pt2+OCe4+ correlation at a distance of 3.28 Å."
[7] "Detailed structural studies show that in the combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2, Pt is dispersed as ion in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ."
[8] "For a higher rate of CO conversion at a lower temperature in the combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2, a higher amount of CO adsorption and availability of dissociated oxygen are essential."

1. The solution combustion method provides CeO2 supported Pt catalysts in a single step, with Pt either forming metal clusters, oxides, or being incorporated into the CeO2 lattice.
2. The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR).
3. Rietveld refinement confirms the formation of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in Pt/CeO2 and rules out the presence of platinum oxide phases.
4. TEM studies reveal that very few Pt particles are present in the as-prepared catalysts, which decreases upon heat treatment.
5. XPS studies demonstrate that Pt is predominantly in +2 and +4 oxidation states in 1% Pt/CeO2, with some Pt metal present. Heating stabilizes Pt2+ at the expense of Pt4+ ions.
6. EXAFS analysis reveals a direct Pt2+OCe4+ correlation at 3.28 Å.
7. Detailed studies indicate that in the combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2, Pt is dispersed as ions in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ.
8. Achieving a higher rate of CO conversion at a lower temperature requires increased CO adsorption and availability of dissociated oxygen.

1. 解决燃烧法提供CeO2支持的Pt催化剂，在一步中，Pt可能形成金属簇，氧化物或被整合到CeO2晶格中。
2. 对于在燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2催化剂的结构和化学性质，使用X射线衍射（XRD），透射电子显微镜（TEM），X射线光电子能谱（XPS），扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）和温度程序反应（TPR）进行表征。
3. Rietveld精修确认了Pt/CeO2中形成了Ce1-xPtxO2-δ，并排除了铂氧化物的存在。
4. TEM研究显示，原始催化剂中的Pt颗粒很少，且在热处理后进一步减少。
5. XPS研究表明，1% Pt/CeO2中的Pt主要以+2和+4氧化态存在，有些是金属Pt。加热稳定化了Pt2+并消耗了Pt4+离子。
6. EXAFS分析揭示了Pt2+OCe4+直接相关关系在3.28 Å。
7. 细致的研究表明，在燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2中，Pt以Ce1-xPtxO2-δ的形式分散为离子。
8. 要实现CO转化率更高且在较低温度下进行，需要增加CO吸附并获得脱附氧的可用性。
