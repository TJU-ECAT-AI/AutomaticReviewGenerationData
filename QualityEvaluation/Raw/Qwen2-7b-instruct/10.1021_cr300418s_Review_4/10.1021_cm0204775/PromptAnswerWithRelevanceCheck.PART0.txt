The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR).

In heat-treated samples, relative Pt metal concentration decreases. This could be due to the formation of more Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution phase while Pt reacts with CeO2 in air.

XPS studies show that Pt is in +2 and +4 states in 1% Pt/CeO2 with a small amount of metal and on heating Pt2+ is stabilized at the cost of Pt4+ ions.

EXAFS analysis clearly indicates a direct Pt2+OCe4+ correlation at a distance of 3.28 Å.

There is a metalceria interaction that leads to the formation of solid solution Ce1-xPtxO2-δ on the surface due to substitution of Pt2+ into Ce4+ sites.

There is an increase in Pt2+ concentration due to heat treatment, indicating the increase in the extent of solid solution.

The key characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts, such as Pt in Pt/CeO2, include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR). These techniques help establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by addressing specific challenges. XRD verifies the formation of the solid solution phase and absence of platinum oxide phases. TEM reveals the dispersion of dopants as ions over nanoscale CeO2 crystallites. XPS quantifies the oxidation states of dopants, showing stabilization of Pt2+ ions upon heating. EXAFS identifies unique correlations like Pt2+OCe4+ at 3.28 Å, indicative of the dopant's role in the catalyst's structure. TPR measures the catalytic activity of the material under different conditions, linking it to the structural changes. Together, these methods rule out alternative explanations and confirm the dopant's beneficial effect on the catalyst's performance.

These techniques collectively help establish the relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by identifying the dopant incorporation, assessing the structural modifications, quantifying the dopant distribution, understanding the chemical nature of the dopant, and evaluating the thermal stability. The decreasing relative Pt metal concentration in heat-treated samples suggests a stabilization of Pt in its ionic state within the CeO2 matrix, forming a solid solution of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ, which indicates a metalceria interaction leading to the substitution of Pt2+ ions for Ce4+ sites. This interaction results in the formation of the solid solution on the surface, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Pt/CeO2 catalysts.
