[1] "The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR)."
[2] "In heat-treated samples, relative Pt metal concentration decreases."
[3] "EXAFS studies show that Pt stabilizes in its ionic state primarily substituted for surface Ce4+ ions in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution."
[4] "There is a metalceria interaction that leads to the formation of solid solution Ce1-xPtxO2-δ on the surface due to substitution of Pt2+ into Ce4+ sites."

The characterization methods crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR). These techniques collectively help establish the relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by identifying the dopant incorporation, assessing the structural modifications, quantifying the dopant distribution, understanding the chemical nature of the dopant, and evaluating the thermal stability. The decreasing relative Pt metal concentration in heat-treated samples suggests a stabilization of Pt in its ionic state within the CeO2 matrix, forming a solid solution of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ, which indicates a metalceria interaction leading to the substitution of Pt2+ ions for Ce4+ sites. This interaction results in the formation of the solid solution on the surface, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Pt/CeO2 catalysts.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键表征方法包括X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）和温度程序反应（TPR）。这些技术共同帮助建立了掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间的关系，通过识别掺杂剂的掺入、评估结构变化、量化掺杂剂分布、理解掺杂剂的化学性质以及评估热稳定性。处理后样品中相对Pt金属浓度的降低表明Pt在CeO2晶格中的离子状态稳定化，形成Ce1-xPtxO2-δ固溶体，这表明Pt2+离子通过与Ce4+位点的相互作用在表面形成固溶体，导致催化性能的增强。
