[1] "In the present study, the solution combustion method provides CeO2 supported Pt catalysts in a single step."
[2] "The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR)."
[3] "High-resolution XRD studies show that the structure could be refined for the composition of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in the fluorite structure with 6% oxide ion vacancy."
[4] "XRD studies show that at least 0.92 at. % of the platinum taken in the preparation of 1 at. % Pt/CeO2 is incorporated in the CeO2 lattice."
[5] "TEM studies demonstrate that over as-prepared 1% Pt/CeO2 an extremely small amount of Pt is present as metal particles and the rest are dispersed as atoms or ions that could not be detected."
[6] "XPS studies show that Pt is in +2 and +4 states in 1% Pt/CeO2 with a small amount of metal and on heating Pt2+ is stabilized at the cost of Pt4+ ions."
[7] "EXAFS analysis clearly indicates a direct Pt2+OCe4+ correlation at a distance of 3.28 Å."
[8] "Detailed structural studies show that in the combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2, Pt is dispersed as ion in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ."

These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR), are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Confirming the precise incorporation of dopants within the host material, as demonstrated by XRD and TEM studies showing the formation of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution and the absence of platinum oxide phases.
2. Revealing the distribution and aggregation state of dopants, such as the presence of few Pt particles in the as-prepared catalysts and their decrease on heat treatment, as observed by TEM.
3. Determining the chemical state of dopants, as evidenced by XPS findings indicating Pt in +2 and +4 states with stabilization of Pt2+ ions on heating.
4. Investigating the bonding environment and local structure around dopants, which is elucidated by EXAFS showing specific correlations such as Pt2+OCe4+ at 3.28 Å, indicative of a unique structure in the solid solution phase.
5. Assessing the effect of heat treatment on the dopant state and its impact on catalytic performance, as highlighted by the increase in Pt2+ concentration and the observed shift in Pt2+(4f7/2) binding energy peaks.

These methodologies collectively provide insights into the structural transformations, chemical interactions, and catalytic activity associated with dopants in metal oxide catalysts, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for enhanced performance.

这些全面的表征方法和分析策略，包括X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）和温度程序反应（TPR），对于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。通过：

1. 确认掺杂剂在主材料中的精确掺入，如XRD和TEM研究显示形成Ce1-xPtxO2-δ固溶体相以及不存在铂族氧化物相。
2. 揭示掺杂剂的分布和聚集状态，如观察到少量Pt颗粒存在于未处理催化剂中，并且在热处理后其数量减少，这通过TEM得到了证明。
3. 确定掺杂剂的化学状态，如XPS结果表明Pt在+2和+4价态上存在，并且在加热时Pt2+离子得到稳定化。
4. 探索掺杂剂周围局部结构的变化，通过EXAFS揭示特定的相互作用，如3.28 Å处的Pt2+OCe4+关联，表明固溶体相中独特的结构。
5. 评估热处理对掺杂剂状态及其对催化性能的影响，通过观察到Pt2+浓度的增加和Pt2+(4f7/2)结合能峰位的偏移，展示了这一点。

这些方法共同提供了关于掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的结构转变、化学交互和催化活性的信息，有助于深入理解导致性能增强的潜在机制。
