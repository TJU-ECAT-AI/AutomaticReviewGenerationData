<p>The best identification of the potential active sites by IR spectroscopy is the direct detection of their IR fingerprint.</p>
<p>If I is an intermediate with a low stability, it is hard to detect; if I0 is a stable intermediate it will easily be detected. The transition state A* or I* is not detectable.</p>
<p>Direct observation of the active sites is possible when Brnsted-acid sites are considered and this possibility is well illustrated by the zeolites or silica, for which the hydroxyl groups can be directly observed through their n(OH) bands.</p>
<p>Case of Brnsted-acid sites. Direct observation of the potential active sites is possible when Brnsted-acid sites are considered and this possibility is well illustrated by the zeolites or silica, for which the hydroxyl groups can be directly observed through their n(OH) bands.</p>
<p>Case of Lewis-acid sites. Direct IR observation of a Lewis-acid site itself is not possible since a coordinatively unsaturated site is not a vibrator.</p>
<p>Proper selection of probe molecules is essential for obtaining information on the physicalchemical properties of the surface entities.</p>
<p>On the way to catalyst optimisation and rational design, we have to thoroughly characterize the active sites, particularly when in action, considering that they are not static entities, but they undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena.</p>
<p>IR spectroscopy is a technique particularly adapted for understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions, being able to probe the surface mechanisms at the molecular level.</p>
<p>For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site.</p>
<p>The best examples are probably those given by the zeolites, for which the strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p>Whatever the probe molecule used, the best one is the reactant itself, providing the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction.</p>
<p>The best conditions for a study appear to be those during the reaction, i.e. the operando conditions (real in situ).</p>
<p>Impurities and surface activation IR is a very sensitive technique for detecting surface impurities such as water, carbonates (formed by catalyst contact with ambient atmosphere), organics and other residual species after synthesis, such as nitrates, sulfates, templates, etc., because these species present characteristic bands in the IR spectra.</p>
<p>Thermal stability of these species strongly depends on acid-base properties of the material: on relatively acidic compounds (alumina, zirconia, ...), carbonate and nitrate species can be removed at mild temperatures.</p>
<p>In the case of sulfates, a reducing treatment at higher temperature is even necessary to clean the surface, but traces of sulfur can remain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we should consider the fact that these residual species are essentially bulk moieties, almost inert during the catalytic process; therefore it is better to leave them in place rather than to heat the sample at very high temperature (with the aim to clean all the impurities), so producing a drastic sintering of its surface.</p>
<p>The increase of the temperature of activation for metal oxides not only removes the impurities and molecularly adsorbed water but also leads to surface reconstruction, due to the elimination of hydroxyls, according to the mechanism involving two MOH groups: 2 MOH - MOM + H2O (with the possible creation of a vacancy).</p>
