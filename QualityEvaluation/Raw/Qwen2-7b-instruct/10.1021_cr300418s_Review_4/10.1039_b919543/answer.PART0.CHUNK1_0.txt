The characterization of dopants in metal oxide catalysts requires a comprehensive approach that includes various techniques. These techniques aim to address the challenges of establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. The following methods are crucial:

1. Coupling of different analytical techniques such as DRIFT (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy) with hard X-ray diffraction. This allows for a detailed examination of the local properties of the catalyst at the nanoscale, including the formation of surface and bulk species and their evolution.

2. Utilizing techniques like Raman spectroscopy, which provides a complete overview of the vibrational spectrum. This technique offers insights into the structure and dynamics of the catalyst, contributing to a deeper understanding of its behavior.

These methods collectively enable researchers to accurately assess the impact of dopants on the catalyst's structure and performance, providing evidence that accounts for structural changes and enhanced activity, while excluding alternative explanations.
