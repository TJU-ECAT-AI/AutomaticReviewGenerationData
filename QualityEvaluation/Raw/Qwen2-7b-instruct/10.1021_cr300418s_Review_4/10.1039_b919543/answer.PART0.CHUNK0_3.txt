Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis is finding an increasing importance in everyday life. The industrial heterogeneous catalysts are shaped multifunctional devices intended to offer to the reacting agents a multitude of active sites, distributed on the external surface or inside the porosity of the materials, in order to optimise the contact between the reacting molecule and the transformation centre in the sense of the Sabatiers principle.

The introduction discusses the growing significance of heterogeneous catalysis in daily life. Industrial heterogeneous catalysts are designed as multifunctional devices that provide numerous active sites across their surfaces and pores, optimizing the interaction between reactants and the catalytic center, in accordance with Sabatier's principle.

The article further explains that the active sites are the locations where reactions cross the energy barrier, and are inherently connected to intermediate species. They can be affected by poisoning substances that may form during the reaction. Precise design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, ...) is crucial for obtaining the optimal catalyst. For the purpose of catalyst optimization and rational design, it is essential to thoroughly characterize the active sites, especially when they are in operation, considering that they are not static entities but undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuring phenomena.

The text elaborates that the active sites are the areas where reactions traverse the energy barrier, and are inherently linked to intermediate species. They can be impacted by poisoning agents that might arise during the reaction. Accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, location, etc.) is vital for achieving the best catalyst. For catalyst optimization and rational design, it is imperative to extensively characterize the active sites, particularly when they are operational, acknowledging that they are not stationary entities but evolve based on reaction conditions and surface reconfiguration processes.

文章进一步解释说，活性位点是反应穿越能垒的地方，并且与中间物种固有相关联。它们可能受到在反应过程中形成的毒物的影响。对活性位点（在质量、强度、位置等方面）进行精确设计对于获得最佳催化剂至关重要。为了实现催化剂优化和合理设计，必须深入研究活性位点，特别是在它们运行时，考虑到它们不是静态实体，而是根据反应条件和表面重构现象而发生变化。

The text highlights that accurate identification of potential active sites through IR spectroscopy is possible via direct detection of their IR fingerprint or by employing probe molecules to obtain a spectroscopic response for the sites. Zeolites are mentioned as examples where strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups. If direct detection is not feasible, specific methodologies must be utilized to generate a spectroscopic response for the sites. Common methods involve adsorption of probe molecules, which provides IR spectra that are specific to the interaction with a single site.

Zeolites serve as examples where strong Brnsted-acid sites are typically identified via the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups. If direct detection is not possible, tailored approaches must be employed to elicit a spectroscopic response for the sites. Typical methodologies involve adsorbing probe molecules, which yield IR spectra that are uniquely associated with the interaction with a single site.

文本强调，通过直接观察其红外指纹或应用探针分子以获得对单个位点的光谱响应，可以准确识别潜在的活性位点，这可以通过红外光谱技术实现。例如，沸石中强Brnsted酸位点通常通过羟基团的n(OH)带进行识别。如果直接检测不可行，则需要采用特定方法来产生对位点的光谱响应。常见的方法是吸附探针分子，这些分子提供了特异性反映与单一位点交互的红外谱图。

The text mentions that surface relaxation and reconstruction phenomena might not permit accurate identification of the nature of Lewis-acid sites via the study of spectra after probe molecule adsorption for the majority of metal oxides. However, this is not the case for most hybrid organic-inorganic solids such as MOFs (metalorganic frameworks), which are crystalline nanoporous solids with an inorganic framework of clusters, chains, or planes and organic linkers. These materials present framework metal sites that can exhibit coordinative vacancies upon solvent removal; such sites represent Lewis-acid centers of well-defined symmetry and oxidation degree. The text illustrates this with the example of MIL-100/101(Cr) where three n(CO) bands are observed, demonstrating that Cr3+ sites are not equivalent. The heterogeneity is attributed to the possible presence of fluoride ions (synthesis being performed in the presence of hydrofluoric acid) on the metallic trimers, with 2, 1, or no fluorine ion in the neighborhood of the coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Cr3+ considered site.

The document notes that surface relaxation and reconstruction phenomena might prevent the accurate identification of the characteristics of Lewis-acid sites through the examination of spectra after probe molecule adsorption for the majority of metal oxides. However, this is not applicable to most hybrid organic-inorganic materials, such as MOFs (metal-organic frameworks), which are crystalline nanoporous solids featuring an inorganic network of clusters, chains, or planes and organic linkers. These materials exhibit framework metal sites that become coordinatively vacant upon solvent removal; these sites serve as well-defined Lewis-acid centers with a specific symmetry and oxidation state. The text exemplifies this with the case of MIL-100/101(Cr), where three n(CO) bands are observed, indicating that Cr3+ sites are not identical. The diversity is attributed to the potential presence of fluoride ions (synthesis conducted in the presence of hydrofluoric acid) on the metal trimers, with 2, 1, or no fluoride ion in proximity to the coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Cr3+ site considered.

文档提到，对于大多数金属氧化物，表面松弛和重构现象可能不允许通过吸附探针分子后的光谱研究准确识别Lewis酸位点的性质。然而，对于大多数杂合有机-无机固体，如MOFs（金属有机框架），它们是具有簇、链或平面的无机骨架和有机连接子的结晶纳米多孔固体。这些材料在溶剂去除后表现出可协调的空位；这些位点代表具有明确对称性和氧化度的Lewis酸中心。文本通过MIL-100/101(Cr)的例子进行了说明，在此情况下观察到三个n(CO)带，表明Cr3+位点并非等效。这种异质性归因于在合成过程中使用氢氟酸的情况下，金属三聚体附近可能存在的氟离子的存在，其中有2、1或没有氟离子环绕考虑的协调未饱和（CUS）Cr3+位点。
