[1] "The most common method for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts is by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These techniques allow for the examination of the crystal structure and morphology of the catalyst, respectively, providing insights into the presence and distribution of dopants."
[2] "Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are also used to quantitatively analyze the dopant concentration and depth profiles within the catalyst matrix."
[3] "In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) can provide detailed structural information about the dopant incorporation and its effect on the crystal lattice."
[4] "To establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance, researchers often employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These computational methods simulate the electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the dopants, predicting their impact on the catalyst's activity."
[5] "Moreover, in situ spectroscopic techniques such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are crucial for monitoring the changes in the catalyst's surface properties and reactivity during the reaction process."
[6] "By combining these characterization methods with careful experimental design, it is possible to rule out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic performance and attribute improvements directly to the dopant incorporation."
