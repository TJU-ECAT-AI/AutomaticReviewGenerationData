The characterization methods that are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include IR analysis coupled with gravimetry and thermogravimetry (TGA). These techniques allow for the description and ranking of physicalchemical properties of the sites, including acidity, basicity, and redox properties, against reference compounds. The strength and site concentrations of these properties are quantified. The coupling of IR with gravimetry provides insights into the weight changes in the sample, while TGA enables monitoring of these changes. Combined thermogravimetry and IR analysis, known as AGIR (Analysis by Gravimetry and IR), is also utilized to study operando conditions. The changes in adsorption sites with coverage affect the shifting and modification of the bands, altering their shape and intensity.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键表征方法包括结合IR分析与称重法（TGA）的使用。这些技术允许描述和排名位点的物理化学性质，包括酸度、碱度和氧化还原性质，并将其与参考化合物进行比较。这些性质的强度和位点浓度被量化。通过将IR与称重法结合，可以获得样品重量变化的信息，而TGA则可以监测这些变化。结合热重分析和IR分析（AGIR，即由称重法和IR分析组成的分析）也被应用于研究操作条件。吸附位点随覆盖度的变化导致带的偏移和修改，改变其形状和强度。
