[1] "The role of the pores was demonstrated for the protection of small particles during ageing of the catalyst, and sintering was limited by the pore diameter where the particle was located."
[2] "Coupling IR with gravimetry. Thermo-gravitimetric analysis (TGA) allows monitoring weight changes in the sample."
[3] "Combined thermogravimetry and IR was also applied to operando conditions, and denoted as AGIR (Analysis by Gravimetry and IR): a modified microbalance was used to follow mass changes (mg accuracy) inside a catalytic reactor equipped with infrared windows."
[4] "Adsorption sites change with coverage, and bands are shifted and their shape and intensity are modified."
[5] "Other coupled techniques. As we have mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of this review is to critically discuss the characterization of the active site in catalytical processes by using IR analysis compared with catalytic tests."
[6] "Sometimes, additional information can be provided by the coupling of complemental techniques able to yield enhanced insight into material local properties (structural, textural, physical, . . .) and reactional events at the nano-scale."
