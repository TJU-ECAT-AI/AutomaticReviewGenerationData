[3] "After having presented the general methodology to observe a potential active site directly or by probe molecule adsorption,several examples illustrate the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the physicalchemical properties of the surface entities."
[4] "The active centres are the sites where the reaction crosses the energy barrier, as classically represented in Fig. 1."
[5] "An accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, . . .) is obviously the key to obtain the optimum catalyst."
[6] "For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site."
[7] "In this contribution, we will present how it is possible to evidence the adsorption sites on a catalyst, particularly using Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie, ENSICAEN, Universite de Caen, CNRS, 6 Bd Mare chal Juin, F-14050 Caen, France."

[10] "In the case of the metal oxides, surface relaxation and reconstruction phenomena might not allow to accurately identify the nature of the Lewis-acid sites (coordination, oxidation degree, unsaturation degree) via the study of spectra after the adsorption of probe molecules."
[11] "The combined use of these two molecules moreover helped us to better characterize the various coordinated NH4 + and determine the activity ranking between the ammonium species and coordinated ammonia over Lewis sites during NOx SCR."
[12] "On the contrary, this is not the case for the majority of hybrid organicinorganic solids such as MOFs (metalorganic frameworks), which are crystalline nanoporous solids, with a framework of inorganic units (clusters, chains or planes) and organic linkers (phosphonates, carboxylates, sulfonates)."
[13] "Acetonitrile has also shown that the basicity of the probe is influenced by the adsorption on the solid, especially on zeolites where confinement is important."
[14] "Moreover,a thorough spectral characterization of KBr-diluted samples indicated that the higher the intensity of unidentate carbonate bands (1499 and 1382 cm1), the higher the sterol ester yield."
[15] "The use of IR spectroscopy should add value to this form of characterisation: adsorption of CS2 on a series of metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO and CeO2) gave rise to a specific interaction with O2 sites, leading to the formation of xanthate (COS2)2 species characterized by bands in the 12001000 cm1 range whose intensities correlate well with the relative basicity of the analyzed oxides."

To address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations, a comprehensive set of characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial. These include:

1. **Direct Observation of Active Sites**: Using infrared spectroscopy (IR) to directly observe and characterize the active sites on catalyst surfaces. This involves identifying IR signatures that correspond to specific sites, such as Brnsted-acid sites (OH groups) or Lewis-acid sites (like AlO species).

2. **Use of Probe Molecules**: Employing specific molecules, like CO, NO, or CO2, to adsorb onto the surface and provide IR signatures that indicate the presence and nature of the active sites. This helps distinguish between bare adsorption centers and active sites by observing perturbations caused by the adsorption of these molecules.

3. **Time-Resolved Studies**: Utilizing time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to monitor the dynamics of adsorbed probe molecules on the catalyst surface. This technique can reveal the transient behavior of the active sites, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and intermediates.

4. **Accessibility Analysis**: Determining the accessibility of sites through isotope labeling, such as deuteration of OH groups. This helps assess whether a site is truly active and accessible to reactants and products, ruling out non-accessible sites as sources of enhanced catalytic performance.

5. **Quantitative Analysis**: Conducting quantitative analysis of IR spectra to determine the concentration and strength of active sites. Techniques like CO adsorption can be used to calculate metal dispersion, offering insights into the spatial distribution of active sites.

6. **Comprehensive Spectral Characterization**: Characterizing the full range of spectral features, including overtones, combination bands, and low-frequency modes, to gain a deeper understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the surface entities.

These methods, when applied systematically and in concert, provide a robust framework for elucidating the relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. By correlating spectral data with catalytic outcomes and excluding alternative explanations, researchers can confidently attribute observed enhancements to specific dopant-induced structural modifications and their impact on catalytic activity.

为了在确定掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间的明确关系的同时，排除其他可能的解释，需要采用一系列全面的表征方法和分析策略。这些方法包括：

1. 直接观察活性位点：使用红外光谱（IR）直接观察和表征催化剂表面的活性位点。这涉及到识别与特定位点相对应的IR特征，例如Brnsted酸位点（OH基团）或Lewis酸位点（如AlO物种）。

2. 使用探针分子：利用特定分子，如CO、NO或CO2，在表面上吸附，并提供指示活性位点存在的IR信号。通过观察这些分子吸附引起的扰动，可以区分无活性吸附中心和活性位点。

3. 时间分辨研究：利用时间分辨红外光谱监测吸附到催化剂表面的探针分子的动态行为。这种技术可以揭示活性位点的瞬态行为，提供反应机制和中间体的见解。

4. 接近性分析：通过同位素标记，如OH基团的脱氘化，来确定位点的接近性。这有助于评估一个位点是否真正可接近反应物和产物，从而排除非可接近位点作为催化性能增强来源的可能性。

5. 定量分析：对IR谱进行定量分析，以确定活性位点的数量和强度。CO吸附等技术可用于计算金属分散度，提供活性位点空间分布的见解。

6. 全面谱特征化：对整个谱特征进行全面分析，包括泛音、组合带和低频模式，以深入了解表面实体的物理和化学性质。

通过系统地应用并结合这些方法，可以建立一个强大的框架，用于阐明掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间的关系。通过将光谱数据与催化结果相关联，并排除其他可能的解释，研究人员可以自信地将观察到的增强归因于特定掺杂剂诱导的结构修改及其对催化活性的影响。
