[1] "Combined in situ-EPR/UVVIS/on line-GC measurements were performed using a home-made flow reactor which was implemented in the rectangular cavity of a c.w. spectrometer ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) operating in X-band."
[2] "For on line product analysis, the reactor outlet was connected to a GC 17AAF capillary gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a 30 m 3 0.32 mm Silicaplot column (Chrompack) and a FID."
[3] "This setup has been used to study the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over two CrOx catalysts: (a) Cr/La,Al2O3 prepared by thermal decomposition of ammonium dawsonite, NH4Al(OH)2CO3, doped with 10 wt% Cr and 3.9 wt% La and (b) Cr//La,ZrO2 prepared by impregnating a commercial 7 wt% La2O3/ZrO2 support (MEL-CAT XZ0681/01, MEL Chemicals) with an aqueous (NH4)2CrO4 solution to result in a Cr loading of 0.5 wt% followed by calcination at 873 K."
[4] "The as-synthesized catalysts contain mainly hexavalent chromate species evidenced by intense CT bands around 370 nm in the UVVIS spectra [Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)]9 besides traces of Cr5+ species that give rise to the very narrow singlet at gA  1.97 in the EPR spectra [Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)]."
[5] "Simultaneously, the narrow EPR singlets of Cr5+ disappear and a broad singlet at gA  2 arises from weakly interacting Cr3+ species [Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)]."
[6] "With increasing time on stream at 810 K the propane conversion over the Cr/La,ZrO2 catalyst drops markedly [Fig. 2(c)]. This is due to the partial coverage of active Cr3+ sites by coke deposits."
[7] "Unfortunately, the dd bands of Cr3+ ions and bands of the different carbonaceous deposites fall partially in the same wavelength range."
[8] "This obviously can not markedly be prevented by doping with La."
[9] "The obtained results demonstrate that the simultaneous coupling of in situ-EPR/UVVIS/on-line-GC is a powerful new tool to follow the reaction-dependent interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behaviour of CrOx catalysts."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include combined in situ-EPR/UVVIS/on line-GC measurements. These techniques allow for the simultaneous monitoring of the behavior of lanthanum-doped chromium oxide catalysts under working conditions, specifically during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The setup involves a home-made flow reactor integrated with a continuous-wave spectrometer, a fiber optics spectrometer for UVVIS reflectance, and a GC system for on-line product analysis. By using this setup, researchers can observe the interconversion of different chromium oxidation states and the deactivation behavior of the catalysts, addressing the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. The techniques rule out alternative explanations by providing real-time data on the catalyst's behavior under actual reaction conditions, ensuring the observed effects are directly related to the dopants' incorporation and distribution rather than other factors.

The setup allows for the study of two specific catalysts: one containing chromium doped with lanthanum on aluminum oxide (Cr/La,Al2O3), and the other on zirconia (Cr//La,ZrO2). The as-synthesized catalysts exhibit hexavalent chromate species, which convert to trivalent chromium species upon heating under feed conditions. This conversion is accompanied by a decrease in catalytic activity due to coke deposition on the active chromium sites. The use of UVVIS and EPR spectroscopy enables the differentiation between chromium oxidation states, while GC provides insights into the formation and impact of carbon deposits on the catalyst's performance. The results highlight the importance of simultaneous measurement techniques in understanding the complex interactions between dopants, catalyst structure, and catalytic activity, thereby providing a powerful tool for optimizing catalyst design and performance.

为了验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功整合和均匀分布，关键的全面表征方法和分析策略包括结合原位EPR/UVVIS/在线GC测量。这些技术允许同时监测镧掺杂铬氧化物催化剂在工作条件下的行为，特别是在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中。该设置包括一个自制的流反应器与连续波光谱仪集成，用于纤维光学光谱仪的UVVIS反射率，以及用于在线产品分析的GC系统。通过使用此设置，研究人员可以观察不同铬氧化态之间的反应依赖性互转化和催化剂的失活行为，从而解决确定掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间关系的挑战，并排除其他因素的可能影响。这些技术通过提供实际反应条件下催化剂行为的实时数据，确保观察到的效果直接与掺杂剂的整合和分布相关，而不是其他因素。

该设置允许研究两种特定催化剂：一种是含镧的铝氧化物（Cr/La,Al2O3）上的铬，另一种是氧化锆（Cr//La,ZrO2）。合成后的催化剂显示六价铬化合物，在加热至供料条件下会转化为三价铬化合物。这种转换伴随着由于焦炭沉积在活性铬位点上导致催化活性下降。UVVIS和EPR光谱分析能够区分铬的氧化状态，而GC则提供了了解碳沉积物对催化剂性能影响的见解。结果强调了同时测量技术在理解掺杂剂、催化剂结构和催化活性之间复杂相互作用的重要性，从而提供了一种优化催化剂设计和性能的强大工具。
