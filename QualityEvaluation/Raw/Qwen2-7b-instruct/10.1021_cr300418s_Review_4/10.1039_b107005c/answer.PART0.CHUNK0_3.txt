The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy, and on-line GC. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction. For instance, UVVIS diffuse reflectance allows monitoring of the structure and valence state of TMI, while EPR spectroscopy provides insights into the coordination environment and oxidation states. By coupling these techniques, researchers can observe the interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and deactivation behavior of CrOx catalysts under working conditions. The stability and activity of the catalysts against deactivation, influenced by factors such as the incorporation of Cr ions in the lattice positions of the catalyst bulk, are also elucidated. The results demonstrate that the simultaneous coupling of in situ-EPR/UVVIS/on-line-GC is a powerful new tool to follow the reaction-dependent interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behavior of CrOx catalysts.

用于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括原位EPR、原位UVVIS光谱学和在线GC。这些技术通过提供有关反应过程中过渡金属离子（TMI）结构和电荷状态的补充信息，解决了确定掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间关系的挑战。例如，UVVIS散射反射允许监测TMI的结构和电荷状态，而EPR光谱学提供了关于配合环境和氧化态的见解。通过将这些技术耦合起来，研究人员可以观察不同Cr氧化态之间的相互转换以及CrOx催化剂的工作条件下的失活行为。催化剂稳定性及其对失活的抗性，受到诸如Cr离子在催化剂基体晶格位置中的掺入等因素的影响，也被阐明。结果表明，同时结合原位EPR/UVVIS/在线GC是一种强大的新工具，可用于跟踪不同Cr氧化态的反应依赖性互变以及CrOx催化剂的失活行为。
