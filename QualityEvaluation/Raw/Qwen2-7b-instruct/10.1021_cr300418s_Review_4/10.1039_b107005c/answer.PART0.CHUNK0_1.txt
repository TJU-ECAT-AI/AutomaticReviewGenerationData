[1] "Understanding the role of active sites in solid catalysts under working conditions is a major research goal in heterogeneous catalysis and a number of spectroscopic techniques have been adapted in recent years to study solid catalysts during reaction,1 among them UVVIS diffuse reflectance2,3 and EPR spectros- copy.4,5 These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction."
[2] "Combined in situ-EPR/UVVIS measurements were performed using a home-made flow reactor4,5 which was implemented in the rectangular cavity of a c.w. spectrometer ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) operating in X-band."
[3] "Moreover, this set-up ensures identical reaction conditions for both spectroscopic techniques that are almost equal to those usually applied in catalytic tests since a fixed-bed flow reactor of similar dimensions is used."
[4] "The obtained results demonstrate that the simultaneous coupling of in situ-EPR/UVVIS/on-line-GC is a powerful new tool to follow the reaction-dependent interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behaviour of CrOx catalysts."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy, and on-line GC. These techniques allow researchers to monitor the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reactions, providing complementary information on the active sites in solid catalysts under working conditions. The simultaneous coupling of these methods ensures identical reaction conditions for both spectroscopic techniques, facilitating a direct comparison and enhancing the accuracy of the characterization. The obtained results confirm that this combination is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic behavior of transition metals and their deactivation mechanisms in metal oxide catalysts.
