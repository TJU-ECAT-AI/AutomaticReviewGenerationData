[1] "Understanding the role of active sites in solid catalysts under working conditions is a major research goal in heterogeneous catalysis and a number of spectroscopic techniques have been adapted in recent years to study solid catalysts during reaction,1 among them UVVIS diffuse reflectance2,3 and EPR spectros- copy.4,5 These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction."
[2] "Combined in situ-EPR/UVVIS measurements were performed using a home-made flow reactor4,5 which was implemented in the rectangular cavity of a c.w. spectrometer ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) operating in X-band."
[3] "This setup has been used to study the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over two CrOx catalysts: (a) Cr/La,Al2O3 prepared by thermal decomposition of ammonium dawsonite, NH4Al(OH)2CO3, doped with 10 wt% Cr and 3.9 wt% La and (b) Cr//La,ZrO2 prepared by impregnating a commercial 7 wt% La2O3/ZrO2 support (MEL-CAT XZ0681/01, MEL Chemicals) with an aqueous (NH4)2CrO4 solution to result in a Cr loading of 0.5 wt% followed by calcination at 873 K."
[4] "The as-synthesized catalysts contain mainly hexavalent chromate species evidenced by intense CT bands around 370 nm in the UVVIS spectra [Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)]9 besides traces of Cr5+ species that give rise to the very narrow singlet at gA  1.97 in the EPR spectra [Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)]."
[5] "With increasing time on stream at 810 K the propane conversion over the Cr/La,ZrO2 catalyst drops markedly [Fig. 2(c)]. This is due to the partial coverage of active Cr3+ sites by coke deposits.6 As a consequence, the EPR singlet of Cr3+ loses intensity since magnetic interaction with paramagnetic coke species may cause line broadening."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ-EPR and UVVIS spectroscopy, along with on-line GC. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction. For instance, they can monitor the interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behavior of CrOx catalysts in real-time. This ensures identical reaction conditions for both spectroscopic techniques, eliminating limitations in comparability that could arise from variations of the reaction conditions when using different in situ-cells for separate measurements. The results demonstrate that these techniques can provide insights into the dynamics of dopant incorporation and its impact on the catalyst's performance and stability under working conditions.

验证掺杂剂成功引入和均相分布在金属氧化物催化剂中的关键全面表征方法和分析方法包括原位EPR和UVVIS光谱学，以及在线GC。这些技术通过提供反应过程中过渡金属离子（TMI）结构和电荷状态的补充信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战。例如，它们可以实时监控不同Cr氧化态之间的互变以及CrOx催化剂的失活行为。这确保了两种光谱技术具有相同的反应条件，消除了使用不同原位单元进行单独测量时可能产生的比较限制。结果表明，这些技术可以提供关于掺杂剂引入动态及其对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响的见解。
