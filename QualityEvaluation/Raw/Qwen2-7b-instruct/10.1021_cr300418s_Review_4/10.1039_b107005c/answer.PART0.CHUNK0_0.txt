The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include in situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy, and on-line GC. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by ensuring identical reaction conditions for both spectroscopic techniques. They eliminate limitations in comparability of spectroscopic results arising from variations of reaction conditions when different in situ-cells are used for separate measurements. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by studying the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over CrOx catalysts.

验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括原位EPR、原位UVVIS光谱学和在线GC。这些技术通过确保两种光谱技术的相同反应条件来解决建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战。它们消除了使用不同原位细胞进行单独测量时产生比较光谱结果差异的可能性。作者通过研究CrOx催化剂上丙烷脱氢到丙烯，证明了这种方法的有效性。
