[1] "The structure of 0.51 atom % Rh/CeO2 is important, because the maximum Rh loading required is less than 1 atom %. To see how the Rh-related phases evolve with increase in Rh loading, 2 atom% Rh/CeO2 was studied."
[2] "The hydrogen uptake measurement demonstrated the unique interaction of Rh and CeO2 in terms of the decrease in reduction temperature from 180 C in pure Rh2O3 to 100  10 C in Rh/CeO2 catalysts."
[3] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ions substitute for Ce4+ ions primarily on the surface in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution."
[4] "Based on this Ce1-xRhxO2-δ model, we propose following redox mechanism for CO oxidation by O2."
[5] "The metalceria interaction in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution mostly in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites is responsible for enhanced catalytic activity."
