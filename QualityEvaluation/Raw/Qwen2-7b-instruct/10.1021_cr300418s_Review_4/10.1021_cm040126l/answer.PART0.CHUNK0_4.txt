[1] "In comparison to Rh metal and Rh2O3, the Rh ions dispersed over CeO2 are more active for CO oxidation."
[2] "H2/Rh ratio of 5.4, 2.4, and 2.1, respectively, for 0.5, 1, and 2% Rh/CeO2 suggests sufficiently high contribution from ceria reduction at lower temperature."
[3] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
[4] "A Rh3+OCe4+ correlation at 3.16 Å in Rh/CeO2 catalysts has been shown from EXAFS analysis."
[5] "The metalceria interaction in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution mostly in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites is responsible for enhanced catalytic activity."

1. 扩散在CeO2上的Rh离子在CO氧化中比Rh金属和Rh2O3更活跃。
2. Rh/CeO2催化剂中的H2/Rh比例表明，低温下CeO2的还原贡献显著。
3. EXAFS分析显示，Rh离子在CeO2的表面层中替代Ce4+离子，并且周围有氧离子空位。
4. Rh/CeO2催化剂中识别出一个Rh3+OCe4+在3.16 Å的关联通过EXAFS分析。
5. Rh与CeO2之间的交互作用，表现为Ce1-xRhxO2-δ固溶体，是催化活性增强的原因。
