[1] "In the present study, we have carried out systematic structural investigations on combustion-synthesized Rh/CeO2 catalysts."
[2] "It has been an endeavor of researchers to reduce the amount of noble metal content without adversely affecting their catalytic properties."
[3] "Ionic dispersion is an effective way to achieve this."
[4] "Combustion synthesis provides in a single step ionically dispersed metal on ceria support."
[5] "The structure of 0.51 atom % Rh/CeO2 is important, because the maximum Rh loading required is less than 1 atom %. To see how the Rh-related phases evolve with increase in Rh loading, 2 atom% Rh/CeO2 was studied."
[6] "In 0.5 and 1 atom % Rh/CeO2, Rh is fully in the oxidized state, which is the real catalyst."
[7] "EXAFS studies show that Rh ions substitute for Ce4+ ions primarily on the surface in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution."
[8] "Since Rh is present in the +3 state in combustion-synthesized Rh/CeO2, Rh3+ ions should be the active sites for CO adsorption in the CO + O2 reaction."
[9] "Therefore, lower temperature CO + O2 reaction over combustion-synthesized Rh/CeO2 is attributed to RhCeO2 interaction in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution having Rh3+OCe4+O site distribution in the surface layers of the catalyst crystallites."
[10] "Based on this Ce1-xRhxO2-δ model, we propose following redox mechanism for CO oxidation by O2."
[11] "The effect of addition of CeO2 and PMs in terms of higher catalytic activity (decrease in reaction temperature and higher rate of conversion) has been known for a long time, and it was generally attributed to strong metalsupport interaction."

The characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the presence of dopants and confirm their structural integration within the host material.
2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the size, shape, and spatial distribution of dopants within the catalyst matrix.
3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the oxidation state and surface concentration of dopants.
4. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to analyze the local atomic environment and coordination numbers of dopants.
5. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to assess the redox properties and interaction strength between dopants and the support material.
6. Hydrogen uptake measurements to evaluate the oxygen storage capacity and reduction behavior of the catalyst.
7. Catalytic tests to measure the efficiency and activity of the catalyst under various reaction conditions.

These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations. They allow researchers to:

- Confirm the incorporation of dopants and their homogeneous distribution throughout the catalyst matrix.
- Understand the local chemical environment and coordination of dopants, which affects their reactivity and stability.
- Evaluate the redox properties and interaction strength between dopants and the support material, which influence the catalytic activity.
- Measure the oxygen storage capacity and reaction kinetics of the catalyst, providing insights into its overall performance.
- Compare the catalytic activity of the modified catalyst with reference materials to quantify the improvement in performance.
