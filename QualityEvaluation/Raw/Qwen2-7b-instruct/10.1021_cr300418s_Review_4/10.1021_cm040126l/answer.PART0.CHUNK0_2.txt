<p>It has been an endeavor of researchers to reduce the amount of noble metal content without adversely affecting their catalytic properties. Ionic dispersion is an effective way to achieve this.</p>
<p>In 0.5 and 1 atom % Rh/CeO2, Rh is fully in the oxidized state, which is the real catalyst. The CO oxidation study has demonstrated that even 0.5 atom % Rh is sufficient to effect high catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The hydrogen uptake measurement demonstrated the unique interaction of Rh and CeO2 in terms of the decrease in reduction temperature from 180 C in pure Rh2O3 to 100  10 C in Rh/CeO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>EXAFS studies show that Rh ions substitute for Ce4+ ions primarily on the surface in the form of Ce1-xRhxO2-δ solid solution.</p>
<p>Based on this Ce1-xRhxO2-δ model, we propose following redox mechanism for CO oxidation by O2.</p>
<p>In the above mechanism, one Rh3+ ion is reducing to Rh0, and conversion of Rh0 to Rh3+ via the holes (h•) created seems to reduce three Ce4+ to Ce3+.</p>
<p>Our study therefore explains the qualitative description in catalysis literature, namely, high dispersion, higher oxygen storage capacity, higher catalytic activity, and strong metalsupport interaction of Rh/CeO2 system.</p>
