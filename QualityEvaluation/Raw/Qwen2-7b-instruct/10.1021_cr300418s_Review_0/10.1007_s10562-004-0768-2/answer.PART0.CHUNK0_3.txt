[1] "In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
[2] "That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals."
[3] "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]."
[4] "Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1]."
[5] "A key feature of Au grown on TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support, yielding electron-rich Au [16]."
[6] "In the late seventies and eighties considerable attention was given the unusual properties of metals supported on TiO2 when reduced at relatively high temperatures, results first reported by Tauster et al. for supported Pt and Ir [20], and designated as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)."
[7] "Specifically the following parallels can be drawn between catalytically active Au on TiO2 and the SMSI effect:"
[8] "For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au [3]."
[9] "Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania [18,39]."
[10] "Similarly, for Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support [41] causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au [1]."

1. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) phenomenon involves the spreading of metal particles on the support, which results in the formation of a bilayer structure. This structure is electron-rich, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical methods. It nucleates on reduced titanium defects generated by annealing to temperatures above 750 K. The metal becomes deactivated through sintering in an oxygen-rich environment. These findings suggest that the fundamental principles governing the activation of gold on titania are also applicable to SMSI involving Group VIII metals.

2. The electron transfer from the titania support to the metal leads to the metal becoming electron-rich. This is consistent with observations made using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for active gold/titania catalysts, as well as density functional calculations that indicate gold remains electron-rich when supported on titania.

3. The SMSI effect involves the metal spreading across the support, wetting its surface. This wetting process is accompanied by the formation of a bilayer structure, which is transparent to electron probes like XPS. The accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface might be misinterpreted as the migration of a titanium oxide species onto the metal during the SMSI formation process. This could lead to an incorrect assumption that a similar migration occurs in the case of gold on titania.

1. SMSI现象涉及金属颗粒在支撑材料上的扩散，形成双层结构。这种结构电子丰富，由实验和理论方法证实。它在高于750K的温度下在还原钛缺陷上形成。金属通过氧气中的再氧化过程失活。这些发现表明，控制黄金在钛酸盐激活的基本原理也适用于涉及第VIII组金属的SMSI。

2. 从钛酸盐支持体到金属的电子转移导致金属变得电子丰富。这与使用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）对活性金/钛酸盐催化剂的观察一致，以及密度泛函计算表明当金支持在钛酸盐上时，金仍然是电子丰富的。

3. SMSI效应涉及金属在整个支撑体上的扩散，润湿其表面。这个润湿过程伴随着形成双层结构，这种结构对电子探针如XPS是透明的。在簇-支撑界面处可能积累的缺陷可能被错误地解释为在SMSI形成过程中钛氧化物物种迁移到金属上。这可能导致错误假设类似的迁移发生在金/钛酸盐体系中。
