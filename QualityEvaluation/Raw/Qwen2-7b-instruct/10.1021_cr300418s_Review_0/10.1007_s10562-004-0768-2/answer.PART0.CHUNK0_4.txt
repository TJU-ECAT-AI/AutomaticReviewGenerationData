(1) "In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr.VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
(2) "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies with catalytic activity for CO oxidation."
(3) "A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes access of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation."
(4) "The essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating new active centers and altering the electronic structure of the catalyst. This can lead to enhanced catalytic activity through changes in the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, and the activation energy of chemical reactions. It also affects the location and nature of active centers, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in industrially relevant reactions.

2. The modification of surface chemistry and disruption of chemical bonding due to substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts enhances catalytic activity by improving the stability of the active sites, reducing the activation energy of reactions, and facilitating better interaction between the catalyst and reactants. This results in potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming processes, leading to higher yields, selectivities, and lower energy consumption.

3. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts are influenced by substitutional cation doping. By introducing dopants, the electronic structure of the catalyst is altered, which can lead to the creation of new active sites with distinct reactivity patterns. The location of these active centers is determined by the dopant's affinity for specific regions of the catalyst surface and its ability to interact with reactants and products. This can result in optimized catalytic performance tailored to specific reaction conditions.

4. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions through substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts include increased efficiency, selectivity, and stability. By enhancing the catalytic activity, these catalysts can lead to reduced energy consumption, lower costs, and minimized environmental impact in industries such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy production. Additionally, the ability to tune the catalyst's properties allows for better adaptation to changing process conditions and optimization of reaction pathways for improved product quality and yield.
