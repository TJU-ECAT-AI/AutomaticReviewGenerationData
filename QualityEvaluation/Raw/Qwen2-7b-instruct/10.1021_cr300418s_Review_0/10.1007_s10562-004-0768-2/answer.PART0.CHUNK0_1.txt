"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by enhancing the catalytic activity through the formation of a bilayer structure. This structure exhibits metal-nonmetal transitions and is electron-rich, which enhances the catalytic activity. The nucleation process occurs on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures above 750 K. The deactivation happens via sintering in an oxygen environment.
