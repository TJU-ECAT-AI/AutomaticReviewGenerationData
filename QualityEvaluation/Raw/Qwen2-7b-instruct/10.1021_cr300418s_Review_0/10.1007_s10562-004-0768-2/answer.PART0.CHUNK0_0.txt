"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
"A key feature of Au grown on TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support, yielding electron-rich Au."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing defects and altering chemical bonding, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the creation of these defects, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions through optimized surface properties and reactivity.
