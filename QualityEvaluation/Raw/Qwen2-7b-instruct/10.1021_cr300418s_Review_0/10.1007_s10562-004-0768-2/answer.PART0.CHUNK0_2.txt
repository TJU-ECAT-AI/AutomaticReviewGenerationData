(1) "Specifically the following parallels can be drawn between catalytically active Au on TiO2 and the SMSI effect:(1) Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI."
(2) "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal [34]."
(3) "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
(4) "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals [22,23]."
(5) "Similarly, for Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support [41] causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au [1]."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the electronic properties and disrupting chemical bonding. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity through the creation of new active centers and improved reactivity. The location of these active centers is influenced by the doping process, which can lead to localized changes in the catalyst's surface. As a result, industrially relevant reactions can be improved due to the optimized reactivity and selectivity provided by the modified catalysts.
