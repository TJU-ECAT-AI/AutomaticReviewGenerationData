1. The substitution of sodium chloride (NaCl) for lithium chloride (LiCl) in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification increases the efficiency of converting methane into ethylene and higher alkenes, with yields ranging from 15.7-30.6% at 750°C. The active centers become more effective due to the altered electronic properties and structure of the catalysts.

2. The nature and location of active centers in these catalysts are influenced by the substitutional cation doping. Sodium chloride doping leads to the creation of more active sites for methane conversion compared to lithium chloride doping. These active sites are more effective in promoting the desired chemical reactions.

3. The industrial relevance of these findings lies in the potential to increase the yield and efficiency of methane conversion processes, particularly in the production of ethylene and other alkenes. The improved stability and catalytic activity of NaCl/Mn-oxide compared to LiCl/Mn-oxide make it a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane, offering significant improvements over previous catalysts.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中用氯化钠（NaCl）替换氯化锂（LiCl）改变了表面化学性质和破坏了化学键，导致催化活性增强。这种改变提高了将甲烷转化为乙烯和其他烯烃的效率，转化率在750°C时为15.7-30.6%。活性中心由于催化剂的电子特性和结构的改变而变得更加有效。

2. 这些催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置受取代阳离子掺杂的影响。氯化钠掺杂产生更多的活性位点用于甲烷转换，与氯化锂掺杂相比，这些活性位点在促进所需化学反应方面更有效。

3. 这些发现的工业相关性在于有可能提高甲烷转化过程的产量和效率，特别是乙烯和其他烯烃的生产。与氯化锂/锰氧化物相比，氯化钠/锰氧化物的改进稳定性和催化活性使其成为氧化耦合甲烷的有前景的催化剂，提供对先前催化剂的显著改进。
