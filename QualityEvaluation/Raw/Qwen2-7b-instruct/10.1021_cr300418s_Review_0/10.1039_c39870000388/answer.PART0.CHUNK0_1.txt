[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation and coupling of CH4 producing C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 + C2H4) has attracted much attention since the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin.1 Many groups2--7 are working in this area and there is increasing industrial activity.8 However, the reactivities of the catalysts reported recently for synthesizing C2 hydrocarbons are still not satisfactory."
[2] "We have already reported that the oxides of the first-row transition elements, such as the oxides of Ni, Ti, and Zn,containing lithium chloride had high catalytic activities in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4.4c The highest space time yields (S.T.Y.) observed for the synthesis of C2 hydrocar- bons were 27 and 11 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 for the LiCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide, respectively."
[3] "Tentative experiments showed that the addition of NaCl instead of LiCl to manganese oxides gave better C2-S.T.Y. (S.T.Y. for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons) compared to that for LiCl/Mn-oxide."
[4] "As can be seen in Table 1, the main products are C2H4 under any conditions tested. It is to be noted that C3H6, C4Hs,benzene, and toluene are also produced."
[5] "The highest C2-S.T.Y. in Table 1 is 64.0 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 for NaCl/Mn-oxide. These values are higher than any previously reported.1-7"
[6] "In conclusion, the high catalytic activity and good stability of the catalyst observed for NaCI/Mn-oxide suggest that this is a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using sodium chloride (NaCl) instead of lithium chloride (LiCl), modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification increases the stability of the catalyst, which is crucial for industrially relevant reactions. The nature and location of active centers within the catalyst are altered due to the different properties of the dopants, affecting the reaction pathways and rates. As a result, the modified catalysts show higher space-time yields (S.T.Y.) for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and ethane, compared to previously reported catalysts. The improved activity and stability of these catalysts make them promising candidates for the oxidative coupling of methane, a process of great interest in industrial applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂，特别是使用氯化钠（NaCl）代替氯化锂（LiCl），改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键，从而提高了催化活性。这种修改增强了催化剂的稳定性，这对工业相关反应至关重要。催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置因掺杂物的不同特性而发生变化，影响了反应途径和速率。因此，修改后的催化剂显示出与之前报道的催化剂相比更高的空间时间产率（S.T.Y.）用于合成C2烃类，如乙烯和乙烷。改进的活性和稳定性使这些催化剂成为甲烷氧化耦合过程的有前景的候选材料，这是一个在工业应用中非常重要的过程。
