[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation and coupling of CH4 producing C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 + C2H4) has attracted much attention since the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin."
[2] "Many groups2--7 are working in this area and there is increasing industrial activity."
[3] "We have already reported that the oxides of the first-row transition elements, such as the oxides of Ni, Ti, and Zn,containing lithium chloride had high catalytic activities in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4."
[4] "Tentative experiments showed that the addition of NaCl instead of LiCl to manganese oxides gave better C2-S.T.Y."
[5] "As can be seen in Table 1, the main products are C2H4 under any conditions tested."
[6] "The NaCl/Mn-oxide is superior to the LiCl/Mn-oxide for the following reasons. (i) As described above, the catalytic activity of the NaCl/Mn-oxide is greater than that of the LiCl/Mn-oxide. (ii) Deactivation of the latter catalyst commenced after 2 h stream, but no deactivation of the former catalyst was observed after 8 h."
[7] "In conclusion, the high catalytic activity and good stability of the catalyst observed for NaCI/Mn-oxide suggest that this is a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active sites. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, altered nature and location of active centers, and improved performance in industrially relevant reactions. In the case of NaCl/Mn-oxide, it demonstrated higher catalytic activity and stability compared to LiCl/Mn-oxide. The main products were C2H4 under various conditions, and the NaCl/Mn-oxide catalyst showed a significant improvement in synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons with higher space time yields and selectivity, making it a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane.

在金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过改变活性位点的电子结构和配位环境，修改了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这导致催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置发生变化，并提高了工业相关反应的性能。对于NaCl/Mn-氧化物来说，它显示出了比LiCl/Mn-氧化物更高的催化活性和稳定性。主要产物为C2H4，在各种条件下，NaCl/Mn-氧化物催化剂在合成C2烃类化合物时显示出更高的空间时间产率和选择性，使其成为甲烷氧化偶联的有前景的催化剂。
