<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation and coupling of CH4 producing C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 + C2H4) has attracted much attention since the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin.1 Many groups2--7 are working in this area and there is increasing industrial activity.8 However, the reactivities of the catalysts reported recently for synthesizing C2 hydrocarbons are still not satisfactory.
<p>We have already reported that the oxides of the first-row transition elements, such as the oxides of Ni, Ti, and Zn,containing lithium chloride had high catalytic activities in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4.4c The highest space time yields (S.T.Y.) observed for the synthesis of C2 hydrocar- bons were 27 and 11 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 for the LiCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide, respectively.
<p>Tentative experiments showed that the addition of NaCl instead of LiCl to manganese oxides gave better C2-S.T.Y. (S.T.Y. for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons) compared to that for LiCl/Mn-oxide. However, NaCl/Ni-oxide did not show better catalytic activity in the synthesis of C2 compounds than that observed for LiCl/Ni-oxide. We now report results for NaClMn-oxides which show better catalytic activities than literature values. 
<p>As can be seen in Table 1, the main products are C2H4 under any conditions tested. It is to be noted that C3H6, C4Hs,benzene, and toluene are also produced. The selectivity for the formation of total hydrocarbons (2C2) observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide at a pres- sure of reactant 0.09 atm reached 30.6%. S.T.Y.s of C2 compounds (C2H4 + C2H6) and of total hydrocarbons (2C2> increased linearly with increasing pressure of reactants. The highest S.T.Y.s observed are 72.3 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (48.2 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide and 18.5 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (43.0 mmol m-2 h-1) for LiCl/Ni-oxide. The highest C2-S.T.Y. in Table 1 is 64.0 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 (42.7 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide. These values are higher than any previously reported.1-7

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by replacing certain ions within the crystal lattice. This change affects the electronic structure and thus the catalytic activity. In the case of NaCl/Mn-oxide, the introduction of sodium chloride instead of lithium chloride leads to enhanced catalytic activity in the oxidative coupling of methane to produce C2 hydrocarbons. The active centers on the surface of these catalysts facilitate the reactions more efficiently due to the altered properties caused by the substitution. The resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement are significant, as evidenced by the higher space-time yields (S.T.Y.) of C2 hydrocarbons achieved with NaCl/Mn-oxide compared to LiCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide. The nature and location of active centers on the surface of these catalysts play a crucial role in their performance, with the substitutional cation doping leading to improved stability and reactivity.

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be expected, particularly in the production of C2 hydrocarbons, as the enhanced catalytic activity can lead to increased efficiency and yield in industrial processes. The higher S.T.Y. values observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide indicate that this catalyst is superior for the oxidative coupling of methane, offering a promising avenue for industrial applications in the synthesis of valuable hydrocarbons.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。通过在晶格中替换某些离子，影响了电子结构，从而提高了催化活性。例如，在NaCl/Mn-oxide中，通过引入氯化钠代替氯化锂，导致氧化甲烷耦合到生产C2烃类产物时催化活性增强。表面活性中心的性质和位置对这些催化剂的性能至关重要，由于掺杂导致的结构改变，它们能够更有效地促进反应。这种掺杂对于催化活性的增强具有重要意义，因为与LiCl/Mn-oxide和LiCl/Ni-oxide相比，NaCl/Mn-oxide实现了更高的空间时间产率（S.T.Y.）的C2烃类产物。活性中心的位置和性质对这些催化剂的性能起着关键作用，而掺杂离子的引入导致了稳定性和反应性的改善。

对于工业相关反应的潜在改进可以预期，尤其是在合成C2烃类化合物方面，增强的催化活性可以提高工业过程的效率和产量。观察到的NaCl/Mn-oxide的最高S.T.Y.值表明，该催化剂在甲烷氧化耦合方面表现出色，为工业应用提供了有前景的途径，用于合成有价值的烃类。
