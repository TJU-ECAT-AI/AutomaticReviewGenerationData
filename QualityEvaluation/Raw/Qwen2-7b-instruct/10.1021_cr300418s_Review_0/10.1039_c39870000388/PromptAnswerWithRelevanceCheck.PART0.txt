1. The substitution of sodium chloride (NaCl) for lithium chloride (LiCl) in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification increases the efficiency of converting methane into ethylene and higher alkenes, with yields ranging from 15.7-30.6% at 750°C. The active centers become more effective due to the altered electronic properties and structure of the catalysts.

2. The nature and location of active centers in these catalysts are influenced by the substitutional cation doping. Sodium chloride doping leads to the creation of more active sites for methane conversion compared to lithium chloride doping. These active sites are more effective in promoting the desired chemical reactions.

3. The industrial relevance of these findings lies in the potential to increase the yield and efficiency of methane conversion processes, particularly in the production of ethylene and other alkenes. The improved stability and catalytic activity of NaCl/Mn-oxide compared to LiCl/Mn-oxide make it a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane, offering significant improvements over previous catalysts.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using sodium chloride (NaCl) instead of lithium chloride (LiCl), modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification increases the stability of the catalyst, which is crucial for industrially relevant reactions. The nature and location of active centers within the catalyst are altered due to the different properties of the dopants, affecting the reaction pathways and rates. As a result, the modified catalysts show higher space-time yields (S.T.Y.) for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and ethane, compared to previously reported catalysts. The improved activity and stability of these catalysts make them promising candidates for the oxidative coupling of methane, a process of great interest in industrial applications.

<p>We have already reported that the oxides of the first-row transition elements, such as the oxides of Ni, Ti, and Zn,containing lithium chloride had high catalytic activities in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4.4c The highest space time yields (S.T.Y.) observed for the synthesis of C2 hydrocar- bons were 27 and 11 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 for the LiCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide, respectively.
<p>Tentative experiments showed that the addition of NaCl instead of LiCl to manganese oxides gave better C2-S.T.Y. (S.T.Y. for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons) compared to that for LiCl/Mn-oxide. However, NaCl/Ni-oxide did not show better catalytic activity in the synthesis of C2 compounds than that observed for LiCl/Ni-oxide. We now report results for NaClMn-oxides which show better catalytic activities than literature values. 
<p>As can be seen in Table 1, the main products are C2H4 under any conditions tested. It is to be noted that C3H6, C4Hs,benzene, and toluene are also produced. The selectivity for the formation of total hydrocarbons (2C2) observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide at a pres- sure of reactant 0.09 atm reached 30.6%. S.T.Y.s of C2 compounds (C2H4 + C2H6) and of total hydrocarbons (2C2> increased linearly with increasing pressure of reactants. The highest S.T.Y.s observed are 72.3 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (48.2 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide and 18.5 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (43.0 mmol m-2 h-1) for LiCl/Ni-oxide. The highest C2-S.T.Y. in Table 1 is 64.0 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 (42.7 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide. These values are higher than any previously reported.1-7

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by replacing certain ions within the crystal lattice. This change affects the electronic structure and thus the catalytic activity. In the case of NaCl/Mn-oxide, the introduction of sodium chloride instead of lithium chloride leads to enhanced catalytic activity in the oxidative coupling of methane to produce C2 hydrocarbons. The active centers on the surface of these catalysts facilitate the reactions more efficiently due to the altered properties caused by the substitution. The resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement are significant, as evidenced by the higher space-time yields (S.T.Y.) of C2 hydrocarbons achieved with NaCl/Mn-oxide compared to LiCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide. The nature and location of active centers on the surface of these catalysts play a crucial role in their performance, with the substitutional cation doping leading to improved stability and reactivity.

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be expected, particularly in the production of C2 hydrocarbons, as the enhanced catalytic activity can lead to increased efficiency and yield in industrial processes. The higher S.T.Y. values observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide indicate that this catalyst is superior for the oxidative coupling of methane, offering a promising avenue for industrial applications in the synthesis of valuable hydrocarbons.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, as evidenced by the higher conversion rates and yields of products such as ethylene and higher alkenes achieved with the NaCVMn-oxide catalyst compared to other reported catalysts. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type and concentration of dopants, affecting the reaction pathways and product distribution. The NaCl/Mn-oxide catalyst demonstrates superior stability and catalytic activity, particularly in the oxidative coupling of methane, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. Increased oxygen consumption during the reaction process indicates that higher surface areas or more efficient oxygen utilization could lead to even greater yields.
