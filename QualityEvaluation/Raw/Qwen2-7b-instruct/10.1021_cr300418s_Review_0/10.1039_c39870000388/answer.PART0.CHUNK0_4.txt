[1] "The NaCVMn-oxide catalyst shows higher catalytic activity than any previously reported in converting methane into ethylene and higher alkenes with yields of 15.7-30.6% at 750C."
[2] "The highest S.T.Y.s of total hydrocarbons observed are 72.3 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 (48.2 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide and 18.5 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 (43.0 mmol m-2 h-1) for LiCl/Ni-oxide."
[3] "Since the oxygen in the reactants was almost completely consumed (O2 conversion >93'/0) during passage through the catalyst bed, we can expect higher S.T.Y.s than those in Table 1 when the flow rate of the reactants and the partial pressure of oxygen are increased further than the conditions described in Table 1."
[4] "The catalytic activity of the NaCl/Mn-oxide is greater than that of the LiCl/Mn-oxide."
[5] "Deactivation of the latter catalyst commenced after 2 h stream, but no deactivation of the former catalyst was observed after 8 h."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, as evidenced by the higher conversion rates and yields of products such as ethylene and higher alkenes achieved with the NaCVMn-oxide catalyst compared to other reported catalysts. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type and concentration of dopants, affecting the reaction pathways and product distribution. The NaCl/Mn-oxide catalyst demonstrates superior stability and catalytic activity, particularly in the oxidative coupling of methane, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. Increased oxygen consumption during the reaction process indicates that higher surface areas or more efficient oxygen utilization could lead to even greater yields.
