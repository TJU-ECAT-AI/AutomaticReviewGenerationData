How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, and what are the resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions?

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding through the introduction of dopants that act as electron donors or acceptors. These dopants lead to changes in the electronic structure of the oxide, affecting the reactivity and stability of the metal particles. The resulting implications include enhanced catalytic activity, altered nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions such as increased efficiency and selectivity.

When Mo species are introduced into the metal oxide, they act as electron donors, stabilizing 2D metal islands by facilitating an electron transfer from the impurity ions to the metal. Conversely, Li dopants serve as electron acceptors, trapping excess electrons and creating charge-compensated ion pairs. This prevents the electron transfer to the metal, restoring the original growth behavior of the metal particles. The modification of surface chemistry and disruption of chemical bonding through doping thus influence the catalytic properties of the materials, impacting their performance in various industrial applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中通过掺杂替换阳离子如何改变表面化学和破坏化学键，以及对催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置、以及在工业相关反应中的潜在改进有何影响？

通过引入作为电子供体或受体的掺杂剂，金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键。这些掺杂剂导致氧化物电子结构的变化，影响金属粒子的反应性和稳定性。其结果包括增强的催化活性、活性中心的改变性质和位置，以及在诸如提高效率和选择性等工业相关反应中的潜在改进。

当Mo物种被引入到金属氧化物中时，它们作为电子供体作用，通过促进从杂质离子到金属的电子传输来稳定二维金属岛。相反，Li掺杂剂充当电子接受者，捕获多余的电子并形成补偿的离子对。这阻止了向金属的电子传输，恢复了金属颗粒的原始生长行为。因此，通过掺杂改变表面化学和破坏化学键，影响材料的催化性能，进而影响各种工业应用的性能。

[1] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[2] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge."
[3] "This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."
[4] "As a result, the Mo dopant becomes oxidized while the Au atom takes a negative charge."
[5] "In contrast to Mo, Li is a charge acceptor as it lacks one valence electron with respect to the divalent Ca."
[6] "It thus creates energetically costive holes in the 2p orbitals of adjacent O ions that can be filled by electrons from the Mo codopants."
[7] "The presence of Li in CaOMo films therefore triggers charge-compensation effects between the dopants, reducing the number of electrons that are available for transfer into the Au deposits."
[8] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing charge transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. For instance, Molybdenum (Mo) acts as an electron donor, leading to an oxidation of Mo while Au atoms acquire a negative charge. Lithium (Li), on the other hand, serves as a charge acceptor, creating energetically costly holes in the oxygen (O) ions' 2p orbitals. These holes are filled by electrons from the Mo codopants, triggering charge-compensation effects that reduce the number of electrons available for transfer into the Au deposits. This results in the formation of charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs, which prevent the modification of Au growth behavior. Consequently, the nature and location of active centers are altered, potentially improving catalytic activity and industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过在掺杂剂与吸附金属之间的电荷转移过程，修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键。例如，钼（Mo）充当电子供体，导致Mo的氧化，而Au原子则获得负电荷。锂（Li）作为电荷接受者，会在相邻氧（O）离子的2p轨道中产生能量成本较高的空穴。这些空穴被Mo共掺杂提供的电子填充，触发电荷补偿效应，减少了可用以转移到Au沉积中的电子数量。因此形成了电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，这阻止了Au生长行为的改变。结果是，活性中心的性质和位置发生变化，可能提高了催化活性并改善了工业相关的反应。
