[1] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[2] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge."
[3] "This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."
[4] "As a result, the Mo dopant becomes oxidized while the Au atom takes a negative charge."
[5] "In contrast to Mo, Li is a charge acceptor as it lacks one valence electron with respect to the divalent Ca."
[6] "It thus creates energetically costive holes in the 2p orbitals of adjacent O ions that can be filled by electrons from the Mo codopants."
[7] "The presence of Li in CaOMo films therefore triggers charge-compensation effects between the dopants, reducing the number of electrons that are available for transfer into the Au deposits."
[8] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing charge transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. For instance, Molybdenum (Mo) acts as an electron donor, leading to an oxidation of Mo while Au atoms acquire a negative charge. Lithium (Li), on the other hand, serves as a charge acceptor, creating energetically costly holes in the oxygen (O) ions' 2p orbitals. These holes are filled by electrons from the Mo codopants, triggering charge-compensation effects that reduce the number of electrons available for transfer into the Au deposits. This results in the formation of charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs, which prevent the modification of Au growth behavior. Consequently, the nature and location of active centers are altered, potentially improving catalytic activity and industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过在掺杂剂与吸附金属之间的电荷转移过程，修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键。例如，钼（Mo）充当电子供体，导致Mo的氧化，而Au原子则获得负电荷。锂（Li）作为电荷接受者，会在相邻氧（O）离子的2p轨道中产生能量成本较高的空穴。这些空穴被Mo共掺杂提供的电子填充，触发电荷补偿效应，减少了可用以转移到Au沉积中的电子数量。因此形成了电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，这阻止了Au生长行为的改变。结果是，活性中心的性质和位置发生变化，可能提高了催化活性并改善了工业相关的反应。
