How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding?

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding through charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. This leads to the growth of 2D metal islands that are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions. When excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants, charge-compensated ion pairs develop, which are unable to modify the Au growth behavior. This results in altering the surface chemistry and disrupting chemical bonding, affecting the catalytic activity, the nature and location of active centers, and potentially improving industrially relevant reactions.

如何通过掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中的置换阳离子修改表面化学和破坏化学键？

金属氧化物催化剂中的置换阳离子掺杂通过电荷转移过程修改表面化学和破坏化学键，导致2D金属岛的生长，这些岛由杂质离子提供的电子转移稳定。当多余的电子被由碱性掺杂剂产生的O 2p型空穴捕获时，会形成电荷补偿的离子对，这些离子对无法改变Au的生长行为。这导致修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键，影响催化活性、活性中心的性质和位置，以及可能改善工业相关反应。
