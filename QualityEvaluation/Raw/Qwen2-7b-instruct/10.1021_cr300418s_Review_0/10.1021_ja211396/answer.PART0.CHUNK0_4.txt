[1] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[2] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[3] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by facilitating charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. This leads to the development of charge-compensated ion pairs, such as Li+Mo3+, which prevent modification of the ad-particle growth behavior. These modifications enhance catalytic activity by altering the nature and location of active centers, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的位取代离子掺杂通过促进掺杂剂与附着金属之间的电荷转移过程，改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键。这导致形成电荷补偿离子对，如Li+Mo3+，阻止修改附着粒子的生长行为。这些修改通过改变活性中心的性质和位置来增强催化活性，有可能改善工业相关反应。
