How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, and what are the resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions?

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding through the introduction of dopants that act as electron donors or acceptors. These dopants lead to changes in the electronic structure of the oxide, affecting the reactivity and stability of the metal particles. The resulting implications include enhanced catalytic activity, altered nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions such as increased efficiency and selectivity.

When Mo species are introduced into the metal oxide, they act as electron donors, stabilizing 2D metal islands by facilitating an electron transfer from the impurity ions to the metal. Conversely, Li dopants serve as electron acceptors, trapping excess electrons and creating charge-compensated ion pairs. This prevents the electron transfer to the metal, restoring the original growth behavior of the metal particles. The modification of surface chemistry and disruption of chemical bonding through doping thus influence the catalytic properties of the materials, impacting their performance in various industrial applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中通过掺杂替换阳离子如何改变表面化学和破坏化学键，以及对催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置、以及在工业相关反应中的潜在改进有何影响？

通过引入作为电子供体或受体的掺杂剂，金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键。这些掺杂剂导致氧化物电子结构的变化，影响金属粒子的反应性和稳定性。其结果包括增强的催化活性、活性中心的改变性质和位置，以及在诸如提高效率和选择性等工业相关反应中的潜在改进。

当Mo物种被引入到金属氧化物中时，它们作为电子供体作用，通过促进从杂质离子到金属的电子传输来稳定二维金属岛。相反，Li掺杂剂充当电子接受者，捕获多余的电子并形成补偿的离子对。这阻止了向金属的电子传输，恢复了金属颗粒的原始生长行为。因此，通过掺杂改变表面化学和破坏化学键，影响材料的催化性能，进而影响各种工业应用的性能。
