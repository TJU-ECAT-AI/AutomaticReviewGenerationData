[1] "The formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase can be attributed to confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, which originate from the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111)."
[2] "Furthermore, the STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data indicate that the formed PtFeO boundaries or edges of the FeO nanoislands present distinct chemical and electronic characteristics, which could be highly active in many catalytic processes."
[3] "The well-defined FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm. The brightness order of the three stacking domains within one Moir pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials (>1.5 V). The top domains are the first ones that are not fully developed at the FeO island boundaries, whereas the fcc and hcp domains are populated inside of the islands, indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the domains increases in the order of fcc > hcp > top."

The document explains how the formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase is influenced by the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111), leading to distinctive chemical and electronic characteristics at the PtFeO boundaries or edges of the FeO nanoislands. These characteristics make them potentially highly active in catalytic processes. The document also describes the Moir pattern and stacking domains within the FeO nanoislands, indicating that the top domains are not fully developed at the boundaries while the fcc and hcp domains are populated inside, suggesting that their thermodynamic stability follows the order of fcc > hcp > top.

文档解释了FeO和Pt(111)之间的强烈相互作用如何影响2D FeO表面相的形成，导致PtFeO边界或FeO纳米岛边缘的特异性化学和电子特性。这些特性可能使它们在催化过程中高度活跃。文档还描述了FeO纳米岛中的莫尔图案和堆叠域，表明顶部域在边界处没有完全发育，而fcc和hcp域则在岛内被填充，表明它们的热力学稳定性遵循fcc > hcp > top的顺序。
