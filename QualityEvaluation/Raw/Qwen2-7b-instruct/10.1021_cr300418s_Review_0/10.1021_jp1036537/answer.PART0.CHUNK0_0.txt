The document discusses the growth and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) metal. These nanoislands were created through a two-step process involving Fe deposition at low temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere, followed by annealing at elevated temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum. The structure, composition, and electronic state of these FeO nanoislands were analyzed using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data revealed that the edges or boundaries of the FeO nanoislands exhibit unique chemical and electronic properties, potentially making them highly reactive in catalytic processes. The peripheries of the FeO nanoislands contain coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which are crucial for CO oxidation reactions. The strong interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate leads to the formation of a metastable 2D FeO surface phase, which is attributed to the interface confinement effect. The existence of transition metal thin films is explained by their additional stability arising from the adhesion energy at the oxide-metal interface.

文档讨论了在Pt(111)金属上生长和表征的二维（2D）FeO纳米岛的研究。这些纳米岛通过低温氧气气氛中沉积Fe，随后在超高真空下退火的两步过程制备。使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）分析了这些FeO纳米岛的结构、组成和电子状态。STM和扫描隧道光谱数据表明，FeO纳米岛的边缘或边界具有独特的化学和电子特性，可能在许多催化过程中表现出高度活性。FeO纳米岛的边缘包含未配位的亚铁(CUF)位点，这对CO氧化反应至关重要。FeO与Pt基底之间的强相互作用导致形成稳定的2D FeO表面相，这归因于界面约束效应。过渡金属薄层的存在解释了它们由于与氧化物-金属界面的粘附能而具有的额外稳定性。
