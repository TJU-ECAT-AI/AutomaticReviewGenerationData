[1] "The two-step deposition process, which consists of evaporation of Fe in an oxidant atmosphere at low temperatures and subsequent annealing in UHV at elevated temperatures, was applied to grow FeO nanostructures on Pt(111)."
[2] "Well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands have been obtained by depositing 0.25 ML Fe at the Pt(111) substrate temperature of 150-250 K and in the O2 partial pressure range from 1.3 × 108 to 1.3 × 106 mbar, followed by postannealing between 473 and 673 K in UHV."
[3] "It has been shown that the low deposition temperatures and higher oxidant atmospheres are critical to the structure and morphology of the FeO nanoislands, which facilitate the feasible oxidation of deposited Fe and the high dispersion of the formed FeO nanoislands."
[4] "The well-defined FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm. The brightness order of the three stacking domains within one Moir pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials (>1.5 V)."
[5] "The formation of a metastable 2D FeO surface phase is attributed to the interface confinement effect, which originates from the strong interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate."

The two-step deposition process involving low-temperature Fe evaporation in an oxidant atmosphere followed by high-temperature UHV annealing allows for the growth of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111). The structure and dispersion of these nanoislands are influenced by the deposition temperature and oxidant pressure, leading to well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands. The nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a specific brightness order of top > hcp > fcc domains at high imaging potentials. The formation of a metastable 2D FeO phase is linked to the strong interface confinement effect due to the interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate.
