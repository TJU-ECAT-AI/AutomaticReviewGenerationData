The metastable 2D FeO surface phase is stabilized by strong interaction effects at the interface between the oxide and metal substrate. This interaction leads to a unique atomic structure and electronic state at the interface compared to the interior of the islands. The Moir pattern within the islands follows a brightness order of top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials, suggesting differences in thermodynamic stability among the domains. The 2D interface confinement contributes to the formation of various metastable oxide surface phases on metal substrates.

稳定的2D FeO表面相态通过氧化物与金属基底界面的强相互作用得到稳定。这种相互作用导致界面处存在独特的原子结构和电子状态，与岛内部不同。在高成像电压下，岛内的莫耳图案遵循亮度顺序为顶 > hcp > fcc，表明不同堆叠域的热力学稳定性存在差异。2D界面约束导致金属表面上形成各种稳定的氧化物表面相态。
