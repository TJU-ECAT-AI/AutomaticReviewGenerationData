[1] "The atomic structure, chemical composition, and electronic state of the formed FeO nanoislands were investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy."
[2] "Furthermore, the STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data indicate that the formed PtFeO boundaries or edges of the FeO nanoislands present distinct chemical and electronic characteristics, which could be highly active in many catalytic processes."
[3] "The peripheries of the FeO nanoislands as prepared on Pt(111) contain coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which have been proved to play very critical roles in CO oxidation reactions."
[4] "The existence of transition metal thin films is attributable to the extra stability that arises from its adhesion energy at the underlying oxide-metal interface."

The document discusses the growth and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) metal. These nanoislands were created through a two-step process involving Fe deposition at low temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere, followed by annealing at elevated temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum. The structure, composition, and electronic state of these FeO nanoislands were analyzed using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data revealed that the edges or boundaries of the FeO nanoislands exhibit unique chemical and electronic properties, potentially making them highly reactive in catalytic processes. The peripheries of the FeO nanoislands contain coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which are crucial for CO oxidation reactions. The strong interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate leads to the formation of a metastable 2D FeO surface phase, which is attributed to the interface confinement effect. The existence of transition metal thin films is explained by their additional stability arising from the adhesion energy at the oxide-metal interface.

文档讨论了在Pt(111)金属上生长和表征的二维（2D）FeO纳米岛的研究。这些纳米岛通过低温氧气气氛中沉积Fe，随后在超高真空下退火的两步过程制备。使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）分析了这些FeO纳米岛的结构、组成和电子状态。STM和扫描隧道光谱数据表明，FeO纳米岛的边缘或边界具有独特的化学和电子特性，可能在许多催化过程中表现出高度活性。FeO纳米岛的边缘包含未配位的亚铁(CUF)位点，这对CO氧化反应至关重要。FeO与Pt基底之间的强相互作用导致形成稳定的2D FeO表面相，这归因于界面约束效应。过渡金属薄层的存在解释了它们由于与氧化物-金属界面的粘附能而具有的额外稳定性。

[1] "The two-step deposition process, which consists of evaporation of Fe in an oxidant atmosphere at low temperatures and subsequent annealing in UHV at elevated temperatures, was applied to grow FeO nanostructures on Pt(111)."
[2] "Well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands have been obtained by depositing 0.25 ML Fe at the Pt(111) substrate temperature of 150-250 K and in the O2 partial pressure range from 1.3 × 108 to 1.3 × 106 mbar, followed by postannealing between 473 and 673 K in UHV."
[3] "It has been shown that the low deposition temperatures and higher oxidant atmospheres are critical to the structure and morphology of the FeO nanoislands, which facilitate the feasible oxidation of deposited Fe and the high dispersion of the formed FeO nanoislands."
[4] "The well-defined FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm. The brightness order of the three stacking domains within one Moir pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials (>1.5 V)."

The two-step deposition process involving low-temperature Fe evaporation in an oxidant atmosphere followed by high-temperature UHV annealing allows for the growth of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111). The structure and dispersion of these nanoislands are influenced by the deposition temperature and oxidant pressure, leading to well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands. The nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a specific brightness order of top > hcp > fcc domains at high imaging potentials. The formation of a metastable 2D FeO phase is linked to the strong interface confinement effect due to the interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate.
