[1] "The formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase can be attributed to confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, which originate from the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111)."
[2] "The well-defined FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm. The brightness order of the three stacking domains within one Moir pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials (>1.5 V)."
[3] "At the FeOPt interfaces, there exist a distinct atomic structure and electronic states in comparison to the sites inside the islands."

The metastable 2D FeO surface phase is formed due to the strong interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate, causing confinement effects at the interface. The FeO nanoislands display a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm, and the brightness order of the stacking domains within this pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials. There is a distinct atomic structure and electronic state at the FeOPt interfaces compared to the interior of the islands.

2D FeO表面相的形成归因于FeO与Pt基底界面之间的强相互作用，导致界面处的限制效应。FeO纳米岛展现出一种周期性为2.48nm的莫尔图案，其中在高成像电位（>1.5V）下，堆叠域的亮度顺序为顶部>hcp>fcc。FeOPt界面存在与岛屿内部不同之处的独特的原子结构和电子状态。
