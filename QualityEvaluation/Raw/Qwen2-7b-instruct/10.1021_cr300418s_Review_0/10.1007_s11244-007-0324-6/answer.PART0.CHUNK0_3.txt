[1] "The role of the oxide phase of oxide-supported metal catalysts in the course of catalytic reactions has been associated with a number of different effects, amongst them are: providing a high-area support for the stabili- sation of the metal phase in the form of small particles; influencing the metal phase via electronic interactions; or providing special reaction sites at the metal-oxide phase boundary."
[2] "A particularly drastic interaction phenomenon between the oxide and the metal phase has been reported in the form of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect."
[3] "The encapsulation of metal particles by a migrating reduced oxide phase of the carrier is associated with an interesting materials trans- port problem across the catalyst surface, which has been addressed in a recent publication."
[4] "The inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostruc- tures."
[5] "The promoting character of transition metal oxide minority phases in the CO and CO2 hydrogenation reaction catalysed by group VIII metals has been demonstrated on such oxide decorated inverse catalyst surfaces by the Somorjai group."
[6] "Bonding sites at the oxide-metal interface related to the Lewis acidity character of the systems have been sug- gested as the promoting agents."
[7] "There is a fundamental interest to explore the local electronic structure of nanostructured materials and STS provides the possibility to study the electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the metal-oxide interface."
[8] "The reduction of the oxide phase of Pd(111)-vana- dium oxide and Rh(111)-vanadium oxide inverse cata- lysts has been discussed and the structure and morphology changes occuring during the reduction process and during red-ox cyclings have been followed at the atomic level."
[9] "The mass transport problem in catalyst systems during structure and morphology changes as a result of red-ox reactions has been addressed and we propose that the material transport is mediated by the observed diffusion of oxide clusters across the metal surface."
[10] "The complex (9 · 9) V2O3type phase on Rh(111) is the result of interfacial strain effects."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry by changing the electronic interactions and creating new active sites. This disruption of chemical bonding can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the promotion of CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions by the presence of transition metal oxide minority phases on group VIII metals. The active sites are often located at the metal-oxide phase boundary, which is crucial for the Lewis acidity character of the systems. Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) provides a tool to explore the local electronic structure of nanostructured materials, offering insights into the electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the metal-oxide interface. During the reduction of metal oxide inverse catalysts, the structure and morphology changes are closely related to the diffusion of oxide clusters across the metal surface, which is proposed to mediate the mass transport problem. The complex V2O3 phase on Rh(111) arises from interfacial strain effects at the metal-oxide interface.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂可以改变表面化学性质，通过调整电子相互作用和形成新的活性位点。这种化学键的破坏可以导致催化活性增强，例如索莫尔贾伊小组通过在组Ⅷ金属上使用氧化物修饰的逆催化剂表面促进了CO和CO2的氢化反应。活性位点通常位于金属-氧化物相界面处，这是系统Lewis酸性特征的关键。扫描隧道谱（STS）提供了一种探索纳米结构材料局部电子结构的工具，为超薄氧化层和金属-氧化物界面的电子签名提供了见解。在金属氧化物逆催化剂的还原过程中，结构和形态变化与氧化簇在金属表面的扩散密切相关，这被提议用于介导质量传输问题。Rh(111)上的复杂V2O3相源自金属-氧化物界面的界面应力效应。
