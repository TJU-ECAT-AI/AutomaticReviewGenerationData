[1] "An interesting approach in the study of the metal-oxide interface is the concept of the inverse or inverted catalyst. While real catalysts consist of metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, the inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostructures."
[2] "Structure and morphological changes of the oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, and the mass transport problem in catalyst systems during oxidation-reduction cycles is addressed."
[3] "We propose that the mass transport on metal-oxide catalysts, which can lead to massive morphology changes during oxidation-reduction cycles, may be caused by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters that form intermediary under the red-ox conditions."
[4] "Support for this conjecture has been obtained very recently by growth experiments of V-oxide on vicinal Rh(111) surfaces, where the (9 · 9) structure has been found on wide Rh(111) terraces, but a (2 · 2) structure was observed on small terraces, where the step edges may provide the strain relief."

1. The inverse catalyst concept involves a metal surface, typically a single crystal surface, decorated by oxide nanostructures instead of having metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, as in traditional catalysts.

2. The discussion covers the structural and morphological transformations of oxide phases on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces, as well as the challenges of mass transport during oxidation-reduction cycles.

3. The authors propose that during redox reactions, mass transport and morphology changes in metal-oxide catalysts could be mediated by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters.

4. Recent growth experiments on vicinal Rh(111) surfaces have provided support for the idea that the complex (9 × 9) structure of V-oxide occurs on wide terraces due to strain relief at the step edges, while a simpler (2 × 2) structure appears on smaller terraces.

We recall that on the Pd(111) surface a (2 · 2) surface-V2O3 phase has been observed after reduction of the (4 · 4) V-oxide (see figure 5), whereas on Rh(111) a (9 · 9) V-oxide overlayer, also of V2O3 overall stoichiometry, has been obtained by reduction of the 7 phase (figure 7)."

1. The inverse catalyst concept refers to a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, decorated by oxide nanostructures, rather than the traditional structure of metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase in real catalysts.

2. The structure and morphological changes of the oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, focusing on the mass transport issue in catalyst systems during oxidation-reduction cycles.

3. It is proposed that the mass transport across metal-oxide catalyst surfaces, leading to significant morphological changes during redox reactions, might be facilitated by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters under redox conditions.

4. On Pd(111) substrate, reduction of the (4 · 4) V-oxide leads to the formation of a (2 · 2) surface-V2O3 phase, while on Rh(111) substrate, reduction of the 7 phase results in a (9 · 9) V-oxide overlayer, both having V2O3 overall stoichiometry.

[1] "The role of the oxide phase of oxide-supported metal catalysts in the course of catalytic reactions has been associated with a number of different effects, amongst them are: providing a high-area support for the stabili- sation of the metal phase in the form of small particles; influencing the metal phase via electronic interactions;or providing special reaction sites at the metal-oxide phase boundary."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry by changing the electronic interactions and creating new active sites. This disruption of chemical bonding can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the promotion of CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions by the presence of transition metal oxide minority phases on group VIII metals. The active sites are often located at the metal-oxide phase boundary, which is crucial for the Lewis acidity character of the systems. Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) provides a tool to explore the local electronic structure of nanostructured materials, offering insights into the electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the metal-oxide interface. During the reduction of metal oxide inverse catalysts, the structure and morphology changes are closely related to the diffusion of oxide clusters across the metal surface, which is proposed to mediate the mass transport problem. The complex V2O3 phase on Rh(111) arises from interfacial strain effects at the metal-oxide interface.
