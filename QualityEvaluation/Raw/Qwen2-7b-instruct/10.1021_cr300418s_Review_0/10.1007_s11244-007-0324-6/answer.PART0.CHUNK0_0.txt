[1] "An interesting approach in the study of the metal-oxide interface is the concept of the inverse or inverted catalyst. While real catalysts consist of metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, the inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostructures."
[2] "Structure and morphological changes of the oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, and the mass transport problem in catalyst systems during oxidation-reduction cycles is addressed."
[3] "We propose that the mass transport on metal-oxide catalysts, which can lead to massive morphology changes during oxidation-reduction cycles, may be caused by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters that form intermediary under the red-ox conditions."
[4] "Support for this conjecture has been obtained very recently by growth experiments of V-oxide on vicinal Rh(111) surfaces, where the (9 · 9) structure has been found on wide Rh(111) terraces, but a (2 · 2) structure was observed on small terraces, where the step edges may provide the strain relief."

1. The inverse catalyst concept involves a metal surface, typically a single crystal surface, decorated by oxide nanostructures instead of having metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, as in traditional catalysts.

2. The discussion covers the structural and morphological transformations of oxide phases on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces, as well as the challenges of mass transport during oxidation-reduction cycles.

3. The authors propose that during redox reactions, mass transport and morphology changes in metal-oxide catalysts could be mediated by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters.

4. Recent growth experiments on vicinal Rh(111) surfaces have provided support for the idea that the complex (9 × 9) structure of V-oxide occurs on wide terraces due to strain relief at the step edges, while a simpler (2 × 2) structure appears on smaller terraces.

1. 反向催化剂概念涉及金属表面，通常是单晶表面，上面装饰有氧化物纳米结构，而不是传统的催化剂中的金属颗粒被氧化物载体相支持。

2. 讨论涵盖了在V-氧化物/Rh和V-氧化物/Pd反向催化剂表面上的氧化物相的结构和形态变化，以及氧化还原周期中催化剂系统中的质量传输问题。

3. 作者提出，在红氧反应期间，金属-氧化物催化剂的质量传输和形态变化可能由形成中间态的氧化物纳米簇的扩散引起。

4. 最近在vicinal Rh(111)表面的生长实验提供了支持，证明了宽Rh(111)台阶上会出现复杂的（9×9）结构的V-氧化物，这是由于台阶边缘提供的应力释放，而较小的台阶上则观察到了更简单的（2×2）结构。
