[1] "An interesting approach in the study of the metal-oxide interface is the concept of the inverse or inverted catalyst. While real catalysts consist of metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, the inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostructures."
[2] "Structure and morphological changes of the oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, and the mass transport problem in catalyst systems during oxidation-reduction cycles is addressed."
[3] "We propose that the mass transport on metal-oxide catalysts, which can lead to massive morphology changes during oxidation-reduction cycles, may be caused by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters that form intermediary under the red-ox conditions."
[4] "Another interesting example of different oxide structures formed on Rh(111) and Pd(111) substrates concerns the more reduced V2O3type phases. We recall that on the Pd(111) surface a (2 · 2) surface-V2O3 phase has been observed after reduction of the (4 · 4) V-oxide (see figure 5), whereas on Rh(111) a (9 · 9) V-oxide overlayer, also of V2O3 overall stoichiometry, has been obtained by reduction of the 7 phase (figure 7)."

1. The inverse catalyst concept refers to a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, decorated by oxide nanostructures, rather than the traditional structure of metal particles supported by an oxide carrier phase in real catalysts.

2. The structure and morphological changes of the oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, focusing on the mass transport issue in catalyst systems during oxidation-reduction cycles.

3. It is proposed that the mass transport across metal-oxide catalyst surfaces, leading to significant morphological changes during redox reactions, might be facilitated by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters under redox conditions.

4. On Pd(111) substrate, reduction of the (4 · 4) V-oxide leads to the formation of a (2 · 2) surface-V2O3 phase, while on Rh(111) substrate, reduction of the 7 phase results in a (9 · 9) V-oxide overlayer, both having V2O3 overall stoichiometry.

1. 反向催化剂概念是指金属表面，优选单晶表面，被氧化纳米结构装饰，而不是传统催化剂中的金属颗粒支持在氧化载体相中。

2. 讨论了V-氧化物/Rh和V-氧化物/Pd反向催化剂表面上的氧化物相的结构和形态变化，重点关注氧化还原周期中催化剂系统中的质量传输问题。

3. 提议，在红-氧条件下，通过氧化物纳米簇的扩散，可能可以促进金属-氧化物催化剂表面的质量传输，导致显著的形貌变化。

4. 在Pd(111)基底上，（4 · 4）V-氧化物的还原会形成（2 · 2）表面-V2O3相，而在Rh(111)基底上，7相的还原会导致（9 · 9）V-氧化物覆盖层的形成，两者均具有V2O3的总体组成。
