[1] "The role of the oxide phase of oxide-supported metal catalysts in the course of catalytic reactions has been associated with a number of different effects, amongst them are: providing a high-area support for the stabili- sation of the metal phase in the form of small particles; influencing the metal phase via electronic interactions; or providing special reaction sites at the metal-oxide phase boundary [1]."
[2] "A particularly drastic interaction phenomenon between the oxide and the metal phase has been reported in the form of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect [2,3], in which cata- lysts containing transition metal oxide supports display radically altered chemisorption and reaction behaviour after high temperature reduction treatments."
[3] "The inverse catalyst model system has a number of technical advan- tages as compared to the real catalyst systems, amongst them the ability to apply surface science techniques with atomic precision for their characterisation [10,11]."
[4] "For example, the promoting character of transition metal oxide minority phases in the CO and CO2 hydrogenation reaction catalysed by group VIII metals has been demonstrated on such oxide decorated inverse catalyst surfaces by the Somorjai group [7,8], and bonding sites at the oxide-metal interface related to the Lewis acidity character of the systems have been sug- gested as the promoting agents."
[5] "The local electronic structure of nanostructured materials and STS provides the possibility to study the electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the metal-oxide interface."
[6] "The vanadium oxide phases discussed in this paper are two-dimensional structures that bear very little relation to vanadium oxides in the known bulk phases."
[7] "The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [16] as described elsewhere [17]."
[8] "The exact geometry of this so-called surface-V2O3 phase [12] has been quantified in previous work by X-ray photoelectron diffraction and LEED I(V) analysis [23,24]."
[9] "The mass transport problem in catalyst systems during structure and morphology changes as a result of red-ox reactions has been addressed and we propose that the material transport is mediated by the observed diffusion of oxide clusters across the metal surface."
[10] "Finally, the role of the metal- oxide interface in determining the structures of metal supported oxide nanolayers has been investigated and the interfacial chemistry together with lattice mismatch strain effects at the interface have been identified as important parameters."
