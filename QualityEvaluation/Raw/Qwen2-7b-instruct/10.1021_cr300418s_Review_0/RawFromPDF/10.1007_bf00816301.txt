The oxidative 
coupling 
of 
methane on 
magnesium 
oxide 
(MgO) 
has been studied 
in the pres- 
ence of carbon tetrachloride (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. Addition of a small 
amount of 
TCM to the reactant stream improves 
the selectivity 
to C2H4, 
while 
the conversion 
of 
methane 
is not influenced 
by the additive. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the used MgO reveal the for- 
mation of chlorine species on the catalyst surface in quantities up to 0.20 of C1/Mg (atomic 
ratio), although X-ray diffraction 
spectra of 
the catalyst show 
MgO only and the content of 
the 
chlorine 
species 
in the bulk phase estimated 
by 
X-ray fluorescence 
analysis 
is very 
low. It is con- 
eluded that the enhancement of the selectivity 
to C2H4 
primarily results from the presence of 
surface 
chlorine 
species. 
The chlorinated species 
on the catalyst has been 
identified 
as MgC12.

1. Introduction 
The oxidative coupling of methane to C2+ hydrocarbons, especially to ethylene, 
is, in principle, one of the most important routes for the utilization of natural gas 
through the production of useful chemicals and fuels. Although a wide variety of 
catalysts has been examined for this process during the last decade, the conversion 
of methane and selectivity to ethylene remain less than desirable for an economic-

S. Sugiyama et al. / Methane coupling on MgO in the 
presence of CCl4 
ally practical process [1-4]. Work in one of our laboratories has shown that the 
introduction of a small quantity of carbon tetrachloride (TCM) to the feedstream 
often results in enhanced conversion of methane and increased selectivity to C2+ 
compounds, especially to ethylene [5,6]. Burch and co-workers have also studied 
the effect of the introduction of 
gaseous chlorine-containing 
compounds in the oxi- 
dative coupling of methane [7]. Although participation of TCM in the gas-phase 
reaction cannot be excluded [8] experimental observations show that the chlorine 
species interacts with and alters the surface of the catalyst. However, the source of 
the advantageous effect of 
the introduction 
of 
chlorine 
is not yet dear. 
Publications from one of our laboratories have shown that oxychlorides are 
formed in the presence of TCM over lanthanide oxides and that the beneficial 
effects of TCM with these catalysts are primarily due to the formation of the oxy- 
chlorides [9,10]. In contrast, work in our laboratories has shown that chloride is 
formed on alkali sulphate in the presence of TCM and that the reaction behaviour 
is strongly influenced by the chloride [11]. These results reveal that the source of 
the effect of 
the introduction 
of 
TCM strongly depends 
on the nature of 
the catalyst 
and more work is required to clarify the role of TCM. In recent work, the oxidative 
coupling of methane over salts of magnesium doped by alkali carbonates has been 
studied and it is concluded that the influence of TCM on the methane conversion 
process appears to result primarily from the interaction of TCM with the anions of 
the magnesium 
compounds [12]. 
The present 
paper describes studies of 
the oxidative 
coupling of 
methane on mag- 
nesium oxide and the application of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelec- 
tron spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence 
analyses to clarify the nature and source 
of the effect of the introduction of TCM into the methane conversion feedstream. 
While the present work was in progress, studies of the effect of dichloromethane 
on 
magnesia in the conversion of methane have shown that chlorine species are pres- 
ent on the surface of the catalyst, but the chlorinated 
species on the catalyst was not 
identified 
[7]. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. CATALYST 
Magnesia (MgO) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals as special grade 
and used as supplied. The oxide was kneaded 
for 1 h with a given amount of water. 
The paste was dried overnight at 353 K and calcined at 1048 K for 5 h. Particles 
of 1.70-0.85 mm were employed 
in the present 
work. 
2.2. APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE 
The catalytic experiments 
were performed in a fixed-bed 
continuous flow quartz 
S. Sugiyama et al. / Methane coupling on MgO in the 
presence of CCl4 
203 
reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. Details of the reactor design and cata- 
lyst packing procedures have been described elsewhere [11,13]. Prior to reaction the 
catalyst was calcined in situ in an oxygen flow (12.5 ml/min) at 1048 K for 1 h. 
The reaction conditions were as follows: W = 0.7 g, F = 15 ml/min, T -- 1048 
or 1123 K, P(CH4)= 28.7 kPa, P(O4) ---- 
4.05 kPa, and P(TCM)= 0, 1.73 or 
6.93 hPa (1 hPa = 0.1 kPa); balance to the atmosphere was provided by helium. 
2.3. ANALYSIS 
AND CHARACTERIZATION 
The reactants and products were analyzed with a Shimadzu GC-8APT gas chro- 
matograph with a TC detector and integrator (Shimadzu C-R6A). Two columns, 
one Porapak N (6 m x 3 mm, programmed 318-423 K), the other Molecular Sieve 
5A (20 cm x 3 mm, 318 K) were employed in the analyses. The conversion of 
methane was calculated from the products and the methane introduced into the 
feed. The selectivities were calculated from the conversion of 
methane to each prod- 
uct on a carbon base. 
The surface areas of the catalysts were measured with a conventional BET nitro- 
gen adsorption apparatus (Shibata P-700). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
(MXP-18, MAC Science Co.) employed monochromatized Cu Ka radiation. Pat- 
terns were recorded over the range 20 = 5-90 
~ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS) (Shimadzu ESCA-1000AX) used unmonochromatized Mg K~t radiation. 
The binding energies were corrected using 285 eV for the C ls level, resulting from 
contaminant carbon, as an internal standard. Argon-ion etching measurement of 
the catalyst was carried out at 2 kV for 0.5 min with a rate of the sputtering esti- 
mated as ca. 2 nm/min for SiO2. The X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) was meas- 
ured with a Rigaku 3370 X-ray spectrometer. 
3. Results and discussion 
In all catalytic experiments, the products were CO, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6 
together with unconverted CH4 and 02. Water and hydrogen were also produced 
but are not reported here. In some experiments, C2H2 and C3 species were detected. 
Chloromethanes such as CHaC1 were detected, but precise quantitative analyses 
could not be done due to overlapping with the GC H20 peak. Carbon balances of 
100 + 5% were obtained in each experiment. The conversion of oxygen was vir- 
tually constant between 96 and 99% in each run. The BET surface area of MgO was 
12 m2/g. 
3.1. ACTIVITY AND SELECTIVITY IN MgO IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF 
TCM 
The conversions, selectivities and yields on MgO in the absence and presence of 
204 
S. Sugiyama et al. / Methane coupling on MgO in the 
presence of CCl4 
TCM are summarized in fig. 1. After 0.5 h on-stream under the standard condi- 
tions ofT = 1048 K and P(TCM) = 0 or 1.73 hPa, the conversion of methane was 
little affected by the introduction of TCM while the selectivity to C2H4 was 
increased by a factor of approximately two. A similar enhancement by TCM has 
been reported on silica-supported magnesia catalyst [14]. However, deactivation 
was observed in the presence of TCM at 1.73 hPa during 6 h on-stream. Increase of 
the partial pressure of TCM (6.93 hPa) resulted in a decrease in the selectivity to 
C2H6, while the conversion and remaining selectivities are relatively stable up to 
30 h on-stream (fig. 2). However, at a higher reaction temperature of 1123 K, evi- 
dence for deactivation was again obtained (fig. 1). 
3.2. EXAMINATION OF THE USED CATALYSTS BY X-RAY ANALYSES 
In order to study the interaction between TCM and MgO, X-ray analyses have 
been carried out and the results are summarized in table 1. No chlorinated species 
were detected in the XRD patterns of each used catalyst, in contrast with those of 
alkali sulphate [11] and lanthanide oxides [9,10] treated with the same procedures 
as employed in the present work. However, chlorine species were detected in XPS 
analysis by Burch and co-workers [7]. These observations suggest that the chlori- 
nated species exist on the catalyst surface and/or in amorphous form in both the

surface and bulk structure. Quantitative analysis with XRF showed that the 
atomic ratio of CI/Mg in the bulk phase was quite small. Therefore it is concluded 
that the chlorinated species are formed only on the catalyst surface, at least under 
the conditions employed in the present work, and the improvement by the addition 
of TCM may be attributed directly or indirectly to the presence of these species on 
the surface. The formation of the surface chlorinated species is further supported 
by argon-ion etching experiments of the used catalyst (fig. 3), for which the C1/Mg 
ratio gradually decreased with increase in the sputtering time. Unfortunately, the 
identification of the chlorinated species by X-ray diffraction analyses could not be 
made due to their small quantities. The C1/Mg ratio was strongly influenced by 
the reaction temperature, but the ratio did not depend on the partial pressure of 
TCM and time-on-stream as shown in table 1.

The results show that formation of an excess of chlorinated species on the cata- 
lyst surface leads to deactivation, possible due to the blockage of oxygen sites of 
MgO. In order to obtain the beneficial effects from the addition of TCM under 
stable conditions 
it is evident 
that the formation of a sufficient 
but not excess quan- 
tity of the corresponding 
chloride is needed 
together 
with the continuous introduc- 
tion of a small but significant partial pressure of TCM (6.93 hPa). These observa- 
tions demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability in the presence of TCM 
depend on a balance of the chlorinated species on the catalyst surface and the con- 
tribution of 
gas-phase TCM to the catalyst surface. 
3.3. IDENTIFICATION OF CHLORINATED SPECIES ON MgO 
Although the identification of the chlorinated species on the catalyst by X-ray 
analyses is difficult due to the limited quantities of the species, the formation of 
chloride (MgC12) or oxychloride (Mg(C104)2 or Mg(C103)2) might be expected, 
based on our results from the oxidation on alkali sulphates [11] or lanthanide oxi- 
S. Sugiyama et al. / Methane coupling on MgO in the 
presenee of CCl4 
207 
des [9,10]. However, the oxychlorides of magnesium decompose at 524 or 393 K, 
respectively [15] and thus are unstable under our reaction conditions. Therefore the 
formation of MgC12, which melts at 987 K but is stable as a molten salt up to 
1710 K (boiling point) [15] appears to be more probable. MgC12 is very hygro- 
scopic and converts to the hydrate (MgC12-6H20), both of which are highly deli- 
quescent. Therefore, if MgC12 forms on the catalyst under the present reaction 
conditions, the chloride would be expected to be converted to the hexahydrate 
under ambient conditions. The hexahydrate does not return to the anhydrous 
chloride by heating, but decomposes to MgO at around 503 K as shown in reac- 
tions (1)-(8) [16]: 
368-388 K 
MgC12.6H20 --+ 
MgC12-4H20 + 2H20, 
(1) 
MgC12.4H20 --+ 
MgC12.2H20 + 2H20, 
(2) 
408-453 K 
MgC12.4H20 ~ Mg(OH)C1 + HC1 + 3H20, 
(3) 
MgC12.2H20 ~ MgC12.H20 + H20, 
(4) 
458-503 K 
MgC12.2H20 ~ Mg(OH)C1 + HC1 + H20, 
(5) 
> 503 K 
MgC12.H20 --~ MgC12 + H20, 
(6) 
MgC12-H20 ~ Mg(OH)C1 + HC1, 
(7) 
Mg(OH)CI-+ MgO + HC1. 
(8) 
Therefore it is expected that the intensity of the C1 XPS signal of the used catalyst 
would decrease by heating above 503 K. The atomic ratio of C1/Mg on the surface 
of commercial MgC12 and MgC12.6H20 decreased markedly by heating at 623 K 
for 1 h in air as shown in table 2. A similar observation was also found with the used 
MgO, which is the same sample as that of run 4 in table 1. These results suggest 
that the chlorinated species on the catalyst is MgC12 and the reaction behaviour in 
the presence of TCM on MgO is strongly influenced by the disappearance and 
regeneration of MgC12 on the catalyst surface under the reaction conditions. 
Furthermore, the formation of MgC12 would be also supported by the binding 
energy at approximately 199 eV (fig. 3) because XPS signals attributed to chlorine 
species in the gas phase and of oxychlorides have been detected at approximately 
207 eV, while those of 
chlorides have been found at approximately 199 eV [17].

4. Conclusions 
(1) The introduction of TCM to the reactant stream in the oxidative coupling 
of 
methane on MgO improves the selectivity 
to ethylene. 
(2) A very small quantity of the chlorinated species is observed by XPS and 
XRF. The chlorinated species are present mainly on the catalyst surface, suggest- 
ing that the reaction behaviour is strongly influenced by the surface chlorinated 
species, although gas phase participation cannot be excluded. 
(3) Thermal decomposition of the used catalyst suggests that the chlorinated 
species is MgC12, based on the comparison with a similar treatment of the commer- 
cial samples.
