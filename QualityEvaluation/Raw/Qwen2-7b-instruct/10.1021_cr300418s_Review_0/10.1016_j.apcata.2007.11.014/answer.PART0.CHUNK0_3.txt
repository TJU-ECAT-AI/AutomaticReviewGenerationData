[Bromine is involved in the catalytic cycle both by forming methyl bromide and by activating the lattice oxygen of active sites and facilitating the regeneration of active sites.]
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing bromine, which forms methyl bromide and activates lattice oxygen. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity and the creation of active centers capable of regenerating themselves.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At room temperature, elemental bromine can be inserted into the zigzag OHgO HgO chains, activating the lattice oxygens to produce highly reactive catalytic oxidants, mercuric hypobromite, which are effective for methane oxidation under mild conditions.
