This document discusses a novel process for selectively converting methane to C1 oxygenates at relatively low reaction temperatures using bromine-mediated catalysis over supported mercury oxide nanophases. The study identifies two bromine-mediated reaction cycles: one involving the formation of methyl bromide as an intermediate species (cycle I), and another with mercuric hypobromite acting as the active agent for methane oxidation (cycle II). The document also mentions the use of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption measurements for characterizing the catalyst. It highlights the mediator role of bromine in increasing methane conversion and improving the selectivity towards C1 oxygenates. The involvement of zinc (Zn) in the catalytic cycle is also discussed, suggesting its role in enhancing the conversion efficiency.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing new reactive sites and altering the electronic structure of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity by increasing the availability of active centers and improving the reaction kinetics. The location of these active centers is influenced by the dopant's nature, which can lead to more efficient and selective catalysis in industrially relevant reactions. The specific implications for catalytic activity enhancement include improved stability, increased turnover frequency, and reduced energy barriers for the desired reaction pathways.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active sites. This modification enhances catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites and stabilizing intermediates. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant type and concentration, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. For instance, in the case of selective methane partial oxidation, the presence of bromine activates the lattice oxygen and facilitates the regeneration of active sites, enabling high selectivity to C1 oxygenates at low temperatures. This process involves the formation of methyl bromide and the insertion of bromine into the mercuric oxide chains, leading to the formation of mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation. The role of zinc content in the catalytic cycle is also established, contributing to the scavenging of bromine and the promotion of CH bond bromination.
