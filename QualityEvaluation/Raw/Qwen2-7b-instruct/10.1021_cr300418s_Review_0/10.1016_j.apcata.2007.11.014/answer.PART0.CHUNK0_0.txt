[1] "Two bromine-mediated routes can be identified: MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation, which occur simultaneously in the methane conversion."
[2] "The catalyst was characterized detailedly by XRD, XPS, and N2 sorption."
[3] "The chemical composite changes of active species were detected by XPS, which provide some direct information about the mediator role of bromine in the catalytic cycle."
[4] "The presence of bromine in feed gas leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion (Fig. 3a), which demonstrates the mediator role of bromine in the methane conversion."
[5] "The introduction of bromine to feed gas consisting of CH4/ O2/Ar (3:1:6) leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion."
[6] "The role of Zn contents in the bromine-mediated process has been established [31]."

This document discusses a novel process for selectively converting methane to C1 oxygenates at relatively low reaction temperatures using bromine-mediated catalysis over supported mercury oxide nanophases. The study identifies two bromine-mediated reaction cycles: one involving the formation of methyl bromide as an intermediate species (cycle I), and another with mercuric hypobromite acting as the active agent for methane oxidation (cycle II). The document also mentions the use of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption measurements for characterizing the catalyst. It highlights the mediator role of bromine in increasing methane conversion and improving the selectivity towards C1 oxygenates. The involvement of zinc (Zn) in the catalytic cycle is also discussed, suggesting its role in enhancing the conversion efficiency.

本文讨论了一种使用溴介导催化在较低反应温度下选择性地将甲烷转化为C1氧化物的新过程，该过程基于支持的汞氧化物纳米相。研究确定了两种溴介导的反应路径：一种涉及中间物种甲基溴的形成（路径I），另一种则以激活甲烷氧化活性的溴化汞作为活性剂（路径II）。文档还提到了使用X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和氮吸附测量来表征催化剂。它强调了溴在提高甲烷转化率并改善C1氧化物选择性方面的媒介作用。文档中还讨论了锌(Zn)在催化循环中的作用，表明其可以增强转化效率。
