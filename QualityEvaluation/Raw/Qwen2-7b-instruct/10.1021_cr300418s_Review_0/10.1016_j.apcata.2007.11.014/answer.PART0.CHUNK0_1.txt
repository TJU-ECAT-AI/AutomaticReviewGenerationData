[1] "In summary, we present a novel bromine-mediated process over supported HgO nanophases for selective methane partial oxidation at relatively low reaction temperature."
[2] "A transient high product selectivity to C1 oxygenates was observed under the methane conversion of 13%, and then the methane conversion and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates gradually decrease and fluctuate around 10% and 55%, respectively."
[3] "This special methane conversion was applied as the model reaction to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle."
[4] "Two reaction routes can be identified: the cycle I with MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and the cycle II with mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation."
[5] "Both bromine-mediated routes occur simultaneously in the methane conversion and the main mechanism transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with the gradual fixation of bromine into mercuric oxide lattice."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing new reactive sites and altering the electronic structure of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity by increasing the availability of active centers and improving the reaction kinetics. The location of these active centers is influenced by the dopant's nature, which can lead to more efficient and selective catalysis in industrially relevant reactions. The specific implications for catalytic activity enhancement include improved stability, increased turnover frequency, and reduced energy barriers for the desired reaction pathways.
