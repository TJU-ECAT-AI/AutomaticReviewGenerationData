[1] "Bromine is involved in the catalytic cycle both by forming methyl bromide and by activating the lattice oxygen of active sites and facilitating the regeneration of active sites."
[2] "Two bromine-mediated routes can be identified: MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation, which occur simultaneously in the methane conversion."
[3] "The catalyst was characterized detailedly by XRD, XPS, and N2 sorption."
[4] "The role of Zn contents in the bromine- mediated process has been established [31]."
[5] "This special methane conversion was applied as the model reaction to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle."
[6] "Both bromine-mediated routes described in the cycle I and the cycle II occur simultaneously in the methane conversion and the main mechanism transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with the gradual fixation of bromine into mercuric oxide lattice."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active sites. This modification enhances catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites and stabilizing intermediates. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant type and concentration, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. For instance, in the case of selective methane partial oxidation, the presence of bromine activates the lattice oxygen and facilitates the regeneration of active sites, enabling high selectivity to C1 oxygenates at low temperatures. This process involves the formation of methyl bromide and the insertion of bromine into the mercuric oxide chains, leading to the formation of mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation. The role of zinc content in the catalytic cycle is also established, contributing to the scavenging of bromine and the promotion of CH bond bromination.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂通过改变活性位点的电子结构和配位环境来修改表面化学性质，破坏化学键。这种修改增强了催化活性，提供了更多的反应活性位点并稳定了中间体。活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂物类型和浓度的影响，从而提高了工业相关反应的效率。例如，在选择性甲烷部分氧化中，溴的存在激活了晶格氧，并促进了活性位点的再生，使在低温下获得高C1氧化物选择性成为可能。这一过程涉及甲基溴化物的形成以及将溴插入汞氧化物链中，导致形成作为甲烷氧化活性剂的汞亚溴酸盐。掺锌含量在催化循环中的作用也被证实，有助于捕获溴并促进CH键的溴化。
