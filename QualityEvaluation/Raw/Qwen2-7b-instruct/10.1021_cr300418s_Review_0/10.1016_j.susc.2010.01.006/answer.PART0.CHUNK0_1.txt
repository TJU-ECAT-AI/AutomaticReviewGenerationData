[1] "Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films were prepared on the Au(1 1 1) surface and characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."
[2] "The reduction to Fe3O4 has been proposed in comparison with the literature results and been supported by XPS, showing a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak due to the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased atomic ratio of O and Fe (from 1.5 to 1.3)."
[3] "STM characterization of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films shows that Fe3O4 appears as particles on Au(1 1 1) at the coverages below 1 MLE, adopting an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges."
[4] "At coverages of 2 MLE, most of the Au(1 1 1) has been covered with a Fe3O4 thin film."
[5] "While two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å have been observed on large Fe3O4 particles, the 50 Å periodicity is the dominant superstructure observed on the continuous Fe3O4 thin films."

1. Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films were synthesized on the Au(1 1 1) surface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for characterization.
2. The formation of Fe3O4 from a-Fe2O3 was confirmed through XPS, indicating a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak due to the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased atomic ratio of O to Fe from 1.5 to 1.3.
3. The STM revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) exhibit an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges at coverages below 1 MLE.
4. At 2 MLE, a continuous Fe3O4 thin film covered most of the Au(1 1 1) surface.
5. Ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å were observed on large Fe3O4 particles, with the 50 Å periodicity dominating on continuous Fe3O4 thin films.

1. 在Au(1 1 1)表面上，通过X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）对Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜进行了合成和表征。
2. 通过XPS确认了从a-Fe2O3到Fe3O4的转变，显示了Fe 2p3/2峰的变宽，由于存在Fe2+和Fe3+物种，以及氧与铁原子比从1.5降低到1.3。
3. STM显示，在低于1 MLE的覆盖度下，Au(1 1 1)表面的Fe3O4纳米颗粒呈现出不规则的六边形形状，并具有锐利的边缘。
4. 当达到2 MLE时，大部分Au(1 1 1)表面被一层连续的Fe3O4薄膜覆盖。
5. 观察到大尺寸Fe3O4颗粒上具有50 Å和42 Å两种不同周期性的有序六边形超结构，其中50 Å的周期性在连续的Fe3O4薄膜上占主导地位。
