The formation of Fe3O4 on Au(1 1 1) involves the annealing of a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures at 750 K in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This process is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which reveals a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak indicating the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased atomic ratio of O and Fe. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) indicates that Fe3O4 manifests as particles on Au(1 1 1) at coverages below 1 monolayer equivalent (MLE), adopting an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges. At coverages of 2 MLE, a Fe3O4 thin film covers most of the Au(1 1 1) surface.

在超高真空（UHV）条件下，通过将a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1)结构在750 K下进行退火，形成了Fe3O4在Au(1 1 1)上的沉积。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）显示了一个扩展的Fe 2p3/2峰，这表明存在Fe2+和Fe3+物种，并且氧和铁的原子比降低。扫描隧道显微镜（STM）表明，在覆盖度低于1个单层等效（MLE）时，Fe3O4以具有尖锐边缘的不规则六边形形状在Au(1 1 1)上形成颗粒。在2 MLE的覆盖度下，大部分Au(1 1 1)表面被Fe3O4薄膜覆盖。
