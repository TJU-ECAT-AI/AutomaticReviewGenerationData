[1] "In this work, we demonstrate the preparation and characterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films on Au(1 1 1)."
[2] "We are interested in Fe3O4 because it is believed to be a key intermediate in the transformation of Fe2O3 into the Fe-carbides which are proposed to be the active phase in Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts."
[3] "STM characterization of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films shows that Fe3O4 appears as particles on Au(1 1 1) at the coverages below 1 MLE, adopting an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges."
[4] "At coverages of 2 MLE, most of the Au(1 1 1) has been covered with a Fe3O4 thin film."
[5] "While two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å have been observed on large Fe3O4 particles, the 50 Å periodicity is the dominant superstructure observed on the continuous Fe3O4 thin films."

1. Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films were successfully prepared on the Au(1 1 1) surface through a UHV annealing process, and they are considered a key intermediate in the transformation of Fe2O3 into Fe-carbides, which are hypothesized to be the active phase in Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.
2. The STM characterization revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films exhibit an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges when the coverage is below 1 MLE, while at 2 MLE, a continuous Fe3O4 thin film covers most of the Au(1 1 1) surface.
3. Two distinct hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å were observed on large Fe3O4 particles. Among these, the 50 Å periodicity predominates on the continuous Fe3O4 thin films.

1. 在这项工作中，我们展示了在Au(1 1 1)表面上通过UHV退火过程制备Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜。人们认为Fe3O4是Fe2O3转化为Fe碳化物的关键中间体，而这些Fe碳化物被提议作为基于Fe的费希尔-特罗斯催化剂的活性相。
2. STM表征显示，当覆盖度低于1 MLE时，Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜呈现出不规则的六边形形状和锐利边缘，而在2 MLE时，大部分Au(1 1 1)表面被一层连续的Fe3O4薄膜覆盖。
3. 大型Fe3O4颗粒上观察到了两种不同的六边形超结构，具有50 Å和42 Å的周期性。在这两者中，50 Å周期性在连续的Fe3O4薄膜上占主导地位。
