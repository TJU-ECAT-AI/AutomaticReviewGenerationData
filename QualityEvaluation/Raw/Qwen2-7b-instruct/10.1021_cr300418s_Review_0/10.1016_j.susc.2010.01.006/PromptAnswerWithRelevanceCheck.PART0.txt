<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The formation of Fe3O4 on Au(1 1 1) involves the annealing of a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures at 750 K in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This process is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which reveals a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak indicating the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased atomic ratio of O and Fe. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) indicates that Fe3O4 manifests as particles on Au(1 1 1) at coverages below 1 monolayer equivalent (MLE), adopting an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges. At coverages of 2 MLE, a Fe3O4 thin film covers most of the Au(1 1 1) surface.

在超高真空（UHV）条件下，通过将a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1)结构在750 K下进行退火，形成了Fe3O4在Au(1 1 1)上的沉积。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）显示了一个扩展的Fe 2p3/2峰，这表明存在Fe2+和Fe3+物种，并且氧和铁的原子比降低。扫描隧道显微镜（STM）表明，在覆盖度低于1个单层等效（MLE）时，Fe3O4以具有尖锐边缘的不规则六边形形状在Au(1 1 1)上形成颗粒。在2 MLE的覆盖度下，大部分Au(1 1 1)表面被Fe3O4薄膜覆盖。

The formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films on Au(1 1 1) surface is accomplished through a UHV annealing process, which removes or desorbs oxygen from the system. This results in a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak at lower binding energies, indicating the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles initially appear as particles at low coverages, transitioning to thin films at 2 monolayer equivalents of iron. The STM images reveal two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å, with the 50 Å feature predominating on continuous films. All Fe3O4 structures exhibit a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in the atomically resolved STM images.

在UHV退火过程中，通过去除或脱附系统中的氧，形成了Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜在Au(1 1 1)表面上。这导致Fe 2p3/2峰在较低结合能处变得更宽，表明存在Fe2+和Fe3+物种。Fe3O4纳米颗粒最初表现为低覆盖度的颗粒，随后在2个单层等效铁的情况下形成薄膜。STM图像显示两种有序的六角超结构，周期性分别为50和42 Å，其中50 Å特征在连续薄膜中占主导地位。所有Fe3O4结构在原子分辨率的STM图像中都显示出具有3 Å周期性的六角晶格单元。

The document describes the preparation and characterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films on the Au(1 1 1) surface. Initially, Fe3O4 forms as nanoparticles at low coverages, transitioning to thin films at 2 monolayer equivalents of iron. Two ordered superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å are observed on the particles. As the films become more continuous, the 50 Å feature predominates. Across all coverages, the Fe3O4 structures exhibit a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in atomically resolved STM images.
