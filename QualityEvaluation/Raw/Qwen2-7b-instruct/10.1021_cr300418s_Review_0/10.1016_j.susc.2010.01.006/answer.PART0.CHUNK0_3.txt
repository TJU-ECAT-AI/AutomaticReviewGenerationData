The formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films on Au(1 1 1) surface is accomplished through a UHV annealing process, which removes or desorbs oxygen from the system. This results in a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak at lower binding energies, indicating the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles initially appear as particles at low coverages, transitioning to thin films at 2 monolayer equivalents of iron. The STM images reveal two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å, with the 50 Å feature predominating on continuous films. All Fe3O4 structures exhibit a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in the atomically resolved STM images.

在UHV退火过程中，通过去除或脱附系统中的氧，形成了Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜在Au(1 1 1)表面上。这导致Fe 2p3/2峰在较低结合能处变得更宽，表明存在Fe2+和Fe3+物种。Fe3O4纳米颗粒最初表现为低覆盖度的颗粒，随后在2个单层等效铁的情况下形成薄膜。STM图像显示两种有序的六角超结构，周期性分别为50和42 Å，其中50 Å特征在连续薄膜中占主导地位。所有Fe3O4结构在原子分辨率的STM图像中都显示出具有3 Å周期性的六角晶格单元。
