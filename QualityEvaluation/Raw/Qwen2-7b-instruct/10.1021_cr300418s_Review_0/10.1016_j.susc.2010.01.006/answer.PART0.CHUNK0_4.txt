The document describes the preparation and characterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin films on the Au(1 1 1) surface. Initially, Fe3O4 forms as nanoparticles at low coverages, transitioning to thin films at 2 monolayer equivalents of iron. Two ordered superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å are observed on the particles. As the films become more continuous, the 50 Å feature predominates. Across all coverages, the Fe3O4 structures exhibit a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in atomically resolved STM images.

文档描述了在Au(1 1 1)表面上制备和表征Fe3O4纳米颗粒和薄膜的过程。起初，Fe3O4以低覆盖度的纳米颗粒形式出现，当铁覆盖度达到2个单层等效时，转变为薄膜形式。观察到两种有序的超结构，分别具有50 Å和42 Å的周期性。随着薄膜的连续性增加，50 Å特征成为主导。在整个覆盖度范围内，Fe3O4结构在原子级分辨率的STM图像中显示为具有3 Å周期性的六角晶格单元。
