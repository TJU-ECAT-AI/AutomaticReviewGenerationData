[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."
[5] "Both systems primarily exhibit metal oxygen double bond surface terminations (Nb@O and V@O)."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically niobia in this case, modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating specific surface terminations. In the niobia/alumina model catalysts, niobia forms N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, as the structure and location of active centers are optimized for certain reactions. The catalysts are stable up to 700 K in vacuum and even more stable in ambient oxygen. The structural similarity to the vanadia/alumina system indicates comparable behavior in terms of metal-oxygen double bond surface terminations, but niobia forms fully oxidized niobium pentoxide phases, which contrasts with vanadium forming a sesquioxide. These structural differences and modifications in surface chemistry lead to improved catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂，特别是铌酸盐在本案例中的应用，通过形成特定的表面终止来改变表面化学和破坏化学键。在铌酸铝模型催化剂中，铌酸盐形成了暴露有Nb@O和Nb5+表面位点的N2O5纳米颗粒。这导致催化活性的增强，因为活性中心的位置和结构优化了某些反应。催化剂在真空下稳定至700 K，在常压氧气中甚至更加稳定。与钒酸铝系统结构相似，表明在金属-氧双键表面终止方面具有可比行为，但铌酸盐形成完全氧化的铌五氧化物相，这与钒形成亚氧化物形成对比。这些结构差异和表面化学的改变导致了工业相关反应的改进性能。
