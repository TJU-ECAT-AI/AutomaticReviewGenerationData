[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating specific surface terminations such as Nb@O and Nb5+. This modification leads to the creation of active centers that enhance catalytic activity. The location and nature of these active centers are influenced by the dopant's chemical properties and its interaction with the oxide lattice. These changes can improve industrially relevant reactions by altering the reaction pathways, increasing efficiency, and reducing side reactions. Additionally, the stability of the catalysts in various environments, such as vacuum or ambient oxygen, is crucial for practical applications, ensuring that the catalyst remains effective under different operational conditions.
