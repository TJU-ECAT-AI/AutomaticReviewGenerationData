[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."

The substitution of niobium in niobia/alumina model catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites. These active centers enhance catalytic activity and improve industrially relevant reactions. The model catalysts show increased stability in ambient oxygen, which contrasts with vanadia/alumina systems where vanadium forms a sesquioxide. The presence of Nb@O and Nb5+ sites suggests a unique mechanism for these catalysts, leading to improved performance in specific reactions.
