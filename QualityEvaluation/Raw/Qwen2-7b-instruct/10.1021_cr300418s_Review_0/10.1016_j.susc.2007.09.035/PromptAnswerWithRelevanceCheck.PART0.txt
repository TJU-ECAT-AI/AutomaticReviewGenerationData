[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."

The substitution of niobium in niobia/alumina model catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites. These active centers enhance catalytic activity and improve industrially relevant reactions. The model catalysts show increased stability in ambient oxygen, which contrasts with vanadia/alumina systems where vanadium forms a sesquioxide. The presence of Nb@O and Nb5+ sites suggests a unique mechanism for these catalysts, leading to improved performance in specific reactions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitution of niobium for vanadium in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the nature of active centers. This modification disrupts chemical bonding, leading to the formation of different types of surface terminations. In niobia/alumina catalysts, niobium forms N2O5 nanoparticles with Nb@O and Nb5+ sites, which are distinct from the V@O terminations in vanadia/alumina systems. These changes enhance catalytic activity by providing specific reactive sites suitable for industrially relevant reactions. The stability of the niobia-based catalysts in both vacuum and ambient oxygen conditions suggests improved performance under various operational environments.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically in this case with niobia and alumina, modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating distinct surface terminations such as Nb@O and Nb5+ sites. These active centers enhance catalytic activity by providing reactive sites for reactants to bind and undergo transformation. The nature and location of these active centers are influenced by the doping process, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. The enhanced stability of the catalysts, particularly in ambient oxygen conditions, allows for more robust and efficient catalytic processes.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating specific surface terminations such as Nb@O and Nb5+. This modification leads to the creation of active centers that enhance catalytic activity. The location and nature of these active centers are influenced by the dopant's chemical properties and its interaction with the oxide lattice. These changes can improve industrially relevant reactions by altering the reaction pathways, increasing efficiency, and reducing side reactions. Additionally, the stability of the catalysts in various environments, such as vacuum or ambient oxygen, is crucial for practical applications, ensuring that the catalyst remains effective under different operational conditions.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically niobia in this case, modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating specific surface terminations. In the niobia/alumina model catalysts, niobia forms N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, as the structure and location of active centers are optimized for certain reactions. The catalysts are stable up to 700 K in vacuum and even more stable in ambient oxygen. The structural similarity to the vanadia/alumina system indicates comparable behavior in terms of metal-oxygen double bond surface terminations, but niobia forms fully oxidized niobium pentoxide phases, which contrasts with vanadium forming a sesquioxide. These structural differences and modifications in surface chemistry lead to improved catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂，特别是铌酸盐在本案例中的应用，通过形成特定的表面终止来改变表面化学和破坏化学键。在铌酸铝模型催化剂中，铌酸盐形成了暴露有Nb@O和Nb5+表面位点的N2O5纳米颗粒。这导致催化活性的增强，因为活性中心的位置和结构优化了某些反应。催化剂在真空下稳定至700 K，在常压氧气中甚至更加稳定。与钒酸铝系统结构相似，表明在金属-氧双键表面终止方面具有可比行为，但铌酸盐形成完全氧化的铌五氧化物相，这与钒形成亚氧化物形成对比。这些结构差异和表面化学的改变导致了工业相关反应的改进性能。
