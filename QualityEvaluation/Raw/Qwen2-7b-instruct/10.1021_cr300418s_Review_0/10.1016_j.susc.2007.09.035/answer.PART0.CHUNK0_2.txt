[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically in this case with niobia and alumina, modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating distinct surface terminations such as Nb@O and Nb5+ sites. These active centers enhance catalytic activity by providing reactive sites for reactants to bind and undergo transformation. The nature and location of these active centers are influenced by the doping process, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. The enhanced stability of the catalysts, particularly in ambient oxygen conditions, allows for more robust and efficient catalytic processes.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂的替换阳离子改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过形成如Nb@O和Nb5+这样的表面终止。这些活性中心通过提供反应物可以结合并进行转化的反应位点来增强催化活性。这些活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂过程的影响，导致对工业相关反应效率的提升。催化剂的增强稳定性，特别是在大气氧条件下，使得催化过程更加稳定和高效。
