[1] "Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere (107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina films grown on NiAl(110)."
[2] "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy as well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites."
[3] "The model catalysts are fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more stable in ambient oxygen."
[4] "The structural characteristics of niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied vanadia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide phases are formed."

The substitution of niobium for vanadium in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the nature of active centers. This modification disrupts chemical bonding, leading to the formation of different types of surface terminations. In niobia/alumina catalysts, niobium forms N2O5 nanoparticles with Nb@O and Nb5+ sites, which are distinct from the V@O terminations in vanadia/alumina systems. These changes enhance catalytic activity by providing specific reactive sites suitable for industrially relevant reactions. The stability of the niobia-based catalysts in both vacuum and ambient oxygen conditions suggests improved performance under various operational environments.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，铌对钒的替代改变了表面化学性质，通过改变活性中心的性质来破坏化学键。这种修改导致了不同类型的表面终止的形成。在铌酸铝模型催化剂中，铌形成了含有Nb@O和Nb5+位点的N2O5纳米颗粒，这与二氧化钒/二氧化硅系统中的V@O终止不同。这些变化通过提供适合工业相关反应的特定反应位点来增强催化活性。铌酸盐基催化剂在真空和大气氧条件下的稳定性提高表明了在各种操作条件下性能的改善。
