[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on rare earth oxides: effects of chlorine additives in gas and solid phase on the oxidation over cerium oxide, the use of small quantities of tetrachloromethane (TCM) in the feedstream has been shown to enhance the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene on cerium oxide at temperatures of 773 and 973 K."
[2] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of Cl into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by CeO2."
[3] "The addition of TCM to the ODE feedstream is shown from XPS to introduce surface Cl on the CeO2, forming CeOCI which is apparently responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed with CeO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitution of chlorine additives, particularly tetrachloromethane (TCM), in the feedstream of ethane oxidation over cerium oxide catalysts modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This results in enhanced conversion of ethane and selectivity to ethylene. The modification involves the introduction of chlorine atoms onto the cerium oxide surface, forming compounds like CeOCI. These modified surfaces serve as active centers that improve catalytic activity, likely by altering the electron density of surface oxygen ions or acting as diluents for them, leading to an enhancement in ethane oxidation and ethylene selectivity.

[1] "Earlier work from our laboratories has shown that the introduction of small quantities (< 1 mol%) of tetra-chloromethane (TCM) into the feedstream for the partial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane generally has advantageous effects in increasing the conversion of methane and/or the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene [1,2]."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has been compared with and without TCM on several catalysts in our laboratories [4-7]."

To understand how substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, consider the role of Tetrachloromethane (TCM) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The introduction of TCM into the reaction mixture enhances the conversion of ethane and the selectivity towards ethylene, especially on cerium oxide (CeO2). This suggests that TCM modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2 by introducing chlorine atoms, leading to the formation of CeOC1. This chlorided surface increases the catalytic activity by promoting ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. However, the impact diminishes at higher temperatures, as the homogeneous reaction becomes more dominant.

In terms of the implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the presence of TCM can lead to the formation of various compounds like magnesium chloride (in the context of magnesium-based catalysts), which might act as diluents or perturb the electron density of the surface oxygen ions. This disruption affects the electron distribution on the surface, potentially creating new active sites or altering the reactivity of existing ones.

For the nature and location of active centers, the chlorided surface appears to play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity. The active centers could be located at the interface between the catalyst and the reactants, where the concentration of reactive species is high. The active sites are likely to be dynamic, changing as the reaction progresses and the surface chemistry evolves.

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions could stem from the ability to fine-tune the catalytic activity by controlling the amount of TCM added. For instance, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, adjusting the TCM concentration could optimize the yield of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side-products. This approach could also be applicable to other reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of methane, where the enhancement of specific product selectivities is desired.

The implications for industrially relevant reactions include increased efficiency, reduced waste, and potentially lower energy consumption. By understanding how TCM interacts with different catalyst materials, it might be possible to develop more selective and efficient catalysts for a variety of industrial processes, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.

金属氧化物催化剂中通过掺杂取代阳离子对表面化学性质进行调整，破坏化学键，进而产生催化活性增强、活性中心性质与位置变化以及对工业相关反应潜在改进的影响。

以四氯化碳（TCM）在乙烷脱氢氧化中的应用为例，引入TCM能够提高乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性，特别是在铈氧化物（CeO2）上效果显著。这表明TCM通过在CeO2表面上引入氯原子，形成CeOC1，从而修改了表面化学性质，增加了催化活性。然而，在较高温度下，这种影响会减弱，因为同质反应对乙烷转化过程的贡献更大。

对于催化活性增强的含义，TCM的存在可能导致形成如镁盐中的氯化镁等化合物，这些化合物可能作为稀释剂或扰乱表面氧离子的电子密度。这种扰动会影响表面的电子分布，可能创造出新的活性位点或者改变现有位点的活性。

关于活性中心的性质和位置，氯化表面似乎在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用。活性中心可能位于催化剂与反应物之间的界面，该处反应物浓度高。这些活性位点很可能是动态的，随着反应的进行和表面化学性质的变化而变化。

对于工业相关反应的潜在改进包括提高了效率、减少了副产物，并且可能降低了能耗。通过理解TCM与不同催化剂材料之间的相互作用，有可能开发出更选择性和高效的催化剂，适用于各种工业过程，带来成本节省和环境效益。

这些影响对于工业相关反应的含义包括更高的效率、减少废物以及可能的更低能耗。通过理解如何调整TCM的添加量，可以优化不同催化剂材料的活性，为各种工业过程开发更具有选择性的催化剂，从而带来成本节约和环境益处。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing surface chlorine atoms, forming compounds like CeOCI. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for ethane oxidation on cerium oxide (CeO2) at temperatures of 773 and 973 K. The presence of chlorine in the surface region of the catalysts leads to the formation of active centers responsible for the enhancement observed in ethane oxidation reactions.

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing foreign atoms that disrupt chemical bonding. This alteration can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the reactivity of existing ones. The nature and location of these active centers depend on the specific dopant and the host material. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include increased conversion efficiency, selectivity towards desired products, and reduced energy consumption.

2. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement include improved conversion rates, higher selectivity to specific products, and the ability to control reaction pathways more precisely. The location of active centers might shift due to the dopant's influence on the crystal structure or electronic properties of the catalyst.

3. The nature of the modification involves the introduction of dopants that can act as electron donors or acceptors, altering the electronic environment around the catalyst surface. This can affect the adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

4. In the context of rare earth oxides, doping can lead to significant changes in the catalytic behavior of materials typically used in methane oxidation or ethane dehydrogenation. The introduction of dopants like TCM can enhance the catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the existing ones.

5. The active role of the chlorinated surface in enhancing the conversion of ethane and selectivity to ethylene is attributed to the formation of CeOC1 on the surface of CeO2. This chlorided surface appears to suppress the oxidation of ethylene, thus improving the selectivity.

6. At higher temperatures, such as 973 K, the effects of chlorinated surfaces on enhancing catalytic activity are diminished. This is because the homogeneous reaction contributes more significantly to the ethane conversion process, overshadowing the benefits provided by the chlorinated surfaces.

2. 活性中心的性质和位置可能由于掺杂剂对催化剂晶格结构或电子性质的影响而发生变化。这可以影响反应物、中间体和产物的吸附，从而提高催化性能。

3. 修改涉及向催化剂表面引入可作为电子供体或受体的掺杂剂，改变周围环境。这可以影响吸附的反应物、中间体和产物，导致增强的催化性能。

4. 在稀土氧化物中，掺杂可能导致材料在甲烷氧化或乙烷脱氢方面的显著变化。向材料中引入像四氯化碳这样的掺杂剂可以增强催化活性，通过创建新的活性中心或修改现有中心。

5. 乙烷转化和乙二醇选择性的增强作用归因于在CeO2表面形成CeOC1。氯化表面似乎抑制了乙二醇的氧化，从而提高了选择性。

6. 在较高温度下（如973 K），氯化表面对增强催化活性的影响减弱。这是因为同质反应对乙烷转化过程的贡献更大，掩盖了氯化表面提供的益处。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically CeO2, introduces surface chlorine (Cl) that forms CeOC1 upon interaction with ethane. This modification enhances the catalytic activity by disrupting the surface chemistry and modifying chemical bonding. The presence of CeOC1 is responsible for the observed improvement in ethane oxidation reactions over CeO2. The nature and location of active centers are thus altered, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates. The implications for industrially relevant reactions are significant, as the enhanced catalytic performance can lead to more efficient processes, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, which is crucial for the production of higher value-added chemicals.
