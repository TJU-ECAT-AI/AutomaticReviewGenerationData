[C1] "Earlier work from our laboratories has shown that the introduction of small quantities (< 1 mol%) oftetra- chloromethane (TCM) into the feedstream for the par- tial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane generally has advantageous effects in increasing the con- version of methane and/or the selectivity to C2 hydro- carbons, particularly ethylene [1,2]."
[C2] "In the present work, the effect of the addition of small quantities of TCM into the ODE feedstream has been investigated on La203, Sm203, Pr6Oll and CeO2 at 773 and 973 K."
[C3] "Although the homogeneous reaction participates in the ethane conversion process to a considerably greater extent at 973 K, the effects due to the chlorinated surfaces are diminished at this temperature."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing surface chlorine atoms, forming compounds like CeOCI. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for ethane oxidation on cerium oxide (CeO2) at temperatures of 773 and 973 K. The presence of chlorine in the surface region of the catalysts leads to the formation of active centers responsible for the enhancement observed in ethane oxidation reactions. At higher temperatures, the effects due to the chlorinated surfaces are reduced because the homogeneous reaction plays a larger role in the conversion process.

在金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过在表面引入氯原子并形成如CeOCI的化合物。这导致催化活性的增强，尤其是在773和973 K下以CeO2为载体的乙烷氧化反应中。表面区域中的氯的存在导致形成了负责增强乙烷氧化反应的活性中心。在较高温度下，由于同质反应在转化过程中起着更大的作用，因此氯化表面的效果会降低。
