[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on rare earth oxides: effects of chlorine additives in gas and solid phase on the oxidation over cerium oxide, the use of small quantities of tetrachloromethane (TCM) in the feedstream has been shown to enhance the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene on cerium oxide at temperatures of 773 and 973 K."
[2] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of Cl into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by CeO2."
[3] "The addition of TCM to the ODE feedstream is shown from XPS to introduce surface Cl on the CeO2, forming CeOCI which is apparently responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed with CeO2."

The substitution of chlorine additives, particularly tetrachloromethane (TCM), in the feedstream of ethane oxidation over cerium oxide catalysts modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This results in enhanced conversion of ethane and selectivity to ethylene. The modification involves the introduction of chlorine atoms onto the cerium oxide surface, forming compounds like CeOCI. These modified surfaces serve as active centers that improve catalytic activity, likely by altering the electron density of surface oxygen ions or acting as diluents for them, leading to an enhancement in ethane oxidation and ethylene selectivity.

在稀有碱土氧化物上进行乙烷氧化时，通过在气相和固相中使用少量四氯化碳（TCM）作为添加剂，可以增强乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性。XPS测量提供了表面氯原子引入到铈氧化物中的证据，形成如CeOCI这样的化合物，这被认为是催化反应增强的原因。表面氯化导致了活性中心的变化，可能通过改变表面氧离子的电子密度或作为它们的稀释剂来增强催化活性，从而促进乙烷氧化并提高乙烯选择性。
