[C1] "The addition of TCM to the ODE feedstream is shown from XPS to introduce surface C1 on the CeO2, forming CeOC1 which is apparently responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed with CeO2."
[C2] "Since the homogeneous reaction participates in the ethane conversion process to a considerably greater extent at 973 K, the effects due to the chlorinated surfaces are diminished at this temperature."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically CeO2, introduces surface chlorine (Cl) that forms CeOC1 upon interaction with ethane. This modification enhances the catalytic activity by disrupting the surface chemistry and modifying chemical bonding. The presence of CeOC1 is responsible for the observed improvement in ethane oxidation reactions over CeO2. The nature and location of active centers are thus altered, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates. The implications for industrially relevant reactions are significant, as the enhanced catalytic performance can lead to more efficient processes, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, which is crucial for the production of higher value-added chemicals.

在金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是CeO2中进行的掺杂，表面引入氯（Cl），形成CeOC1与乙烷相互作用。这种修改通过改变表面化学和化学键的性质来增强催化活性。表面活性中心的性质和位置因此被改变，导致转化率和选择性提高。工业相关反应的含义是重大的，因为增强的催化性能可以导致更高效的工艺，如乙烷的氧化脱氢，这对于生产更高价值的化学品至关重要。
