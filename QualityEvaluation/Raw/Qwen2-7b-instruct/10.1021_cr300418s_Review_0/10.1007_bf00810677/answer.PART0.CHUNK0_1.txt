[1] "Earlier work from our laboratories has shown that the introduction of small quantities (< 1 mol%) of tetra-chloromethane (TCM) into the feedstream for the partial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane generally has advantageous effects in increasing the conversion of methane and/or the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene [1,2]."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has been compared with and without TCM on several catalysts in our laboratories [4-7]."
[3] "With 12-molybdophosphoric acid supported on silica the conversion is increased on addition of TCM to the feedstream while the C2 selectivities are unaffected."
[4] "In the oxidation of methane and of ethane on magnesium salts,where TCM is present, evidence for the formation of magnesium chloride has been found [6-10]."
[5] "Rare earth oxides, for example, Sm203 and La203, have been shown to be highly active in the oxidative coupling of methane [12-15] and such oxides have been employed as catalysts in comparative studies of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) in the absence of TCM [16]."
[6] "The addition of small quantities of TCM into the ODE feedstream has been investigated on La203, Sm203, Pr6Oll and CeO2 at 773 and 973 K."
[7] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence and absence of tetrachloromethane (TCM) has been investigated on La203, Sm203, Pr6011 and CeO2 at 773 and 973 K."
[8] "The use of TCM in the ODE at 773 and 973 K produced beneficial effects on CeO2 but not on the remaining three rare earth oxides examined."
[9] "Since the homogeneous reaction participates in the ethane conversion process to a considerably greater extent at 973 K, the effects due to the chlorinated surfaces are diminished at this temperature."

To understand how substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, consider the role of Tetrachloromethane (TCM) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The introduction of TCM into the reaction mixture enhances the conversion of ethane and the selectivity towards ethylene, especially on cerium oxide (CeO2). This suggests that TCM modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2 by introducing chlorine atoms, leading to the formation of CeOC1. This chlorided surface increases the catalytic activity by promoting ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. However, the impact diminishes at higher temperatures, as the homogeneous reaction becomes more dominant.

In terms of the implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the presence of TCM can lead to the formation of various compounds like magnesium chloride (in the context of magnesium-based catalysts), which might act as diluents or perturb the electron density of the surface oxygen ions. This disruption affects the electron distribution on the surface, potentially creating new active sites or altering the reactivity of existing ones.

For the nature and location of active centers, the chlorided surface appears to play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity. The active centers could be located at the interface between the catalyst and the reactants, where the concentration of reactive species is high. The active sites are likely to be dynamic, changing as the reaction progresses and the surface chemistry evolves.

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions could stem from the ability to fine-tune the catalytic activity by controlling the amount of TCM added. For instance, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, adjusting the TCM concentration could optimize the yield of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side-products. This approach could also be applicable to other reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of methane, where the enhancement of specific product selectivities is desired.

The implications for industrially relevant reactions include increased efficiency, reduced waste, and potentially lower energy consumption. By understanding how TCM interacts with different catalyst materials, it might be possible to develop more selective and efficient catalysts for a variety of industrial processes, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.

金属氧化物催化剂中通过掺杂取代阳离子对表面化学性质进行调整，破坏化学键，进而产生催化活性增强、活性中心性质与位置变化以及对工业相关反应潜在改进的影响。

以四氯化碳（TCM）在乙烷脱氢氧化中的应用为例，引入TCM能够提高乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性，特别是在铈氧化物（CeO2）上效果显著。这表明TCM通过在CeO2表面上引入氯原子，形成CeOC1，从而修改了表面化学性质，增加了催化活性。然而，在较高温度下，这种影响会减弱，因为同质反应对乙烷转化过程的贡献更大。

对于催化活性增强的含义，TCM的存在可能导致形成如镁盐中的氯化镁等化合物，这些化合物可能作为稀释剂或扰乱表面氧离子的电子密度。这种扰动会影响表面的电子分布，可能创造出新的活性位点或者改变现有位点的活性。

关于活性中心的性质和位置，氯化表面似乎在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用。活性中心可能位于催化剂与反应物之间的界面，该处反应物浓度高。这些活性位点很可能是动态的，随着反应的进行和表面化学性质的变化而变化。

对于工业相关反应的潜在改进包括提高了效率、减少了副产物，并且可能降低了能耗。通过理解TCM与不同催化剂材料之间的相互作用，有可能开发出更选择性和高效的催化剂，适用于各种工业过程，带来成本节省和环境效益。

这些影响对于工业相关反应的含义包括更高的效率、减少废物以及可能的更低能耗。通过理解如何调整TCM的添加量，可以优化不同催化剂材料的活性，为各种工业过程开发更具有选择性的催化剂，从而带来成本节约和环境益处。
