[1] "Earlier work from our laboratories has shown that the introduction of small quantities (< 1 mol%) of tetrachloromethane (TCM) into the feedstream for the partial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane generally has advantageous effects in increasing the conversion of methane and/or the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene [1,2]."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has been compared with and without TCM on several catalysts in our laboratories [4-7]. With 12-molybdophosphoric acid supported on silica the conversion is increased on addition of TCM to the feedstream while the C2 selectivities are unaffected."
[3] "With 12-molybdophosphoric acid supported on silica the conversion is increased on addition of TCM to the feedstream while the C2 selectivities are unaffected."
[4] "Rare earth oxides, for example, Sm203 and La203, have been shown to be highly active in the oxidative coupling of methane [12- 15] and such oxides have been employed as catalysts in comparative studies of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) in the absence of TCM [16]."
[5] "The addition of TCM to the ODE feedstream is shown from XPS to introduce surface C1 on the CeO2, forming CeOC1 which is apparently responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed with CeO2."
[6] "Since the homogeneous reaction participates in the ethane conversion process to a considerably greater extent at 973 K, the effects due to the chlorinated surfaces are diminished at this temperature."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing foreign atoms that disrupt chemical bonding. This alteration can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the reactivity of existing ones. The nature and location of these active centers depend on the specific dopant and the host material. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include increased conversion efficiency, selectivity towards desired products, and reduced energy consumption.

2. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement include improved conversion rates, higher selectivity to specific products, and the ability to control reaction pathways more precisely. The location of active centers might shift due to the dopant's influence on the crystal structure or electronic properties of the catalyst.

3. The nature of the modification involves the introduction of dopants that can act as electron donors or acceptors, altering the electronic environment around the catalyst surface. This can affect the adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

4. In the context of rare earth oxides, doping can lead to significant changes in the catalytic behavior of materials typically used in methane oxidation or ethane dehydrogenation. The introduction of dopants like TCM can enhance the catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the existing ones.

5. The active role of the chlorinated surface in enhancing the conversion of ethane and selectivity to ethylene is attributed to the formation of CeOC1 on the surface of CeO2. This chlorided surface appears to suppress the oxidation of ethylene, thus improving the selectivity.

6. At higher temperatures, such as 973 K, the effects of chlorinated surfaces on enhancing catalytic activity are diminished. This is because the homogeneous reaction contributes more significantly to the ethane conversion process, overshadowing the benefits provided by the chlorinated surfaces.

1. 添加剂如四氯化碳在金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂，通过改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键，提高了催化活性。这种修改可以创建新的活性中心或改变现有中心的反应性，依赖于特定的掺杂剂和载体材料。工业相关反应的潜在改进包括提高转化率、更高的目标产物选择性和精确控制反应路径的能力。

2. 活性中心的性质和位置可能由于掺杂剂对催化剂晶格结构或电子性质的影响而发生变化。这可以影响反应物、中间体和产物的吸附，从而提高催化性能。

3. 修改涉及向催化剂表面引入可作为电子供体或受体的掺杂剂，改变周围环境。这可以影响吸附的反应物、中间体和产物，导致增强的催化性能。

4. 在稀土氧化物中，掺杂可能导致材料在甲烷氧化或乙烷脱氢方面的显著变化。向材料中引入像四氯化碳这样的掺杂剂可以增强催化活性，通过创建新的活性中心或修改现有中心。

5. 乙烷转化和乙二醇选择性的增强作用归因于在CeO2表面形成CeOC1。氯化表面似乎抑制了乙二醇的氧化，从而提高了选择性。

6. 在较高温度下（如973 K），氯化表面对增强催化活性的影响减弱。这是因为同质反应对乙烷转化过程的贡献更大，掩盖了氯化表面提供的益处。
