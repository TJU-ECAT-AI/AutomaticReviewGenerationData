The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the structure and composition of the oxide surface. This disruption leads to the modification of catalytic activity, potentially enhancing it through the creation of new active centers. These active centers can be either the oxygen atoms close to the dopant or the dopants themselves. Additionally, anion doping might also offer benefits by changing the chemical environment. Computational work has provided insights into the properties of doped oxides, classifying dopant-oxide pairs based on common properties obtained through simulations. However, computational methods have inherent limitations due to inaccuracies in total energy calculations and lack of knowledge about the actual morphology and composition of the catalyst under operational conditions. Despite these limitations, computations can still be useful in identifying qualitative trends and rules for catalyst design, thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering more effective oxide catalysts.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，掺杂离子的置换修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键合，通过改变氧化物表面的结构和组成。这种破坏导致催化活性的调整，可能通过创建新的活性中心来增强它。这些活性中心可能是靠近掺杂物的氧原子或掺杂物本身。此外，阴离子掺杂也可能带来好处，通过改变化学环境。计算工作已经提供了关于掺杂氧化物的见解，根据模拟得到的共同属性对掺杂物-氧化物对进行了分类。然而，计算方法存在固有的局限性，由于实际能量计算的不准确性以及对操作条件下氧化物催化剂形态和组成的未知。尽管存在这些局限性，但计算仍然可以在识别设计催化剂的定性趋势和规则方面发挥作用，从而增加发现更有效氧化物催化剂的可能性。
