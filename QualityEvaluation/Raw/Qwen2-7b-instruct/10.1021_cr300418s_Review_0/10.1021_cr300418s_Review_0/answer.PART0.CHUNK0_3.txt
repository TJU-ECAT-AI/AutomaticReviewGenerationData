Catalysis by doped oxides involves modifying surface chemistry and disrupting chemical bonding through substitutional cation doping. This disruption is expected to enhance catalytic activity by creating favorable conditions for active centers, which could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopants themselves. While anion doping has been explored for changing optical properties, it is less commonly discussed in the context of catalysis. Computational work on doped oxides aims to identify qualitative trends and rules for catalyst design, focusing on total energy inaccuracies and the unknown morphology or composition of oxides under working conditions. These limitations guide the use of computations in identifying potentially better oxide catalysts.

掺杂氧化物通过替换阳离子实现催化活性的增强，这一过程会改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键。这种破坏有望通过创造有利于活性中心的条件来提高催化活性，这些活性中心可能是靠近掺杂剂的氧原子或掺杂剂本身。对于阴离子掺杂，虽然它已被证明可以改变光催化剂的光学性质，但在催化作用方面的应用较少讨论。计算工作在氧化物掺杂方面旨在识别催化剂设计的定性趋势和规则，重点关注实际可使用的计算方法在总能量准确性上的不足以及在工作条件下未知的氧化物形态或组成。这些限制指导着计算在寻找可能更好的氧化物催化剂方面的应用。
