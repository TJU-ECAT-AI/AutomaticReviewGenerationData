"Catalysis by Doped Oxides" - "For example, VOx clusters supported on ceria (8, 9) are more active for methanol oxidation (and many other reactions) than either V2O5 or CeO2."
"Catalysis by Doped Oxides" - "We do not know of any work that has proven that the improvements come from the substitution of some of the oxygen atoms with halogens."
"Catalysis by Doped Oxides" - "Rather than attempting to cover all work on catalysis by doped oxides, which is rather vast and fragmentary, we examine in some depth a few examples on which data are more abundant and the research is more extensive and more systematic."
"Catalysis by Doped Oxides" - "One of the questions we ask in this Review is: Are there hints in the experiments that these rules are obeyed?"

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the composition and structure of the oxide surface. This disruption influences the catalytic activity by creating new reactive sites or modifying existing ones, potentially enhancing the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. The nature and location of active centers can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopants themselves. For instance, VOx clusters supported on ceria exhibit higher activity for methanol oxidation compared to their bulk counterparts. However, there is insufficient evidence proving that improvements in catalytic activity result from the substitution of oxygen atoms with halogens. Computational studies are valuable in predicting qualitative trends and rules for catalyst design, aiding in the identification of better oxide catalysts. These calculations classify dopant-oxide pairs based on common properties, offering insights into whether experimental results align with computational predictions.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过掺杂改变组分和结构，可以修改表面化学性质并破坏化学键。这会影响催化活性，通过创建新的反应位点或修改现有位点，从而提高工业相关反应的效率。活性中心的性质和位置可能是掺杂原子附近的氧原子或掺杂原子本身。例如，铈上支持的VOx簇对于甲醇氧化表现出更高的活性，与它们的体相对应物相比。然而，目前缺乏证据证明催化活性的改善来自于氧原子被卤素取代。计算研究在预测催化剂设计的定性趋势和规则方面非常有价值，有助于识别更好的氧化物催化剂。这些计算将掺杂剂-氧化物对分类为基于共同属性的属性，提供实验结果是否遵循计算预测的线索。
