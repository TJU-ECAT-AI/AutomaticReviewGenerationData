[1] "Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications."
[2] "In this system, as in the other two mentioned above, we place the oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations with the intention of improving their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions."
[3] "The performance depends strongly on the method of preparation; and it is difficult to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared."
[4] "Computations are most useful, at this time, if they look for qualitative trends and qualitative rules for catalyst design."
[5] "One of the questions we ask in this Review is: Are there hints in the experiments that these rules are obeyed?"

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding, potentially enhancing catalytic activity through the creation of unique bonding situations for oxygen atoms or the dopants themselves. The active centers can be either oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself, depending on the specific chemical environment.

2. The effectiveness of substitutional cation doping is highly dependent on the method of preparation, and it's challenging to confirm the successful doping of oxides due to the difficulty in providing conclusive evidence.

3. Computational methods are most beneficial for identifying qualitative trends and rules that can guide the design of better oxide catalysts. They offer insights into the properties of dopant-oxide pairs based on common characteristics obtained through computations.

4. The experiments suggest that the rules derived from computational studies might align with observed improvements in catalytic activity, indicating a possible correlation between theoretical predictions and practical outcomes.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过掺杂离子改变表面化学性质，破坏化学键，可能通过为氧原子或掺杂剂创造独特的结合情况来增强催化活性。活性中心可以是靠近掺杂剂的氧原子，也可以是掺杂剂本身，具体取决于特定的化学环境。

2. 掺杂氧化物的有效性高度依赖于制备方法，并且由于难以提供明确证据证明掺杂成功，因此确定这一点具有挑战性。

3. 计算方法在识别指导更好氧化物催化剂设计的定性趋势和规则方面最为有益。它们提供了基于计算得出的共性特征的掺杂剂-氧化物对的性质见解。

4. 实验结果表明，从计算研究中得出的规则与观察到的催化活性改善之间可能存在一致性，暗示理论预测与实际结果之间存在可能的相关性。
