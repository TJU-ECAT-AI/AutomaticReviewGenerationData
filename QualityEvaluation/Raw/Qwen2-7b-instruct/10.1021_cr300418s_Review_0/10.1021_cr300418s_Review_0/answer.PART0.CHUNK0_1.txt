1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment around the dopant and nearby oxygen atoms. This modification can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites, either involving the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself, depending on the specific doping element and the reaction mechanism.

2. Replacing anions with other anions in metal oxide catalysts can also be beneficial. This anion doping might change the optical properties of the catalyst, which could impact its efficiency in light-driven processes like photocatalysis.

3. Computational methods are valuable in identifying qualitative trends and rules for catalyst design. They can help predict the behavior of dopant-oxide pairs, aiding in the search for improved catalysts by providing insights into how different doping strategies affect catalytic activity and stability.

4. Calculations have classified dopant-oxide pairs based on their common properties, offering guidance on which combinations might yield the most effective catalysts. However, these predictions need to be corroborated with experimental results, as computational models do not account for the complexities of real-world working conditions.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过掺杂离子改变了表面化学和化学键，这会影响掺杂剂及其附近氧原子周围的电子结构和配位环境。这种改变可以提高催化活性，形成新的活性位点，这些位点可能涉及靠近掺杂剂的氧原子或掺杂剂本身，具体取决于掺杂元素和反应机制。

2. 可以想象用其他阴离子替换某些阴离子在金属氧化物催化剂中也是有益的。这种阴离子掺杂可能会改变催化剂的光学性质，从而影响其在光驱动过程如光催化中的效率。

3. 计算方法对于确定催化剂设计的定性趋势和规则很有价值。它们可以帮助预测掺杂氧化物对的行为，通过提供关于不同掺杂策略如何影响催化活性和稳定性的见解，帮助寻找改进的催化剂。

4. 根据计算结果分类的掺杂剂-氧化物对提供了指导，指出哪些组合可能产生最有效的催化剂。然而，这些预测需要与实验结果相吻合，因为计算模型无法考虑实际工作条件的复杂性。
