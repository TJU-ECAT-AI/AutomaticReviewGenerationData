[1] "In consequence,the reader is left with only a few disjointed insights into the dynamics of Soviet society and almost no coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research."
[2] "The result,not surprisingly,is a relentless exposure of Soviet hypocrisy-one with which most scholars in the field (the reviewer included) would probably sympathize, yet one that may strike some student readers as evidence of 'anti-Soviet bias.'"
[3] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."

The review by Grey Hodnett criticizes Robert G. Wesson's work for providing fragmented insights into Soviet society and lacking coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research. It also notes that the relentless exposure of Soviet hypocrisy might be seen as anti-Soviet bias, especially to student readers. However, Hodnett acknowledges that Wesson has achieved his goal of writing a readable textbook that is thematically integrated and contains useful details, despite occasional oversimplifications. The review by Jeremy R. Azrael praises Wesson for combining balanced coverage of Soviet society's aspects with commendable depth, focusing on the strain towards autocratic structures in both the tsarist and Soviet periods due to the functional need to prevent disintegration in a vast empire. The review also mentions that Wesson's work ranks well above most other introductory texts in this area.

评论者格雷·霍德特批评罗伯特·G·韦森的作品提供了苏联社会的零碎见解，缺乏独立思考和研究的连贯指导方针。它还指出，对苏联虚伪的持续揭露可能被视为对苏联的偏见，尤其是对学生读者来说。然而，霍德特承认韦森已经实现了他写一本可读的教科书的目标，该书主题整合良好，并包含有用细节，尽管偶尔存在过度概括或事实的可疑断言。杰里米·R·阿泽尔教授的评论赞扬韦森结合了对苏联社会各方面平衡的覆盖与令人钦佩的深度，强调了在沙皇时期和苏联时期存在的向集权体制的压力，由于需要防止帝国庞大的俄罗斯主导的多民族帝国的分裂而存在。评论还提到，在这个领域，韦森的工作在众多入门教材中排名较高。
