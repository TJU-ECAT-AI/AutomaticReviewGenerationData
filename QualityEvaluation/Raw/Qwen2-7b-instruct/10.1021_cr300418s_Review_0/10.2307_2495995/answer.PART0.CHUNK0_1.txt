The Soviet Russian State is a comprehensive textbook designed for undergraduate courses focusing on Soviet politics. It delves into the historical context, ideology, party, state, economy, law, military, nationalities, and international relations. The author, Robert G. Wesson, explores the tension between the need for Western technology and maintaining political control within the empire.
