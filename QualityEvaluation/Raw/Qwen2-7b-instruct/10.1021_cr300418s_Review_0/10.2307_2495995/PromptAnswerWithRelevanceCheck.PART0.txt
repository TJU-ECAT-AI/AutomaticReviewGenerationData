[1] "In consequence,the reader is left with only a few disjointed insights into the dynamics of Soviet society and almost no coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research."
[2] "The result,not surprisingly,is a relentless exposure of Soviet hypocrisy-one with which most scholars in the field (the reviewer included) would probably sympathize, yet one that may strike some student readers as evidence of 'anti-Soviet bias.'"
[3] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."
[4] "It needed the passionate and combative spirit of Jasny -to launch the theme and to force it upon scholarship, West and -East."

The review by Grey Hodnett criticizes Robert G. Wesson's work for providing fragmented insights into Soviet society and lacking coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research. It also notes that the relentless exposure of Soviet hypocrisy might be seen as anti-Soviet bias, especially to student readers. However, Hodnett acknowledges that Wesson has achieved his goal of writing a readable textbook that is thematically integrated and contains useful details, despite occasional oversimplifications. The review by Jeremy R. Azrael praises Wesson for combining balanced coverage of Soviet society's aspects with commendable depth, focusing on the strain towards autocratic structures in both the tsarist and Soviet periods due to the functional need to prevent disintegration in a vast empire. The review also mentions that Wesson's work ranks well above most other introductory texts in this area.
