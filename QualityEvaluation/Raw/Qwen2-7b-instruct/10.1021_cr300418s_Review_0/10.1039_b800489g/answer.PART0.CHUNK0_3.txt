This critical review shows the basis of photocatalytic water splitting and experimental points, and surveys heterogeneous photocatalyst materials for water splitting into H2 and O2, and H2 or O2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing a sacrificial reagent.
Many oxides consisting of metal cations with d0 and d10 configurations, metal (oxy)sulfide and metal (oxy)nitride photocatalysts have been reported, especially during the latest decade. The fruitful photocatalyst library gives important information on factors affecting photocatalytic performances and design of new materials.
Photocatalytic water splitting and H2 evolution using abundant compounds as electron donors are expected to contribute to construction of a clean and simple system for solar hydrogen production, and a solution of global energy and environmental issues in the future.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and composition of the catalyst. This leads to the creation of new active sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing the catalytic activity. The nature and location of active centers change, which can improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions such as water splitting and hydrogen evolution. By optimizing these parameters, one can achieve more effective and sustainable solar hydrogen production systems, addressing global energy and environmental challenges.
