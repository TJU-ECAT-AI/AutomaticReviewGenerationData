1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by replacing certain metal ions with others, which can alter the electronic structure and introduce new functionalities. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity due to changes in the active center properties, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions by increasing efficiency and selectivity.

2. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement involve the creation of new active sites on the catalyst surface due to the introduction of dopants, which can facilitate faster reaction rates and better control over the reaction pathways. The nature and location of active centers may shift, depending on the specific dopant and its interaction with the host material. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions could include more efficient hydrogen production through water splitting, leading to cleaner and simpler systems for solar hydrogen generation.
