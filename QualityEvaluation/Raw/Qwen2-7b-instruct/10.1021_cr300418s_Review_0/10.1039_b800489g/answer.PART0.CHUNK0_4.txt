The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This is because doping changes the electronic structure of the catalyst, which affects its surface properties and reactivity. As a result, the nature and location of active centers within the catalyst are altered, potentially improving its performance in industrially relevant reactions such as water splitting for hydrogen production. The modification of chemical bonding through doping can lead to more efficient charge separation and transfer, which are crucial for enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键，从而提高了催化活性。这是因为掺杂改变了催化剂的电子结构，这影响了其表面性质和反应性。因此，催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置会发生变化，可能提高其在工业相关反应（如水分解制氢）中的性能。通过掺杂修改化学键可以导致更高效的电荷分离和传输，这对于增强整体催化效率至关重要。
