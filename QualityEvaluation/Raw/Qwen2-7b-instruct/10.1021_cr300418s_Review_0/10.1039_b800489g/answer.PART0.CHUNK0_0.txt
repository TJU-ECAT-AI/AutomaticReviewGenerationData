The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This is because the doping changes the electronic structure and surface properties of the catalysts, creating more active sites for reactions. The resulting implications include improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity in industrially relevant reactions. The nature and location of active centers also change due to doping, which can lead to more efficient utilization of reactants and products.
