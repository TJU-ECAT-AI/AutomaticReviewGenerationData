Answer: Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies the electronic structure of the catalyst surface, disrupting the chemical bonding. This leads to an enhancement of catalytic activity as new active sites are created, which depend on the type of dopant used. These modifications are particularly beneficial for industrially relevant reactions, improving their efficiency and selectivity.
