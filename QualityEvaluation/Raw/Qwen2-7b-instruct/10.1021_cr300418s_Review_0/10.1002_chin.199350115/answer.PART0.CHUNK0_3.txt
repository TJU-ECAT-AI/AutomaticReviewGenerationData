</ChineseVersionAnswer>

Answer: The provided literature focuses on the oxidative coupling of methane over alkali sulphates, examining its behavior with and without the presence of tetrachloromethane. It does not specifically discuss substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, surface chemistry modifications, disruptions to chemical bonding, enhanced catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, or improvements in industrially relevant reactions. Therefore, these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.
