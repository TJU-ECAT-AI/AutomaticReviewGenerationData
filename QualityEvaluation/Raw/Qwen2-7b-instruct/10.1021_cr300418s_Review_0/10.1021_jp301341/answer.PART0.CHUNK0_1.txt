[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."
[4] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
[5] "However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen."

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, decreasing the energy required to form oxygen vacancies and enhancing the binding of various bases (such as H, CH3, CO) to the doped oxide surface.
2. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, effectively adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.
3. When the basicity of the dopant isn't too high, the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 molecules retain some acidity, enabling reactions with Lewis bases.
4. If the dopant is highly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 becomes excessively bound, losing its chemical reactivity.
5. In specific circumstances, the group consisting of the dopant and adsorbed oxygen behaves like a low-valence dopant, activating the surface oxygen.

1. 可还原氧化物展现出Lewis酸性质，降低了形成氧空位的能量，并增加了表面掺杂氧化物上各种基团（如H、CH3、CO）的结合能。
2. 高价掺杂物表现为Lewis碱，有效吸附Lewis酸如O2或卤素分子。
3. 当掺杂物的碱性不是太高时，吸附的氧或Br2分子仍保留一定的酸性，能够与Lewis碱发生反应。
4. 如果掺杂物过于碱性，吸附的氧或Br2变得过度束缚，失去了化学活性。
5. 在某些情况下，由掺杂物和吸附的氧组成的群体表现出低价掺杂物的行为，激活了表面氧。
