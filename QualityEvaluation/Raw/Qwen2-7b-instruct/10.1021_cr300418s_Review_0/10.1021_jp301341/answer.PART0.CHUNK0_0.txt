[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and makes the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic."

1. Reducible oxides, when doped, become Lewis acids, which lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increases the binding energy of bases like H, CH3, and CO to the surface, and makes the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic. 
2. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, strongly adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 and halogen molecules.
3. Oxides doped with low-valence dopants become Lewis acids, lowering oxygen vacancy formation energy, increasing base binding energy, and enhancing alkane dissociation exothermicity.

1. 可还原氧化物，当掺杂时，会成为路易斯酸，这降低了氧空位形成的能量，增加了表面基团（如H、CH3和CO）的结合能，并使烷烃的离解吸附更放热。
2. 高价掺杂物充当路易斯碱，强烈吸附路易斯酸如O2和卤素分子。
3. 当用低价掺杂物掺杂时，氧化物成为路易斯酸，降低了氧空位形成能量，增加了基团的结合能，并增强了烷烃的离解放热量。
