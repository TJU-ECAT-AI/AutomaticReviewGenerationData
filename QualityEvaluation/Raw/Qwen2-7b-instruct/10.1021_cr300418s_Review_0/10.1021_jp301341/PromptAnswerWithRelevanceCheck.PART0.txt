[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and makes the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic."

1. Reducible oxides, when doped, exhibit Lewis acid properties that lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of various bases to the surface. This modification can increase the catalytic activity of the oxide.

2. High-valence dopants, on the other hand, are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.

3. Low-valence dopants in metal oxides transform the material into a Lewis acid, which leads to decreased energy for oxygen vacancy formation, increased binding of Lewis bases, and enhanced exothermicity in the dissociative adsorption of alkanes.

4. Reducible oxides, due to their inherent Lewis acid nature, facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, strengthen the interaction with single metal atoms, and potentially improve the efficiency of catalytic reactions.

[1] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[2] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base. This modification can be achieved by preadsorbing on the surface electron donors. Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."
[3] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide. This reduces the energy to form the vacancy."
[4] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active.

1. The rules for Lewis acid-base interactions in oxide surfaces are applicable generally, with significant effects observed, and they can be applied to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of their specific chemical nature.

2. Modifying an oxide surface to become a Lewis base can significantly increase the binding energy of a Lewis acid. Conversely, modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid can increase the binding energy of a Lewis base. This can be achieved by adsorbing electron donors or doping with low-valence dopants, respectively.

3. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which lower the energy required to form oxygen vacancies and increase the binding energy of single metal atoms. The unpaired electrons from oxygen vacancies are transferred to the cations in the oxide, facilitating the formation of the vacancy.

4. High-valence dopants function as Lewis bases, adsorbing strongly with Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules. If the dopant is not overly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or halogen retains sufficient acidity to react with other Lewis bases. However, if the dopant is highly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or halogen is bound too tightly, losing its chemical reactivity.

1. 离子酸碱相互作用在氧化物表面的规则具有普遍性，观察到显著效应，并且可以应用于涉及Lewis酸和碱基的任何化学过程，无论它们的具体化学性质如何。

2. 通过吸附电子供体或掺杂低价掺杂剂来改变氧化物表面的性质，可以显著增加Lewis酸的结合能。相反，通过掺杂形成Lewis酸性质，可以增加Lewis碱的结合能。这可以通过吸附电子供体或掺杂低价掺杂剂实现。

3. 可还原氧化物表现出Lewis酸性质，降低了形成氧空位所需的能量，并增加了单金属原子的结合能。从氧空位释放的不成对电子被氧化物中的离子捕获，促进氧空位的形成。

4. 高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱起作用，强烈吸附Lewis酸如O2或卤素分子。如果掺杂剂不是过于碱性，吸附的氧气或卤素保持足够的酸性以与其它Lewis碱反应。然而，如果掺杂剂过于碱性，吸附的氧气或卤素将被紧紧绑定，失去其化学活性。
