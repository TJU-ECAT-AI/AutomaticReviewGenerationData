[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding energy of single metal atoms.
2. High-valence dopants function as Lewis bases, effectively adsorbing Lewis acids such as oxygen molecules (O2) or halogen molecules (X2).
3. The proposed rules demonstrate broad applicability across various chemical processes involving Lewis acids and bases, with notable effects and generalizability across different chemical systems.
