[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[4] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

1. Reducible oxides, when doped, exhibit Lewis acid properties that lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of various bases to the surface. This modification can increase the catalytic activity of the oxide.

2. High-valence dopants, on the other hand, are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.

3. Low-valence dopants in metal oxides transform the material into a Lewis acid, which leads to decreased energy for oxygen vacancy formation, increased binding of Lewis bases, and enhanced exothermicity in the dissociative adsorption of alkanes.

4. Reducible oxides, due to their inherent Lewis acid nature, facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, strengthen the interaction with single metal atoms, and potentially improve the efficiency of catalytic reactions.

1. 可还原氧化物，在掺杂后显示出Lewis酸性质，降低了氧空位形成能并增强了表面各种碱的结合能力。这种修改可以提高氧化物的催化活性。

2. 高价掺杂物实际上是Lewis碱，强烈吸附像O2或卤素分子这样的Lewis酸。

3. 低价掺杂物在金属氧化物中使材料成为Lewis酸，导致氧空位形成能降低，Lewis碱结合能力增强，并且烷烃的解离吸附过程变得更放热。

4. 可还原氧化物由于其固有的Lewis酸性，促进了氧空位的形成，增强了单个金属原子的相互作用，并可能改善催化反应的效率。
