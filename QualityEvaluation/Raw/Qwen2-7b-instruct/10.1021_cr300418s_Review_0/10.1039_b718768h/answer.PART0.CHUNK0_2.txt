[1] "The use of oxide films provides a versatile strategy for the study of model systems in catalysis. The thickness of the oxide film may be used as a control parameter on one hand to design and investigate materials in their own right whose properties may open interesting routes for catalyst design and on the other hand as models of dispersed metal catalysts on bulk oxide surfaces."
[2] "Understanding the growth of particles is important, in particular, when different metals are compared. It turns out that, for example, Co interacts strongly with an alumina substrate while Pd interacts more weakly and is considerably more mobile. This leads to the formation of relatively big Pd clusters at room temperature as shown in Fig. 4 while Co forms small clusters, homogeneously distributed across the surface (not shown)."
[3] "The activation of supported particles on specific defects We have seen above that STM is essential to obtain direct images of the structure of the oxide surface and of the supported nanoclusters. This is a crucial aspect since the identification of the structure and composition of a supported particle or a metal cluster is a difficult task."
[4] "The extent of tunnelling (hence of charging) is expected to depend directly on the thickness of the oxide film: beyond a given thickness, typically 10 ML, the behaviour of a bulk oxide surface should be recovered. This aspect has been explored both theoretically and experimentally."
[5] "The origin of the change in shape of the Au20 cluster on MgO(100) and MgO/Mo(100) films is the occurrence of a charge transfer from the Mo substrate to the Au cluster on the thin film. The charge localizes at the AuMgO interface, and strongly reinforces the AuMgO interaction by about 1 eV atom thus favoring the structural cross-over."

1. The use of oxide films in catalysis allows for the design of materials with unique properties suitable for catalyst development, as well as modeling dispersed metal catalysts on bulk oxide surfaces. Different metal interactions with the substrate influence cluster growth patterns.
2. Co and Pd exhibit distinct behaviors when deposited on alumina substrates. Co forms small, evenly distributed clusters, whereas Pd creates larger clusters due to its weaker interaction with the substrate.
3. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) plays a vital role in identifying the structure and composition of supported particles or metal clusters, which is a challenging task.
4. The spontaneous charging of supported metal particles on thin oxide films depends on the film's thickness, transitioning from a thin film's unique behavior to that of a bulk oxide surface at a specific thickness.
5. The change in Au20 cluster shape on MgO(100) and MgO/Mo(100) films is attributed to a charge transfer from the Mo substrate to the Au cluster, enhancing the Au-MgO interaction and facilitating a structural transition.

1. 氧化物薄膜在催化剂研究中提供了灵活多样的策略。氧化物薄膜的厚度可以作为控制参数，一方面设计和研究自成一体的材料，这些材料的特性可能为催化剂设计开辟新的路径；另一方面，它们用作分散金属催化剂在基体氧化物表面的模型。
2. Co和Pd在沉积到铝酸盐基质上时表现出不同的行为。Co形成小而均匀分布的簇，而Pd由于其与基质的较弱相互作用形成了较大的簇。
3. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）对于识别支持粒子或金属簇的结构和组成至关重要，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。
4. 支持金属粒子在薄氧化物薄膜上的自发充电取决于薄膜的厚度，当薄膜达到特定厚度时，从薄膜的行为转变为基体氧化物表面。
5. MgO(100)和MgO/Mo(100)薄膜上Au20簇形状的变化归因于Mo基质向Au簇的电荷转移，增强Au-MgO相互作用，并促进结构过渡。
