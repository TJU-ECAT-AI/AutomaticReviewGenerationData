[1] "Films of ionic materials such as MgO or NaCl, on the contrary, induce a substantial reduction of the work function."
[2] "Charging on this substrate is neither expected nor observed."
[3] "The work function of the Mo(112) metal, 4.3 eV according to DFT calculations, becomes 4.7 eV upon growth of the silica film."
[4] "The modification of the metal/oxide work function is thus an essential parameter to determine the properties of deposited metal atoms, and ways to tune the work function in a controlled way are highly desirable."
[5] "There is another, essential effect which favours the occurrence of a charge transfer: this is the polaronic distortion of the oxide film which accompanies the formation of a charged species."
