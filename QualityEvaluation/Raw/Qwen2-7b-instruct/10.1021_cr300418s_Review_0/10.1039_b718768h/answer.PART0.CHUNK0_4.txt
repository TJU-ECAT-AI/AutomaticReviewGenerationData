The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The nature and location of active centers can change, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions. For instance, doping can lead to the formation of new reactive sites or alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating faster or more efficient reactions.
