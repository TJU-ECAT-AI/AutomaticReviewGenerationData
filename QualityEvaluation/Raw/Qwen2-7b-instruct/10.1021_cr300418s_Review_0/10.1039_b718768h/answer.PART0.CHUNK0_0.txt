While substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies the electronic structure and chemical properties of the catalyst surface, leading to changes in surface chemistry and disrupted chemical bonding, the specifics of how this impacts catalytic activity, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions depend on the type of dopant and the host oxide. The dopants can introduce new active sites, alter the redox properties of the surface, and influence the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. This can lead to enhanced catalytic performance, improved product yields, and optimized reaction pathways for various industrial processes. However, the exact effects require detailed study and may vary significantly based on the reaction conditions, the specific dopant, and the interaction with other components in the catalytic system.
