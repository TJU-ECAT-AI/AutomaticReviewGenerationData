The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating new active sites, which enhances catalytic activity. The nature and location of these active centers depend on the dopant used, influencing the selectivity of reactions. These modifications lead to more efficient industrial processes, reduced energy consumption, and minimized environmental impact.
