Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in various ways. This modification leads to the creation of new active centers and alters the electronic states of the oxide, which in turn enhances catalytic activity. The nature and location of these active centers are influenced by the type of dopant and the specific structure of the oxide. As a result, the catalysts exhibit improved performance in industrially relevant reactions.

For instance, the deposition of CeOx nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) catalysts leads to a high catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction. The CeOx/Cu catalysts show higher activity compared to Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) and Cu/ZnO(000 1) surfaces. The introduction of Ce3+ cations facilitates the dissociation of water on the surface, making the process exothermic. This change in the reaction mechanism, combined with the unique properties of ceria nanoparticles, results in a catalyst with significantly lower activation energy for the water-gas shift reaction.

In summary, substitutional cation doping modifies the surface chemistry and electronic states of metal oxides, leading to the creation of new active centers. These modifications enhance catalytic activity and lead to improved performance in industrially relevant reactions such as the water-gas shift process.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行取代阳离子掺杂可以以多种方式修改表面化学和破坏化学键。这种修改导致创建新的活性中心，并改变氧化物的电子状态，从而增强催化活性。活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂物类型和氧化物特定结构的影响。结果，催化剂在工业相关反应中的性能得到改善。

例如，将CeOx纳米颗粒沉积到Au(1 1 1)催化剂上，导致水气转换反应中表现出高催化性能。CeOx/Cu催化剂的活性比Cu/CeO2(1 1 1)和Cu/ZnO(000 1)表面高。引入Ce3+离子使表面水分解的过程变为放热过程。这一反应机制的变化，结合Ceia纳米颗粒的独特性质，导致具有明显较低活化能的催化剂。

总之，取代阳离子掺杂修改了表面化学和氧化物的电子状态，导致创建新的活性中心。这些修改增强了催化活性并导致工业相关反应（如水气转换过程）的性能提高。
