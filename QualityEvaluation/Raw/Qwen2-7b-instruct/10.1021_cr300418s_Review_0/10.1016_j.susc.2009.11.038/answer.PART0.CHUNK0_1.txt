[1] "In recent years, a series of studies has been published examining the growth of oxide nanoparticles on metal substrates. These studies have revealed structures for the supported oxide which are different from those found in bulk phases."
[2] "The oxide M metal interactions can alter the electronic states of the oxide producing new chemical properties."
[3] "In these systems, one can couple the special reactivity of the oxide nanoparticles to the reactivity of the metal to obtain high catalytic activity."
[4] "Furthermore, an oxide/metal system is also an attractive model for fundamental studies. It can be used to investigate the role of the oxide in a catalytic process, and how the stability of different reaction intermediates depends on the nature of the oxide."
[5] "Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a long time."
[6] "The application of surface science techniques are limited when working with oxide single crystals."
[7] "Since oxides can be insulators, the possibility of sample charging puts serious constraints on the application of electron- and ion-based characterization techniques."
[8] "As shown in Fig. 1, an inverse oxide/metal catalyst exposes oxide nanoparticles to the reactants."
[9] "Defect sites present in the oxide are not covered by metal particles, as in the case of a traditional metal/oxide catalyst."
[10] "On the inverse oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide interface."
[11] "The special properties of an oxide/metal interface can be used to improve or tune the activity of a catalyst."
[12] "CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1) [22], Pt(1 1 1) [15], Cu(1 1 1) [7] and Au(1 1 1) [6] are much easier to reduce than extended surfaces of bulk CeO2."
[13] "The reducibility of the oxide/ metal systems can be an important property since many bulk oxides exhibit a low reactivity and become chemically active only after the generation of O vacancies."
[14] "Au(1 1 1) cannot dissociate water and, therefore, is not able to catalyze the watergas shift (WGS) reaction."
[15] "Once the OH groups are formed, subsequent steps for the WGS process occur readily on the gold substrate."
[16] "The deposition of CeOx nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) produces an excellent WGS catalysts [6]."
[17] "Cu(1 1 1) has become a benchmark surface for studying the WGS reaction."
[18] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV [7]."
[19] "For comparison, we include results obtained under the same conditions for Cu(1 0 0) and 0.5 ML of Cu deposited on CeO2(1 1 1) [34]."
[20] "The CeOx nanoparticles supported on Cu(1 1 1) generated a catalyst which was 8 (at 650 K) to 23 times (at 575 K) more active than the clean Cu(1 1 1) substrate."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic states of the oxide, leading to new chemical properties. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, the creation of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions. Inverse oxide/metal systems allow coupling the special reactivity of oxide nanoparticles with the reactivity of the metal, increasing catalytic activity. These systems are attractive models for fundamental studies, enabling investigation of the role of the oxide in catalytic processes and how the stability of reaction intermediates depends on the oxide's nature. The special properties of the oxide/metal interface can be utilized to optimize catalyst activity. Oxide nanoparticles on metal substrates often exhibit easier reducibility compared to bulk oxides, which can generate O vacancies crucial for catalytic activity. Gold surfaces, like Au(1 1 1), are incapable of catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction, while ceria nanoparticles on gold surfaces can transform water dissociation into an exothermic process, reducing the activation energy required for the reaction. Copper surfaces, such as Cu(1 1 1), are benchmarked for studying the water-gas shift reaction, and ceria nanoparticles on copper surfaces further enhance this activity by decreasing the activation energy needed for the dissociation of water.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行掺杂，改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过改变氧化物的电子状态产生新的化学性质。这导致催化活性增强、活性中心的创建以及对工业相关反应的潜在改进。逆向氧化物/金属系统允许将氧化物纳米粒子的独特反应性与金属的反应性耦合，从而提高催化活性。这些系统是基础研究的吸引模型，可以用来探究氧化物在催化过程中的作用，以及不同氧化物性质如何影响反应中间体的稳定性。氧化物/金属界面的特殊性质可用于优化催化剂的活性。在金属基底上的氧化物纳米颗粒往往比块状氧化物更容易还原，这可以产生对于催化活性至关重要的氧空位。如Au(1 1 1)这样的金表面无法催化水煤气变换反应，而氧化铈纳米颗粒在金表面上可以将水的分解转化为一个放热过程，降低反应所需的活化能。铜表面，如Cu(1 1 1)，被用作研究水煤气变换反应的基准，而铜表面上的氧化铈纳米颗粒进一步增强了这一活性，通过降低水分解所需活化的能量。
