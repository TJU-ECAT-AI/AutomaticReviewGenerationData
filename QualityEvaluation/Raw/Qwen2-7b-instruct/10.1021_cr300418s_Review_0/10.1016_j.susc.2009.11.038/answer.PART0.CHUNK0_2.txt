[1] "There is a general desire to improve the configuration of industrial catalysts to take advantage of the intrinsic properties of metal oxides."
[2] "In recent years, a series of studies has been published examining the growth of oxide nanoparticles on metal substrates. These studies have revealed structures for the supported oxide which are different from those found in bulk phases."
[3] "The oxide M metal interactions can alter the electronic states of the oxide producing new chemical properties."
[4] "On an inverse oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide interface."
[5] "Furthermore, an oxide/metal system is also an attractive model for fundamental studies. It can be used to investigate the role of the oxide in a catalytic process, and how the stability of different reaction intermediates depends on the nature of the oxide."
[6] "Due to its ability to undergo a facile conversion between 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, ceria has unique applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
[7] "CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1), Cu(1 1 1), and Au(1 1 1) are much easier to reduce than extended surfaces of bulk CeO2."
[8] "Au(1 1 1) cannot dissociate water and, therefore, is not able to catalyze the watergas shift (WGS) reaction."
[9] "Once the OH groups are formed, subsequent steps for the WGS process occur readily on the gold substrate."
[10] "In TiO2x/Au(1 1 1) and CeO2x/Au(1 1 1), water dissociates on O vacancies of the oxide nanoparticles, CO adsorbs on Au sites located nearby, and subsequent reaction steps take place at the metaloxide interface."
[11] "Cu(1 1 1) has become a benchmark surface for studying the WGS reaction."
[12] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV."
[13] "Post-reaction surface analysis indicated that the dominant oxidation state of cerium in the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst was 3+."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic states of the oxide, leading to new chemical properties. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, as the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide interface. The nature and location of active centers are improved, potentially increasing the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. The configuration of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the stability of different reaction intermediates, demonstrating that optimizing the properties of both the oxide and metal components is essential for achieving high catalytic performance.
