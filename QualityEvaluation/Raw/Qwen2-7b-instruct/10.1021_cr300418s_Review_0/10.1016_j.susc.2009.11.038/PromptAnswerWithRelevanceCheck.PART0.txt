Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic states of the oxide, leading to new chemical properties. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, the creation of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions. Inverse oxide/metal systems allow coupling the special reactivity of oxide nanoparticles with the reactivity of the metal, increasing catalytic activity. These systems are attractive models for fundamental studies, enabling investigation of the role of the oxide in catalytic processes and how the stability of reaction intermediates depends on the oxide's nature. The special properties of the oxide/metal interface can be utilized to optimize catalyst activity. Oxide nanoparticles on metal substrates often exhibit easier reducibility compared to bulk oxides, which can generate O vacancies crucial for catalytic activity. Gold surfaces, like Au(1 1 1), are incapable of catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction, while ceria nanoparticles on gold surfaces can transform water dissociation into an exothermic process, reducing the activation energy required for the reaction. Copper surfaces, such as Cu(1 1 1), are benchmarked for studying the water-gas shift reaction, and ceria nanoparticles on copper surfaces further enhance this activity by decreasing the activation energy needed for the dissociation of water.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in various ways. This modification leads to the creation of new active centers and alters the electronic states of the oxide, which in turn enhances catalytic activity. The nature and location of these active centers are influenced by the type of dopant and the specific structure of the oxide. As a result, the catalysts exhibit improved performance in industrially relevant reactions.

For instance, the deposition of CeOx nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) catalysts leads to a high catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction. The CeOx/Cu catalysts show higher activity compared to Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) and Cu/ZnO(000 1) surfaces. The introduction of Ce3+ cations facilitates the dissociation of water on the surface, making the process exothermic. This change in the reaction mechanism, combined with the unique properties of ceria nanoparticles, results in a catalyst with significantly lower activation energy for the water-gas shift reaction.

In summary, substitutional cation doping modifies the surface chemistry and electronic states of metal oxides, leading to the creation of new active centers. These modifications enhance catalytic activity and lead to improved performance in industrially relevant reactions such as the water-gas shift process.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the electronic states of the oxide, leading to new chemical properties. This alteration affects the nature and location of active centers, enhancing catalytic activity. For instance, the deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) produces an excellent WGS catalyst, demonstrating the enhancement in catalytic activity. Similarly, ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transform the dissociation of water into an exothermic process, reducing the activation energy required for the reaction. These changes are crucial for improving industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the physical and chemical properties of the oxide component in the catalyst.

In conventional metal/oxide catalysts, the focus is typically on controlling the oxidation state and morphology of the metal. However, in inverse oxide/metal systems, the effect of the oxide on the reaction mechanism and the stability of different reaction intermediates can be studied. The optimization of both metal and oxide components is essential for practical applications in industry. The use of inverse oxide/metal catalysts can lead to more efficient and selective catalytic processes, contributing to advancements in various industrial sectors such as hydrocarbon conversion, environmental pollution control, and fuel synthesis.
