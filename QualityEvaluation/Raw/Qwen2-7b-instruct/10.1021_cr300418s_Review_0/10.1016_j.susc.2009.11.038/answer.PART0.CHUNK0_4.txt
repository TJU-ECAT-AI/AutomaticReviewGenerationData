[1] "Studies of metal oxide catalysts have widely increased in recent years due to the important role that these materials play in industrial catalytic processes for the conversion of hydrocarbons, the control of environmental pollution and the synthesis of fuels [1]."
[2] "Furthermore, a very large number of industrial catalysts consist of metal particles dispersed over an oxide support [2,3]."
[3] "In these systems, the oxide can behave as simple template for the dispersion of the metal or it can participate directly into the catalytic process [13]."
[4] "Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a long time [9,10]."
[5] "The application of surface science techniques are limited when working with oxide single crystals [8]."
[6] "Since oxides can be insulators, the possibility of sample charging puts serious constraints on the application of electron- and ion-based characterization techniques."
[7] "This problem is less critical for ultra-thin films grown on conductive single crystal substrates [8,11,12]."
[8] "Thus, many studies have been published investigating the growth of Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, TiO2, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, CoO, NiO, MoO3 and CeO2 on metal substrates [5,8,1113]."
[9] "In several cases, these studies have revealed structures for the supported oxide which are different from those found in bulk phases [5,7,8,11,1316]."
[10] "Fur- thermore, the oxide M metal interactions can alter the electronic states of the oxide producing new chemical properties [12]."
[11] "As we will see below, the special properties of an oxide/metal inter- face can be used to improve or tune the activity of a catalyst."
[12] "Due to its ability to undergo a facile conversion between 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, ceria has unique applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis [17,18]."
[13] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles and films has been studied on close packed metal surfaces of Ni [19], Cu [7,20,21], Rh [14,22], Ru [19,23,24], Pd [25], Re [26], Pt [15,27,28], and Au [6,16]."

[18] "Specific rates, activation energies, and reaction orders are consistent with data reported for ZnO-supported Cu catalysts [35,36]."
[19] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV [7]."
[20] "For comparison, we include results obtained under the same conditions for Cu(1 0 0) and 0.5 ML of Cu deposited on CeO2(1 1 1) [34]."
[21] "The CeOx nanoparticles supported on Cu(1 1 1) generated a catalyst which was 8 (at 650 K) to 23 times (at 575 K) more active than the clean Cu(1 1 1) substrate."
[22] "This was not the case for the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst [34], where there were only a few O vacancies in the ceria support."
[23] "When working with conventional metal/oxide catalysts, the major emphasis is usually in controlling the oxidation state and morphology of the metal in the catalytic system."
[24] "Inverse oxide/metal systems can be used to test this hypothesis [6,7,4042]."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the electronic states of the oxide, leading to new chemical properties. This alteration affects the nature and location of active centers, enhancing catalytic activity. For instance, the deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) produces an excellent WGS catalyst, demonstrating the enhancement in catalytic activity. Similarly, ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transform the dissociation of water into an exothermic process, reducing the activation energy required for the reaction. These changes are crucial for improving industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the physical and chemical properties of the oxide component in the catalyst.

In conventional metal/oxide catalysts, the focus is typically on controlling the oxidation state and morphology of the metal. However, in inverse oxide/metal systems, the effect of the oxide on the reaction mechanism and the stability of different reaction intermediates can be studied. The optimization of both metal and oxide components is essential for practical applications in industry. The use of inverse oxide/metal catalysts can lead to more efficient and selective catalytic processes, contributing to advancements in various industrial sectors such as hydrocarbon conversion, environmental pollution control, and fuel synthesis.

在金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂通过改变氧化物的电子状态，导致新的化学性质，从而修改表面化学和破坏化学键。这影响活性中心的性质和位置，增强催化活性。例如，在Au(1 1 1)上沉积铈氧化合物纳米颗粒产生了优秀的水煤气转换催化剂，表明了催化活性的增强。同样，在Cu(1 1 1)上沉积铈氧化合物将水分解过程转化为放热过程，降低了反应所需的活化能。这些变化对于改善工业相关反应至关重要，通过优化催化剂中氧化物成分的物理和化学性质。

在传统的金属/氧化物催化剂中，重点通常放在控制金属的氧化态和形态。然而，在逆向氧化物/金属系统中，可以测试这一假设，并研究氧化物对反应机制的影响以及不同反应中间体的稳定性。金属和氧化物组件的优化对于工业应用至关重要。逆向氧化物/金属催化剂的使用可以导致更高效、选择性的催化过程，为多个工业领域如烃类转化、环境污染控制和燃料合成带来进步。
