How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, and what are the resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions?

Substitutional cation doping modifies the electronic structure of metal oxides, leading to changes in their surface chemistry. This process introduces new active sites on the catalyst surface by disrupting local chemical bonding, which enhances catalytic activity by increasing the density and reactivity of active centers. Doping also influences the selectivity of the catalyst, directing the reaction towards more desirable products. In industrially relevant reactions, such as hydrogenation or oxidation processes, the use of doped catalysts can lead to improved efficiency and yield.
