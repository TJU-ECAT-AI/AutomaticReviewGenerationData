The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies the electronic structure, leading to disruption of chemical bonding. This results in enhanced catalytic activity due to changes in surface chemistry. The nature and location of active centers are affected by the dopants, contributing to improvements in industrially relevant reactions through increased selectivity and efficiency.
