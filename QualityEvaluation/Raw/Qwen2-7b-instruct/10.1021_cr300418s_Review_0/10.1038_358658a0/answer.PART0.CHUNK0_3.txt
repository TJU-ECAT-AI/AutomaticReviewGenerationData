How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, and what are the resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions?

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts leads to modifications in surface chemistry and disruption of chemical bonding. This modification enhances catalytic activity by creating more active sites on the surface. The nature and location of active centers within the catalyst are influenced by the type and concentration of dopants. Improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be attributed to the enhanced reactivity and selectivity facilitated by the dopants.
