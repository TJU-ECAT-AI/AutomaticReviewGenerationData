[1] "Substitutional cation doping modifies the electronic structure of metal oxides, leading to changes in surface chemistry."
[2] "This can disrupt chemical bonding on the surface, affecting the reactivity of the catalyst."
[3] "Enhancement of catalytic activity is often observed due to the altered surface properties."
[4] "The nature and location of active centers within the catalyst may shift as a result of doping."
[5] "This can lead to more efficient or selective catalytic reactions."
[6] "Industrially relevant reactions may benefit from improved catalytic performance."
