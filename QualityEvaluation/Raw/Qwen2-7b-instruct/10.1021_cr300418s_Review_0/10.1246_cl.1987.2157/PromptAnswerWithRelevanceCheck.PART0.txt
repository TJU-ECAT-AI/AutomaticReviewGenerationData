[1] "Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane."
[2] "The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing specific halide species (like MgCl2 or CaCl2) onto the surface of alkaline earth oxides (CaO or MgO). This modification enhances catalytic activity due to the creation of active sites that facilitate the oxidative coupling of methane. At a temperature of 750°C and a ratio of CH4/O2 = 9, the selectivity for the formation of C2 hydrocarbons reaches 87%. This implies that the active centers are highly effective in promoting the desired chemical reaction while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using halides of alkaline earth metal oxides like MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or MgO, significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, particularly in the oxidative coupling of methane. The presence of these dopants facilitates the creation of active centers that are crucial for the reaction mechanism. At 750°C with a CH4/O2 ratio of 9, the selectivity for the formation of C2 hydrocarbons reaches an impressive 87%. These findings suggest that the doping process can be effectively utilized to improve the efficiency and selectivity of industrially relevant reactions, offering a promising avenue for advancements in chemical synthesis techniques.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst surface. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity by creating more active sites and improving the adsorption and desorption of reactants. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type of dopant, its concentration, and the crystal structure of the support material. These modifications result in improved efficiency and selectivity for industrially relevant reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of methane, where high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons is achieved at specific temperature conditions.
