[1] "Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane."
[2] "The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst surface. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity by creating more active sites and improving the adsorption and desorption of reactants. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type of dopant, its concentration, and the crystal structure of the support material. These modifications result in improved efficiency and selectivity for industrially relevant reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of methane, where high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons is achieved at specific temperature conditions.

在碱土金属氧化物中掺杂取代阳离子修改了催化剂表面的化学性质并破坏了化学键，通过改变催化剂表面的电子结构和反应性。这通过增加活性位点和改善反应物的吸附与脱附来提高催化活性。活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂剂类型、浓度以及支撑材料晶体结构的影响。这些修改导致了对工业相关反应的改进效率和选择性，如甲烷的氧化耦合，其中在特定温度条件下实现了高C2烃选择性。
