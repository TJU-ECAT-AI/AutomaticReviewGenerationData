The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using halides of alkaline earth metal oxides like MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or MgO, significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, particularly in the oxidative coupling of methane. The presence of these dopants facilitates the creation of active centers that are crucial for the reaction mechanism. At 750°C with a CH4/O2 ratio of 9, the selectivity for the formation of C2 hydrocarbons reaches an impressive 87%. These findings suggest that the doping process can be effectively utilized to improve the efficiency and selectivity of industrially relevant reactions, offering a promising avenue for advancements in chemical synthesis techniques.
