[1] "Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane."
[2] "The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using halides of alkaline earth metal oxides like magnesium chloride (MgCl2) or calcium chloride (CaCl2) on calcium oxide (CaO) or magnesium oxide (MgO), significantly modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This modification leads to enhanced catalytic activity, as evidenced by the high selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons reaching 87% at a temperature of 750°C with a ratio of methane to oxygen of 9. The presence of these specific halide dopants creates active centers that facilitate the oxidative coupling of methane, improving the efficiency of the reaction and yielding desired products with high purity.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的取代阳离子掺杂，特别是使用碱土金属氧化物卤化物，如镁氯化物(MgCl2)或钙氯化物(CaCl2)，在钙氧化物(CaO)或镁氧化物(MgO)上，显著改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这种修改导致催化活性增强，具体表现为在750°C时C2烃的选择性达到87%，甲烷与氧气的比例为9。这些特定卤化物掺杂物的存在形成了促进甲烷氧化耦合的活性中心，提高了反应效率并生成高纯度的期望产物。
