1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing specific dopants that alter the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst surface. This modification leads to enhanced catalytic activity by creating more active sites for the desired reaction. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type of dopant and its interaction with the host material, which can lead to improved selectivity and efficiency in industrially relevant reactions.
