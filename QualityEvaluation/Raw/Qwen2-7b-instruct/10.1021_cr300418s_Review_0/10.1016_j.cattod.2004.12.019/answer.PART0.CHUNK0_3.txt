[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored."
[2] "It is important to initially discuss one component metal oxide phases before addressing the more complex mixed metal oxide catalytic materials. One component metal oxides can crystallize with different morphologies (iso- tropic, anisotropic or remain amorphous) and local coordination."
[3] "The electronic and molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species that are present on oxide supports have received enormous attention over the past three decades because of (1) their industrial significance as catalysts for numerous applications [82] and (2) their ability to serve as model mixed metal oxide catalytic system due to the essentially completely dispersed state."
[4] "The surface chemistry of the different supported vanadia species were chemically probed by CH3OH oxidation to H2CO [88,89]. The catalytic results were quantified per surface vanadia species as turnover frequencies (TOF = - number of H2CO molecules formed/surface V/s) because the surface vanadia species were 100% dispersed (confirmed with Raman)."
[5] "The driving force for this surface wetting of metal oxides is the lower surface free energy of the final supported metal oxide system. The hydroxylated oxide support surface possesses a much higher surface free energy than the terminal M=O bonds formed in the surface metal oxide monolayer."
[6] "The success of Raman spectroscopy in detecting the surface VOx species is a consequence of the absence of strong Raman bands from the bulk lattice of the VNbO and MoNbO oxide phases."
[7] "The recent findings about the surface nature of mixed metal oxide catalysts suggest that the most important aspect of such catalytic materials was completely overlooked: the catalytic active sites present on the outermost surface layer."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding and potentially enhancing catalytic activity through the creation of new active centers. This modification can lead to improved industrially relevant reactions by altering the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst.

2. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts are significantly influenced by substitutional cation doping. Active centers are often located at the surface, where chemical reactions occur. Doping can create defects or new sites that serve as active centers for catalysis.

3. The implications of substitutional cation doping for catalytic activity enhancement include the potential for increased reactivity and selectivity. By modifying the electronic structure of the surface, doping can facilitate more efficient interactions between reactants and the catalyst, leading to enhanced performance in specific reactions.

4. Industrially relevant reactions can benefit greatly from substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. The modified surface chemistry can lead to improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability in reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming processes.

5. Surface chemistry and the nature of active centers play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity of metal oxide catalysts. By understanding and controlling these factors through substitutional doping, researchers can tailor catalysts for specific applications, optimizing their performance in industrial settings.

6. Surface wetting of metal oxides by substitutional doping can be driven by the desire to achieve a lower surface free energy. The doping process modifies the surface energy landscape, promoting the formation of a more energetically favorable configuration that facilitates better adhesion and dispersion of the metal oxide on the support.

7. The recent findings about the surface nature of bulk mixed metal oxide catalysts suggest that the presence of amorphous surface species and their electronic/molecular structures are critical for catalytic activity. These surface species can have unique reactivity patterns and influence the overall catalytic performance of the mixed metal oxide catalysts.
