[1] "Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information."
[2] "This situation began to change 30 years ago as more powerful characterization techniques became available that could provide information about amorphous metal oxide phases, as well as crystalline nanophases, under different environmental conditions."
[3] "The first major breakthrough was the discovery and subsequent confirmation that amorphous surface species exist for supported metal oxide catalysts, which opened up an entirely new area of catalysis research."
[4] "More recent studies demonstrated that the same metal oxide catalytic active sites are present for crystalline siliceous molecular sieves and their corresponding amorphous SiO2-supported metal oxide analogs."
[5] "Furthermore, the same catalytic properties are exhibited by both the crystalline molecular sieves and the amorphous SiO2-based catalysts revealing the importance of local environment over long range order in mixed metal oxides."
[6] "Most recently, the discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the local coordination environment around the dopant ions. This can lead to changes in the electronic structure and thus the catalytic activity of the active sites. The resulting implications include enhanced catalytic activity, the creation of new types of active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions by providing more efficient pathways for reactants to access the active sites.

2. The introduction of substitutional cations can disrupt the regular crystalline structure, leading to the formation of amorphous regions. These amorphous regions can have different surface chemistry compared to the crystalline bulk, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic activity due to the presence of more reactive surface sites. The nature and location of the active centers can be altered, with some active sites migrating to the surface as a result of the cation doping process.

3. The implications for industrially relevant reactions are multifaceted. Enhanced activity can lead to faster reaction rates, lower energy requirements, and higher product yields. The creation of new active sites can enable reactions that were previously inaccessible or inefficient. Additionally, the ability to tune the surface chemistry through cation doping offers a route to optimize catalysts for specific reaction conditions, improving the selectivity of the desired products.

4. In the context of mixed metal oxides, substitutional doping can lead to the formation of mixed oxides with unique electronic and chemical properties. This can result in the creation of new active sites with distinct catalytic behavior, leading to improved performance in reactions that rely on mixed metal oxide catalysts.

5. The discovery of amorphous surface species in mixed metal oxides highlights the importance of surface chemistry in catalysis. It challenges traditional models that focus solely on the bulk structure and suggests that the surface properties play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity. This realization opens up new avenues for designing catalysts with optimized surface features to enhance catalytic performance.

6. The presence of amorphous surface species in bulk mixed metal oxides implies that the catalytic activity is not solely dependent on the bulk crystalline structure. Instead, the surface chemistry and the properties of the amorphous regions contribute significantly to the overall catalytic behavior. This understanding can guide the development of more effective mixed metal oxide catalysts by focusing on the design of surfaces with tailored chemical and physical properties.
