[1] "Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information."
[2] "This situation began to change 30 years ago as more powerful characterization techniques became available that could provide information about amorphous metal oxide phases, as well as crystalline nanophases, under different environmental conditions."
[3] "The first major breakthrough was the discovery and subsequent confirmation that amorphous surface species exist for supported metal oxide catalysts, which opened up an entirely new area of catalysis research."
[4] "More recent studies demonstrated that the same metal oxide catalytic active sites are present for crystalline siliceous molecular sieves and their corresponding amorphous SiO2-supported metal oxide analogs. Furthermore, the same catalytic properties are exhibited by both the crystalline molecular sieves and the amorphous SiO2-based catalysts revealing the importance of local environment over long range order in mixed metal oxides."
[5] "Most recently, the discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding. This leads to changes in the nature and location of active centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity. For instance, doping can alter the electronic structure, affecting the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

2. The implications for industrially relevant reactions are significant. Enhanced activity can lead to faster reaction rates, lower energy consumption, and improved product yields. Doping can also improve selectivity, directing the reaction towards more desirable products.

3. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts can be disrupted by substitutional cation doping. This can lead to the creation of new active sites or the modification of existing ones, depending on the dopant used and the degree of substitution.

4. The location of active centers is crucial for optimizing the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Doping can strategically place these centers closer to the reaction site, facilitating more efficient catalysis. For example, in the context of heterogeneous catalysis, surface dopants can act as electron donors or acceptors, influencing the redox properties of the catalyst.

5. The impact of substitutional cation doping on catalytic materials extends beyond the surface to the bulk structure. Doping can lead to the formation of new phases or the modification of existing ones, potentially affecting the transport properties and reactivity of the catalyst. This can have significant implications for the design of catalysts for specific reactions.
