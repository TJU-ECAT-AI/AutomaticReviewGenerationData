[1] "The reaction of nanocrystalline AP-MgO with 1-iodobutane in the temperature range of 100 400 C is accompanied by an increase in the sample weight."
[2] "The kinetic graphs of the weight change presented in Fig. 1 indicate that the maximum weight gain depends on the reac- tion temperature."
[3] "At 100 C the percentage conversion decreases from the initial 45% to nearly zero in 3 h (Fig. 3,curve 1)."
[4] "The activities of AP-MgO and CP-MgO in dehydroiod- ination of 1-iodobutane are compared in Fig. 4."
[5] "As noted above, dehydroiodination of 1-iodobutane over AP-MgO yields a mixture of three butene isomers: 1-butene,cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene."
[6] "Changes in the relative selectivity for these three iso- mers with time on stream at 300 and 400 C are presented in Fig. 5."
[7] "The atom of iodine, after ab- straction on the surface magnesium atom (first step of stage E1 mechanism), can react again with carbocation to form 2-iodobutane."
[8] "The lower selectivity for 2-iodobutane over AP-MgO indicates that the surface MgI bond in the AP sample is stronger than that in the CP sample."
[9] "The high- est concentration of guest species was found for sample 3 after reaction with 1-iodobutane at 200 C, which shows maximum weight gain as well."
[10] "XPS spectra in the I 3d5/2 region are presented in Fig. 8."

1. The weight gain of the nanocrystalline AP-MgO sample increases with the reaction temperature when exposed to 1-iodobutane.
2. The maximum weight gain of the AP-MgO sample depends on the reaction temperature.
3. At 100°C, the conversion of 1-iodobutane to butenes is significantly reduced over time.
4. The reaction of 1-iodobutane with nanocrystalline AP-MgO produces a mixture of three butene isomers.
5. The selectivity for the formation of the three butene isomers changes with time when the reaction temperature is 300°C and 400°C.
6. The strength of the MgI bond on the surface of the AP-MgO sample affects the selectivity for the formation of 2-iodobutane.
7. The concentration of iodine species on the surface of the sample increases with the reaction of 1-iodobutane.
8. The XPS spectra of the AP-MgO sample after reacting with 1-iodobutane shows the presence of iodine in the ionic state.
