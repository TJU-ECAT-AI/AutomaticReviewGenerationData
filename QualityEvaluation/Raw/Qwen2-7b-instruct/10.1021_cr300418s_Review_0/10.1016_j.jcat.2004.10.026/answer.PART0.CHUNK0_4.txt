[1] "There are two reasons to gain an understanding of the 1-iodobutane system: (1) to establish whether general observations for chloro- and bromo-derivatives carry over to the iodo-system, leading to a better understanding of the overall reaction, and (2) to establish whether iodobutanes are likely intermediates in the dehydrogenation of butane over nanocrystalline MgO in the presence of iodine as an additive,"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study aimed to understand the 1-iodobutane system for two reasons: firstly, to see if the general observations from chloro- and bromo-substituted compounds apply to the iodine system, enhancing our knowledge of the overall reaction mechanisms. Secondly, to determine if iodobutanes might act as intermediates in the dehydrogenation of butane over nanocrystalline MgO when iodine is added as a catalyst.

研究旨在理解碘代丁烷系统，原因有两个：首先，看氯代和溴代化合物的一般观察结果是否适用于碘系统，从而增强我们对整体反应机制的理解。其次，确定碘代丁烷是否可能作为丁烷在纳米晶镁氧化合物上脱氢时碘的添加剂的中间体。

[1] "The lattice parameter in the face-centered cubic lattice of MgO is 4.21 Å, so that the minimum distance between Mg atoms is 2.105 Å. This means that the depth of the surface layer studied by XPS is about 15 monolayers. Thus, assuming that all iodine is located in one surface monolayer, the iodine concentration in this monolayer can be estimated to be 45 at%."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The edge length of the face-centered cubic lattice of MgO is 4.21 Å, meaning the shortest distance between Mg atoms is 2.105 Å. Consequently, the thickness of the XPS studied surface layer is approximately 15 monolayers. Assuming all iodine is confined to a single surface monolayer, the iodine concentration in that layer is estimated to be 45 atomic percent.

MgO的面心立方晶格边长为4.21 Å，意味着两个镁原子之间的最短距离为2.105 Å。因此，XPS研究的表面层厚度约为15个单分子层。假设所有碘都位于一个表面单分子层中，该层的碘浓度估计为45原子百分比。
