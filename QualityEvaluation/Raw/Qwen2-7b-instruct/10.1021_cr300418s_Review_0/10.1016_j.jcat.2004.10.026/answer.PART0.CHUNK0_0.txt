1. The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically in the case of nanocrystalline AP-MgO reacting with 1-iodobutane, leads to an increase in the sample weight, indicating modifications in surface chemistry and disruption of chemical bonding. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, altered nature and location of active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions like the selective dehydroiodination of 1-iodobutane.

2. The activity of the AP-MgO catalyst surpasses that of the CP-MgO catalyst across all tested temperatures, highlighting the influence of doping on catalytic performance.

3. The formation of cis-2-butene is favored over trans-2-butene in the reaction with 1-iodobutane, suggesting that the catalyst's surface chemistry affects the mechanism of the HI elimination.

4. The specific surface areas of the MgO samples decrease with increasing reaction temperature, indicating a drop in the geometric surface area that correlates with the textural behavior of the material in the presence of halogenated compounds.

5. The analysis of the samples' surfaces through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the iodine concentration is significantly high, suggesting a strong interaction between the metal oxide and the iodine species.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行掺杂，特别是纳米晶AP-MgO与1-碘丁烷反应的情况下，样品重量的增加表明了表面化学的修改和化学键的破坏。这导致催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置改变，并且对工业相关反应如选择性脱碘反应有改善。

2. 在所有测试温度下，AP-MgO的活性都超过CP-MgO，突出了掺杂对催化性能的影响。

3. 在与1-碘丁烷反应时，形成顺式-2-丁烯的量始终高于反式-2-丁烯，表明催化剂表面化学影响HI消除机制。

4. 随着反应温度的升高，MgO样品的特定表面积下降，表明几何表面积的减少，与材料在卤化物化合物存在的情况下纹理行为有关。

5. 对样品表面的分析通过X射线光电子能谱（XPS）显示碘浓度非常高，表明金属氧化物与碘物种之间存在强烈相互作用。
