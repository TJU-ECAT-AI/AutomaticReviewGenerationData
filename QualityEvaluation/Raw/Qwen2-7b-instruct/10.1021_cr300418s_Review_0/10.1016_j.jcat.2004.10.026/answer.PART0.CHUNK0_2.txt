[1] "There are two reasons to gain an understanding of the 1-iodobutane system: (1) to establish whether general observations for chloro- and bromo-derivatives carry over to the iodo-system, leading to a better understanding of the overall reaction, and (2) to establish whether iodobutanes are likely intermediates in the dehydrogenation of butane over nanocrystalline MgO in the presence of iodine as an additive,"

The study investigates the reaction of 1-iodobutane with nanocrystalline MgO for two main reasons: to understand if the general observations for chloro- and bromo-derivatives apply to the iodo-system, enhancing the understanding of the overall reaction, and to assess if iodobutanes might act as intermediates in the dehydrogenation of butane over nanocrystalline MgO when iodine is added as a catalyst.
