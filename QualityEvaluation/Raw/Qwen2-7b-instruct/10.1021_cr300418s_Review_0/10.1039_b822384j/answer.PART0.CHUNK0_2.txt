The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was studied. On non-reduced surfaces, methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, leading to no formaldehyde production. On reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed. Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime. If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy. STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage.

在对V2O5(001)薄膜上支持的Au(111)表面进行甲醇的部分氧化研究中，发现在未处理表面上，甲醇仅以分子形式吸附，导致无法产生甲醛。在处理过的表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些团在400 K到550 K的温度范围内反应生成甲醛。其他产物未被观察到。羟基团还可以与其他羟基团反应形成水，这种反应可能在相同的温度范围内发生。如果大量甲醇在室温下施用，水的形成会从表面去除所有羟基团，最终稳定一层甲氧基。STM图像显示，由于甲氧基的形成，表面缺陷的密度降低，除了垂直于二价钒双行的对缺陷密度增加，这在甲醇施用后发生。
