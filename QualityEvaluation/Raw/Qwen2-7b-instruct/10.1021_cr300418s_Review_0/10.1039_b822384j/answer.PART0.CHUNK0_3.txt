The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced surfaces, methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, and no formaldehyde production takes place. On reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Methoxy groups can be stabilized at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime. If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, which finally stabilizes a layer of methoxy. Single defects would represent catalytic centers for water formation.

在对V2O5(001)薄膜支持的Au(111)上的甲醇部分氧化进行了研究。在非还原表面上，甲醇仅以分子形式吸附，不会产生甲醛。在还原表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些团在400 K到550 K的温度范围内反应生成甲醛。只有当表面不含羟基时，甲氧基团才能在室温下稳定。羟基还可以与其他羟基反应形成水，这可能在相同的温度范围内脱附。如果在室温下大量投加甲醇，水形成会从表面上移除所有羟基，最终稳定一层甲氧基。单个缺陷将代表水形成的催化剂中心。
