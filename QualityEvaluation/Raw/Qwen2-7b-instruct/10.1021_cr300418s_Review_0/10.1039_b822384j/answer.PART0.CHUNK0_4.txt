The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced surfaces, methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, hence no formaldehyde production occurs. On reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Methoxy groups can be stabilized at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups, as otherwise, methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K. Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime. If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy. STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows, whose density increases upon methanol dosage.

在对V2O5(001)薄膜上支持的Au(111)上的甲醇部分氧化的研究中，非还原表面仅以分子形式吸附甲醇，因此不产生甲醛。在还原表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些团在400 K至550 K的温度范围内反应产生甲醛。甲氧基团仅在表面无羟基团时才能在室温下稳定，否则甲氧基和羟基团可能会反应生成甲醇，其在230至300 K的温度范围内脱附。羟基团也可以与其他羟基团反应形成水，这可能在相同的温度范围内脱附。如果在室温下大量甲醇被注入，水的形成会从表面去除所有羟基团，最终稳定一层甲氧基。STM图像显示，由于甲氧基形成，表面缺陷密度降低，除了垂直于范德华双行的对缺陷密度增加的双行缺陷，其密度随着甲醇剂量的增加而增加。
