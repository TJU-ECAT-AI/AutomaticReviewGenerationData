[1] "The DFT results show that conditions under which the bilayer FeO film transforms into the trilayer FeO2 film depend strongly on the region within the coincidence (Moir) unit cell of FeO(111)/Pt(111)."
[2] "Indeed, the strong site specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process explains the experimentally observed formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands."
[3] "Moreover, a high resolution STM study reveals a (3 × 3)R30 superstructure of the FeO2 islands with respect to the pristine FeO film."
[4] "This structure was rationalized by DFT in terms of the preferred O on top of Pt interface registry associated with a buckling effect in the Fe sublayer."

The study elucidates how the oxidation of the FeO(111) film on Pt(111) is influenced by the region within the Moir unit cell. The strong site specificity of the oxidation process leads to the formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands. Further, the STM images reveal a unique (3 × 3)R30 superstructure of these islands. This structure is explained by DFT calculations as a result of a buckling effect in the Fe sublayer, where one out of three Fe atoms flips outward at the height of the topmost oxygen layer.

研究揭示了FeO(111)薄膜在Pt(111)上的氧化过程受到莫尔单元格内区域的影响。强烈的位点特异性氧化过程导致FeO2岛屿的有序图案形成。进一步，STM图像揭示了这些岛屿的独特（3 × 3）R30超结构。这一结构由DFT计算解释为Fe子层中的一种弯曲效应的结果，其中三个Fe原子之一向外翻转到最上层氧层的高度。
