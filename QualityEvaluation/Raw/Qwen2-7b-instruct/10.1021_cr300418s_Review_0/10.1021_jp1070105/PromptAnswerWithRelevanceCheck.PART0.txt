[1] "The ultrathin films consisting of just a single layer of oxide often show structural and electronic properties different from their bulk counterparts."
[2] "Indeed, bilayer FeO(111) films supported on Pt(111) have been shown to be much more active in low temperature CO oxidation than Pt(111)."
[3] "The proposed mechanism involves, prior to the reaction with CO, the transformation of the bilayer FeO film into a trilayer OFeO (FeO2) film, that further catalyzes CO oxidation via a Marsvan Krevelen type mechanism."
[4] "In the present study we aim at a deeper understanding of the oxidation of the FeO(111) film as a function of oxygen pressure and at a determination of the atomic structure of catalytically active O-rich films using density functional theory (DFT) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly alter surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding. This leads to modifications in the electronic structure of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature and location of active centers. These changes enhance catalytic activity by providing more efficient sites for reaction intermediates to adsorb, react, and desorb. The resulting implications for industrially relevant reactions include increased selectivity, improved efficiency, and broader applicability of the catalysts. For instance, the transformation of a bilayer FeO(111) film into a trilayer OFeO (FeO2) film, as observed in this study, enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The mechanism involves the activation of molecular oxygen by electrons transferred from the oxide/metal interface, leading to the formation of an OFeO film that further catalyzes CO oxidation.

[1] "The DFT results show that conditions under which the bilayer FeO film transforms into the trilayer FeO2 film depend strongly on the region within the coincidence (Moir) unit cell of FeO(111)/Pt(111)."
[2] "The buckled FeO2 film undergoes a substantial local distortion. Two out of three cations in the unit cell remain 6-fold coordinated, but the third Fe ion flips outward almost at the height of the topmost oxygen layer."
[3] "Our results show that such a structural distortion is not associated with a substantial change of the electronic structure. In particular, the electron transfer at the interface and the oxidation state of all ions remain practically unaltered."
[4] "Indeed, the strong site specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process explains the experimentally observed formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by changing the composition and structure of the oxide surface. This can lead to enhancements in catalytic activity by creating more active sites and altering the reactivity of the surface. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the doping, potentially leading to more efficient and selective reactions. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be achieved through optimized doping strategies that enhance the desired catalytic pathways. The specific details provided in the document demonstrate how the DFT calculations and STM observations elucidate the site-specific oxidation processes and the formation of ordered patterns of FeO2 islands on the FeO(111)/Pt(111) surface, indicating the impact of doping on the surface chemistry and catalytic behavior.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by influencing the oxidation states and coordination environments of dopant atoms. This leads to changes in the nature and location of active centers on the catalyst surface. As a result, catalytic activity is enhanced due to the altered reactivity and selectivity of the active sites. This modification can potentially improve industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the reaction pathways, increasing the reaction rates, and reducing byproduct formation. The presence of dopants can lead to the creation of unique electronic and geometric structures that facilitate specific reactions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

The study elucidates how the oxidation of the FeO(111) film on Pt(111) is influenced by the region within the Moir unit cell. The strong site specificity of the oxidation process leads to the formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands. Further, the STM images reveal a unique (3 × 3)R30 superstructure of these islands. This structure is explained by DFT calculations as a result of a buckling effect in the Fe sublayer, where one out of three Fe atoms flips outward at the height of the topmost oxygen layer.
