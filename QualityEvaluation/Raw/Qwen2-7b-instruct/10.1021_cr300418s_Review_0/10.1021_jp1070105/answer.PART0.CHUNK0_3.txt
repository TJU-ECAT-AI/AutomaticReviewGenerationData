[1] "The ultrathin films consisting of just a single layer of oxide often show structural and electronic properties different from their bulk counterparts."
[2] "The synergy of all these effects gives rise to very complex phase diagrams of low-dimensional oxide structures supported on metals."
[3] "The DFT results show that conditions under which the bilayer FeO film transforms into the trilayer FeO2 film depend strongly on the region within the coincidence (Moir) unit cell of FeO(111)/Pt(111)."
[4] "Indeed, the strong site specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process explains the experimentally observed formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands."
[5] "This buckled structure, where one out of three Fe atoms flips outward at the height of the topmost oxygen layer, may be considered as an intermediate state in the transformation of the FeO(111) into Fe2O3(0001) film."

1. Ultrathin oxide films display distinct structural and electronic properties compared to their bulk forms, owing to the influence of low coordination, bond types at the interface, and effects like elasticity and polarity.

2. The interaction among these factors creates intricate phase diagrams for low-dimensional oxide structures supported on metals.

3. The density functional theory (DFT) outcomes indicate that the conditions leading to the transformation of the bilayer FeO film into the trilayer FeO2 film vary significantly based on the location within the coincidence (Moir) structure between FeO(111) and Pt(111).

4. The strong specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process across various sites within the Moir unit cell explains the formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands observed experimentally.

5. The buckled structure, with one out of three Fe atoms flipping outward at the topmost oxygen layer's height, is recognized as an intermediate stage in the transformation from FeO(111) to Fe2O3(0001).

1. 超薄氧化物薄膜的结构和电子性质与它们的宏观形式不同，这是由低配位、界面键的类型以及弹性效应和极性效应等因素决定的。

2. 这些因素之间的相互作用导致金属支持的低维氧化物结构具有复杂的相图。

3. 密度泛函理论（DFT）的结果表明，在FeO(111)/Pt(111)的莫尔单元格中，不同位置下的条件差异显著影响了从双层FeO薄膜转化为三层FeO2薄膜的过程。

4. FeO(111)的氧化过程在莫尔单元格中的特定位置的强特异性解释了实验上观察到的FeO2岛屿有规律排列的现象。

5. 具有一个Fe原子翻出至顶部氧层高度的凹陷结构，被视为从FeO(111)到Fe2O3(0001)转变过程中的一个中间状态。
