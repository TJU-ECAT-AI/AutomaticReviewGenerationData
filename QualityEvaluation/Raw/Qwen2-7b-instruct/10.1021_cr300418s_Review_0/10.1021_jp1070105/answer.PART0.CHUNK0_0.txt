[1] "The ultrathin films consisting of just a single layer of oxide often show structural and electronic properties different from their bulk counterparts."
[2] "Indeed, bilayer FeO(111) films supported on Pt(111) have been shown to be much more active in low temperature CO oxidation than Pt(111)."
[3] "The proposed mechanism involves, prior to the reaction with CO, the transformation of the bilayer FeO film into a trilayer OFeO (FeO2) film, that further catalyzes CO oxidation via a Marsvan Krevelen type mechanism."
[4] "In the present study we aim at a deeper understanding of the oxidation of the FeO(111) film as a function of oxygen pressure and at a determination of the atomic structure of catalytically active O-rich films using density functional theory (DFT) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly alter surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding. This leads to modifications in the electronic structure of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature and location of active centers. These changes enhance catalytic activity by providing more efficient sites for reaction intermediates to adsorb, react, and desorb. The resulting implications for industrially relevant reactions include increased selectivity, improved efficiency, and broader applicability of the catalysts. For instance, the transformation of a bilayer FeO(111) film into a trilayer OFeO (FeO2) film, as observed in this study, enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The mechanism involves the activation of molecular oxygen by electrons transferred from the oxide/metal interface, leading to the formation of an OFeO film that further catalyzes CO oxidation.

金属氧化物催化剂中的置换离子掺杂可以显著改变表面化学和破坏化学键。这导致催化活性中心性质和位置的变化。这些变化通过提供更有效的吸附反应中间体的位点来增强催化活性。对于工业相关反应，这些影响包括提高选择性、提高效率以及催化剂的应用范围更广。例如，在本研究中观察到的bilayer FeO(111)薄膜转变为trilayer OFeO（FeO2）薄膜，提高了CO氧化的催化活性。该机制涉及从氧化物/金属界面传输电子激活分子氧，导致形成OFeO薄膜，进一步催化CO氧化。
