[1] "The DFT results show that conditions under which the bilayer FeO film transforms into the trilayer FeO2 film depend strongly on the region within the coincidence (Moir) unit cell of FeO(111)/Pt(111)."
[2] "The buckled FeO2 film undergoes a substantial local distortion. Two out of three cations in the unit cell remain 6-fold coordinated, but the third Fe ion flips outward almost at the height of the topmost oxygen layer."
[3] "Our results show that such a structural distortion is not associated with a substantial change of the electronic structure. In particular, the electron transfer at the interface and the oxidation state of all ions remain practically unaltered."
[4] "Indeed, the strong site specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process explains the experimentally observed formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by changing the composition and structure of the oxide surface. This can lead to enhancements in catalytic activity by creating more active sites and altering the reactivity of the surface. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the doping, potentially leading to more efficient and selective reactions. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be achieved through optimized doping strategies that enhance the desired catalytic pathways. The specific details provided in the document demonstrate how the DFT calculations and STM observations elucidate the site-specific oxidation processes and the formation of ordered patterns of FeO2 islands on the FeO(111)/Pt(111) surface, indicating the impact of doping on the surface chemistry and catalytic behavior.
