[1] "The DFT results show that conditions under which the bilayer FeO film transforms into the trilayer FeO2 film depend strongly on the region within the coincidence (Moir) unit cell of FeO(111)/Pt(111)."
[2] "Indeed, the strong site specificity of the FeO(111) oxidation process explains the experimentally observed formation of an ordered pattern of FeO2 islands."
[3] "This structure was rationalized by DFT in terms of the preferred O on top of Pt interface registry associated with a buckling effect in the Fe sublayer."
[4] "The buckled film, with all the iron atoms in the formal Fe3+ oxidation state, approaches the structure of the Fe-terminated Fe2O3(0001) hematite."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by influencing the oxidation states and coordination environments of dopant atoms. This leads to changes in the nature and location of active centers on the catalyst surface. As a result, catalytic activity is enhanced due to the altered reactivity and selectivity of the active sites. This modification can potentially improve industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the reaction pathways, increasing the reaction rates, and reducing byproduct formation. The presence of dopants can lead to the creation of unique electronic and geometric structures that facilitate specific reactions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.
