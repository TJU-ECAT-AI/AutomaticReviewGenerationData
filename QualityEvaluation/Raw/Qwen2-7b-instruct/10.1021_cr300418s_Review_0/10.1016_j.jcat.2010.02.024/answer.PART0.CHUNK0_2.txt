[1] "The addition of ceria nanoparticles to Au(1 1 1) is essential to generate an active WGS catalyst and to increase the production and stability of key reaction intermediates (OH, HCOO and CO3)."
[2] "After examining the adsorption of HCOOH and CO2 we found that formates and carbonates are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with the former showing the greater thermal stability."
[3] "H2O dissociates readily in the presence of Ce3+ and forms hydroxyls that remain on the surface right up to the WGS reaction temperature (600 K)."
[4] "We present evidence that CO interacts with OH groups on an oxidized CeO2/Au(1 1 1) surface by forming predominantly carbonates and on the reduced CeO1.75/Au(1 1 1) surface to give both carbonates and formates."
[5] "The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) system is considerably more active toward the high temperature (575650 K) WGS than Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing dopant atoms that alter the local electronic environment around active sites. This can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by providing new active sites or modifying the reactivity of existing ones. The nature and location of active centers change, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. For example, the CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst shows higher activity for the watergas shift reaction compared to Cu-based catalysts.

2.Formates (HCOO) and carbonates (CO3) are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with formates exhibiting greater thermal stability. This stability contributes to the enhanced performance of the catalyst.

3.Hydroxyls (OH) remain stable on the surface until the reaction temperature (600 K), indicating that Ce3+ facilitates the dissociation of H2O and stabilization of OH groups, which are crucial for the watergas shift reaction.

4.CO interacts with OH groups on the surface, forming carbonates and formates. The nature of this interaction depends on the surface chemistry, with oxidized surfaces yielding predominantly carbonates and reduced surfaces producing both carbonates and formates.

5.The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst is more active for the watergas shift reaction than Cu-based catalysts at higher temperatures (575650 K). This increased activity is attributed to the synergistic effect between ceria nanoparticles and the Au(1 1 1) support, enhancing the production and stability of key reaction intermediates.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中掺入取代阳离子改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过引入改变活性位点周围局部电子环境的掺杂原子。这可能导致催化活性增强，提供新的活性位点或修改现有位点的反应性。活性中心的性质和位置发生变化，导致在工业相关反应中的改进选择性和效率。例如，CeOx/Au(1 1 1)催化剂在水气变换反应中的活性高于Cu基催化剂。

2.在CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上，形式酸(HCOO)和碳酸盐(CO3)是稳定的物种，其中形式酸显示出更高的热稳定性。这种稳定性对催化剂的增强性能有所贡献。

3.直到反应温度（600 K），OH留在表面上，表明Ce3+促进H2O的分解并稳定OH分子，这对水气变换反应至关重要。

4.CO与OH分子在表面上相互作用，形成碳酸盐和形式酸。这种相互作用的性质取决于表面化学特性，氧化表面主要产生碳酸盐，而还原表面产生两者。

5.CeOx/Au(1 1 1)催化剂在更高温度（575650 K）下的水气变换反应活性高于Cu基催化剂。这种增加的活性归因于铈氧化物纳米粒子与Au(1 1 1)支撑材料之间的协同效应，增强了关键反应中间体的生产和稳定性。
