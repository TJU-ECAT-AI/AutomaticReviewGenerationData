[1] "The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) system is considerably more active toward the high temperature (575650 K) WGS than Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces."
[2] "After examining the adsorption of HCOOH and CO2 we found that formates and carbonates are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with the former showing the greater thermal stability."
[3] "H2O dissociates readily in the presence of Ce3+ and forms hydroxyls that remain on the surface right up to the WGS reaction temperature (600 K)."
[4] "We present evidence that CO interacts with OH groups on an oxidized CeO2/Au(1 1 1) surface by forming predominantly carbonates and on the reduced CeO1.75/Au(1 1 1) surface to give both carbonates and formates."
[5] "The carboxylates remain undetectable under UHV conditions but they cannot be ruled out as possible intermediates of the high-temperature WGS reaction on CeOx/Au(1 1 1)."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, enhancing catalytic activity. This leads to the creation of active centers that improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions.

2. The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst system shows significantly higher activity for the watergas shift reaction compared to copper-based catalysts at high temperatures. 

3. Formates and carbonates are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with formates exhibiting greater stability. 

4. Hydroxyls are formed when water dissociates in the presence of Ce3+, and these remain stable until the watergas shift reaction reaches its peak temperature of 600 K.

5. Carbonates and formates are produced when carbon monoxide interacts with hydroxyl groups on the CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surface, depending on the surface's oxidation state.

6. Carboxylates are likely intermediates in the watergas shift reaction on CeOx/Au(1 1 1), though their detection requires conditions other than ultra-high vacuum.

1. 通过掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中的替换性阳离子，改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，从而提高了催化活性。这导致活性中心的产生，提高了工业相关反应的效率。

2. CeOx/Au(1 1 1)催化剂系统在高温下对于水气转换反应显示出显著更高的活性，与铜基催化剂相比。

3. 形酸盐和碳酸盐在CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上是稳定的物种，其中形酸盐表现出更大的稳定性。

4. 当存在Ce3+时，水容易分解形成羟基，在这种情况下，这些羟基直到水气转换反应达到峰值温度（600 K）都保持稳定。

5. 当碳氧化合物与氧化态为CeO2/Au(1 1 1)表面的羟基相互作用时，会在氧化态的表面上生成碳酸盐，而在还原态的表面上生成碳酸盐和形酸盐。

6. 在CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上，羧酸酯可能是水气转换反应的潜在中间体，尽管它们的检测需要其他于超高真空的条件。
