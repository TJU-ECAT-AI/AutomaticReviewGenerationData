<p>On the Au(1 1 1) surface, the physisorbed HCOOH is reported to des- orb below 300 K [5] but on CeO2(1 1 1) a formate is the likely inter- mediate [10]. So hence the 289 eV peak most likely arises from the dissociation of the acid proton of HCOOH to give HCOO bound to CeOx. This species remains stable between 300 and 400 K but decomposes beyond 400 K.</p>
<p>The pathways for decomposition of HCOOH and HCOO may occur as follows: HCOOH  O oxide ! HCOO a  OH a 2OH a ! H2O  O oxide; 300 K 10</p>
<p>2HCOO a ! 2CO a  H2O  O oxide; 300 K</p>
<p>2HCOO a ! 2CO2  H2; 360 K 10</p>
<p>CO a ! CO; 450600 K</p>
<p>HCOO a ! CO  1=2H2  O oxide; 450600 K 10</p>
<p>CO is reported to only interact weakly with CeO2(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) [15,22,23]. Dissociation of CO was observed in the presence of M/CeO1.75(1 1 1), where M = Rh [24,25], Pd [26], and Pt [27], but not for adsorption of the molecule on Au/CeO1.98(1 1 1) [15]. Furthermore, DF calculations have pointed to a weak interac- tion between CO and the CeO2(1 1 1) surface (Ebind 4.6 kcal/mol) but stronger interaction with the (1 1 0) surface (Ebind > 46 kcal/ mol) resulting in carbonate formation [28].</p>
<p>Unlike the sXPS results, the NEXAFS provided additional in- sights. As discussed above and shown in Table 1, adsorbed carbon- ate and formate have distinctive features in the C K - edge region.</p>

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing new active sites and disrupting chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification can lead to the creation of more efficient active centers, improving the performance of industrially relevant reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers in doped metal oxide catalysts can change significantly. Doping introduces new functionalities that can alter the electronic structure and modify the surface properties, creating sites that are more reactive towards specific reactants or products. This can lead to localized hot spots for catalytic reactions.

3. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include increased reaction rates, selectivity towards desired products, and enhanced stability of the catalyst under operating conditions. The introduction of dopants can optimize the catalytic cycle, making reactions more efficient and reducing byproducts.
