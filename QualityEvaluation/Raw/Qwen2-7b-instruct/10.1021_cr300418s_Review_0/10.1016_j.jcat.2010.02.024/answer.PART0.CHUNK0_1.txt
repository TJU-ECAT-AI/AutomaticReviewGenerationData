[1] "The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) system is considerably more active toward the high temperature (575650 K) WGS than Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces."
[2] "After examining the adsorption of HCOOH and CO2 we found that formates and carbonates are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with the former showing the greater thermal stability."
[3] "H2O dissociates readily in the presence of Ce3+ and forms hydroxyls that remain on the surface right up to the WGS reaction temperature (600 K)."
[4] "We present evidence that CO interacts with OH groups on an oxidized CeO2/Au(1 1 1) surface by forming predominantly carbonates and on the reduced CeO1.75/Au(1 1 1) surface to give both carbonates and formates."
[5] "The addition of ceria nanoparticles to Au(1 1 1) is essential to generate an active WGS catalyst and to increase the production and stability of key reaction intermediates (OH, HCOO and CO3)."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering chemical bonding, typically through the creation of active centers with different reactivity. This can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites for chemical transformations. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant's properties and its incorporation within the oxide lattice. This can result in improved catalytic performance for industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

2. The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst shows significantly higher activity in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction compared to copper-based catalysts like Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0), and Cu(1 1 1). This enhanced activity is attributed to the unique properties of ceria and the specific arrangement of ceria nanoparticles on the gold surface.

3. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O) dissociates efficiently in the presence of cerium ions (Ce3+) on the CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surface, leading to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups. These hydroxyl groups remain stable up to the WGS reaction temperature, contributing to the catalytic activity.

4. Carbon monoxide (CO) interacts differently with hydroxyl groups on oxidized and reduced CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces. On oxidized surfaces, CO primarily forms carbonates, whereas on reduced surfaces, both carbonates and formates are produced. This indicates that the presence of Ce3+ facilitates the formation of hydroxyl groups, which in turn influence CO's reactivity.

5. Incorporating ceria nanoparticles onto the Au(1 1 1) surface is crucial for generating an efficient WGS catalyst. This addition increases the production and stability of key reaction intermediates, such as hydroxyl (OH), formates (HCOO), and carbonates (CO3), thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的掺杂可以改变表面化学性质，通过改变化学键来实现。这通常会通过在氧化物晶格中创建具有不同反应性的活性中心来实现。这种改变可以导致催化活性的增强，为化学转换提供更多的反应位点。活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂物的属性及其在氧化物晶格中的集成的影响。这可以导致工业相关反应的改进性能，通过优化催化剂的反应性和稳定性。

2. CeOx/Au(1 1 1)催化剂在高温水气变换（WGS）反应中的活性显著高于铜基催化剂，如Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1)，Cu(1 0 0)和Cu(1 1 1)。这种增强的活性归因于铈的特殊性质以及铈氧化物纳米颗粒在金表面的特定排列。

3. 水（H2O）在Ce3+的存在下，在CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上高效分解，产生羟基（OH）组分。这些羟基组分在高达WGS反应温度时保持稳定，有助于催化活性。

4. 一氧化碳（CO）与氧化态和还原态CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上的羟基组分的相互作用存在差异。在氧化表面上，CO主要形成碳酸盐，而在还原表面上，同时形成碳酸盐和甲酸盐。这表明Ce3+的存在促进了羟基组分的形成，从而影响CO的反应性。

5. 在Au(1 1 1)表面上添加铈氧化物纳米颗粒是生成高效WGS催化剂的关键。这种添加增加了关键反应中间体（如羟基（OH），甲酸盐（HCOO）和碳酸盐（CO3））的生产和稳定性，从而增强了整体催化性能。
