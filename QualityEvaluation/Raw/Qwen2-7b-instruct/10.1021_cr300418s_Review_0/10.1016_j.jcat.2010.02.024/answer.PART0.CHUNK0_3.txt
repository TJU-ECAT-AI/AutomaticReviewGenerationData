[1] "The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) system is considerably more active toward the high temperature (575650 K) WGS than Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces."
[2] "After examining the adsorption of HCOOH and CO2 we found that formates and carbonates are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with the former showing the greater thermal stability."
[3] "H2O dissociates readily in the presence of Ce3+ and forms hydroxyls that remain on the surface right up to the WGS reaction temperature (600 K)."
[4] "We present evidence that CO interacts with OH groups on an oxidized CeO2/Au(1 1 1) surface by forming predominantly carbonates and on the reduced CeO1.75/Au(1 1 1) surface to give both carbonates and formates."
[5] "The carboxylates remain undetectable under UHV conditions but they cannot be ruled out as possible intermediates of the high-temperature WGS reaction on CeOx/Au(1 1 1)."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the local electronic environment and creating new active sites. This modification enhances catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites and improving the reactivity of the catalyst towards specific reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant's properties and its incorporation into the catalyst structure. The active sites can be distributed throughout the catalyst, promoting uniform reactivity across the surface.

3. The enhanced catalytic activity and improved surface chemistry enable more efficient and selective industrial reactions. For example, the high temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction can be facilitated with greater efficiency, leading to improved performance in hydrogen production processes.

4. Industrially relevant reactions can benefit significantly from such enhancements, as they may lead to increased productivity, reduced energy consumption, and improved selectivity in chemical synthesis.

5. The undetectability of carboxylates under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions suggests their potential role as transient intermediates in high-temperature reactions. This indicates that they might play a crucial role in the catalytic mechanisms, even if they are not directly observable under standard conditions.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行替换离子掺杂会修改表面化学和破坏化学键，通过改变局部电子环境并创建新的活性中心。这种修改可以增强催化活性，提供更多的反应位点，并提高催化剂对特定反应的反应性。

2. 活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂物的属性及其在催化剂结构中的整合影响。这些活性位点可以在催化剂中分布，促进表面的均匀反应性。

3. 提高催化活性和改善表面化学特性能够使工业反应更有效率和选择性。例如，高温水煤气转换（WGS）反应可以通过更高的效率得到促进，从而提高氢气生产过程的性能。

4. 对于工业相关反应，这些增强可以带来显著的好处，包括增加生产力、降低能量消耗和改进化学合成的选择性。

5. 酸基化合物在超高真空（UHV）条件下不可见，这表明它们可能在高温反应中扮演关键角色作为瞬态中间体。这表明它们可能在催化机制中发挥重要作用，即使在标准条件下它们不易直接观测到。
