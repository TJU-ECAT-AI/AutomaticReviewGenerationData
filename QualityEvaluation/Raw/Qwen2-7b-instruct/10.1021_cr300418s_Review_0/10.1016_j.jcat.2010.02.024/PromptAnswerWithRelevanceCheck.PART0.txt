<p>On the Au(1 1 1) surface, the physisorbed HCOOH is reported to des- orb below 300 K [5] but on CeO2(1 1 1) a formate is the likely inter- mediate [10]. So hence the 289 eV peak most likely arises from the dissociation of the acid proton of HCOOH to give HCOO bound to CeOx. This species remains stable between 300 and 400 K but decomposes beyond 400 K.</p>
<p>The pathways for decomposition of HCOOH and HCOO may occur as follows: HCOOH  O oxide ! HCOO a  OH a 2OH a ! H2O  O oxide; 300 K 10</p>
<p>2HCOO a ! 2CO a  H2O  O oxide; 300 K</p>
<p>2HCOO a ! 2CO2  H2; 360 K 10</p>
<p>CO a ! CO; 450600 K</p>
<p>HCOO a ! CO  1=2H2  O oxide; 450600 K 10</p>
<p>CO is reported to only interact weakly with CeO2(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) [15,22,23]. Dissociation of CO was observed in the presence of M/CeO1.75(1 1 1), where M = Rh [24,25], Pd [26], and Pt [27], but not for adsorption of the molecule on Au/CeO1.98(1 1 1) [15]. Furthermore, DF calculations have pointed to a weak interac- tion between CO and the CeO2(1 1 1) surface (Ebind 4.6 kcal/mol) but stronger interaction with the (1 1 0) surface (Ebind > 46 kcal/ mol) resulting in carbonate formation [28].</p>
<p>Unlike the sXPS results, the NEXAFS provided additional in- sights. As discussed above and shown in Table 1, adsorbed carbon- ate and formate have distinctive features in the C K - edge region.</p>

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by introducing new active sites and disrupting chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification can lead to the creation of more efficient active centers, improving the performance of industrially relevant reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers in doped metal oxide catalysts can change significantly. Doping introduces new functionalities that can alter the electronic structure and modify the surface properties, creating sites that are more reactive towards specific reactants or products. This can lead to localized hot spots for catalytic reactions.

3. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include increased reaction rates, selectivity towards desired products, and enhanced stability of the catalyst under operating conditions. The introduction of dopants can optimize the catalytic cycle, making reactions more efficient and reducing byproducts.

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering chemical bonding, typically through the creation of active centers with different reactivity. This can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites for chemical transformations. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant's properties and its incorporation within the oxide lattice. This can result in improved catalytic performance for industrially relevant reactions by optimizing the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

2. The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst shows significantly higher activity in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction compared to copper-based catalysts like Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1), Cu(1 0 0), and Cu(1 1 1). This enhanced activity is attributed to the unique properties of ceria and the specific arrangement of ceria nanoparticles on the gold surface.

3. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O) dissociates efficiently in the presence of cerium ions (Ce3+) on the CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surface, leading to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups. These hydroxyl groups remain stable up to the WGS reaction temperature, contributing to the catalytic activity.

4. Carbon monoxide (CO) interacts differently with hydroxyl groups on oxidized and reduced CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces. On oxidized surfaces, CO primarily forms carbonates, whereas on reduced surfaces, both carbonates and formates are produced. This indicates that the presence of Ce3+ facilitates the formation of hydroxyl groups, which in turn influence CO's reactivity.

5. Incorporating ceria nanoparticles onto the Au(1 1 1) surface is crucial for generating an efficient WGS catalyst. This addition increases the production and stability of key reaction intermediates, such as hydroxyl (OH), formates (HCOO), and carbonates (CO3), thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的掺杂可以改变表面化学性质，通过改变化学键来实现。这通常会通过在氧化物晶格中创建具有不同反应性的活性中心来实现。这种改变可以导致催化活性的增强，为化学转换提供更多的反应位点。活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂物的属性及其在氧化物晶格中的集成的影响。这可以导致工业相关反应的改进性能，通过优化催化剂的反应性和稳定性。

2. CeOx/Au(1 1 1)催化剂在高温水气变换（WGS）反应中的活性显著高于铜基催化剂，如Cu/ZnO(0 0 0 1)，Cu(1 0 0)和Cu(1 1 1)。这种增强的活性归因于铈的特殊性质以及铈氧化物纳米颗粒在金表面的特定排列。

3. 水（H2O）在Ce3+的存在下，在CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上高效分解，产生羟基（OH）组分。这些羟基组分在高达WGS反应温度时保持稳定，有助于催化活性。

4. 一氧化碳（CO）与氧化态和还原态CeOx/Au(1 1 1)表面上的羟基组分的相互作用存在差异。在氧化表面上，CO主要形成碳酸盐，而在还原表面上，同时形成碳酸盐和甲酸盐。这表明Ce3+的存在促进了羟基组分的形成，从而影响CO的反应性。

5. 在Au(1 1 1)表面上添加铈氧化物纳米颗粒是生成高效WGS催化剂的关键。这种添加增加了关键反应中间体（如羟基（OH），甲酸盐（HCOO）和碳酸盐（CO3））的生产和稳定性，从而增强了整体催化性能。

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing dopant atoms that alter the local electronic environment around active sites. This can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by providing new active sites or modifying the reactivity of existing ones. The nature and location of active centers change, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. For example, the CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst shows higher activity for the watergas shift reaction compared to Cu-based catalysts.

2.Formates (HCOO) and carbonates (CO3) are stable species on CeOx/Au(1 1 1) surfaces, with formates exhibiting greater thermal stability. This stability contributes to the enhanced performance of the catalyst.

3.Hydroxyls (OH) remain stable on the surface until the reaction temperature (600 K), indicating that Ce3+ facilitates the dissociation of H2O and stabilization of OH groups, which are crucial for the watergas shift reaction.

4.CO interacts with OH groups on the surface, forming carbonates and formates. The nature of this interaction depends on the surface chemistry, with oxidized surfaces yielding predominantly carbonates and reduced surfaces producing both carbonates and formates.

5.The CeOx/Au(1 1 1) catalyst is more active for the watergas shift reaction than Cu-based catalysts at higher temperatures (575650 K). This increased activity is attributed to the synergistic effect between ceria nanoparticles and the Au(1 1 1) support, enhancing the production and stability of key reaction intermediates.

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the local electronic environment and creating new active sites. This modification enhances catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites and improving the reactivity of the catalyst towards specific reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant's properties and its incorporation into the catalyst structure. The active sites can be distributed throughout the catalyst, promoting uniform reactivity across the surface.

4. Industrially relevant reactions can benefit significantly from such enhancements, as they may lead to increased productivity, reduced energy consumption, and improved selectivity in chemical synthesis.

5. The undetectability of carboxylates under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions suggests their potential role as transient intermediates in high-temperature reactions. This indicates that they might play a crucial role in the catalytic mechanisms, even if they are not directly observable under standard conditions.
