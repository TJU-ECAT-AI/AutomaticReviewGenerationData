[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "There is an optimal content (about 2 wt.%) of chloride ions in Na/CaO, at which the total selectivity of reaction and selectivity of ethane formation reach the highest values, higher than those with the chloride-free catalyst."
[3] "At the lower of the applied temperatures the value of the conversion decrease in the presence of chloride ions practically did not depend on the other reaction conditionsby about 75 relative percent."
[4] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."
[5] "The role of the chloride modifier seems to consist in poisoning the catalyst surface and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen, which in consequence leads mainly to an exclusion of the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

1. The presence of chloride ions in the catalyst modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and the creation of specific active centers depending on the reaction temperature.
2. An optimal content of around 2 wt.% chloride ions in Na/CaO catalyst provides the highest selectivity for ethane and ethylene formation, surpassing the performance of chloride-free catalysts.
3. At lower temperatures, the conversion decrease due to chloride ions is largely independent of other reaction conditions, with about a 75% relative decrease.
4. At temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, adding 12 wt.% chloride ions to the Na/CaO catalyst significantly reduces the selectivity of ethylene formation, maintaining a constant level of decrease regardless of modifier content.
5. The chloride modifier's role is to poison the catalyst surface and reduce the number of active oxygen sites, leading to the exclusion of the most active sites from methane transformations.

1. 氯离子在催化剂中的存在修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键，导致催化活性增强，并且根据反应温度形成特定的活性中心。
2. 在约2 wt.%氯离子含量的Na/CaO催化剂中，反应选择性和乙烷形成的选择性达到最高值，超过无氯化物催化剂的性能。
3. 在较低温度下，由于氯离子导致的转化率下降主要与其它反应条件无关，大约减少了75%的相对比例。
4. 在973和1023 K的温度下，向Na/CaO催化剂添加12 wt.%氯离子显著降低了乙烯形成的选区性，无论修饰剂含量如何，保持恒定的下降水平。
5. 氯化物修饰剂的作用是毒害催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量，导致最活跃位点从甲烷转换中排除。
