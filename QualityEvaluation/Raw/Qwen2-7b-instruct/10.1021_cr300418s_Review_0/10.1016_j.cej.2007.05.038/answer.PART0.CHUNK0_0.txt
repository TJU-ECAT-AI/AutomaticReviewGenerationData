[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "At every amount of chloride ions present in the catalyst, there may occur a decrease in its activity, especially at lower reaction temperatures."
[3] "Already small amounts of chloride ions (up to about 2 wt.%) caused a considerable increase of the selectivity."
[4] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."
[5] "Only the role of chloride ions is unequivocally negative in determining the activity of the catalystthe value of the conversion of both reagents, at every contents of the chloride modifier, is always lower than with the unmodified Na/CaO."

1. The positive impact of chloride ions is noticeable at their low concentrations in the catalyst, and the effects are largely dependent on the reaction temperature.
2. The activity of the catalyst may decrease, particularly at lower temperatures, due to the presence of chloride ions.
3. Small quantities of chloride ions (around 2 wt.%) can significantly enhance the selectivity of the process.
4. At temperatures around 973 and 1023 K, adding 12 wt.% of chloride ions to the catalyst Na/CaO leads to a decrease in the selectivity of ethylene formation, regardless of the other conditions.
5. Chloride ions consistently reduce the activity of the catalyst, causing a lower conversion rate of both reactants irrespective of their concentration.

1. 氯离子在催化剂中的较低浓度下表现出积极的影响，其效果主要依赖于反应温度。
2. 在较低温度下，催化剂的活性可能因氯离子的存在而降低。
3. 小量氯离子（约2 wt.%）可以显著提高选择性。
4. 在大约973和1023 K的温度下，向催化剂Na/CaO添加12 wt.%的氯离子会导致乙烯形成的选择性下降，无论其他条件如何。
5. 氯离子始终降低催化剂的活性，导致两种反应物的转化率降低，无论其浓度如何。
