<quotes>
[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "At every amount of chloride ions present in the catalyst, there may occur a decrease in its activity, especially at lower reaction temperatures."
[3] "Already small amounts of chloride ions (up to about 2 wt.%) caused a considerable increase of the selectivity."
[4] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."
[5] "Only the role of chloride ions is unequivocally negative in determining the activity of the catalystthe value of the conversion of both reagents, at every contents of the chloride modifier, is always lower than with the unmodified Na/CaO."

1. The positive impact of chloride ions is noticeable at their low concentrations in the catalyst, and the effects are largely dependent on the reaction temperature.
2. The activity of the catalyst may decrease, particularly at lower temperatures, due to the presence of chloride ions.
3. Small quantities of chloride ions (around 2 wt.%) can significantly enhance the selectivity of the process.

[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "There is an optimal content (about 2 wt.%) of chloride ions in Na/CaO, at which the total selectivity of reaction and selectivity of ethane formation reach the highest values, higher than those with the chloride-free catalyst."
[3] "At the temperature of 973 K, the increases in total selectivity were about 10 relative percents, regardless of the employed conditions of the reaction."
[4] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The presence of chloride ions in the catalyst modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by poisoning the catalyst surface and reducing the number of active oxygen sites. This exclusion of active sites from methane transformations leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, at small contents, it enhances selectivity for ethane and ethylene formation, particularly at lower temperatures.

2. There is an optimal content of 2 wt.% chloride ions in Na/CaO catalysts, where the total selectivity and ethane formation selectivity reach their highest values, surpassing those of chloride-free catalysts.

3. At 973 K, regardless of the reaction conditions, the total selectivity of the process increases by about 10% due to the chloride ions' presence.

4. At 973 and 1023 K, adding 12 wt.% chloride ions to the Na/CaO catalyst reduces the selectivity of ethylene formation to a constant level, irrespective of the modifier's content.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 氯离子在催化剂中的存在通过破坏表面化学和改变化学键来修改表面化学，主要是通过毒害催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量。这导致活性降低。然而，在小含量下，它提高了乙烷和乙烯形成的选择性，尤其是在较低温度下。

2. Na/CaO催化剂中氯离子的最佳含量为2 wt.％，此时总选择性和乙烷形成选择性达到最高值，超过无氯化物催化剂。

3. 在973 K下，无论反应条件如何，过程总选择性由于氯离子的存在增加了大约10％。

4. 在973和1023 K下，向Na/CaO催化剂添加12 wt.％氯离子会将乙烯形成的选择性降低到一个常数水平，无论修饰剂的含量如何。

[1] "An introduction of a chloride modifier to catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in its activity in comparison with the unmodified catalyst which was manifested as a decrease in the conversions of both reagents."
[2] "At the lower temperature of the process, 973 K, there occurs a deep drop in the conversion of oxygen and methane already in the presence of very small amounts of chloride ions."
[3] "The very rapid and deep decrease in the activity of the modified catalysts at lower temperatures may result from the fact that under such conditions the dominant participation in the course of the process of the oxidative coupling of methane must belong to the most active sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Only the poisoning of also those less active sites with large amounts of the modifier considerably inhibits the course of the OCM process also at higher temperatures."
[5] "So, it is possible to state that alkali metal and chloride ions should coexist in the optimal proportion on the catalyst surface to achieve the high selectivity of the oxidative coupling of methane process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by poisoning the catalyst surface and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. This leads to an exclusion of the most active sites from methane transformations. The nature and location of active centers are altered due to the presence of chloride ions, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for certain industrially relevant reactions. To achieve high selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane process, alkali metal and chloride ions should coexist in the optimal proportion on the catalyst surface.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过毒害催化剂表面并减少具有活性氧的位点来实现。这导致从甲烷转化中排除最活跃的位点。活性中心的性质和位置由于氯离子的存在而发生变化，这可能使某些工业相关反应的催化活性得到增强。为了在甲烷氧化耦合过程中实现高选择性，碱金属和氯离子应该在催化剂表面以最佳比例共存。
