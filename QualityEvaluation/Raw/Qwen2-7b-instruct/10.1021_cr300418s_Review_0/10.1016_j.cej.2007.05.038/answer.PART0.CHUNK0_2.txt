[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "At the temperature of 973 K, the increases in total selectivity were about 10 relative percents, regardless of the employed conditions of the reaction."
[3] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."
[4] "At the temperature of 1123 K and contact time W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3, regardless of oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture, were the results of the OCM process different: under such conditions a slight increase in the selectivity to C3+ in comparison with unmodified catalyst Na/CaO was observed."

1. The presence of chloride ions in the catalyst at small contents shows a positive impact, and the specific effects are largely determined by the reaction temperature.
2. At 973 K, the total selectivity increases by about 10% regardless of the reaction conditions.
3. At temperatures around 973 K and 1023 K, adding 12 wt.% chloride ions reduces the selectivity of ethylene formation, with this effect remaining constant at higher modifier contents.
4. At 1123 K with a contact time of 0.4 s g/cm3, the selectivity towards C3+ hydrocarbons increases slightly compared to the unmodified catalyst Na/CaO, regardless of the oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture.

1. 氯离子在催化剂中的存在，特别是在小含量下，表现出积极的影响，这些特定效果主要取决于反应温度。
2. 在973 K时，总选择性增加约10%，无论反应条件如何。
3. 在大约973 K和1023 K的温度下，添加12 wt.%的氯化物离子会降低乙烯形成的选择性，这种效应在更高修饰剂含量时保持不变。
4. 在1123 K和接触时间为0.4 s g/cm3的情况下，与未修改的催化剂Na/CaO相比，C3+烃的选择性略有增加，无论反应混合物中的氧浓度如何。
