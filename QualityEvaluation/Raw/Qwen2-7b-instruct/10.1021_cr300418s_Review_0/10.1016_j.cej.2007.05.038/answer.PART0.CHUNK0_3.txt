[1] "An introduction of a chloride modifier to catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in its activity in comparison with the unmodified catalyst which was manifested as a decrease in the conversions of both reagents."
[2] "At the lower temperature of the process, 973 K, there occurs a deep drop in the conversion of oxygen and methane already in the presence of very small amounts of chloride ions."
[3] "The very rapid and deep decrease in the activity of the modified catalysts at lower temperatures may result from the fact that under such conditions the dominant participation in the course of the process of the oxidative coupling of methane must belong to the most active sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Only the poisoning of also those less active sites with large amounts of the modifier considerably inhibits the course of the OCM process also at higher temperatures."
[5] "So, it is possible to state that alkali metal and chloride ions should coexist in the optimal proportion on the catalyst surface to achieve the high selectivity of the oxidative coupling of methane process."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by poisoning the catalyst surface and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. This leads to an exclusion of the most active sites from methane transformations. The nature and location of active centers are altered due to the presence of chloride ions, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for certain industrially relevant reactions. To achieve high selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane process, alkali metal and chloride ions should coexist in the optimal proportion on the catalyst surface.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂改变了表面化学和破坏了化学键，通过毒害催化剂表面并减少具有活性氧的位点来实现。这导致从甲烷转化中排除最活跃的位点。活性中心的性质和位置由于氯离子的存在而发生变化，这可能使某些工业相关反应的催化活性得到增强。为了在甲烷氧化耦合过程中实现高选择性，碱金属和氯离子应该在催化剂表面以最佳比例共存。
