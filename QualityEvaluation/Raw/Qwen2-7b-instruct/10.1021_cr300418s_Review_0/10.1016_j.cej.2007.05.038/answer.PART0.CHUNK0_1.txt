[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."
[2] "There is an optimal content (about 2 wt.%) of chloride ions in Na/CaO, at which the total selectivity of reaction and selectivity of ethane formation reach the highest values, higher than those with the chloride-free catalyst."
[3] "At the temperature of 973 K, the increases in total selectivity were about 10 relative percents, regardless of the employed conditions of the reaction."
[4] "Regardless of the other reaction conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addition of chloride ions in the amount of 12 wt.% to the catalyst Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher contents of the modifier."

1. The presence of chloride ions in the catalyst modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by poisoning the catalyst surface and reducing the number of active oxygen sites. This exclusion of active sites from methane transformations leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, at small contents, it enhances selectivity for ethane and ethylene formation, particularly at lower temperatures.

2. There is an optimal content of 2 wt.% chloride ions in Na/CaO catalysts, where the total selectivity and ethane formation selectivity reach their highest values, surpassing those of chloride-free catalysts.

3. At 973 K, regardless of the reaction conditions, the total selectivity of the process increases by about 10% due to the chloride ions' presence.

4. At 973 and 1023 K, adding 12 wt.% chloride ions to the Na/CaO catalyst reduces the selectivity of ethylene formation to a constant level, irrespective of the modifier's content.

1. 氯离子在催化剂中的存在通过破坏表面化学和改变化学键来修改表面化学，主要是通过毒害催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量。这导致活性降低。然而，在小含量下，它提高了乙烷和乙烯形成的选择性，尤其是在较低温度下。

2. Na/CaO催化剂中氯离子的最佳含量为2 wt.％，此时总选择性和乙烷形成选择性达到最高值，超过无氯化物催化剂。

3. 在973 K下，无论反应条件如何，过程总选择性由于氯离子的存在增加了大约10％。

4. 在973和1023 K下，向Na/CaO催化剂添加12 wt.％氯离子会将乙烯形成的选择性降低到一个常数水平，无论修饰剂的含量如何。
