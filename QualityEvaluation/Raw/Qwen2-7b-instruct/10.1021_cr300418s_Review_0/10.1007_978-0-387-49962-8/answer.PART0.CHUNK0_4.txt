[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and lattice parameters of the catalyst. This leads to changes in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. The modification of surface chemistry affects the nature and location of active centers, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. The specific implications depend on the type of doping, the metal oxide used, and the reaction conditions.
