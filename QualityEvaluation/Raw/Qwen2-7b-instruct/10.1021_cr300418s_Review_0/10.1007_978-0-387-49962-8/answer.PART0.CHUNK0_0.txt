[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering the electronic structure and disrupting chemical bonding, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification affects the nature and location of active centers, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions by creating more efficient pathways for reactant molecules to interact. The implications include increased selectivity, higher reaction rates, and possibly reduced energy consumption in industrial processes.
