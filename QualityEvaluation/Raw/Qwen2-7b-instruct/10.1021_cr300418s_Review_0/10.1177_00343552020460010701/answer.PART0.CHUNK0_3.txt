[1] "The book Enabling Lives: Biographies of Six Prominent Americans with Disabilities features six individuals with disabilities who have achieved remarkable success."
[2] "Judy Heumann's first job application rejection, by the New York City Board of Education because she used a wheelchair, generated a New York Times editorial and an interview on the national news that were exclusively about her situation."
[3] "Tony Coelho, upon retiring from Congress, switched careers to the corporate sector. His boss, grateful to have snatched this enterprising former House Majority Whip, offered him a $100,000 annual bonus for reading the Wall Street Journal each day in toto, as part of a crash course in finance (p. 146)."
[4] "After publishing a New York Times op-ed piece that sharply criticized the fundraising strategy based on patronizing pity that the Jerry Lewis telethon employed, Evan Kemp found out that the beneficiary of that telethon, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, paid a private investigator about a quarter of a million dollars to surreptitiously discredit his reputation."
[5] "Despite early-onset deafness and not making a phone call until he was 25 years old, Frank Bowe was largely responsible for the proposal and passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 that mandate telephone and television equipment and services be accessible to everyone."
[6] "For decades, Justin Dart and his wife, Yoshiko, have conducted their own version of foster parenting (life-quality training) in their home for more than 80 individuals with significant disabilities, to provide them with the skills and supports to start working and living independently."
[7] "With all his high-brow experiences to reminisce about - starring in a Hollywood film for which he received two Academy Awards and directing the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities under nine consecutive presidents - a retired septuagenarian, Harold Russell, chose to work as a program consultant and peer counselor for a radical, grassroots service program for homeless veterans."
