There are a number of interesting specific systems in which catalysis may be strongly connected to this aspect of flexibility, but for which it has not been considered to play a role; for example, gold catalysis, methanol synthesis, and CO oxidation over ruthenium oxide. Also, the necessity to include materials flexibility in a description of catalytic phenomena has been largely neglected in theoretical modeling of catalytic reactions, but may be necessary to reach an atomistic understanding of both the energetic and, in particular, the kinetic aspects of catalysis, which is a kinetic phenomenon, after all.

The inclusion of substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify the surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding. This modification affects the nature and location of active centers, enhancing catalytic activity and potentially improving industrially relevant reactions. The flexibility of the system plays a crucial role in these changes, influencing the energetics and kinetics of catalytic processes.
