[1] "Combined experimental and theoretical model studies are successful in disentangling structurespectroscopy and struc- turereactivity relationships as demonstrated for a hydroge- nation and oxidation reaction."
[2] "Model systems may be characterized at the atomic level experimentally, which allows for direct comparison with theoretical modeling and allows useful correlations with systems of practical relevance."
[3] "The flexibility of the system is a relevant parameter that renders nanoparticle uptake different from single crystals."
[4] "Thin oxide films on metal substrates represent an interesting and promising material combination. It is possible to use known concepts from semiconductor physics to understand the underlying principles, taking the flexibility of the system into account, and to use them to design model systems to get insight into elementary questions in catalysis."
[5] "In both examples discussed electron transfer determines reactivity."
[6] "It is quite possible to think about material combinations that would favor electron transfer for specific molecules and induce specific and selective reactions."
