[1] "The introduction of TCM to the reactant stream in the oxidative coupling of methane on MgO improves the selectivity to ethylene."
[2] "A very small quantity of the chlorinated species is observed by XPS and XRF. The chlorinated species are present mainly on the catalyst surface, suggesting that the reaction behaviour is strongly influenced by the surface chlorinated species, although gas phase participation cannot be excluded."
[3] "Thermal decomposition of the used catalyst suggests that the chlorinated species is MgC12, based on the comparison with a similar treatment of the commercial samples."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing additional dopant atoms, which can alter the electronic structure and coordination environment of the host metal ions. This can lead to changes in the active site properties, such as acidity, basicity, or redox potentials, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The resulting modifications can enhance the catalytic activity by providing more efficient pathways for the desired reaction, stabilizing intermediates, or facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products.

2. The nature and location of active centers on the metal oxide catalyst surface are influenced by the substitutional doping, leading to specific functionalities that are tailored for specific reactions. In the case of MgO, the presence of chlorine species on the surface is suggested to play a critical role in improving the selectivity towards ethylene in the oxidative coupling of methane. These surface chlorinated species likely act as reactive sites that promote the formation of ethylene by modifying the surface chemistry and reactivity.

3. The implications for industrially relevant reactions include potential improvements in yield, selectivity, and reaction efficiency. By carefully controlling the doping process and optimizing the conditions, it may be possible to tailor the catalyst properties for maximizing the production of valuable chemical intermediates or fuels. This could lead to more sustainable and economically viable processes for the utilization of natural gas resources, which is particularly important for the development of cleaner energy technologies.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂离子改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键，通过引入额外的掺杂物原子，可以改变宿主金属离子的电子结构和配位环境。这可能导致活性位点性质的变化，如酸性、碱性或还原电势，这对于催化活性至关重要。这些修改可以通过提供更有效的反应途径来增强催化活性，稳定中间体或促进反应物和产物的扩散。

2. 催化剂表面的活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂的影响，导致特定的功能特性，这些特性针对特定反应进行了调整。对于MgO而言，表面氯化物种的存在被建议在甲烷氧化耦合生成乙烯时提高选择性。这些表面氯化物种可能作为反应位点，通过修改表面化学性质和反应活性来促进乙烯的形成。

3. 对工业相关反应的潜在影响包括产量、选择性和反应效率的改进。通过精确控制掺杂过程并优化条件，有可能根据最大化有价值化学中间体或燃料的生产来定制催化剂属性。这可能导致更可持续和经济上可行的过程，用于利用天然气资源，这对开发清洁能源技术的发展特别重要。
