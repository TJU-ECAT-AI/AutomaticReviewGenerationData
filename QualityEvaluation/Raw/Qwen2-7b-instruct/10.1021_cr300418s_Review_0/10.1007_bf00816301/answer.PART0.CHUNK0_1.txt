[1] "The introduction of TCM to the reactant stream in the oxidative coupling of methane on MgO improves the selectivity to ethylene."
[2] "A very small quantity of the chlorinated species is observed by XPS and XRF. The chlorinated species are present mainly on the catalyst surface, suggesting that the reaction behaviour is strongly influenced by the surface chlorinated species, although gas phase participation cannot be excluded."
[3] "Thermal decomposition of the used catalyst suggests that the chlorinated species is MgC12, based on the comparison with a similar treatment of the commercial samples."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing specific elements that alter the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. This modification can lead to the creation of new active centers, enhancing catalytic activity and improving the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. The resulting implications include selective enhancement of certain reaction pathways, increased stability of the catalyst under various operating conditions, and the ability to control product distribution.

2. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts are significantly influenced by substitutional cation doping. Surface chemistry modifications can lead to the formation of specific reactive sites where key chemical transformations occur. These active sites are often localized on the surface of the metal oxide particles, contributing to the overall catalytic performance. The presence of dopants can affect the adsorption/desorption properties of reactants and intermediates, influencing the reaction kinetics and equilibrium.

3. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions stem from the enhanced selectivity, increased reaction rates, and better control over product formation. By modifying the catalyst surface chemistry, it becomes possible to optimize reaction conditions for specific applications, leading to higher yields of desired products, reduced waste generation, and more sustainable manufacturing processes.
