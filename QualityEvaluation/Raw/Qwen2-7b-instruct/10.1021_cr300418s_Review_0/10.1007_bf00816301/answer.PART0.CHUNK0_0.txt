[1] "The introduction of TCM to the reactant stream in the oxidative coupling of methane on MgO improves the selectivity to ethylene."
[2] "A very small quantity of the chlorinated species is observed by XPS and XRF. The chlorinated species are present mainly on the catalyst surface, suggesting that the reaction behaviour is strongly influenced by the surface chlorinated species, although gas phase participation cannot be excluded."
[3] "Thermal decomposition of the used catalyst suggests that the chlorinated species is MgC12, based on the comparison with a similar treatment of the commercial samples."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification creates new active centers on the catalyst surface, which are crucial for the acceleration of industrially relevant reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers on the catalyst surface are significantly influenced by the presence of surface chlorinated species. These species are believed to play a critical role in improving the selectivity towards specific products, such as ethylene in the oxidative coupling of methane. The chlorinated species observed on the catalyst surface are primarily MgC12, which is responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance.

3. The implications for industrially relevant reactions include improved selectivity and yield of desired products. The enhanced stability and activity of the catalysts allow for more efficient use of raw materials and energy, contributing to a more sustainable chemical industry.
