[1] "The present paper describes studies of the oxidative coupling of methane on magnesium oxide and the application of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence analyses to clarify the nature and source of the effect of the introduction of carbon tetrachloride into the methane conversion feedstream."
[2] "It is concluded that the enhancement of the selectivity to ethylene primarily results from the presence of surface chlorine species."
[3] "The chlorinated species on the catalyst has been identified as magnesium chloride."
[4] "The formation of an excess of chlorinated species on the catalyst surface leads to deactivation, possible due to the blockage of oxygen sites of magnesium oxide."
[5] "These results suggest that the chlorinated species on the catalyst is magnesium chloride (MgCl2)."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing foreign atoms that alter the local electronic environment, potentially creating new active sites or modifying existing ones. This modification can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by facilitating or inhibiting specific reaction pathways. The implications for industrially relevant reactions include improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic process.

2. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts are influenced by the dopant type, concentration, and the crystal structure of the host material. In the case of magnesium oxide, the introduction of chlorine species through carbon tetrachloride leads to the formation of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) on the surface. This surface modification can create new active sites that enhance the selectivity towards desired products, such as ethylene, in the oxidative coupling of methane.

3. The location of active centers can vary depending on the dopant and the reaction conditions. In the context of magnesium oxide, the active centers responsible for the enhanced selectivity are found on the surface where magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is formed. This surface modification can lead to deactivation if an excess of chlorinated species forms, blocking oxygen sites and disrupting the catalytic process.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过掺杂取代阳离子可以改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键。这可能通过引入外层原子来改变局部电子环境，从而创建新的活性位点或修改现有位点。这种修改可能导致催化活性增强，通过促进或抑制特定反应途径。对于工业相关反应而言，这种影响包括提高催化过程的效率、选择性和稳定性。

2. 金属氧化物催化剂中的活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂类型、浓度和宿主材料的晶体结构的影响。在镁氧化物的情况下，通过碳四氯化物引入氯物种导致镁氯化物（MgCl2）在表面形成。这种表面修饰可以创建新的活性位点，以增强甲烷氧化耦合过程中所需产品的选择性，如乙烯。

3. 活性中心的位置取决于掺杂剂和反应条件。在镁氧化物的背景下，负责增强选择性的活性中心位于表面，那里形成了镁氯化物（MgCl2）。这种表面修饰可能导致失活，如果形成过多的氯化物种，阻塞氧位点并破坏催化过程。
