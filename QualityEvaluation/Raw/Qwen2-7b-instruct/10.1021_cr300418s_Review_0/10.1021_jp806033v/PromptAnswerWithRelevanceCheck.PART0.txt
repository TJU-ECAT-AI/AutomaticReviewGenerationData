[1] "Despite the increasing interest, atomic-scale model studies of the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in the catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are rather scarce."
[2] "The effect of promoters becomes clearly visible in these diagrams because of the changed adspeciessurface interactions and the resulting alteration of the sticking and the adsorption/desorption kinetics."
[3] "The presence of CeOx nanoformations has a significant impact on the catalytic performance of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation reaction, inducing a significant shift of the bistability region and thereby of the whole kinetic phase diagram for CO oxidation to higher CO pressures."

[1] "Despite the increasing interest, atomic-scale model studies of the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in the catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are rather scarce."
[2] "The main hindrance in the creation of well-defined model systems necessary for such studies is the interfacial Ceplatinum metal alloying starting already around room temperature, which makes the effective separation of coadsorption- and substrate-caused effects difficult."
[3] "However, even for the higher coverage the determination of the Ce oxidation state in 2D CeOx nanoformations from the XP signal still remains difficult because of presence of two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) in partially reduced ceria islands."
[4] "Such phase diagrams appeared to be helpful in revealing and understanding mechanisms of bistability and oscillations for reactions in homogeneous phase such as the Briggs-Rauscher (BR) or Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillating reaction, (38, 39) and are applied since more than one decade also to heterogeneous systems such as CO + O2/Me. (32, 37, 40, 41)"
[5] "Indeed, the interface step height of 3Å (see inset in Figure 1) may provide an inhomogeneity which is sufficient to significantly facilitate the O2 dissociation."

1. Atomic-scale model studies exploring the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are scarce due to difficulties in creating well-defined model systems that effectively separate coadsorption- and substrate-caused effects.
2. Interfacial Ce-platinum metal alloying starting at room temperature complicates the creation of such model systems, making it hard to distinguish between effects caused by the metal and the oxide.
3. Determining the Ce oxidation state in 2D CeOx nanoformations is challenging, especially at higher coverages, because of the presence of two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) in partially reduced ceria islands.
4. Kinetic phase diagrams are useful tools for revealing and understanding mechanisms of bistability and oscillations in reactions like the Briggs-Rauscher (BR) or Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillating reactions, and they have been widely applied to heterogeneous systems such as CO + O2/Me reactions for over a decade.
5. The interface step height of 3 Å, as depicted in the figure, introduces inhomogeneity that facilitates the dissociation of O2, potentially enhancing the reaction rate.

1. 在原子尺度上研究氧化铈和氧化铈/金属界面在铂基催化剂上催化CO氧化的作用相对较少，主要障碍在于室温下就开始出现的铈-铂合金化，这使得有效分离协同吸附和基质引起的效应变得困难。
2. 铈-铂合金化从室温开始就存在，这使得构建能够清晰区分金属和氧化物作用的模型系统变得复杂，从而难以区分两者所引起的效果。
3. 确定二维氧化铈纳米形成体中的铈氧化状态尤其在高覆盖率的情况下具有挑战性，因为部分还原的铈岛中存在两种氧化态（Ce3+和Ce4+）。
4. 动力学相图对于揭示和理解Briggs-Rauscher（BR）或Belousov-Zhabotinsky（BZ）振荡反应等均相反应机制非常有帮助，并且已经广泛应用于如CO + O2/Me这类异相系统的反应机制研究超过十年时间。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating mixed oxidation states, such as Ce3+ and Ce4+, in ceria islands. This affects the adsorption and desorption kinetics of reactants, leading to changes in the catalytic activity. The presence of ceria nanoformations introduces an electronically modified area around the CeOx islands, which can act as an 'active border'. This area enhances the uptake of oxygen, shifting the kinetic phase diagram towards higher CO pressures, and improving the overall catalytic activity. The concept of an active border helps to explain the local enhancement of catalytic activity.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically ceria (CeOx) in this context, modifies surface chemistry by creating an active border around the CeOx islands. This border is a few adsorption sites wide and electronically modified, leading to an enhancement of catalytic activity. The modification disrupts chemical bonding through the introduction of Ce ions, which alters the surface properties and reactivity. The resulting implications include an increase in catalytic activity, a shift in the kinetic phase diagram for CO oxidation towards higher CO pressures, and a remarkable improvement in the total catalytic activity, despite the blocking effect of ceria islands on the Pt(111) surface.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，特别是掺杂铈（CeOx）的情况下，表面化学性质通过在CeOx岛周围形成活性边界而发生变化。这个边界宽度约为几个吸附位点，并且是电子修改的，导致催化活性增强。这种修改破坏了化学键，通过引入Ce离子改变了表面性质和反应性。由此产生的影响包括催化活性的增加、CO氧化反应动力学相图向更高CO压力方向的移动以及总催化活性的显著提高，尽管铈岛对Pt(111)表面的阻挡效应。
