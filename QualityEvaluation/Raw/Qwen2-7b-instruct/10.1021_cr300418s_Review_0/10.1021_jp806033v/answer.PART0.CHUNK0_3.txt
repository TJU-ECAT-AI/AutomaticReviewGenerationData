[1] "Despite the increasing interest, atomic-scale model studies of the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in the catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are rather scarce."
[2] "The main hindrance in the creation of well-defined model systems necessary for such studies is the interfacial Ce-platinum metal alloying starting already around room temperature, which makes the effective separation of coadsorption- and substrate-caused effects difficult."
[3] "However, even for the higher coverage the determination of the Ce oxidation state in 2D CeOx nanoformations from the XP signal still remains difficult because of presence of two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) in partially reduced ceria islands."
[4] "Due to their characteristic shape for the CO oxidation reaction on different Pt, Rh, and Pd surfaces, these diagrams are often referred to as cross-shaped phase diagrams (40) or (because of the branching at the transition points) as bifurcation diagrams. (32)"
[5] "Starting from the clean Pt(111) surface shown in Figure 2a and using the corresponding phase diagram in Figure 2c as a reference, the role of the ceria nanoformations can be studied by a direct comparison:"

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by creating mixed oxidation states, such as Ce3+ and Ce4+, in ceria islands. This affects the adsorption and desorption kinetics of reactants, leading to changes in the catalytic activity. The presence of ceria nanoformations introduces an electronically modified area around the CeOx islands, which can act as an 'active border'. This area enhances the uptake of oxygen, shifting the kinetic phase diagram towards higher CO pressures, and improving the overall catalytic activity. The concept of an active border helps to explain the local enhancement of catalytic activity.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂离子改变了表面化学性质和化学键，通过在铈化物岛中产生混合氧化态（如Ce3+和Ce4+），影响了反应物的吸附和脱附动力学，从而改变催化活性。铈氧化物纳米形貌引入了一个电子修改区域，围绕铈氧岛，这可以作为“活性边界”。这个区域增强了氧气的吸收，将动力学相图向更高的CO压力移动，并提高整体催化活性。活性边界的概念有助于解释活性区域的局部催化活性增强。
