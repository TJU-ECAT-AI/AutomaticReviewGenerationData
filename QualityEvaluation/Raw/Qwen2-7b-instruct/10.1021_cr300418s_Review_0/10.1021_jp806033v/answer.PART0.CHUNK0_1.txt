[1] "The effect of promoters becomes clearly visible in these diagrams because of the changed adspecies-surface interactions and the resulting alteration of the sticking and the adsorption/desorption kinetics."
[2] "This increase in activity is not accompanied by an additional noticeable shift or modification of the kinetic phase diagram."
[3] "The explanation for the observed effects can be found in the atomic-scale peculiarities of the spatial electron density distribution at the Pt surface in the vicinity to CeOx islands (at the PtCeOx interface)."
[4] "An active border consisting of an a few adsorption sites wide electronically modified area around the CeOx islands is proposed to explain the strong local enhancement of catalytic activity."

1. Promoters enhance catalytic activity by altering adspecies-surface interactions and modifying sticking and adsorption/desorption kinetics.

2. The increase in catalytic activity of the CeOx/Pt(111) model system is not accompanied by a significant change in the kinetic phase diagram.

3. The atomic-scale characteristics of the spatial electron density distribution near the Pt surface in relation to CeOx islands explain the observed effects.

4. The proposed concept of an active border, an electronically modified area around the CeOx islands, contributes to the strong local enhancement of catalytic activity.

1. 添加剂通过改变吸附物种与表面的相互作用以及调节粘附和吸附/脱附动力学来增强催化活性。

2. CeOx/Pt(111)模型系统的催化活性增加并未伴随着动力学相图的显著变化。

3. Pt表面附近CeOx岛屿的原子尺度特性，尤其是空间电子密度分布，解释了观察到的效果。

4. 提出的活性边界概念，即围绕CeOx岛屿的几纳米宽的电子修饰区域，有助于强烈的局部催化活性增强。
