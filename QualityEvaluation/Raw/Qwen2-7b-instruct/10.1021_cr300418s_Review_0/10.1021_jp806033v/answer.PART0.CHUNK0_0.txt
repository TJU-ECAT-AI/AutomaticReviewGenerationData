[1] "Despite the increasing interest, atomic-scale model studies of the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in the catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are rather scarce."
[2] "The effect of promoters becomes clearly visible in these diagrams because of the changed adspeciessurface interactions and the resulting alteration of the sticking and the adsorption/desorption kinetics."
[3] "The presence of CeOx nanoformations has a significant impact on the catalytic performance of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation reaction, inducing a significant shift of the bistability region and thereby of the whole kinetic phase diagram for CO oxidation to higher CO pressures."

1. Atomic-scale model studies exploring the role of ceria and its interface with metals in catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are limited, highlighting the scarcity of such investigations.
2. Promoters alter the adsorbent-surface interactions, leading to changes in sticking coefficients and adsorption/desorption kinetics, which are clearly evident in kinetic phase diagrams.
3. The introduction of CeOx nanostructures significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Pt(111) surface in CO oxidation, shifting the bistability region towards higher CO pressures.
