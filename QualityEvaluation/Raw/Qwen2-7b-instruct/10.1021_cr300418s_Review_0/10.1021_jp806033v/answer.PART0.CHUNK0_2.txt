[1] "Despite the increasing interest, atomic-scale model studies of the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in the catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are rather scarce."
[2] "The main hindrance in the creation of well-defined model systems necessary for such studies is the interfacial Ceplatinum metal alloying starting already around room temperature, which makes the effective separation of coadsorption- and substrate-caused effects difficult."
[3] "However, even for the higher coverage the determination of the Ce oxidation state in 2D CeOx nanoformations from the XP signal still remains difficult because of presence of two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) in partially reduced ceria islands."
[4] "Such phase diagrams appeared to be helpful in revealing and understanding mechanisms of bistability and oscillations for reactions in homogeneous phase such as the Briggs-Rauscher (BR) or Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillating reaction, (38, 39) and are applied since more than one decade also to heterogeneous systems such as CO + O2/Me. (32, 37, 40, 41)"
[5] "Indeed, the interface step height of 3Å (see inset in Figure 1) may provide an inhomogeneity which is sufficient to significantly facilitate the O2 dissociation."

1. Atomic-scale model studies exploring the role of ceria and the ceria/metal interface in catalytic CO oxidation on platinum metals are scarce due to difficulties in creating well-defined model systems that effectively separate coadsorption- and substrate-caused effects.
2. Interfacial Ce-platinum metal alloying starting at room temperature complicates the creation of such model systems, making it hard to distinguish between effects caused by the metal and the oxide.
3. Determining the Ce oxidation state in 2D CeOx nanoformations is challenging, especially at higher coverages, because of the presence of two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) in partially reduced ceria islands.
4. Kinetic phase diagrams are useful tools for revealing and understanding mechanisms of bistability and oscillations in reactions like the Briggs-Rauscher (BR) or Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillating reactions, and they have been widely applied to heterogeneous systems such as CO + O2/Me reactions for over a decade.
5. The interface step height of 3 Å, as depicted in the figure, introduces inhomogeneity that facilitates the dissociation of O2, potentially enhancing the reaction rate.

1. 在原子尺度上研究氧化铈和氧化铈/金属界面在铂基催化剂上催化CO氧化的作用相对较少，主要障碍在于室温下就开始出现的铈-铂合金化，这使得有效分离协同吸附和基质引起的效应变得困难。
2. 铈-铂合金化从室温开始就存在，这使得构建能够清晰区分金属和氧化物作用的模型系统变得复杂，从而难以区分两者所引起的效果。
3. 确定二维氧化铈纳米形成体中的铈氧化状态尤其在高覆盖率的情况下具有挑战性，因为部分还原的铈岛中存在两种氧化态（Ce3+和Ce4+）。
4. 动力学相图对于揭示和理解Briggs-Rauscher（BR）或Belousov-Zhabotinsky（BZ）振荡反应等均相反应机制非常有帮助，并且已经广泛应用于如CO + O2/Me这类异相系统的反应机制研究超过十年时间。
5. 图片中显示的界面台阶高度为3 Å，引入了不均匀性，可以显著促进氧的解离，可能增强反应速率。
