[1] "The presence of CeOx nanoformations has a significant impact on the catalytic performance of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation reaction, inducing a significant shift of the bistability region and thereby of the whole kinetic phase diagram for CO oxidation to higher CO pressures."
[2] "Despite of the surface blocking effect (by ceria islands) the total catalytic activity increases remarkably, indicating a significant gain of the catalytic activity on the exposed (uncovered) Pt-surface."
[3] "A concept of an active border consisting of an a few adsorption sites wide electronically modified area around the CeOx islands is proposed to explain the strong local enhancement of catalytic activity."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically ceria (CeOx) in this context, modifies surface chemistry by creating an active border around the CeOx islands. This border is a few adsorption sites wide and electronically modified, leading to an enhancement of catalytic activity. The modification disrupts chemical bonding through the introduction of Ce ions, which alters the surface properties and reactivity. The resulting implications include an increase in catalytic activity, a shift in the kinetic phase diagram for CO oxidation towards higher CO pressures, and a remarkable improvement in the total catalytic activity, despite the blocking effect of ceria islands on the Pt(111) surface.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，特别是掺杂铈（CeOx）的情况下，表面化学性质通过在CeOx岛周围形成活性边界而发生变化。这个边界宽度约为几个吸附位点，并且是电子修改的，导致催化活性增强。这种修改破坏了化学键，通过引入Ce离子改变了表面性质和反应性。由此产生的影响包括催化活性的增加、CO氧化反应动力学相图向更高CO压力方向的移动以及总催化活性的显著提高，尽管铈岛对Pt(111)表面的阻挡效应。
