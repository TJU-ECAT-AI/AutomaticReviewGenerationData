The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify the surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification often leads to the creation of new active sites or the alteration of existing ones, which can improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. For example, doping can change the electronic structure of the metal oxide, affecting its reactivity and selectivity towards specific chemical transformations. Additionally, the introduction of dopants can lead to the formation of defects or impurities on the surface, which can act as additional active centers for catalysis. These changes can result in improved performance in reactions such as alkane oxidation, olefin metathesis, and selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement. The nature and location of these active centers depend on the specific type of doping and the reaction conditions, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the local electronic environment around the active sites. This change can lead to enhanced catalytic activity due to the creation of new reactive sites or the stabilization of intermediates. The nature and location of active centers can also be influenced, potentially leading to more efficient reaction pathways. For industrially relevant reactions, such modifications could result in improved selectivity and yield, as well as increased stability of the catalyst. The specific effects depend on the dopant type, its concentration, and the interaction with the metal oxide matrix.

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and charge distribution within the material. This change can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying existing ones. The nature and location of active centers can shift due to the doping, which may result in improved selectivity and efficiency for specific reactions. For instance, the introduction of dopants can influence the redox properties, leading to better performance in redox and acid-base catalytic processes. In alkane reactions, such as propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the doping might optimize the reaction pathways, enhancing the conversion rates and product yields. Additionally, the selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons, as well as the use of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors, can be improved through the strategic doping of metal oxides, affecting their reactivity and sensitivity to specific molecules or gases.

The volume of Metal Oxides: Chemistry and Applications comprises 23 chapters, with 15 focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides. The organization of the content is described as vague, with the first five chapters lacking a clear logical order. However, Chapter 6 provides an extensive overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides, serving as a valuable resource for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides. Chapter 7, while detailed, narrows its focus to manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors, potentially losing readers who are primarily interested in catalysis.
