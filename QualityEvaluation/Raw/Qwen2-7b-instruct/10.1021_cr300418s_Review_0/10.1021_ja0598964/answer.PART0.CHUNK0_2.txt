[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties. Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides."
[3] "Chapters 8–11 survey redox and acid-base properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[4] "Chapters 13–15 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis."
[5] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides, and Chapter 22 is a discussion of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and charge distribution within the material. This change can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying existing ones. The nature and location of active centers can shift due to the doping, which may result in improved selectivity and efficiency for specific reactions. For instance, the introduction of dopants can influence the redox properties, leading to better performance in redox and acid-base catalytic processes. In alkane reactions, such as propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the doping might optimize the reaction pathways, enhancing the conversion rates and product yields. Additionally, the selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons, as well as the use of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors, can be improved through the strategic doping of metal oxides, affecting their reactivity and sensitivity to specific molecules or gases.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂通过改变材料内的电子结构和电荷分布来修改表面化学和破坏化学键。这种变化可能导致催化活性增强，通过创建新的活性位点或修改现有位点。活性中心的性质和位置可能会因掺杂而发生变化，这可能导致特定反应的选择性和效率得到改善。例如，掺杂可以影响还原性，从而在还原性和酸碱催化过程中提高性能。在烷烃反应中，如丙烷选择性氧化、甲烷氧化以及较低烷烃的氧化脱氢，掺杂可能优化反应途径，提高转化率和产物产率。此外，通过在金属氧化物上使用氨或碳氢化合物进行选择性还原以消除NOx，以及使用半导体SnO2气体传感器，可以通过策略性掺杂金属氧化物来改善其反应性，使其对特定分子或气体更加敏感。
