[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides."
[4] "Chapters 811 survey redox and acidbase properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[5] "Chapters 1315 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis."
[6] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides."
[7] "Chapter 22 is a discussion of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify the surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification often leads to the creation of new active sites or the alteration of existing ones, which can improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. For example, doping can change the electronic structure of the metal oxide, affecting its reactivity and selectivity towards specific chemical transformations. Additionally, the introduction of dopants can lead to the formation of defects or impurities on the surface, which can act as additional active centers for catalysis. These changes can result in improved performance in reactions such as alkane oxidation, olefin metathesis, and selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement. The nature and location of these active centers depend on the specific type of doping and the reaction conditions, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.
