[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 811 survey redox and acidbase properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[3] "Chapters 1315 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis."
[4] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides, and Chapter 22 is a discussion of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering the electronic structure and chemical bonding within the metal oxide. This modification leads to the creation of new active sites or changes the existing ones, enhancing the catalytic activity. The nature and location of active centers become crucial factors in determining the efficiency of the catalytic process. The resulting implications include improved selectivity and yield in industrially relevant reactions such as redox and acid-base properties (Chapter 8-11), alkane reactions (Chapters 13-15), and specific processes like olefin metathesis (co-authored chapter). Additionally, the modification can lead to enhanced performance in environmental remediation techniques, such as selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement (Chapter 21) and gas sensor applications (Chapter 22).

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂通过改变金属氧化物内的电子结构和化学键合，修改了表面化学性质。这种修改导致新活性位点的产生或现有位点的变化，从而增强催化活性。活性中心的性质和位置成为决定催化过程效率的关键因素。由此产生的影响包括提高特定反应如还原性和酸碱性质（第8-11章）、烷烃反应（第13-15章）以及诸如烯烃环化等过程的选择性与产率。此外，修改还可以导致环境修复技术的性能提升，例如选择性催化还原用于NOx去除（第21章）和气体传感器应用（第22章）。
