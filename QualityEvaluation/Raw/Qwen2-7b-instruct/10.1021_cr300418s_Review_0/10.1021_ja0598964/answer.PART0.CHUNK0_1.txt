[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."
[4] "Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors."
[5] "This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis."
[6] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader."
[7] "This volume comprises 23 chapters, 15 of which are focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides."
[8] "Overall, this volume contains many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis."
[9] "A wealth of references are given with each chapter, providing a valuable starting point for those new to each area of focus."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the local electronic environment around the active sites. This change can lead to enhanced catalytic activity due to the creation of new reactive sites or the stabilization of intermediates. The nature and location of active centers can also be influenced, potentially leading to more efficient reaction pathways. For industrially relevant reactions, such modifications could result in improved selectivity and yield, as well as increased stability of the catalyst. The specific effects depend on the dopant type, its concentration, and the interaction with the metal oxide matrix.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行取代阳离子掺杂可以改变表面化学和破坏化学键，通过改变活性位点附近的局部电子环境。这可能导致催化活性增强，由于创建新的反应性位点或中间体稳定性的增加。活性中心的性质和位置也可能受到影响，可能导致更有效的反应途径。对于工业上相关的反应，这种修改可能导致选择性和产率的改善，以及催化剂的稳定性增加。具体影响取决于掺杂剂类型、浓度及其与金属氧化物基质的相互作用。
