[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "The first five chapters contain a variety of topics that do not appear to have any particular logical order."
[3] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[4] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."
[5] "Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors."

The volume of Metal Oxides: Chemistry and Applications comprises 23 chapters, with 15 focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides. The organization of the content is described as vague, with the first five chapters lacking a clear logical order. However, Chapter 6 provides an extensive overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides, serving as a valuable resource for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides. Chapter 7, while detailed, narrows its focus to manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors, potentially losing readers who are primarily interested in catalysis.

《金属氧化物：化学与应用》一书包含23章，其中15章直接关注过渡金属氧化物的催化化学和应用。内容组织被描述为模糊不清，前五章缺乏明显的逻辑顺序。然而，第6章提供了关于金属氧化物本体电子结构的详尽概述，对于需要了解金属氧化物基本原理的读者来说，这是一份宝贵的资源。第7章虽然详细，但将重点放在锰酸盐巨磁电阻（CMR）材料和高Tc超导体上，可能会让主要对催化感兴趣的读者感到困惑。
