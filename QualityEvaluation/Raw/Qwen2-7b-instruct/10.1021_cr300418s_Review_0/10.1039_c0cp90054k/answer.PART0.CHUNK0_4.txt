The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding. This modification leads to the creation of new active sites, enhancing catalytic activity. It also changes the nature and location of active centers within the catalyst, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions. The specific implications depend on the type of dopant, the catalyst's structure, and the reaction conditions.
