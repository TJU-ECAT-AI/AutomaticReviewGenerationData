The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and creating new active sites. These modifications lead to enhanced catalytic activity by facilitating faster reaction rates and improving the selectivity of products. The nature and location of active centers are typically at the interface between the dopant and the catalyst matrix, where the electronic environment is optimized for specific reactions. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include increased efficiency and yield, reduced energy consumption, and the ability to perform reactions under milder conditions. However, the document does not provide specific details on how these modifications occur or their exact implications for different types of reactions.
