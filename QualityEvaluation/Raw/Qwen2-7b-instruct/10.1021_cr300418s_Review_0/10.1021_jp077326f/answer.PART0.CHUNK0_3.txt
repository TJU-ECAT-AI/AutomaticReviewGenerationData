The study investigates the interaction of gold and palladium atoms with thin silicon dioxide films grown on a Mo(112) substrate. Through techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption, researchers observe the formation of three-dimensional nanoparticles from gold at low temperatures. Palladium, on the other hand, shows structure-dependent behavior, causing a red-shift in the phonon frequency of the monolayer films but not the multilayer ones. Moreover, the amount of CO that can adsorb on palladium particles on the oxygen-poor monolayer films is significantly less compared to those on oxygen-rich films and multilayer films. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental findings, indicating that palladium atoms penetrate into the hexagonal rings of the silica network and bind at the interface between the silica film and the Mo substrate. Low-temperature STM images confirm the migration of palladium atoms into the film.

本研究探讨了在Mo(112)基底上生长的薄二氧化硅薄膜与金和钯原子的相互作用。通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、红外反射吸收光谱法以及一氧化碳（CO）吸附等技术，研究人员观察到了在低温下金形成三维纳米颗粒的现象。而钯则表现出结构依赖性行为，导致单层薄膜中的声子频率红移，但多层薄膜不发生此现象。此外，钯在氧贫乏单层薄膜上的CO吸附量远少于氧丰富的薄膜和多层薄膜。密度泛函理论计算支持实验结果，表明钯原子渗透进入二氧化硅网络的六边形环，并且与二氧化硅和Mo界面结合。低温STM图像证实了钯原子向薄膜内的迁移。
