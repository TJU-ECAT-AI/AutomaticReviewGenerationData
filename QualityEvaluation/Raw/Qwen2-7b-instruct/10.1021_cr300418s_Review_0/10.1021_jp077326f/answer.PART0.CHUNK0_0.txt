[1] "Gold atoms or clusters deposited on 23 layers thick MgO/Ag(100) films become negatively charged. This effect has dramatic consequences on the structure and shape of the supported clusters, which form two-dimensional structures, while on thicker films they form three-dimensional particles."
[2] "Pd deposition leads to a red-shift of the phonon frequency of the monolayer and not of the multilayer films."
[3] "On the monolayer films, gold forms three-dimensional nanoparticles at temperatures as low as 10 K and does not affect the phonon spectra of the silica films."
[4] "The amount of CO that may adsorb on the Pd particles formed on the O-poor monolayer films is much smaller than that on the O-rich films (with an additional O-layer on the Mo surface) and multilayer films."
[5] "On the O-poor films the Pd atoms strongly bind at the silicaMo interface and do not interact with CO, so that the total amount of adsorbed CO molecules remains small."
[6] "On the O-rich monolayer film, the Pd atoms are also adsorbed subsurface, but the CO is able to form stable PdCO complexes which can escape from the cavity and aggregate to form Pd nanoparticles."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the charge distribution, altering the bonding nature, and influencing the structure and shape of supported clusters. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity due to the creation of unique active centers. For example, gold atoms on thin oxide films form two-dimensional structures, whereas on thicker films, they form three-dimensional particles. Palladium deposition causes a red-shift in the phonon frequency of monolayer films, but not of multilayer films. Gold nanoparticles form at lower temperatures on thin films, and do not affect the phonon spectra. The adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) on palladium is significantly reduced on oxygen-poor films compared to oxygen-rich ones. On oxygen-poor films, palladium atoms bind strongly at the interface without interacting with CO, limiting the total amount of adsorbed CO molecules. On oxygen-rich films, CO forms stable complexes with palladium, enabling the complex to escape and aggregate, which is not possible on oxygen-poor films.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂的置换阳离子改变了表面化学性质，通过改变电荷分布、改变化学键性质以及影响支持簇的结构和形状。这导致催化活性增强，由于产生了独特的活性中心。例如，金原子在薄氧化物薄膜上形成二维结构，而在较厚的薄膜上则形成三维颗粒。钯沉积会导致单层薄膜的声子频率红移，但多层薄膜不发生这种情况。金纳米粒子在薄薄膜上于较低温度下形成，并且不会影响声子谱。碳氧化合物（CO）在贫氧薄膜上的吸附量远小于富氧薄膜。在贫氧薄膜上，钯原子在界面处牢固地结合，而不与CO相互作用，限制了吸附的CO分子总数。在富氧薄膜上，CO能够形成稳定的钯复合物，使复合物能够逃离并聚集，这是在贫氧薄膜上无法实现的。
