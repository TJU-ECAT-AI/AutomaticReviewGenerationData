[1] "In order to verify this hypothesis, here we report on the comparative study of the Pd and Au atom deposition on the O-poor and O-rich monolayer films as well as on a multilayer silica film, used as a reference support."
[2] "Concomitantly, one can expect that the different interaction of Pd with the silica films will manifest itself in the adsorption of CO as a probe molecule, since CO adsorption on the Pd surfaces is well understood and a large database exists for IR spectra."
[3] "On the O-poor phase, where Pd is strongly bound to the substrate, CO is unbound to Pd (by 0.11 eV)."
[4] "On the O-rich film, here CO binds strongly (by 1.04 eV) to Pd atoms located in the cavity."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the physical properties of the catalyst surface. This alteration leads to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying existing ones. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type and amount of dopants added. This modification can improve industrially relevant reactions by increasing reaction rates, improving selectivity, or reducing energy consumption. The specific examples given involve palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) deposition on silica films, where the adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) is significantly affected by the structure of the silica film. On the O-poor film, CO is unable to bind to Pd, whereas on the O-rich film, CO binds strongly to Pd, facilitating its escape and aggregation, demonstrating how the structure of the film influences catalytic performance.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的掺杂改变了表面化学性质，破坏了化学键。这导致催化活性增强，通过创建新的活性位点或修改现有位点来实现。活性中心的性质和位置受到添加掺杂物的类型和数量的影响。这可以改善工业相关反应，通过提高反应速率、提高选择性或降低能耗。给出的具体例子涉及到钯（Pd）和金（Au）在二氧化硅薄膜上的沉积，其中二氧化碳（CO）的吸附受到二氧化硅薄膜结构的影响。在O-poor薄膜上，CO无法与Pd结合，在O-rich薄膜上，CO与Pd结合强烈，促进其逃脱和聚集，证明了薄膜结构如何影响催化性能。
