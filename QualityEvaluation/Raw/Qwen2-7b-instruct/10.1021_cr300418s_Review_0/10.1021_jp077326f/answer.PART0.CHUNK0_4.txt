<p>The adsorption of Au and Pd atoms on thin SiO2 films grown on Mo(112) has been studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and CO adsorption. On the monolayer films, gold forms three-dimensional nanoparticles at temperatures as low as 10 K and does not affect the phonon spectra of the silica films. On the other hand, palladium exhibits structure-dependent behavior. Pd deposition leads to a red-shift of the phonon frequency of the monolayer and not of the multilayer films. The amount of CO that may adsorb on the Pd particles formed on the O-poor monolayer films is much smaller than that on the O-rich films (with an additional O-layer on the Mo surface) and multilayer films.</p>
<p>These experimental findings have been rationalized on the basis of density functional theory calculations showing that the Pd atoms penetrate into the hexagonal rings of the silica network and bind at the SiO2/Mo interface, which in turn depends on the atomic structure of the film. This bonding is very strong on the O-poor films so that Pd is unable to bind CO, while on the O-rich films CO may even pull out the Pd atoms from the interface thus promoting aggregation and particle formation.</p>
<p>The Pd migration into the film has been directly supported by low-temperature STM images.</p>

The adsorption of Au and Pd atoms on thin SiO2 films has been studied using various techniques. Gold tends to form three-dimensional nanoparticles at low temperatures and does not alter the phonon spectra of the silica films. In contrast, palladium shows structure-dependent behavior, causing a red-shift in the phonon frequency of monolayer films. The amount of CO adsorbing on Pd particles on O-poor monolayer films is significantly less compared to O-rich films. Density functional theory calculations indicate that Pd atoms penetrate the silica network and bind at the SiO2/Mo interface, which varies depending on the film's atomic structure. This binding is particularly strong on O-poor films, preventing CO adsorption, whereas on O-rich films, CO can facilitate Pd aggregation. Pd migration into the film is confirmed by low-temperature STM images.

在对生长在Mo(112)上的薄SiO2薄膜上Au和Pd原子的吸附进行了研究，使用了扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、红外反射吸收光谱法和CO吸附等多种技术。金倾向于在较低温度下形成三维纳米颗粒，并不改变硅酸盐薄膜的声子谱。相反，钯表现出结构依赖性行为，在单层薄膜中导致声子频率的红移。O-poor单层薄膜上Pd粒子吸附的CO量远少于O丰富的薄膜。密度泛函理论计算表明，Pd原子渗透到硅酸盐网络并在SiO2/Mo界面处绑定，这取决于薄膜的原子结构。这种绑定在O-poor薄膜上特别强烈，阻止了CO吸附，而在O丰富的薄膜上，CO可以促进Pd聚合。通过低温STM图像证实了Pd迁移进入薄膜。
