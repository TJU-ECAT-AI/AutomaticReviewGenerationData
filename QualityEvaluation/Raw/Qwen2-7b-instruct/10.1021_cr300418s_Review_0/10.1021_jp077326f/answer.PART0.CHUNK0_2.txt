<p>In the past few years the study of ultrathin oxide films grown on metal substrates has attracted the interest of the surface chemistry community because of the discovery that these systems, under particular circumstances, can behave in a different way with respect to the corresponding surfaces of bulk oxides.</p>
<p>While several oxides in the form of thin films have been studied for more than a decade, intense efforts have only recently been directed toward silica.</p>
<p>The possibility of preparing well-defined, crystalline SiO2/Mo(112) films opened new perspectives for the study, interpretation, and theoretical modeling of the deposition of metal atoms and clusters.</p>
<p>The calculations showed, however, that this kind of interstitial gold is quite difficult to form since the barrier for migration into the film amounts to about 0.9 eV.</p>
<p>This means that when the temperature of the substrate is raised, the Au atoms will either desorb from the surface or aggregate to form small particles before diffusion into the film sets in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, palladium exhibits structure-dependent behavior.</p>
<p>Pd deposition leads to a red-shift of the phonon frequency of the monolayer and not of the multilayer films.</p>
<p>The amount of CO that may adsorb on the Pd particles formed on the O-poor monolayer films is much smaller than that on the O-rich films (with an additional O-layer on the Mo surface) and multilayer films.</p>
<p>Theoretical arguments in favor of the continuous hexagonal film have been summarized in a recent comprehensive paper.</p>
<p>The calculations predicted a completely different behavior for Pd.</p>
<p>First, a Pd single atom interacts much stronger than Au with the Si and O atoms of the film, with binding energies of about 0.30.4 eV.</p>
<p>However, more interesting is that the Pd atom can easily penetrate into the film (the barrier is very small, if any) and become bound to the Mo atoms, with a binding energy of 3.30 eV.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, quite different behavior is expected for the Pd and Au atoms deposited onto the SiO2/Mo(112) films.</p>
<p>In contrast, STM images of Pd deposits revealed some randomly located spots, such as six-fold stars, which appear much brighter than the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>No features are present in these images, which could be associated with the Pd atoms located on top of the silica surface.</p>
<p>Therefore, the STM study provides strong evidence for the diffusion of the Pd atoms through the silica film to the SiO2/Mo(112) interface.</p>
<p>To better understand the microscopic aspects of the observed behavior, we have performed DFT calculations on the CO adsorption.</p>
<p>On the O-poor phase, where Pd is strongly bound to the substrate, CO is unbound to Pd (by 0.11 eV).</p>
<p>Even if we assume that a PdCO complex is formed under elevated CO pressures, the barrier to pull the PdCO species out from the hexagonal ring would be very large, approximately 1.7 eV.</p>
<p>This means that on the O-poor surface, CO is unable to bind to the Pd atoms, which are trapped at the interface.</p>
<p>Here CO binds strongly (by 1.04 eV) to Pd atoms located in the cavity.</p>
<p>The formation of a strong PdCO bond weakens the interaction of Pd with the substrate so that the PdCO complex becomes unbound by 0.69 eV and can easily escape from the cavities by overcoming a barrier of 0.23 eV only.</p>
<p>Thus, CO adsorption has a completely different effect on Pd atoms deposited on O-poor or O-rich silica monolayers.</p>

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the interaction of the dopant atoms with the oxide surface and the surrounding metal atoms. This disruption can lead to the formation of new chemical bonds and the creation of active centers on the catalyst surface. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement depend on the type of dopant, its location relative to the active sites, and the degree of modification it introduces. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the ability of the dopant to promote surface reactions, facilitate diffusion of reactants and products, or alter the electronic properties of the surface. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions might include enhanced selectivity, increased reaction rates, or broader applicability of the catalysts to different reaction types.

For instance, in the context of the provided literature, the deposition of Au and Pd atoms on SiO2 films grown on Mo(112) substrates exhibits distinct behaviors. Au atoms interact weakly with the silica surface, allowing for high mobility at low temperatures. In contrast, Pd atoms can easily penetrate into the film and bind strongly to the Mo substrate. This leads to changes in the phonon frequency of the silica films, formation of distinct STM images indicating diffusion of Pd atoms to the interface, and altered CO adsorption behavior. The continuous hexagonal structure of the SiO2/Mo(112) film facilitates Pd migration and binding at the interface, affecting the adsorption properties of the film. These findings suggest that modifying the structure of the metal oxide film can influence the deposition and behavior of dopants, potentially enhancing their catalytic activity in specific reactions.

The DFT calculations provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding mechanisms involved in the deposition and adsorption processes. They predict that Au atoms bind weakly to the O-poor film, preventing CO adsorption, while Pd atoms can bind strongly to the O-rich film, facilitating CO adsorption and potentially enabling aggregation. These theoretical predictions align with the experimental observations and offer guidance for designing catalysts with tailored surface properties for improved catalytic performance.

In summary, substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry by altering the interactions between dopants and the oxide surface. This can lead to the creation of active centers with unique properties, enhancing catalytic activity in specific reactions. The location and nature of these active centers are influenced by factors such as dopant location, bonding strength, and electronic effects. The insights gained from studying dopant behavior on model systems like the SiO2/Mo(112) films can inform the design of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂离子取代改变了表面化学性质，通过改变掺杂原子与氧化物表面及其周围金属原子的相互作用，从而影响催化活性。这种改变可能引发新的化学键形成和表面活性中心的产生。对催化活性增强的影响取决于掺杂剂的类型、其相对于活性位点的位置以及引入的修改程度。活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂剂促进表面反应、促进反应物和产物扩散或改变表面电子性质的能力的影响。

例如，在提供的文献中，金(Au)和钯(Pd)原子沉积在生长于Mo(112)基底上的SiO2薄膜上表现出不同的行为。Au原子与二氧化硅表面的相互作用较弱，允许低温下的高移动性。相反，Pd原子可以轻松渗透到薄膜中，并与Mo原子形成强烈的键合。这导致了硅酸盐薄膜的声子频率变化，形成了独特的扫描隧道显微镜图像，表明Pd原子向界面的扩散，以及CO吸附行为的变化。连续的六边形结构的SiO2/Mo(112)薄膜促进了Pd原子向界面的迁移，影响了薄膜的吸附特性。这些发现表明，通过修改金属氧化物薄膜的结构，可以影响掺杂物的沉积和行为，从而提高特定反应的催化活性。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提供了关于掺杂物在沉积和吸附过程中的电子结构和键合机制的见解。它们预测，Au原子与O-poor薄膜的弱键合阻止了CO吸附，而Pd原子与O-rich薄膜的强键合则有利于CO吸附，并有可能促进聚集。这些理论预测与实验观察相吻合，并为设计具有定制表面性质以提高工业应用中催化剂性能的催化剂提供了指导。

综上所述，金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂离子取代可以显著改变表面化学性质，通过改变掺杂剂与氧化物表面的相互作用。这可能导致活性中心的生成，具有独特的性质，从而增强特定反应的催化活性。活性中心的位置和性质受因素如掺杂剂位置、键合强度和电子效应的影响。从研究掺杂物在模型系统如SiO2/Mo(112)薄膜上的行为中获得的见解可指导设计更高效的催化剂。
