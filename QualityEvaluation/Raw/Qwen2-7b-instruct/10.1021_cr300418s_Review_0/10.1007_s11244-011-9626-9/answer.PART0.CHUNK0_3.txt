[1] "We review our approach to model heterogeneous catalysts on the basis of four examples."
[2] "It is shown that Pd nanoparticles in hydrogenation incorporate hydrogen which turns out to be crucial for the actual hydrogenation step."
[3] "For Pd on alumina it was even possible to resolve the atomic structure of the facets."
[4] "Due to the considerably higher flexibility of the lattice of the small particle as compared to a single crystal the interior of the particle actively participates in reactions and, in particular, in hydrogenation reactions by hydrogen accommodation at conditions different from the bulk material."
[5] "The second example is concerned with the reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material."
[6] "In a combined experimental and theoretical effort together with Joachim Sauers group we have studied those systems using the described model catalyst approach."
[7] "We have studied alumina, silica, and ceria as supports for vanadia deposits prepared by physical vapor deposition in an oxygen ambient."
[8] "Briefly, vanadia grows as 3-dimensional clusters, both, on alumina and silica from low to high coverage."
[9] "On the other hand, the hydrogenation depends on hydrogen pressure, i.e. hydrogen concentration in the particle."
[10] "Obviously, such species are more reactive, and this observation can be well explained by theoretical models describing the elementary steps involved."
[11] "In order to analyze the situation with the help of simple physical models one has to consider, for example, the physical quantities that determine electron transfer from the metal substrate through the film."
[12] "However, this is only part of a proper description, because it is not obvious how the quantity would depend on thickness of the film, as the energy balance will only weakly depend on it for very thin films!"
[13] "The reason is connected with the increased lattice flexibility of very thin films which is altered very rapidly as the film gets thicker, approaching quickly the phonon behavior of the bulk or a bulk terminating surface."
[14] "One may use this knowledge to choose combinations of materials in thin oxide film design to produce systems with specific electronic properties with respect to electron transfer, which may in turn lead to specific chemical reactivity."
[15] "As stated above, clusters of varying sizes were systematically studied."
[16] "Au1Au7 clusters, which are mainly linear and cluster with sizes between Au10 and Au20, which are two-dimensional, have been imaged."
[17] "Those images may well be simulated by calculations of 2-dimensional Au islands containing edges and kinks."
[18] "Figure 6a shows an STM image of this system after heating it to 850 K."
[19] "Moreover, atomically resolved images reveal corrugation that does not stem from Pt but rather from a well ordered double-layer FeO(111) film, well described and characterized in the literature."
[20] "Its structure has been studied in detail and characterized at the atomic level."
[21] "The 10% misfit between the FeO(111) lattice constant and that of Pt(111) gives rise to a typical Moir pattern in the STM image."
[22] "The situation changes, however, dramatically if one tests the system with respect to CO oxidation at ambient conditions (1 atm) in a reactor."
[23] "If one ramps the temperature linear with 1 K per minute from 300 to 455 K, CO oxidation ignites at 410 K (see Fig. 6b)."
[24] "The interesting observation is that this FeO/Pt(111) system at this temperature is by more than an order of magnitude more reactive than clean platinum."
[25] "Usually, SMSI leads to an attenuated activity while here we observe a strong enhancement!"
[26] "The scenario is depicted in Fig. 6c."
[27] "The middle panel in Fig. 6c shows an STM image of such a trilayer formed in situ at elevated O2 pressure in a microscope."
[28] "Nevertheless, if the trilayer is exposed to carbon monoxide the trilayer oxidizes the incoming CO to CO2 via an EleyRideal mechanism leaving behind an oxygen vacancy in the film."
[29] "Experimentally, we have confirmed [66] that the iron oxide film dewets the Pt(111) surface under CO poor reaction conditions by forming small iron oxide particles, leaving Pt(111) surface under open which then determines the reactivity of the systems."
[30] "Heating the dewetted surface in vacuum again leads to the formation of the FeO double layer, which then, at higher oxygen pressure, may be transformed into the trilayer again."
[31] "Closer inspection reveals that this concept has been used in the late forties by Cabrera and Mott [67] to understand metal oxidation and in the fifties and sixties by F. Volkenshtein to explain catalytic activity [68]."
[32] "It was eventually forgotten and not followed up, probably because tools to study systematically such systems at the atomic level were not yet available."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. **Surface Chemistry Modification**: Doping introduces foreign atoms that alter the electronic structure and bonding patterns on the surface of metal oxides. This can lead to changes in surface reactivity, such as adsorption energies and reaction pathways.

2. **Disruption of Chemical Bonding**: The introduction of dopants can create new types of bonds or modify existing ones, affecting the stability and reactivity of the surface. For instance, dopants can lead to the formation of new compounds or phases on the surface.

3. **Enhancement of Catalytic Activity**: By modifying the surface chemistry and bonding, doping can enhance the catalytic activity of metal oxides. This is particularly evident in the examples provided, where specific dopants (like vanadia, FeO, and Au) lead to increased reactivity in reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and CO oxidation.

4. **Location of Active Centers**: The location of active centers on the catalyst surface can be influenced by doping. In the case of Pd nanoparticles, the interior of the particle becomes an active center due to the hydrogen accommodation, which is crucial for hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, the vanadia-supported systems exhibit enhanced activity for methanol oxidation.

5. **Improvement in Industrially Relevant Reactions**: Doped metal oxides can lead to improved performance in industrial processes. For example, the FeO/Pt(111) system shows a significant increase in reactivity under CO oxidation conditions, which could potentially improve the efficiency of industrial reactions.

Answering the question requires understanding that substitutional cation doping modifies the electronic structure and bonding of metal oxides, leading to changes in surface chemistry. This modification can enhance catalytic activity, alter the location of active centers, and improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. The examples provided demonstrate the impact of doping on catalytic systems, showing increased reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenation, oxidation, and CO oxidation processes.
