[1] "In order to trace results observed on real catalysts it is important to capture some of the complexity of the real system. In the present case it is the size of the metal particle and the presence of the support that is important to understand the elementary processes involved."
[2] "The second example is concerned with the reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material."
[3] "Ultrathin films where we have to consider interaction between the adsorbate on the thin film and the oxide metal support interface."
[4] "Strong Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) observed with particular catalyst systems, in which metal particles (such as Pd and Pt) are strongly interacting with a reducible support (such as Titania), and are covered by a thin oxide film upon heating to elevated temperature."

1. The size of the metal particle and the presence of the support are crucial factors to understand the elementary processes involved in real catalyst systems, particularly when modeling heterogeneous catalysts.

2. The reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material, such as vanadia on ceria, plays a significant role in enhancing the activity of catalysts for specific reactions.

3. Interactions between adsorbates on ultrathin films and the oxide metal support interface can significantly impact the electronic properties of the catalyst and thus its chemical reactivity.

4. Strong Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) in catalyst systems, especially when metal particles like Pd and Pt are covered by a thin oxide film on reducible supports like titania, can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity due to reduced adsorption capacity.

1. 在实际催化剂系统中，金属颗粒的大小和存在的支撑物是理解基本过程的关键因素，特别是对于模拟异相催化剂时。

2. 氧化物纳米粒子（如氧化钒）在另一种氧化物材料（如氧化铈）上的活性对提高特定反应的催化剂活性至关重要。

3. 薄膜上的吸附剂与氧化物金属支持界面之间的相互作用可以显著影响催化剂的电子性质及其化学活性。

4. 特别是在可还原支撑物（如二氧化钛）上覆盖薄氧化物薄膜的金属颗粒（如钯和铂）表现出强烈的强金属支撑相互作用（SMSI），可能导致催化活性降低，主要是由于吸附能力减弱。
