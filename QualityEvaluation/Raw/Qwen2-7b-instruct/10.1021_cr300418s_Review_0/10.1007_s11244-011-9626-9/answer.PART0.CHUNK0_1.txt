[1] "The second example is concerned with the reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material. It is an established concept among catalyst scientists that so called monolayer catalysts, where a reactive oxide, such as vanadia, is supported on a second oxide, such as ceria, exhibits considerably higher activity for methanol oxidation towards formaldehyde."
[2] "The ceria support was grown as a thin film (thick enough to represent the bulk) [42] on a Ru(0001) single crystal surface according to a recipe by Mullins et al. [43] and modified in our group."
[3] "On the other hand, the hydrogenation depends on hydrogen pressure, i.e. hydrogen concentration in the particle. This, clearly, demonstrates the importance of this species for the hydrogenation channel."
[4] "We have studied such samples with respect to methanol oxidation to formaldehyde using temperature programmed reaction (TPR). The outcome is interesting but will only be briefly mentioned here [40, 41]:"
[5] "Obviously, such species are more reactive, and this observation can be well explained by theoretical models describing the elementary steps involved."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of the dopant atoms. This modification can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the existing ones. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type of dopant and its interaction with the host oxide. These changes can potentially improve industrially relevant reactions by providing more efficient pathways for the desired chemical transformations. The enhanced activity is attributed to the modification of surface chemistry, which can facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants, and the promotion of product desorption, thus optimizing the overall catalytic performance.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂的替换阳离子通过改变掺杂原子的电子结构和配位环境，修改了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这种修改可能导致催化活性增强，通过创建新的活性中心或修改现有中心。活性中心的性质和位置受掺杂物类型及其与宿主氧化物的相互作用的影响。这些变化有可能通过提供更高效的反应路径来改善工业相关反应，优化整体催化性能。增强的活性归因于表面化学性质的修改，这可以促进反应物的吸附和活化，并促进产物的脱附。
