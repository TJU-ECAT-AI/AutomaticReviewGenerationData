1. The interior of Pd nanoparticles in hydrogenation incorporates hydrogen, which is crucial for the actual hydrogenation step. This contrasts with Pd(111) single crystals, where hydrogenation activity is less sustained.

2. On Pd nanoparticles, the presence of carbonaceous species enhances hydrogen diffusivity, promoting hydrogenation. These species are not observed in the same manner on Pd(111) single crystals.

3. Carbonaceous species on the surface of Pd nanoparticles are vital for the hydrogenation process, as they facilitate hydrogen movement to the sub-surface region, enabling hydrogenation reactions.

4. In the case of vanadia monolayer catalysts on ceria, the vibrational spectra can be accurately assigned, providing insights into the structure and reactivity of the catalyst.

5. The transient \( \text{O}_{2}{{2{ - } }} \) molecule and the formation of a local OFeO trilayer upon oxygen interaction with the FeO/Pt(111) system are responsible for its enhanced reactivity compared to clean Pt.

1. Pd纳米粒子中的氢化反应内部积极参与，特别是在与块材材料不同的条件下，通过氢吸附进行氢化反应。

2. 在Pd单晶（111）和Pd纳米粒子上氢化2-顺丁烯的比较中，只有纳米粒子显示持续的催化活性。表面的碳化合物物种增强了金属中的氢扩散，从而促进了氢化反应。

3. Pd纳米粒子表面的碳化合物物种对于氢化反应至关重要，因为它们促进氢从表面到金属亚表面区域的扩散，从而导致氢化反应的发生。

4. 对于在氧化铈上的氧化钒单层催化剂，在氧化铈上，支持的氧化钒沉积物的振动谱可以重新分配并与光谱数据相关联，揭示了氧化钒物种形成和簇生长模式的见解。

5. 氧与FeO/Pt(111)系统上的FeO双层相互作用形成的瞬态 \( \text{O}_{2}{{2{ - } }} \) 分子以及随后形成的局部OFeO三层是该系统增强活性的原因。
