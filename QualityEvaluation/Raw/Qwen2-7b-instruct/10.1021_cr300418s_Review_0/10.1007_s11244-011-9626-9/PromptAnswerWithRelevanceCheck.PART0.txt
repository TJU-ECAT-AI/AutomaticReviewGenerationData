[1] "The present paper centers around this question and we will show, by virtue of four examples, how the phenomena addressed express themselves."
[2] "One, where the goal is to represent a disperse supported metal or a mixed oxide catalyst. Both are shown on the left hand side and are based on the ability to model the bulk or volume of a supporting oxide using thin film techniques."
[3] "This is on one hand the ionization potential to excite an electron from the metal oxide, which is, in general, not simply the work function of the metal, because it will be substantially modified by the presence of the oxide overlayer."
[4] "Obviously, thin oxide films can be used as spacers to grow ideally flat metal-insulator structures at smallest dimensions."
[5] "Moreover, atomically resolved images reveal corrugation that does not stem from Pt but rather from a well ordered double-layer FeO(111) film, well described and characterized in the literature."
[6] "Closer inspection reveals that this concept has been used in the late forties by Cabrera and Mott to understand metal oxidation and in the fifties and sixties by F. Volkenshtein to explain catalytic activity."

To address the question of how substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, and the implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions, the document provides several insights. 

Firstly, the goal of modeling disperse supported metals or mixed oxide catalysts involves representing the bulk or volume of a supporting oxide using thin film techniques. This approach enables capturing the complexity of technologically employed disperse metal catalysts while applying the toolbox of surface science for atomic-level studies.

Secondly, the document highlights that the ionization potential for exciting an electron from the metal oxide is generally not equal to the work function of the metal. This potential is modified by the presence of the oxide overlayer, affecting electron transfer dynamics.

Thirdly, the utilization of thin oxide films as spacers facilitates the growth of ideally flat metal-insulator structures at minimal dimensions. This technique offers a means to study surface chemistry at the atomic level.

Fourthly, atomically resolved images demonstrate that the corrugation observed is not due to the Pt layer but originates from a well-ordered double-layer FeO(111) film. This finding underscores the importance of understanding the atomic structure of the catalyst surface for optimizing catalytic performance.

Lastly, the document references historical concepts from the late 1940s to the early 1960s that have been revisited in the context of modern catalysis. These concepts, initially developed by Cabrera and Mott and later expanded by Volkenshtein, relate to electron transfer and its role in catalytic activity. By leveraging these principles, researchers can design catalysts that favor specific electron transfer pathways for enhanced reactivity in industrially relevant reactions.

要回答关于掺杂金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学和化学键破坏如何改变，以及对催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置、以及工业相关反应改进的潜在影响的问题，文档提供了几个见解。

首先，建模分散支持金属或混合氧化物催化剂的目标在于使用薄膜技术表示支持氧化物的体积或整体。这种方法允许捕捉技术上使用的分散金属催化剂的复杂性，并通过表面科学工具进行原子级研究。

其次，文档强调了激发电子从金属氧化物所需的电离势通常不等于金属的工作函数。这个势能由氧化物覆盖层的存在显著修改，影响电子传输动态。

第三，利用薄氧化物薄膜作为间隔物可促进最小尺寸下理想平坦的金属绝缘结构生长。这项技术为在原子水平上研究表面化学提供了一种方法。

第四，原子分辨率图像显示，观察到的波纹并非来自铂层，而是来自有序双层FeO(111)薄膜。这一发现强调了理解催化剂表面的原子结构对于优化催化性能的重要性。

最后，文档引用了从1940年代后期到1960年代初的几个概念，这些概念已被重新审视并应用于现代催化作用。这些概念最初由Cabrera和Mott开发，并在1950年代和1960年代由Volkenshtein扩展，涉及电子转移及其在催化活性中的作用。通过利用这些原理，研究人员可以设计出有利于特定电子传输途径的催化剂，以增强工业相关反应的活性。

[1] "The second example is concerned with the reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material. It is an established concept among catalyst scientists that so called monolayer catalysts, where a reactive oxide, such as vanadia, is supported on a second oxide, such as ceria, exhibits considerably higher activity for methanol oxidation towards formaldehyde."
[2] "The ceria support was grown as a thin film (thick enough to represent the bulk) [42] on a Ru(0001) single crystal surface according to a recipe by Mullins et al. [43] and modified in our group."
[3] "On the other hand, the hydrogenation depends on hydrogen pressure, i.e. hydrogen concentration in the particle. This, clearly, demonstrates the importance of this species for the hydrogenation channel."
[4] "We have studied such samples with respect to methanol oxidation to formaldehyde using temperature programmed reaction (TPR). The outcome is interesting but will only be briefly mentioned here [40, 41]:"
[5] "Obviously, such species are more reactive, and this observation can be well explained by theoretical models describing the elementary steps involved."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of the dopant atoms. This modification can lead to enhanced catalytic activity by creating new active sites or modifying the existing ones. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the type of dopant and its interaction with the host oxide. These changes can potentially improve industrially relevant reactions by providing more efficient pathways for the desired chemical transformations. The enhanced activity is attributed to the modification of surface chemistry, which can facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants, and the promotion of product desorption, thus optimizing the overall catalytic performance.

[1] "We review our approach to model heterogeneous catalysts on the basis of four examples."
[2] "It is shown that Pd nanoparticles in hydrogenation incorporate hydrogen which turns out to be crucial for the actual hydrogenation step."
[3] "For Pd on alumina it was even possible to resolve the atomic structure of the facets."
[4] "Due to the considerably higher flexibility of the lattice of the small particle as compared to a single crystal the interior of the particle actively participates in reactions and, in particular, in hydrogenation reactions by hydrogen accommodation at conditions different from the bulk material."
[5] "The second example is concerned with the reactivity of oxide nanoparticles supported by another oxide material."
[6] "In a combined experimental and theoretical effort together with Joachim Sauers group we have studied those systems using the described model catalyst approach."
[7] "We have studied alumina, silica, and ceria as supports for vanadia deposits prepared by physical vapor deposition in an oxygen ambient."
[8] "Briefly, vanadia grows as 3-dimensional clusters, both, on alumina and silica from low to high coverage."
[9] "On the other hand, the hydrogenation depends on hydrogen pressure, i.e. hydrogen concentration in the particle."
[10] "Obviously, such species are more reactive, and this observation can be well explained by theoretical models describing the elementary steps involved."
[11] "In order to analyze the situation with the help of simple physical models one has to consider, for example, the physical quantities that determine electron transfer from the metal substrate through the film."
[12] "However, this is only part of a proper description, because it is not obvious how the quantity would depend on thickness of the film, as the energy balance will only weakly depend on it for very thin films!"
[13] "The reason is connected with the increased lattice flexibility of very thin films which is altered very rapidly as the film gets thicker, approaching quickly the phonon behavior of the bulk or a bulk terminating surface."
[14] "One may use this knowledge to choose combinations of materials in thin oxide film design to produce systems with specific electronic properties with respect to electron transfer, which may in turn lead to specific chemical reactivity."
[15] "As stated above, clusters of varying sizes were systematically studied."
[16] "Au1Au7 clusters, which are mainly linear and cluster with sizes between Au10 and Au20, which are two-dimensional, have been imaged."
[17] "Those images may well be simulated by calculations of 2-dimensional Au islands containing edges and kinks."
[18] "Figure 6a shows an STM image of this system after heating it to 850 K."
[19] "Moreover, atomically resolved images reveal corrugation that does not stem from Pt but rather from a well ordered double-layer FeO(111) film, well described and characterized in the literature."
[20] "Its structure has been studied in detail and characterized at the atomic level."
[21] "The 10% misfit between the FeO(111) lattice constant and that of Pt(111) gives rise to a typical Moir pattern in the STM image."
[22] "The situation changes, however, dramatically if one tests the system with respect to CO oxidation at ambient conditions (1 atm) in a reactor."
[23] "If one ramps the temperature linear with 1 K per minute from 300 to 455 K, CO oxidation ignites at 410 K (see Fig. 6b)."
[24] "The interesting observation is that this FeO/Pt(111) system at this temperature is by more than an order of magnitude more reactive than clean platinum."
[25] "Usually, SMSI leads to an attenuated activity while here we observe a strong enhancement!"
[26] "The scenario is depicted in Fig. 6c."
[27] "The middle panel in Fig. 6c shows an STM image of such a trilayer formed in situ at elevated O2 pressure in a microscope."
[28] "Nevertheless, if the trilayer is exposed to carbon monoxide the trilayer oxidizes the incoming CO to CO2 via an EleyRideal mechanism leaving behind an oxygen vacancy in the film."
[29] "Experimentally, we have confirmed [66] that the iron oxide film dewets the Pt(111) surface under CO poor reaction conditions by forming small iron oxide particles, leaving Pt(111) surface under open which then determines the reactivity of the systems."
[30] "Heating the dewetted surface in vacuum again leads to the formation of the FeO double layer, which then, at higher oxygen pressure, may be transformed into the trilayer again."
[31] "Closer inspection reveals that this concept has been used in the late forties by Cabrera and Mott [67] to understand metal oxidation and in the fifties and sixties by F. Volkenshtein to explain catalytic activity [68]."
[32] "It was eventually forgotten and not followed up, probably because tools to study systematically such systems at the atomic level were not yet available."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. **Surface Chemistry Modification**: Doping introduces foreign atoms that alter the electronic structure and bonding patterns on the surface of metal oxides. This can lead to changes in surface reactivity, such as adsorption energies and reaction pathways.

2. **Disruption of Chemical Bonding**: The introduction of dopants can create new types of bonds or modify existing ones, affecting the stability and reactivity of the surface. For instance, dopants can lead to the formation of new compounds or phases on the surface.

3. **Enhancement of Catalytic Activity**: By modifying the surface chemistry and bonding, doping can enhance the catalytic activity of metal oxides. This is particularly evident in the examples provided, where specific dopants (like vanadia, FeO, and Au) lead to increased reactivity in reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and CO oxidation.

4. **Location of Active Centers**: The location of active centers on the catalyst surface can be influenced by doping. In the case of Pd nanoparticles, the interior of the particle becomes an active center due to the hydrogen accommodation, which is crucial for hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, the vanadia-supported systems exhibit enhanced activity for methanol oxidation.

5. **Improvement in Industrially Relevant Reactions**: Doped metal oxides can lead to improved performance in industrial processes. For example, the FeO/Pt(111) system shows a significant increase in reactivity under CO oxidation conditions, which could potentially improve the efficiency of industrial reactions.

Answering the question requires understanding that substitutional cation doping modifies the electronic structure and bonding of metal oxides, leading to changes in surface chemistry. This modification can enhance catalytic activity, alter the location of active centers, and improve the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions. The examples provided demonstrate the impact of doping on catalytic systems, showing increased reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenation, oxidation, and CO oxidation processes.
