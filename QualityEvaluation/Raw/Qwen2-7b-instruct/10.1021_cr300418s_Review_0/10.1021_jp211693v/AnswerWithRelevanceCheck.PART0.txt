          [1] "Our calculations show that the exothermicity of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base."
          [2] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
          [3] "Finally, we show that the presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by turning the surface into either a Lewis acid or a base, depending on the dopant used. This disruption of chemical bonding leads to enhanced catalytic activity, influences the nature and location of active centers, and potentially improves industrially relevant reactions like the activation of alkanes and oxyhalogenation processes.

          金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂通过将表面转化为Lewis酸或碱，具体取决于掺杂物，从而改变表面化学性质。这种对化学键的破坏可以增强催化活性，影响活性中心的性质和位置，并可能改善工业相关反应，如烷烃活化和氧卤化过程。

          [1] "Halogen atoms (formed by dissociative adsorption) can function as a Lewis acid-base pair."
          [2] "The interaction between Lewis acids and bases, through the surface, is very strong."
          [3] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid."
          [4] "Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base."
          [5] "Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."
          [6] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

          Halogen atoms formed through dissociative adsorption can act as a Lewis acid-base pair. The interaction between Lewis acids and bases on the surface is strong. Adsorbing a hydrogen atom to form a hydroxyl makes it act as a Lewis base, forcing a halogen atom to bind as a Lewis acid. Doping the surface with lanthanum (La) turns it into a Lewis acid, making the halogen atom bind to the oxygen site, which is a Lewis base. On the other hand, doping with tantalum (Ta) creates a strong Lewis base surface, which forces the halogen atom to bind as a Lewis acid on a different site. Halogenated surfaces may facilitate the breaking of the CH bond in methane more efficiently than clean oxide surfaces.

          溶剂化的卤素原子可以充当Lewis酸碱对。表面的Lewis酸与碱之间的相互作用很强。吸附一个氢原子形成一个羟基使其作为Lewis碱，迫使卤素原子结合为Lewis酸。添加镧（La）作为掺杂剂将表面转化为Lewis酸，使卤素原子绑定到氧位，该位是一个Lewis碱。相反，添加钽（Ta）会产生一个强大的Lewis碱表面，迫使卤素原子在不同的位点作为Lewis酸绑定。含卤素的表面可能比清洁氧化物表面更易于断裂甲烷中的CH键。
