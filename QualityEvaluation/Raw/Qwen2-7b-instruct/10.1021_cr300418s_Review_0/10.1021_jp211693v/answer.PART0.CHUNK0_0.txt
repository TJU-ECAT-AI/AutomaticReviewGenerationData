[1] "Our calculations show that the exothermicity of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base."
[2] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
[3] "Finally, we show that the presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by turning the surface into either a Lewis acid or a base, depending on the dopant used. This disruption of chemical bonding leads to enhanced catalytic activity. For instance, doping can facilitate the breaking of the CH bond in methane by creating conditions that are more conducive to chemical reactions. Additionally, the nature and location of active centers on the catalyst surface are influenced by such doping, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂通过将表面转化为Lewis酸或碱，从而改变表面化学性质。这种对化学键的破坏可以增强催化活性。例如，掺杂可以促进甲烷中CH键的断裂，因为这为化学反应创造了更有利的条件。此外，催化剂表面的活性中心的性质和位置也受到掺杂的影响，可能提高了工业相关反应的效率。
