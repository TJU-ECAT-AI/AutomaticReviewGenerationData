[1] "Numerous papers have pointed out that adding halogens to an oxide surface often (but not always) improves the catalytic activity of the oxide toward alkane activation."
[2] "Halogenated oxide surfaces are also of interest in oxyhalogenation reactions,210 and in the destruction of unwanted halogenated side products.7,1118"
[3] "Our calculations show that the exothermicity of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base."
[4] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
[5] "The presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane."
[6] "We have seen similar behavior in the coadsorption of a Lewis acid with a Lewis base on rutile TiO2(110).19"
[7] "The acidity of the surface discourages the adsorption of another acid."
[8] "On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."
[9] "A Cl atom could bind on the CeO2(111) surface either on top of an oxygen atom or on top of a Ce atom."
[10] "The energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 + CeO2 (ClO)/ CeO2 is +0.24 eV (see Tables 1 and 2)."
[11] "The BV of Cl (in ClO) is 0.15 electron."
[12] "The BV on the oxygen atom in the ClO group is 0.91 electron."
[13] "Replacing an O atom with a ClO group does create an excess of electrons in the rest of the doped oxide as compared to the case in which no Cl atom is adsorbed."
[14] "The energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 + CeO2(111) (ClCe)/ CeO2(111) is +0.18 eV (Table 1)."
[15] "The BV of Cl in ClCe is 0.33 electron."
[16] "The fact that the Cl atom in the ClCe group is a Lewis acid and the Cl atom in the ClO group is a Lewis base plays an important role in what follows."
[17] "Because there are two adsorption sites for each Cl atom, there are three pairs of binding sites when a Cl2 molecule adsorbs dissociatively."
[18] "The energy of the reaction:+ Cl CeO (111) (Cl Ce, Cl O)/CeO (111) 2 2 2 has the highest dissociative adsorption energy, equal to ΔEad = 0.58 eV (see Table 1)."
[19] "When Cl adsorbs alone on O, the chlorine atom loses charge and a Ce4+ ion is reduced; Ce4+ is a Lewis acid, and it forces the Cl atom to behave like a Lewis base."
[20] "Clearly, the presence of the La dopant increases dramatically the binding energy of the Cl atom and also guides the atom to bind to an oxygen site where it functions as a Lewis base."
[21] "The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + CeO2(111) H/CeO2(111) is 1.24 eV (Table 3)."

[23] "In the final state, Cl adsorbs on the O atom and is a Lewis base; the BV for the Cl atom is 0.11 electron."
[24] "The presence of H, which is a Lewis base, induces the Cl atom to act as a Lewis acid, increases the binding energy of Cl, and dictates the binding site (Cl binds to Ce not to O)."
[25] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid."
[26] "Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base."
[27] "Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."
[28] "Halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by changing the surface properties such as acidity and basicity. This modification influences the nature and location of active centers, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. For example, doping with lanthanum (La) transforms the surface into a stronger Lewis acid, which attracts chloride (Cl) atoms to bind as Lewis bases rather than acids. Similarly, tantalum (Ta) doping makes the surface a stronger Lewis base, forcing Cl to bind as Lewis acids. These changes facilitate the breaking of the CH bond in methane, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions like alkane activation and oxyhalogenation processes.

2. The implications of substitutional cation doping on catalytic activity enhancement involve altering the electronic structure of the metal oxide surface. By tuning the surface chemistry, the reactivity towards specific reactants and products can be optimized. For instance, doping with lanthanum (La) can increase the binding energy of chloride (Cl) atoms by turning the surface into a Lewis acid, which attracts Cl to bind as Lewis bases. This leads to a more favorable environment for reactions involving chloride, such as oxyhalogenation of alkanes. Similarly, doping with tantalum (Ta) creates a stronger Lewis base surface, which attracts Cl to bind as Lewis acids, potentially facilitating the breaking of the CH bond in methane more efficiently than on an undoped surface.

3. The nature and location of active centers on metal oxide catalysts are significantly influenced by substitutional cation doping. Doping introduces new functionalities to the surface, such as increased Lewis acidity or basicity, which dictate where and how adsorbates like chloride (Cl) and hydrogen (H) can bind. For example, doping with lanthanum (La) enhances the Lewis acidity of the surface, promoting the adsorption of Cl as a Lewis base rather than an acid. Conversely, doping with tantalum (Ta) creates a surface that acts as a stronger Lewis base, forcing Cl to bind as a Lewis acid. These changes in the active center's characteristics enable more efficient catalysis, particularly in reactions involving the breaking of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds in methane, leading to improved performance in industrial applications such as alkane activation and oxyhalogenation.

4. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions, such as alkane activation and oxyhalogenation, are achieved through the strategic doping of metal oxide catalysts. By modifying the surface properties to enhance the Lewis acidity or basicity, the reactivity of the catalyst towards specific reactants and products is optimized. For example, doping with lanthanum (La) creates a surface that attracts chloride (Cl) as a Lewis base, which can facilitate the activation of alkanes more effectively. Similarly, doping with tantalum (Ta) enhances the Lewis basicity of the surface, promoting the adsorption of Cl as a Lewis acid, which can aid in the breaking of the CH bond in methane. These modifications lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency, enabling more selective and productive reactions in industrial processes.
