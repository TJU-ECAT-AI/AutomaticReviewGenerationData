[1] "Halogen atoms (formed by dissociative adsorption) can function as a Lewis acid-base pair."
[2] "The interaction between Lewis acids and bases, through the surface, is very strong."
[3] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid."
[4] "Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base."
[5] "Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."
[6] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Halogen atoms can act as a Lewis acid-base pair when dissociatively adsorbed on a surface.
2. The interaction between Lewis acids and bases on a surface is very strong.
3. A hydrogen atom acting as a Lewis base forces a halogen atom to bind as a Lewis acid.
4. Adding lanthanum (La) as a dopant turns the surface into a Lewis acid, influencing halogen binding.
5. Tantalum (Ta) doping creates a strong Lewis base, altering halogen binding sites.
6. Halogenated surfaces might facilitate the breaking of the CH bond in methane more efficiently than clean oxide surfaces.
