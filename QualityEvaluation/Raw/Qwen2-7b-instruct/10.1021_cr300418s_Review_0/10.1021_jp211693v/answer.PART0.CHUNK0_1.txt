[1] "Our calculations show that the exothermicity of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base."
[2] "The presence of a hydroxyl (a Lewis base) forces the halogen to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid, and stabilizes considerably the bond of the halogen to the oxide."
[3] "The presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane."
[4] "A halogen atom can adsorb on ceria on either an oxygen site (we denote the system formed in this way by (XO/CeO2(111)) or a Ce site (denoted (XCe)/ CeO2(111))."
[5] "However, the reaction X2 + CeO2(111) (XO, XCe)/CeO2(111), in which one X formed by dissociation binds on O and the other X binds on Ce, is exoergic."
[6] "Clearly, the presence of the La dopant increases dramatically the binding energy of the Cl atom and also guides the atom to bind to an oxygen site where it functions as a Lewis base."
[7] "Because the H atom is a Lewis base and Cl can function as a Lewis acid, the presence of the halogen will cause the H atom to bind more strongly and therefore shifts the reaction energy favorably."
[8] "This happens because La-doped CeO2(111) is a much stronger Lewis acid then (ClCe)/CeO2(111)."

1. Adsorbed Lewis acids and Lewis bases interact strongly, and this interaction can be used to manipulate the chemistry of the surface. By doping metal oxide catalysts with substitutional cations, the surface chemistry and bonding nature can be modified, leading to enhanced catalytic activity, altered location and nature of active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

2. Substitutional cation doping changes the surface's Lewis acidity or basicity. For example, doping with La turns the surface into a stronger Lewis acid, while doping with Ta makes the surface a stronger Lewis base. This influences how Lewis acids and bases interact on the surface.

3. Halogenated surfaces facilitate the breaking of the CH bond in methane more efficiently than clean oxide surfaces due to the enhanced interaction between Lewis acids and bases present on the surface.

4. A halogen atom can adsorb onto a ceria surface either on an oxygen site or a Ce site. The energy of adsorption is influenced by the nature of the adsorption site.

5. The interaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base on the surface is exothermic, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the surface.

6. The presence of a hydroxyl group on the surface as a Lewis base encourages the halogen to bind as a Lewis acid, stabilizing the bond significantly.

7. Halogens on the oxide surface promote the breaking of the C-H bond in methane, indicating the role of these elements in catalysis.

8. The La-doped ceria surface, being a stronger Lewis acid, increases the binding energy of halogen atoms and guides them to bind as Lewis bases, affecting the surface's catalytic activity.

1. 吸附的路易斯酸和路易斯碱在表面上强烈相互作用，这种相互作用可以用来操纵表面化学。通过掺杂金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子，可以改变表面化学和键合性质，从而增强催化活性、调整活性中心的性质和位置，并改善工业相关反应。

2. 掺杂改变了表面的路易斯酸性或碱性。例如，使用La掺杂会使表面成为更强的路易斯酸，而使用Ta掺杂会使表面成为更强的路易斯碱。这影响了表面的Lewis酸和碱之间的相互作用方式。

3. 含卤素的表面比干净的氧化物表面更有利于甲烷分子中C-H键的断裂，因为表面存在增强的Lewis酸碱相互作用。

4. 卤素原子可以在铈氧化物表面上吸附在氧位或Ce位上。吸附能受到吸附部位性质的影响。

5. 表面上Lewis酸与Lewis碱之间的相互作用是放热的，增强了表面的稳定性和反应性。

6. 表面的羟基（作为Lewis碱）的存在鼓励卤素以Lewis酸的形式结合，显著稳定了键。

7. 氧化物表面的卤素促进甲烷分子中C-H键的断裂，表明这些元素在催化中的作用。

8. La掺杂的铈氧化物表面作为更强的Lewis酸，增加了卤素原子的结合能并引导它们作为Lewis碱结合，影响表面的催化活性。
