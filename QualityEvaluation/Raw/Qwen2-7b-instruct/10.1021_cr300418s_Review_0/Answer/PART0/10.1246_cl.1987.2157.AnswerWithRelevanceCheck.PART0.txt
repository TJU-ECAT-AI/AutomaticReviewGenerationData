          [1] "Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane."
          [2] "The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing specific halide species (like MgCl2 or CaCl2) onto the surface of alkaline earth oxides (CaO or MgO). This modification enhances catalytic activity due to the creation of active sites that facilitate the oxidative coupling of methane. At a temperature of 750°C and a ratio of CH4/O2 = 9, the selectivity for the formation of C2 hydrocarbons reaches 87%. This implies that the active centers are highly effective in promoting the desired chemical reaction while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

          在碱土金属氧化物（如CaO或MgO）表面掺杂特定卤化物物种（如MgCl2或CaCl2）改变了表面化学性质，破坏了化学键。这种修改通过在碱土氧化物表面引入特定卤化物物种，增强了催化剂活性，促进了甲烷的氧化耦合反应。在750°C的温度和CH4/O2比例为9时，C2烃的选择性达到87%。这意味着活性中心高度有效促进所需化学反应，同时减少副反应。

      <English>
          The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, specifically using halides of alkaline earth metal oxides like MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or MgO, significantly modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, as evidenced by the high selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons reaching 87% at a temperature of 750°C with a ratio of methane to oxygen of 9. The presence of these specific halide dopants creates active centers that facilitate the oxidative coupling of methane, improving the efficiency of the reaction and yielding desired products with high purity.

          在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的取代阳离子掺杂，特别是使用碱土金属氧化物卤化物，如MgCl2或CaCl2在CaO或MgO上，显著改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这促进了甲烷的氧化耦合反应，催化活性得到显著增强，具体表现为在750°C时C2烃的选择性达到87%，甲烷与氧气的比例为9。这些特定卤化物掺杂物的存在形成了促进甲烷氧化耦合的活性中心，提高了反应效率并生成高纯度的期望产物。
