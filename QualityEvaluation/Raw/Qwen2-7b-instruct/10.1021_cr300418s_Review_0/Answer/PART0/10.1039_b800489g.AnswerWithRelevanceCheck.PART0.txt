          The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This is because doping changes the electronic structure of the catalyst, which affects its surface properties and reactivity. As a result, the nature and location of active centers within the catalyst are altered, potentially improving its performance in industrially relevant reactions such as water splitting for hydrogen production. The modification of chemical bonding through doping can lead to more efficient charge separation and transfer, which are crucial for enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.
