[1] "Halogen atoms (formed by dissociative adsorption) can function as a Lewis acid-base pair."
          [2] "The interaction between Lewis acids and bases, through the surface, is very strong."
          [3] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid."
          [4] "Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base."
          [5] "Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."

[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
          [2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
          [3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
          [4] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
