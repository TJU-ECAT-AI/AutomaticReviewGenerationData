          [1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored."
          [2] "It is important to initially discuss one component metal oxide phases before addressing the more complex mixed metal oxide catalytic materials."
          [3] "Supported metal oxide catalysts are created when an active metal oxide component is deposited on an oxide support."
          [4] "The electronic and molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species that are present on oxide supports have received enormous attention over the past three decades because of (1) their industrial significance as catalysts for numerous applications [82] and (2) their ability to serve as model mixed metal oxide catalytic system due to the essentially completely dispersed state."
          [5] "The presence of the same elements in the bulk crystalline lattice and on the surface and in the bulk lattice does not allow many surface analytical techniques to discriminate between the bulk and surface cations of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials because of the 35 nm sampling depth of typical electron spectroscopic techniques (e.g., XPS, AES, etc.)."
          [6] "The recent findings about the surface nature of bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials are very exciting and creating a paradigm shift in the fundamental understanding of how such mixed metal oxides function as selective oxidation catalysts."
          [7] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure of the surface. This modification can lead to the creation of new active sites, changing the nature and location of the active centers. The resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement depend on the specific doping element and its ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be achieved by tailoring the surface chemistry to optimize the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. The exact nature of these improvements depends on the specific reaction conditions and the chemical properties of the dopant.

          在金属氧化物催化剂中进行掺杂可以改变表面化学和破坏化学键，通过改变表面的电子结构。这种修改可能导致新活性位点的生成，改变活性中心的性质和位置。催化活性增强的潜在影响取决于掺杂元素的具体特性和其促进所需化学反应的能力。在工业相关反应中的改进可以通过调整表面化学来优化催化剂的反应性和选择性。这些改进的确切性质取决于特定的反应条件和掺杂剂的化学性质。

          [1] "Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information."
          [2] "The major advantages offered by these spectroscopic improvements are that (1) they can detect XRD inactive amorphous surface metal oxide phases as well as crystalline nanophases and (2) their ability to collect information under various environmental conditions."
          [3] "The discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials."
          [4] "This new research paradigm will have significant impact on the catalysis models of mixed metal oxides in the coming years."
