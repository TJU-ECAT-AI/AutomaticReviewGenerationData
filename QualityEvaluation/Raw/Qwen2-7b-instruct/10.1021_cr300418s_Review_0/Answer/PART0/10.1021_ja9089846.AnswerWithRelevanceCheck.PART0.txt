         The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, which leads to enhanced catalytic activity. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement include improved selectivity towards desired products, altered reaction pathways, and potentially higher stability of the catalyst. Active centers on the catalyst surfaces are influenced by the dopant species, leading to changes in the electronic structure and reactivity. These modifications enable the catalyst to perform better in industrially relevant reactions, such as the preferential oxidation of CO.
