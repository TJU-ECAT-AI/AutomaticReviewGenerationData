          [This format also allows the experienced and practising chemist and engineer to quickly locate information of interest, similar to a traditional handbook format.]

[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
          [2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
          [3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."

[1] "Many oxides consisting of metal cations with d0 and d10 configurations, metal (oxy)sulfide and metal (oxy)nitride photocatalysts have been reported, especially during the latest decade."
          [2] "The fruitful photocatalyst library gives important information on factors affecting photocatalytic performances and design of new materials."

[1] "Our calculations show that the exothermicity of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base."
          [2] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
          [3] "Finally, we show that the presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane."

[1] "In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of inverse CeO2/CuO catalysts and their application as an alternative to classical direct configurations for preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich stream."
         [2] "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity."
         [3] "The resulting implications include improved selectivity towards desired products, altered reaction pathways, and potentially higher stability of the catalyst."
         [4] "Active centers on the catalyst surfaces are influenced by the dopant species, leading to changes in the electronic structure and reactivity."
         [5] "These modifications enable the catalyst to perform better in industrially relevant reactions, such as the preferential oxidation of CO."

[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
          [2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
          [3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."

[1] "Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane."
          [2] "The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9."
