The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and lattice parameters of the catalyst. This leads to changes in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. The modification of surface chemistry affects the nature and location of active centers, leading to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. The specific implications depend on the type of doping, the metal oxide used, and the reaction conditions.
