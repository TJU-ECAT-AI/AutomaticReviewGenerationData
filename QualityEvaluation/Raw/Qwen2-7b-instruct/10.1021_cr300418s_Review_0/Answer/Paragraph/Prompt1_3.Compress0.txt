{"Quotes": "[1] \"Catalysis is important academically and industrially.\"\n          [2] \"It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive.\"\n          [3] \"Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future.\"", "English": "The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering the electronic structure and disrupting chemical bonding, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity. This modification affects the nature and location of active centers, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions by creating more efficient pathways for reactant molecules to interact. The implications include increased selectivity, higher reaction rates, and possibly reduced energy consumption in industrial processes.", "Doi": "10.1007/978-0-387-49962-8"},
{"Quotes": "[1] \"Halides of alkaline earth metal oxides such as MgCl2 or CaCl2 on CaO or on MgO were found to be excellent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane.\"\n          [2] \"The selectivity of C2 hydrocarbon reached 87% at 750 C and CH4/O2=9.\"", "English": "The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing specific halide species (like MgCl2 or CaCl2) onto the surface of alkaline earth oxides (CaO or MgO). This modification enhances catalytic activity due to the creation of active sites that facilitate the oxidative coupling of methane. At a temperature of 750°C and a ratio of CH4/O2 = 9, the selectivity for the formation of C2 hydrocarbons reaches 87%. This implies that the active centers are highly effective in promoting the desired chemical reaction while minimizing unwanted side reactions.", "Doi": "10.1246/cl.1987.2157"}
