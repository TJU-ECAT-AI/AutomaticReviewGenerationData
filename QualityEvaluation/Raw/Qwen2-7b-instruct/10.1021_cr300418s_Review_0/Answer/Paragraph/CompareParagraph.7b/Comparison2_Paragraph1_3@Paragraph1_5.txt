They share similar strengths in logical structure, clarity of content, and adherence to academic standards. However, they lack unique insights and innovation. Both articles effectively contribute to the field of catalysis and propose feasible suggestions for future research. The minor differences lie in writing fluency and terminological use, where neither article outperforms the other."
