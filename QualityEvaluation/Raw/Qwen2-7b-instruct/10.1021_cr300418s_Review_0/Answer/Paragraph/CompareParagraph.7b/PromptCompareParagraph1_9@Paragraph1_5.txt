Catalysis by Doped Oxides

SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the 2013 Surface Chemistry of Oxides special issue.
1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications. (1-7) In addition, oxides catalyze many important reactions whose conversion or selectivity is too low to be commercially interesting. We review here experiments and calculations whose goal was to improve the catalytic activity of an oxide by substituting a small fraction of the cations of a “host oxide” with a different cation. We call this substitutional doping or doping. The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will modify favorably its catalytic activity. The active centers in such a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself.
This is not the only kind of “creative disturbance” that can activate the surface of an oxide. The catalytic activity of a small (molecular size) cluster MeOx (where Me is a cation, O is oxygen, and x is usually unknown) supported on the surface of another oxide (or any other insulator) is often very different from that of the bulk oxide of Me. For example, VOx clusters supported on ceria (8, 9) are more active for methanol oxidation (and many other reactions) than either V2O5 or CeO2. The so-called “inverse catalysts” are similar. They consist of a very thin oxide film supported on a metal surface. (10-30) In this system, as in the other two mentioned above, we place the oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations with the intention of improving their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions.
Substitutional cation doping is not the only possibility. One can imagine that replacing some anions with other anions may also be beneficial. There is evidence that the presence of small amounts of halogen in the feed or on the oxide surface improves its catalytic activity (more often the selectivity). (31-53) We do not know of any work that has proven that the improvements come from the substitution of some of the oxygen atoms with halogens. Anion doping is beneficial for changing the optical properties of photocatalysts as reviewed recently by Kudo. (54)
In this Review, we discuss only oxidation catalysis by substitutional cation doping of binary oxides (oxides with the formula MexOy), and leave out complex oxides (e.g., perovskites, vanadates). This is an emerging field, which is rapidly evolving and is very far from maturity; therefore, it is not advisable to attempt the kind of exhaustive review typical of mature fields. Instead, we concentrate on the main ideas and the major difficulties of the field, try to sort out its prospects, suggest future lines of research, and examine the extent to which computations aid the search for better doped-oxide catalysts. Rather than attempt to cover all work on catalysis by doped oxides, which is rather vast and fragmentary, we examine in some depth a few examples on which data are more abundant and the research is more extensive and more systematic. One example deals with the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene, by using oxygen or CO2 as oxidant. The other example examines the ODH of ethane with oxygen. We decided that piling up more examples would not bring more clarity to our understanding of the subject. This decision was made easier by our awareness of the finite nature of our time, energy, and intellectual resources.
We note that we present scientific research rather than focus on efforts directed toward finding the best commercial catalyst. This means that some aspects that are essential for deciding whether a catalyst is commercially promising are not addressed in this article. An excellent discussion of the criteria that a commercial catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation must meet can be found in Chapter 5 of the book by Centi, Cavani, and Trifiro. (7)
As we worked on this article, several themes became central. On the experimental side two facts imposed themselves on us: The performance depends strongly on the method of preparation; and it is difficult to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared. For this reason, we devoted a section to the methods of preparation and one to the methods of characterization.
There has been considerable computational work on various properties of doped oxides. There are inherent limitations in this work. First, we know that the computational methods usable in practice do not give accurate total energies. Second, we do not know, at the atomic level, the morphology or the composition of an oxide catalyst under working conditions. The latter is a shortcoming of the experiments. We could perform useful calculations on any morphology or any surface composition, if we knew what they are. Unfortunately, experiments are not likely to provide this information soon, despite the great progress made lately in operando microscopy and spectroscopy. For these reasons, we believe that computations are most useful, at this time, if they look for qualitative trends and qualitative rules for catalyst design. They should help increase the probability of finding better oxide catalysts. This opinion has guided the way we examined the computations and organized the presentation of their results. The calculations performed so far provide a classification of the dopant&ndash;oxide pairs based on the common properties obtained by computations. One of the questions we ask in this Review is: Are there hints in the experiments that these rules are obeyed? Given the uncertainties in the experiments, we can only say that many experimental results are in accord with the qualitative suggestions made by computations.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1038/358658a0], [10.1002/cjce.5450850114], [10.1007/978-1-4615-4175-2], and [10.1021/ja304497n]. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure of the surface. This modification can lead to the creation of new active sites, changing the nature and location of the active centers. The resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement depend on the specific doping element and its ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions. Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions can be achieved by tailoring the surface chemistry to optimize the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. The exact nature of these improvements depends on the specific reaction conditions and the chemical properties of the dopant.

        Enhancing catalytic performance of metal oxide catalysts through substitutional cation doping involves several mechanisms, including the modification of electronic properties, disruption of chemical bonding, and the relocation of active centers on the catalyst surface. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, improved selectivity towards desired products, altered reaction pathways, and potentially higher stability of the catalyst. Active centers on the catalyst surfaces are influenced by the dopant species, leading to changes in the electronic structure and reactivity. These modifications enable the catalyst to perform better in industrially relevant reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation.

        For instance, in the context of propane dehydrogenation, substitutional cation doping can lead to the creation of new active sites that facilitate the breaking of C-C bonds, resulting in the production of ethylene and hydrogen. The doping element can affect the coordination environment around metal centers, influencing chemical bonding and thus the catalytic activity. Doping can also disrupt the Lewis acid-base balance on the catalyst surface, which can enhance the efficiency of reactant molecule interactions and the selectivity towards the desired product.

        The implications for industrially relevant reactions are significant, as optimized catalysts can lead to higher yields, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact. By carefully selecting the dopant and tuning the surface chemistry, the catalytic performance can be significantly enhanced, leading to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel doping strategies that can further tailor the surface properties of metal oxide catalysts. This could involve the integration of multiple dopants to create synergistic effects, the exploration of new dopant types beyond metals, or the design of hierarchical structures that combine different functional components. Additionally, the development of in situ characterization techniques could provide real-time insights into the dynamic behavior of catalysts under operational conditions, enabling the optimization of catalyst design and operation.

        The field of metal oxide catalysts is poised for significant growth, driven by the increasing demand for more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical processes. By leveraging the principles of substitutional cation doping, researchers can continue to push the boundaries of catalytic science, leading to advancements in a wide range of industrial applications, from energy production to fine chemical synthesis.
