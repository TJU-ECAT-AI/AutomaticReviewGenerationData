[1] "The formation of a particular oxide phase can be tuned by appropriate choices of the Mn coverage, substrate temperature and oxygen chemical potential."
[2] "The chemical potential of oxygen as a growth variable during the oxidation step of the preparation procedure crucially determines the atomic structure of the particular oxide phase formed."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by controlling the Mn coverage, substrate temperature, and oxygen chemical potential. These factors determine the atomic structure of the oxide phase, influencing the nature and location of active centers. By tuning these variables, one can enhance catalytic activity and potentially improve industrially relevant reactions.
