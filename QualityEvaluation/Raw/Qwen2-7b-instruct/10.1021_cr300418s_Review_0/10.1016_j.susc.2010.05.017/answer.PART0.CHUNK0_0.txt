[1] "The Mn-oxide nanostructures reported here have been atomically characterized by STM and LEED in a multi-task custom-designed system as described previously [10]."
[2] "The formation of a particular oxide phase can be tuned by appropriate choices of the Mn coverage, substrate temperature and oxygen chemical potential."
[3] "The physical origin of the mesoscopic stabilization of the regular stepterrace morphology of the vicinal metal surfaces by decoration with oxide nanostructures is presumably due to a twofold effect: the substrate steps become rigid due to the coupling to pseudomorphic oxide line structures, and particular terrace widths become preferred thanks to the interfacial matching with the lattice of 2-D oxide wetting layers."
[4] "The here described route of atomic scale engineering of nanopatterned oxide surfaces may be applied to a variety of metal-oxide hybrid combinations, thus creating new avenues for the study of physical and chemical phenomena at the nanoscale."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the composition and structure of the catalyst surface. This modification enhances catalytic activity through the creation of new active sites and changes in reactivity pathways. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by the dopant's ability to create defects, modify the bandgap, and induce changes in surface morphology. These changes can lead to improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, and combustion processes, by providing better access to reactants and products, reducing reaction barriers, and increasing the selectivity of the catalytic process.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的掺杂改变了表面化学和化学键，通过改变催化剂表面的组成和结构来实现。这通过增强催化活性来提高催化活性，通过创建新的活性中心和改变反应路径。活性中心的性质和位置受到掺杂物在缺陷生成、带隙修改和表面形态变化方面的能力的影响。这些变化可以导致工业相关反应（如氧化、氢化和燃烧过程）的效率提高，通过提供更好的反应物和产物的接近性，降低反应障碍，并增加催化过程的选择性。
