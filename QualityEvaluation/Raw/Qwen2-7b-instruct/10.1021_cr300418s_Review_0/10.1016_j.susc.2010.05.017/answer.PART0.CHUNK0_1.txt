[1] "The Mn-oxide nanostructures reported here have been atomically characterized by STM and LEED in a multi-task custom-designed system as described previously."
[2] "The formation of a particular oxide phase can be tuned by appropriate choices of the Mn coverage, substrate temperature and oxygen chemical potential."
[3] "Different oxide nanostructures, in form of oxide nanostripes, can be fabricated by completely covering the terraces of the vicinal Pd(1,1,17) surface by a Mn-oxide wetting layer, as depicted in Fig. 2."
[4] "We note parenthetically that on the flat Pd(100) surface the c(4×2)Mn3O4 overlayer forms ordered areas of only limited size,which are separated by disordered regions as a result of residual interface strain."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by altering chemical bonding patterns, leading to changes in the nature and location of active centers. This modification enhances catalytic activity by providing a more efficient reaction pathway. Industrially relevant reactions can benefit from these improvements due to increased efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts.
