[1] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C 2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "It is reasonable to suspect that CC14 is modifying the oxide surface in a number of ways."
[3] "It may be noted that in the absence of any catalyst the ratio of C2H4/C2H6 was also much higher when the experiment was conducted with CC14 in the feed."
[4] "The relatively high ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 observed in the presence of CC14 in the feed suggests that halogen radicals supplied from CC14 are catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C2H 6 to C2H 4."
[5] "It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H 4 to C2H 6 ratio in the presence of CC14."
[6] "In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H 4 from CH 4 in the gas phase."
[7] "The low selectivity of CH3C1 is not surprising in view of the high temperature used."
[8] "Nevertheless, in view of the remarkable increase observed both in the yield and selectivity of dimerized product, it is believed that further studies will provide valuable practical and mechanistic information on the conversion process and the nature of the additive effect."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing chlorine atoms from the added chloromethane (CC14). This leads to enhancements in catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions such as the oxidative coupling of methane. The chloride ions can act as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, affecting the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 products. The high temperature used facilitates the formation of chlorine radicals, which can catalyze the conversion of methane into hydrocarbons. Despite lower selectivity for certain products, the significant increase in yield and selectivity for dimerized products suggests that further studies could provide valuable insights into the conversion process and the role of the additive.

金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂离子通过引入来自添加四氯化碳（CC14）的氯原子，改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这导致催化活性的增强、活性中心的性质和位置的变化以及对工业相关反应的改进，如甲烷的氧化耦合。氯离子可以作为催化C2H6转化为C2H4的催化剂，影响C2H4与C2H6产物的比例。高温有助于形成氯自由基，这些自由基可以催化甲烷转化为烃类。尽管某些产品的选择性较低，但对二聚产物显著增加的产量和选择性的观察表明，进一步的研究可能提供有关转化过程和添加剂作用的重要信息。
