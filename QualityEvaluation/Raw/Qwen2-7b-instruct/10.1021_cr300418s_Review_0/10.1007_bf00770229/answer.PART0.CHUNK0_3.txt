[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."
[2] "The observed effects may, among others,depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form C1 atoms or radicals."
[3] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[4] "Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time."
[5] "The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCI 4 [5,10,19], that C2H 6 is the primary C 2 product and C2H 4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in various ways. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement are multifaceted, involving changes to the nature and location of active centers. This modification can lead to enhanced activity in industrially relevant reactions by altering the reactivity pathways of substrates, influencing adsorption/desorption properties, and modulating the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. The specific effects depend on factors such as the incorporation of chlorine into or retention by the oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond, and the oxide's ability to decompose the additive and generate reactive species like chlorine atoms or radicals. For instance, in the case of Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, there is a notable increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons in the initial stages of the reaction, though this increase is not sustained over longer reaction times. The presence of tetrachloromethane in the feed stream leads to an increase in the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6, suggesting that halogen radicals from the additive catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, which could involve direct or indirect pathways involving the formation of chlorinated intermediates.

在金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂会以多种方式改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键。催化活性增强的后果是多方面的，涉及活性中心的性质和位置的变化。这种修改可以通过改变基质的反应路径、影响吸附/脱附性质以及调节催化剂表面的电子结构来提高工业相关反应的活性。特定的影响取决于氯是否被引入或保留在氧化物中、金属-氯键的强度以及氧化物表面分解添加剂并生成活性物种（如氯原子或自由基）的能力。例如，在Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2的情况下，在反应初期阶段观察到了C2烃类产量的显著增加，但这种增加没有随着反应时间的延长而持续。在添加剂加入到进料流中的情况下，C2H4与C2H6的比例增加，这表明从添加剂产生的卤素自由基催化了C2H6的脱氢生成C2H4，这可能涉及到直接或间接途径，包括形成氯化中间体的过程。
