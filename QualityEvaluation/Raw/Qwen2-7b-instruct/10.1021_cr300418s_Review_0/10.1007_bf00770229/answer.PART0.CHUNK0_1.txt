[1] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C 2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[3] "For example, in addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO2, and Ti/SiO2 with which the addition of CC14 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[4] "It is reasonable to suspect that CC14 is modifying the oxide surface in a number of ways."
[5] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals."
[6] "The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CC14, that C2H6 is the primary C 2 product and C2H4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6."
[7] "It may be noted that with CC14 in the feed, in addition to CO, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6, CH3Cl is formed although in very small quantities."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways. The introduction of CC14 to the feed stream alters the surface properties of metal oxides, such as changing their acidity or basicity, incorporating chlorine into or retaining it within the oxide structure, affecting the strength of metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals. These changes enhance the catalytic activity of certain catalysts, like those of Ba, Cs, and Mn supported on silica, by promoting oxidative dehydrogenation of methane into C2 hydrocarbons. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by these modifications, leading to increased yields and selectivities in industrially relevant reactions. The effectiveness of CC14 varies depending on the specific oxide used, with some oxides facilitating the coupling reaction, while others either have little effect or inhibit the reaction. The observed effects could be attributed to the oxide surface's ability to alter its chemical properties in response to CC14, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic performance and improved selectivity in the production of C2 hydrocarbons.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂的置换离子通过改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键的方式对催化活性产生了影响。向反应流中加入CC14会改变金属氧化物的表面特性，如改变其酸性或碱性、将氯融入或保留于氧化物结构中、影响金属-氯键的强度、使氧化物表面分解CC14并形成Cl原子或自由基等。这些变化增强了某些催化剂（如Ba、Cs、Mn支持在硅上的氧化物）的活性，促进了甲烷的氧化脱氢生成C2烃类。活性中心的位置和性质受到这些修改的影响，导致了工业相关反应的增加产量和选择性。CC14的有效性取决于所使用的特定氧化物类型，一些氧化物促进耦合反应，而其他氧化物则要么几乎没有影响，要么抑制反应。观察到的效果可能是由于氧化物表面能够响应CC14改变其化学性质的能力，从而导致增强的催化性能和C2烃类生产的改进选择性。
