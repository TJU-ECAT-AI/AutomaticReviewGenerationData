[1] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[3] "Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction."
[4] "In addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO2, and Ti/SiO2 with which the addition of CC14 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[5] "It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H4/C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface, incorporating or retaining chlorine, forming metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the decomposition of CC14 to form Cl atoms or radicals. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, the creation of new active centers, and improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers in these catalysts are influenced by how CC14 interacts with the oxide surface. It can lead to the formation of new active sites due to changes in surface chemistry, the incorporation of chlorine, and the disruption of existing bonding patterns.

3. The enhancement in the yield and selectivity of dimerized products when CC14 is added to catalysts of Ba, Cs, and Mn on silica supports demonstrates a significant improvement in the oxidative coupling of methane.

4. Different oxides exhibit varying responses to CC14. Some, like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2, have little impact on the oxidation process, while others, such as Pb/SiO2 and Ti/SiO2, show strong inhibition of the reaction when CC14 is present. This variability suggests that CC14 modifies the oxide surface in multiple ways, affecting its reactivity differently based on the oxide type.

5. The enrichment of the C2H4/C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14 cannot be solely attributed to either heterogeneous or homogeneous processes. Chlorine radicals from CC14 may catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, contributing to the increased production of ethene, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.

1. 添加CC14到Ba、Cs和Mn在二氧化硅支持下的氧化物中，通过改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键，修改了金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质。这导致了酸性和/或碱性的变化，氯的整合或保留，形成了金属-氯键，以及CC14的分解形成Cl原子或自由基。这促进了催化活性，创建了新的活性中心，并提高了工业相关反应的效率。

2. 这些催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置受到CC14与氧化物表面相互作用的影响。它可能导致由于表面化学性质的变化、氯的整合和现有键模式的破坏而形成新的活性位点。

3. Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2上添加CC14时，明显增加了C2烃类化合物的形成，这表明了通过氧化脱氢甲烷来促进甲烷的氧化耦合。

4. 不同的氧化物对CC14的响应各不相同。Ni/SiO2、Cd/SiO2和Zn/SiO2等氧化物对氧化过程影响较小，而Pb/SiO2和Ti/SiO2等氧化物在CC14存在时强烈抑制了反应。这种差异性表明CC14以多种方式修改了氧化物表面，根据氧化物类型的不同影响其反应性。

5. 在CC14存在的条件下，C2H4/C2H6比值的增加不能仅归因于异相或均相过程。CC14释放的氯原子可能催化C2H6转化为C2H4，导致乙炔产量的增加，但确切机制仍不清楚。
