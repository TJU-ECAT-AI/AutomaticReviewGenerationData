[1] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[3] "Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction."
[4] "In addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO2, and Ti/SiO2 with which the addition of CC14 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[5] "It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H4/C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface, incorporating or retaining chlorine, forming metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the decomposition of CC14 to form Cl atoms or radicals. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity, the creation of new active centers, and improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions.

2. The nature and location of active centers in these catalysts are influenced by how CC14 interacts with the oxide surface. It can lead to the formation of new active sites due to changes in surface chemistry, the incorporation of chlorine, and the disruption of existing bonding patterns.

3. The enhancement in the yield and selectivity of dimerized products when CC14 is added to catalysts of Ba, Cs, and Mn on silica supports demonstrates a significant improvement in the oxidative coupling of methane.

4. Different oxides exhibit varying responses to CC14. Some, like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2, have little impact on the oxidation process, while others, such as Pb/SiO2 and Ti/SiO2, show strong inhibition of the reaction when CC14 is present. This variability suggests that CC14 modifies the oxide surface in multiple ways, affecting its reactivity differently based on the oxide type.

5. The enrichment of the C2H4/C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14 cannot be solely attributed to either heterogeneous or homogeneous processes. Chlorine radicals from CC14 may catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, contributing to the increased production of ethene, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.

1. 添加CC14到Ba、Cs和Mn在二氧化硅支持下的氧化物中，通过改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键，修改了金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质。这导致了酸性和/或碱性的变化，氯的整合或保留，形成了金属-氯键，以及CC14的分解形成Cl原子或自由基。这促进了催化活性，创建了新的活性中心，并提高了工业相关反应的效率。

2. 这些催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置受到CC14与氧化物表面相互作用的影响。它可能导致由于表面化学性质的变化、氯的整合和现有键模式的破坏而形成新的活性位点。

3. Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2上添加CC14时，明显增加了C2烃类化合物的形成，这表明了通过氧化脱氢甲烷来促进甲烷的氧化耦合。

4. 不同的氧化物对CC14的响应各不相同。Ni/SiO2、Cd/SiO2和Zn/SiO2等氧化物对氧化过程影响较小，而Pb/SiO2和Ti/SiO2等氧化物在CC14存在时强烈抑制了反应。这种差异性表明CC14以多种方式修改了氧化物表面，根据氧化物类型的不同影响其反应性。

5. 在CC14存在的条件下，C2H4/C2H6比值的增加不能仅归因于异相或均相过程。CC14释放的氯原子可能催化C2H6转化为C2H4，导致乙炔产量的增加，但确切机制仍不清楚。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways. The introduction of CC14 to the feed stream alters the surface properties of metal oxides, such as changing their acidity or basicity, incorporating chlorine into or retaining it within the oxide structure, affecting the strength of metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals. These changes enhance the catalytic activity of certain catalysts, like those of Ba, Cs, and Mn supported on silica, by promoting oxidative dehydrogenation of methane into C2 hydrocarbons. The nature and location of active centers are influenced by these modifications, leading to increased yields and selectivities in industrially relevant reactions. The effectiveness of CC14 varies depending on the specific oxide used, with some oxides facilitating the coupling reaction, while others either have little effect or inhibit the reaction. The observed effects could be attributed to the oxide surface's ability to alter its chemical properties in response to CC14, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic performance and improved selectivity in the production of C2 hydrocarbons.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂的置换离子通过改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键的方式对催化活性产生了影响。向反应流中加入CC14会改变金属氧化物的表面特性，如改变其酸性或碱性、将氯融入或保留于氧化物结构中、影响金属-氯键的强度、使氧化物表面分解CC14并形成Cl原子或自由基等。这些变化增强了某些催化剂（如Ba、Cs、Mn支持在硅上的氧化物）的活性，促进了甲烷的氧化脱氢生成C2烃类。活性中心的位置和性质受到这些修改的影响，导致了工业相关反应的增加产量和选择性。CC14的有效性取决于所使用的特定氧化物类型，一些氧化物促进耦合反应，而其他氧化物则要么几乎没有影响，要么抑制反应。观察到的效果可能是由于氧化物表面能够响应CC14改变其化学性质的能力，从而导致增强的催化性能和C2烃类生产的改进选择性。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing chlorine atoms from the added chloromethane (CC14). This leads to enhancements in catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions such as the oxidative coupling of methane. The chloride ions can act as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, affecting the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 products. The high temperature used facilitates the formation of chlorine radicals, which can catalyze the conversion of methane into hydrocarbons. Despite lower selectivity for certain products, the significant increase in yield and selectivity for dimerized products suggests that further studies could provide valuable insights into the conversion process and the role of the additive.

[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."
[2] "The observed effects may, among others,depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form C1 atoms or radicals."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in various ways. The implications for catalytic activity enhancement are multifaceted, involving changes to the nature and location of active centers. This modification can lead to enhanced activity in industrially relevant reactions by altering the reactivity pathways of substrates, influencing adsorption/desorption properties, and modulating the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. The specific effects depend on factors such as the incorporation of chlorine into or retention by the oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond, and the oxide's ability to decompose the additive and generate reactive species like chlorine atoms or radicals. For instance, in the case of Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, there is a notable increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons in the initial stages of the reaction, though this increase is not sustained over longer reaction times. The presence of tetrachloromethane in the feed stream leads to an increase in the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6, suggesting that halogen radicals from the additive catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, which could involve direct or indirect pathways involving the formation of chlorinated intermediates.

在金属氧化物催化剂中的取代离子掺杂会以多种方式改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键。催化活性增强的后果是多方面的，涉及活性中心的性质和位置的变化。这种修改可以通过改变基质的反应路径、影响吸附/脱附性质以及调节催化剂表面的电子结构来提高工业相关反应的活性。特定的影响取决于氯是否被引入或保留在氧化物中、金属-氯键的强度以及氧化物表面分解添加剂并生成活性物种（如氯原子或自由基）的能力。例如，在Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2的情况下，在反应初期阶段观察到了C2烃类产量的显著增加，但这种增加没有随着反应时间的延长而持续。在添加剂加入到进料流中的情况下，C2H4与C2H6的比例增加，这表明从添加剂产生的卤素自由基催化了C2H6的脱氢生成C2H4，这可能涉及到直接或间接途径，包括形成氯化中间体的过程。
