[1] "Among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals."
[3] "At the present stage, very little can be said about the mechanism of the reaction."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface. Chlorine incorporation into or retention by the oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond, and the oxide surface's ability to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals contribute to these modifications.

2. The nature and location of active centers in metal oxide catalysts are influenced by the way substitutional cation doping changes their surface chemistry. This alteration can lead to the creation of reactive sites capable of enhancing the catalytic activity of the material.

3. The mechanism of the reaction promoted by substitutional cation doping is not yet fully understood. The specifics of how the doping affects the reaction pathway and the role of chlorine in the catalytic process remain unclear.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的取代阳离子掺杂通过改变氧化物表面的酸性和/或碱性来修改表面化学性质。氯原子的整合或保留于氧化物、金属-氯键的强度，以及氧化物表面分解CC14并形成Cl原子或自由基的能力，都对这些修改有贡献。

2. 金属氧化物催化剂中活性中心的性质和位置受到取代阳离子掺杂对其表面化学性质影响的影响。这种变化可能导致产生能够增强材料催化活性的反应位点。

3. 掺杂促进的反应机制尚未完全理解。关于掺杂如何影响反应途径以及氯在催化过程中的作用的具体细节仍然不清楚。
