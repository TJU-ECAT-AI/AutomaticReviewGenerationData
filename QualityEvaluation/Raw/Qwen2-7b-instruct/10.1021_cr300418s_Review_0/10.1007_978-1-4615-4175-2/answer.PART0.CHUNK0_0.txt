[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
[2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis aims to achieve two significant objectives. Firstly, it provides illustrative examples of significant, representative new catalytic oxidations, analyzing them to deepen understanding and enhance the design of catalytic oxidation processes. Secondly, it critically examines traditional concepts and identifies their constraints, thereby outlining guidelines for future research directions.
