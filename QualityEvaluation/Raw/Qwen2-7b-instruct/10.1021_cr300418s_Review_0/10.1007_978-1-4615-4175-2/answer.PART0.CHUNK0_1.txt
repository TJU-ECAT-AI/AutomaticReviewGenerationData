[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them. Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[2] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."

Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis is a comprehensive book that aims to enhance understanding of catalytic oxidations. The authors achieve this by providing examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations, considering them in depth to gain insights into the design of catalytic oxidation processes. They also critically evaluate established ideas and concepts, identifying their limitations to outline guidelines for future research. The book covers various topics such as new technological and industrial opportunities, control of surface reactivity, new fields of application for solid catalysts, new concepts and strategies in selective oxidation, new aspects of the mechanisms of selective oxidation, and structure/activity relationships. This book serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of catalysis, particularly those involved in catalytic oxidation or those considering entering the field.
