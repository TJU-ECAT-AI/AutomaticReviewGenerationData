[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them. Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[2] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."

Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis discusses the use of concept by example to clarify fundamental, but new concepts necessary for a better understanding of the new opportunities in selective oxidation field and the design of new catalysts or catalytic reactions. The book aims to provide examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and considers them to lead to greater understanding of these reactions. It also takes a fresh look at long-established ideas and concepts to ascertain their limitations and outline guidelines for future research.
