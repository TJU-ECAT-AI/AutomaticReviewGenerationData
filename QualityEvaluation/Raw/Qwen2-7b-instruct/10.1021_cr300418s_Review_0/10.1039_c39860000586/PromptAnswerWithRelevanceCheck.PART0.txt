The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, such as the addition of LiCl to Sm2O3, modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhancements in catalytic activity, the creation of more effective active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions. For instance, the addition of LiCl specifically increases the selectivity for ethylene (C2H4) production during the partial oxidation of methane, resulting in yields that surpass those achieved with other metal oxide catalysts. This modification enables more efficient and selective synthesis of ethylene from methane, which is a significant improvement in industrial applications.

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. This is exemplified by the improved performance of the LiCl-doped Sm2O3 catalyst in the partial oxidation of methane, where it exhibited higher C2-yield compared to pure Sm2O3.
2. The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 are quantified based on their yields relative to the conversion of methane. This provides a measure of how effectively the catalyst converts methane into specific products.
3. The addition of LiCl to Sm2O3 catalysts has a favorable effect by suppressing further oxidation of methane and C2H6 to CO and CO2, thus enhancing the selectivity towards C2 compounds.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing additional ions that alter the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst. This can lead to enhancements in catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, and improved performance in industrially relevant reactions.
2. The addition of lithium chloride (LiCl) to samarium oxide (Sm2O3) specifically enhances the selectivity for ethylene (C2H4) production during the partial oxidation of methane, without increasing the overall conversion efficiency. This is attributed to the suppression of further oxidation reactions that would otherwise produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), thereby favoring the formation of ethylene.
3. The results obtained using LiCl-doped Sm2O3 catalysts surpass those reported for other metal oxide catalysts in the literature, indicating its potential utility in the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中掺入替代阳离子可以修改表面化学性质并破坏化学键，通过引入额外的离子来改变催化剂的电子结构和反应活性。这可能导致催化活性的增强、活性中心的性质和位置的变化以及在工业相关反应中的改进。
2. 在镧榴石（Sm2O3）中添加锂氯（LiCl）可以特别提高甲烷部分氧化生成乙烯（C2H4）的选择性，而不会增加整体转化效率。这归因于抑制进一步氧化反应，这些反应原本会产生二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO），从而有利于乙烯的形成。
3. 使用LiCl掺杂的Sm2O3催化剂获得的结果超过了文献中其他金属氧化物催化剂的报告结果，表明其在选择性地从甲烷合成乙烯方面的潜在应用价值。

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment around the dopant ions. This leads to changes in the nature and location of active centers, enhancing catalytic activity. In the case of the LiCl-Sm2O3 catalyst, the addition of LiCl specifically improves the selectivity of ethylene production from methane, reducing further oxidation of methane and C2H6 to CO and CO2. The result is a significant increase in ethylene yield compared to other metal oxide catalysts, demonstrating improved performance for industrially relevant reactions such as selective synthesis of ethylene.
