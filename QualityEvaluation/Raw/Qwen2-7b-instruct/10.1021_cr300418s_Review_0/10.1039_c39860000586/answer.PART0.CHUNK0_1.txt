[1] "Although the catalytic partial oxidation of methane is of potential technological importance, there have been only a few fundamental reports on this reaction."
[2] "An Sm203 catalyst containing added alkali metal carbonate showed better catalytic activity and selectivity giving a C2-yield of 21%."
[3] "The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6, respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion."
[4] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. This is exemplified by the improved performance of the LiCl-doped Sm2O3 catalyst in the partial oxidation of methane, where it exhibited higher C2-yield compared to pure Sm2O3.
2. The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 are quantified based on their yields relative to the conversion of methane. This provides a measure of how effectively the catalyst converts methane into specific products.
3. The addition of LiCl to Sm2O3 catalysts has a favorable effect by suppressing further oxidation of methane and C2H6 to CO and CO2, thus enhancing the selectivity towards C2 compounds.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中进行位掺杂会改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键，从而提高催化活性和选择性。以添加LiCl的Sm2O3催化剂在甲烷部分氧化反应中的表现为例，其C2产物的产率显著提高。
2. C2H4和C2H6的选择性是基于它们相对于甲烷转化率的比例来衡量的产物产量。这为催化剂如何有效地将甲烷转化为特定产品提供了量化指标。
3. LiCl添加到Sm2O3催化剂中具有有利的影响，通过抑制甲烷和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2，从而增强C2化合物的选择性。
