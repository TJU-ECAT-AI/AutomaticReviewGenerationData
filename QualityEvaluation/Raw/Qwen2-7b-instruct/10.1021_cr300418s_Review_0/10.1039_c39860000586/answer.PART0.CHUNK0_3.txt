[1] "We report here the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane over LiC1- Sm203 catalyst."
[2] "The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6, respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion."
[3] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."
[4] "These yields are considerably better than results reported in the literature for other metal oxide catalysts. 1-3 Thus, LiC1-Sm203 may be a useful catalyst in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, such as using lithium chloride (LiCl) in the LiCl-Sm2O3 catalyst, modifies the surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhancements in catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, and improved efficiency in industrially relevant reactions. For instance, the addition of LiCl specifically boosts the selectivity for ethylene (C2H4) production from methane, resulting in higher yields compared to other metal oxide catalysts. This makes LiCl-Sm2O3 a promising catalyst for the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane.

金属氧化物催化剂中的位取代离子掺杂，例如在LiCl-Sm2O3催化剂中使用LiCl，改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键。这导致催化活性的增强、活性中心的性质和位置的变化，并提高了工业相关反应的效率。例如，LiCl的添加专门提升了从甲烷生产乙烷（C2H4）的选择性，产生了比其他金属氧化物催化剂更高的产率。这使得LiCl-Sm2O3成为从甲烷选择性合成乙烷的有前景的催化剂。
