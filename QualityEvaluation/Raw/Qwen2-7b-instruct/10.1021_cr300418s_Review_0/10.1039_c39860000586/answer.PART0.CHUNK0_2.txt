[1] "We report here the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane over LiC1- Sm203 catalyst."
[2] "The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6,respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion."
[3] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."
[4] "These yields are considerably better than results reported in the literature for other metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

1. Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by introducing additional ions that alter the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst. This can lead to enhancements in catalytic activity, changes in the nature and location of active centers, and improved performance in industrially relevant reactions.
2. The addition of lithium chloride (LiCl) to samarium oxide (Sm2O3) specifically enhances the selectivity for ethylene (C2H4) production during the partial oxidation of methane, without increasing the overall conversion efficiency. This is attributed to the suppression of further oxidation reactions that would otherwise produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), thereby favoring the formation of ethylene.
3. The results obtained using LiCl-doped Sm2O3 catalysts surpass those reported for other metal oxide catalysts in the literature, indicating its potential utility in the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane.

1. 在金属氧化物催化剂中掺入替代阳离子可以修改表面化学性质并破坏化学键，通过引入额外的离子来改变催化剂的电子结构和反应活性。这可能导致催化活性的增强、活性中心的性质和位置的变化以及在工业相关反应中的改进。
2. 在镧榴石（Sm2O3）中添加锂氯（LiCl）可以特别提高甲烷部分氧化生成乙烯（C2H4）的选择性，而不会增加整体转化效率。这归因于抑制进一步氧化反应，这些反应原本会产生二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO），从而有利于乙烯的形成。
3. 使用LiCl掺杂的Sm2O3催化剂获得的结果超过了文献中其他金属氧化物催化剂的报告结果，表明其在选择性地从甲烷合成乙烯方面的潜在应用价值。
