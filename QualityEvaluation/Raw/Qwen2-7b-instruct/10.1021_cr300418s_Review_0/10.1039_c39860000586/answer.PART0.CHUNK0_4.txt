[1] "Although the catalytic partial oxidation of methane is of potential technological importance, there have been only a few fundamental reports on this reaction."
[2] "We report here the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane over LiCl- Sm2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6, respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion."
[4] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2."
[5] "These yields are considerably better than results reported in the literature for other metal oxide catalysts."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment around the dopant ions. This leads to changes in the nature and location of active centers, enhancing catalytic activity. In the case of the LiCl-Sm2O3 catalyst, the addition of LiCl specifically improves the selectivity of ethylene production from methane, reducing further oxidation of methane and C2H6 to CO and CO2. The result is a significant increase in ethylene yield compared to other metal oxide catalysts, demonstrating improved performance for industrially relevant reactions such as selective synthesis of ethylene.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行的掺杂通过改变掺杂离子周围的电子结构和配位环境，修改了表面化学和破坏了化学键。这导致活性中心的性质和位置发生变化，从而增强催化活性。对于LiCl-Sm2O3催化剂而言，添加LiCl特别提高了从甲烷合成乙烯的选择性，减少了甲烷和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2的过程。结果是与其它金属氧化物催化剂相比，乙烯产率有了显著提高，这表明该催化剂在工业相关反应如选择性合成乙烯方面表现出改进性能。
