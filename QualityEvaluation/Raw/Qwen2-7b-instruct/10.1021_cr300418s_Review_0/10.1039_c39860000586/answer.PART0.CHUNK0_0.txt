[1] "We report here the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane over LiCl- Sm203 catalyst."
[2] "The selectivities of C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6, respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion."
[3] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."
[4] "These yields are considerably better than results reported in the literature for other metal oxide catalysts."

The substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, such as the addition of LiCl to Sm2O3, modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding. This leads to enhancements in catalytic activity, the creation of more effective active centers, and improvements in industrially relevant reactions. For instance, the addition of LiCl specifically increases the selectivity for ethylene (C2H4) production during the partial oxidation of methane, resulting in yields that surpass those achieved with other metal oxide catalysts. This modification enables more efficient and selective synthesis of ethylene from methane, which is a significant improvement in industrial applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂替代阳离子，例如在Sm2O3中添加LiCl，会改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键。这导致催化活性的增强、活性中心的有效创建以及对工业相关反应的改进。例如，LiCl的添加专门提高了甲烷部分氧化过程中乙烷（C2H4）的选择性生产，所获得的产量超过了其他金属氧化物催化剂的报道结果。这种修改使得从甲烷高效且选择性地合成乙烷成为可能，在工业应用中是一个显著的改进。
