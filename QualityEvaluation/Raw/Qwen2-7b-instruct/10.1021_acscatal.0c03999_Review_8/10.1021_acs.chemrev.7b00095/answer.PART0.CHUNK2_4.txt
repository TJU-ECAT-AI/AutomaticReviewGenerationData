Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its lower oxidation potential. Catalysts such as noble metals like platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru) are commonly used in this process. However, significant challenges include catalyst deactivation due to sintering, poisoning by impurities, and loss of activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing new catalyst materials with improved stability and selectivity, such as supported metal oxides or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Research directions might also focus on enhancing the understanding of reaction mechanisms and optimizing operating conditions to boost propylene yield and efficiency.

使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，由于其比其他氧化剂更低的氧化电位，具有更高的丙烯选择性优势。此过程中常用的催化剂包括铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）和钌（Ru）等贵金属，它们在脱氢反应中表现出高活性。然而，关键挑战包括催化剂由于烧结、杂质中毒以及随时间逐渐失去活性等问题。应对这些局限性的策略可能包括开发新的稳定性和选择性更好的催化剂材料，如支持金属氧化物或金属有机框架（MOFs）。研究方向也可以集中在深化反应机理的理解和优化操作条件，以提高丙烯产率和效率。
