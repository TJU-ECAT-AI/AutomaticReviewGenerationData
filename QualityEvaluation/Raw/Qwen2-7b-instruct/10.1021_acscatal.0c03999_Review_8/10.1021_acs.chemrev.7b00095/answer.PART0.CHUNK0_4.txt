[1] "Metal adsorbents may be useful as a final polishing step to limit the energy duty for H2S adsorption/regeneration."
[2] "For example, they can be useful in certain applications such as direct-methane fuel cells (170) to achieve ultra-low sulfur content methane from pre-treated natural gas."

One strategy to address the limitations of using nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is to incorporate metal adsorbents as a final polishing step. This can help in minimizing the energy requirement for adsorption and regeneration processes. Metal adsorbents, particularly those capable of selectively adsorbing and desorbing hydrogen sulfide (H2S), can be effectively utilized in applications like direct-methane fuel cells, where achieving ultra-low sulfur content in methane is crucial. This approach can improve the overall efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of the process.
