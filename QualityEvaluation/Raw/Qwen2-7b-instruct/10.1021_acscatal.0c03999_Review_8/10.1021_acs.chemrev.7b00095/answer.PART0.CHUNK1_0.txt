[1] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."
[2] "It should be noted here that, for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), isotherms were simulated for two different rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and the large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm."
[3] "The breakthrough capacity also increased by 40% when the adsorption temperature was raised from 30 to 80 C. Both of these observations suggest that there is a competitive adsorption between H2O and H2S, and lowering the adsorbed quantity of moisture, either with an increased activation temperature or with an increased adsorption temperature, increases the H2S capacity."
[4] "In the absence of any known method to suppress this reaction, the authors suggest short-time techniques such as PSA/VSA."
[5] "The adsorption isotherms of these compounds were found to be quite different, with saturation loadings extrapolated from the fitted adsorption isotherm for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS being 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several challenges and limitations. According to quote [1], the process involves adsorption at 300 C with a coal syngas composition containing various gases and H2S, followed by regeneration at 550 C with alternating oxidation-reduction treatments. This indicates the complexity involved in operating such a process. 

In quote [2], the simulated isotherms for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)) highlight the distinction between narrow and large-pore regimes, suggesting that the structure of the adsorbent plays a crucial role in adsorption efficiency. 

Quote [3] notes an increase in H2S capacity when the adsorption temperature is raised, implying a competitive adsorption between H2O and H2S. This observation could be leveraged to optimize the process by reducing moisture content, either through increased activation or adsorption temperatures.

Quote [4] recommends short-time techniques like PSA/VSA to mitigate the conversion of H2S to COS during the process, indicating a need for better control mechanisms to maintain selectivity.

Finally, quote [5] presents the distinct saturation loadings for different compounds under adsorption isotherms, emphasizing the need for careful selection of adsorbents and operating conditions to achieve optimal performance in the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂存在一系列挑战和限制。根据引用[1]，该过程涉及在300°C下吸附含有多类气体和H2S的煤合成气，并在550°C下通过交替的氧化还原处理进行再生。这表明操作此类过程的复杂性。

引用[2]中对呼吸MOF（MIL-53（Cr））的模拟等温线指出窄孔和大孔体系的区别，表明吸附剂结构在吸附效率中扮演着关键角色。

引用[3]提到当吸附温度提高时，H2S容量增加，暗示H2O和H2S之间存在竞争吸附。这一观察结果可能被用来优化过程，通过提高激活或吸附温度来减少水分含量。

引用[4]建议使用PSA/VSA等短时间技术来抑制H2S转化为COS，表明需要更好的控制机制以保持选择性。

最后，引用[5]展示了不同化合物在吸附等温线下的不同饱和负载量，强调了选择合适的吸附剂和操作条件以实现最优性能的必要性。
