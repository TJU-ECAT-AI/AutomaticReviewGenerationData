Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this method offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, mainly its ability to selectively produce propylene. Different catalysts such as noble metals like palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and rhodium (Rh), as well as mixed metal oxides and supported catalysts, have been utilized in this process. However, critical challenges include catalyst deactivation, which might arise from sintering, poisoning by sulfur and nitrogen compounds, and instability over time. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more robust catalysts that are less prone to deactivation and incorporating protective measures to mitigate poisoning effects. Research could also focus on improving the stability of the catalysts to extend their operational lifespan, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢的氧化剂，这种方法在与其他氧化剂相比时，主要优点在于其能够选择性地生成丙烯。不同的催化剂，如贵金属如钯（Pd）、铂（Pt）和铑（Rh），以及混合金属氧化物和负载催化剂，已经在这一过程中被使用。然而，关键的挑战包括催化剂失活，这可能由烧结、硫和氮化合物中毒以及随时间的不稳定性引起。解决这些限制的方法可以涉及开发更坚固的催化剂，它们不易失活，并采取保护措施来减轻中毒效应。研究还可以集中在提高催化剂的稳定性上，以延长其使用寿命，使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项。
