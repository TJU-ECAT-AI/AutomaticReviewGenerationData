[1] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."

[2] "It should be noted here that, for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), isotherms were simulated for two different rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and the large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm."

[3] "The authors observed poor thermal desorption at 350 C, indicating no physisorption and the formation of stable sulfur polymers which further compromised thermal regeneration."

[4] "The adsorption isotherms of these compounds were found to be quite different, with saturation loadings extrapolated from the fitted adsorption isotherm for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS being 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively."

[5] "This seminal discovery enabling uniform pore sizes of mesoporous materials with high surface areas opened up a new area for novel heterogeneous catalysts."

[6] "It was observed that the sulfur capacity oscillated, reproducibly, with the number of cycles rather than monotonically increasing or decreasing."

Answer:

1. Adsorption experiments were conducted at 300°C using a coal syngas mixture containing 23% hydrogen, 29% carbon monoxide, 8% carbon dioxide, 30% water vapor, 10% helium, and 10 ppm hydrogen sulfide. The regeneration process took place at 550°C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure hydrogen and 10% air in argon, with a short argon purge in between.

2. For the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), simulations were carried out for two distinct rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm.

3. On the NaX zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 1.4, the authors observed poor thermal desorption at 350°C, indicating no physisorption and the formation of stable sulfur polymers that hindered thermal regeneration.

4. The adsorption isotherms for CO2, CH4, H2S, and COS showed significant differences, with saturation loadings of 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively, extrapolated from the fitted adsorption isotherm.

5. The discovery of ordered mesoporous molecular sieves with uniform pore sizes of 16-100 Å enabled the creation of novel heterogeneous catalysts.

6. The sulfur capacity of the adsorbent showed oscillations with each cycle, rather than a steady increase or decrease.

1. 吸附实验在300°C下进行，使用煤合成气混合物，包含23%氢、29%一氧化碳、8%二氧化碳、30%水蒸气、10%氦和10 ppm硫化氢。再生过程在550°C下进行，采用纯氢和10%空气在氩气中的交替氧化还原处理，中间有短时间的氩气冲洗。

2. 对于呼吸MOF（MIL-53（Cr）），进行了两种不同的刚性MOF结构的模拟，分别代表实验吸附等温线中的狭窄和大型孔系统。

3. 对于Si/Al比为1.4的NaX沸石，在350°C时观察到贫热脱吸，表明没有物理吸附，并且形成了稳定硫聚合物，进一步阻碍了热再生。

4. CO2、CH4、H2S和COS的吸附等温线显示出显著差异，分别具有9.16、7.25、5.87和3.11 mmol/g的饱和负载量，通过拟合吸附等温线得出。

5. 统一孔径为16-100 Å的有序介孔分子筛的发现开辟了新型异质催化剂的新领域。

6. 吸附剂的硫容量在每个循环中表现出振荡，而不是稳定的增加或减少。
