Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several advantages stand out in comparison to other oxidants. Firstly, N2O offers higher propylene selectivity, making it a favorable choice for propylene production. Multiple catalysts have been utilized in this process, including metals like palladium, ruthenium, and iron, as well as solid acid catalysts and metal oxide catalysts. Despite these benefits, significant challenges exist, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and stability. Coke-like deposits on the catalyst surface can lead to alterations in surface properties and a decrease in activity, posing a major hurdle in achieving consistent and efficient ODHP operations. Addressing these limitations through research and development could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）的氧化脱氢过程中，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O具有更高的丙烯选择性，使其成为生产丙烯的有利选择。在这一过程中，已经应用了多种催化剂，包括钯、钌和铁等金属催化剂，以及固体酸催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂。尽管存在这些优势，但在催化剂失活和稳定性方面仍面临重大挑战。催化剂表面的焦炭状沉积物会导致表面性质变化并降低活性，对实现稳定且高效的ODHP操作构成了障碍。通过研究和发展来解决这些问题，有可能使N2O-ODHP成为可行的工业应用方案。
