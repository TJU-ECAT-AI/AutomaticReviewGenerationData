The use of manganese oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. Manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable, preventing the formation of a carbon layer during the reaction. This contrasts with metal catalysts, which can form a carbon layer, potentially deactivating the catalyst. The low concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere poses a challenge for its widespread use as an oxidant, but the potential recovery of CO2 from industrial and transportation exhaust gases can make it more attractive. The presence of sulfur in the catalyst can prevent coking, enhancing its stability. Among the various catalysts employed in ODHP, manganese oxide catalysts stand out for their effectiveness in converting propane into propylene.

However, challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability persist. The interaction of manganese oxide catalysts with CO2 through a redox mechanism enables high conversions of propane into propylene and other products. To address the issue of catalyst deactivation and instability, strategies could focus on modifying catalysts with other oxides, like potassium, chromium, or lanthanum, which can influence the catalyst's acceptor function and degree of surface oxidation. Rare earth oxides, with properties similar to manganese oxides, can form carbonates of moderate stability, contributing to the catalyst's effectiveness. Research could explore the synergistic effects of combining manganese oxides with other catalyst components to enhance selectivity and stability.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，锰氧化物催化剂具有多个优势，尤其是丙烯选择性。锰氧化物催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性高，在反应过程中不会形成碳层，与金属催化剂形成碳层导致催化剂失活的情况不同。二氧化碳（CO2）在大气中的低浓度是其广泛应用的障碍，但从工业和运输排放气体中回收CO2使其更具吸引力。硫的存在可以防止催化剂结焦，增强其稳定性。在ODHP中使用的各种催化剂中，锰氧化物催化剂因其将丙烷高效转化为丙烯的能力而突出。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性问题仍然存在。通过锰氧化物催化剂与CO2的氧化还原机制实现高丙烷转化为丙烯和其他产品的转化率。为解决催化剂失活和不稳定性问题，策略可能集中在通过添加其他氧化物（如钾、铬或镧）修改催化剂上，以影响催化剂的接受功能和表面氧化程度。具有类似锰氧化物性质的稀土氧化物能够形成稳定度适中的碳酸盐，有助于催化剂的有效性。研究可以探索结合锰氧化物与其他催化剂组分的协同作用，以提高选择性和稳定性。
