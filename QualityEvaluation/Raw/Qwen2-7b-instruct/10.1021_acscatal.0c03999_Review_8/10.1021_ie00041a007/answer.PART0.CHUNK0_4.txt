[1] "Redox reactions with the participation of C02 as an oxidant are more representative in this respect for large- scale C02 use."
[2] "The great interest displayed lately in heterogeneous catalytic reactions of carbon dioxide is caused by two reasons: (1) the necessity to fight the greenhouse effect and 2) the exhaust of carbon raw material sources."
[3] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."
[4] "Redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition seems to play an important role here."
[5] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide is described by the equation where k,, and kred are rate constants of catalyst oxidation and reduction."
[6] "The rate of the catalyst reduction by ethane (0.6 x 10-3 mol/(gh) is close to that of the catalyst reoxidation by COZ (0.7 x mol/(gh))."
