1. Manganese oxide catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction, unlike metal catalysts.
2. The main challenge in the wide use of CO2 is its low atmospheric concentration, which is only 0.03%.
3. The X-ray diffraction study of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst showed the presence of Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases before the reaction, and MnO and MnC03 phases during the reaction, indicating a lack of direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with Si02.
4. The 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz catalyst is highly selective in the formation of Cz-hydrocarbons in the non-steady-state regime.
5. The 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOn catalyst exhibits different properties in methane conversion with CO2, resulting in CO predominance in the reaction products.
6. The rate of catalyst reduction by ethane is nearly equivalent to the rate of catalyst reoxidation by CO2, indicating a balance between the two processes.

1. 钴氧化物催化剂在反应过程中不会形成碳层，而金属催化剂会。
2. CO2广泛使用的主要障碍是其在大气中的浓度极低，仅为0.03%。
3. 对于Mn-Cr-O/SiOn催化剂的X射线衍射研究显示，在反应前存在Mn304和Mn2O3相，而在反应中则观察到MnO和MnC03相，这表明锰与铬氧化物与Si02之间缺乏直接作用。
4. 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz催化剂在非稳态状态下对Cz-烃的形成具有高度的选择性。
5. 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOn催化剂在甲烷与CO2的转化中表现出不同的特性，导致反应产物中CO的主导地位。
6. 催化剂由乙烷还原的速度几乎等于由CO2重新氧化的速度，表明两个过程之间的平衡状态。
