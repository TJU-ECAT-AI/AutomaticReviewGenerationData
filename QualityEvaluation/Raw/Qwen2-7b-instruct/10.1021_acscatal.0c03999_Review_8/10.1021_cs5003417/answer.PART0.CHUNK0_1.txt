Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that N2O is favored for its ability to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, along with the potential for reduced formation of undesired byproducts. This process typically employs a range of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. However, significant challenges persist, particularly related to catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, which hinder the practical application of N2O-ODHP.
