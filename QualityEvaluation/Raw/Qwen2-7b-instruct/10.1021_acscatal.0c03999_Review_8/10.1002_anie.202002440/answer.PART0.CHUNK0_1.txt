[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "We detected NO on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[5] "However, the detection of methyl radical over BOx/SiO2 (Supporting Information, FigureS21) in the absence of NO suggests that radical chemistry over boron-based catalysts for ODHP reaction is indeed present regardless of NO presence."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers certain advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. One of the key advantages is its ability to selectively convert propane to propylene with minimal formation of other by-products, particularly carbon oxides. This makes N2O a potentially more favorable choice for industrial applications where propylene purity is crucial.

2. Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide being among the most prominent. These materials are chosen for their high efficiency and selectivity in converting propane to propylene. The selectivity and efficiency of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as surface chemistry and the presence of active sites capable of facilitating the desired reaction pathways.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are significant limitations that hinder practical implementation. Catalysts may degrade over time due to exposure to reactants and products, leading to reduced activity and selectivity. Additionally, maintaining the stability of the catalyst under operational conditions can be difficult, requiring careful control of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios.

4. Strategies to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more robust catalyst formulations that can withstand harsh operating conditions without degradation. Research into modifying the surface properties of catalysts to enhance their stability and selectivity for propylene production is crucial. Furthermore, the integration of advanced monitoring techniques, such as the synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), can enable real-time analysis of reaction progress and product distribution, facilitating optimization of the process parameters to maintain high yields and selectivities.

5. Considering the potential of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP, future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design and operation conditions to maximize propylene yield and purity. This includes investigating the role of N2O in the reaction mechanism and exploring synergies with other catalyst materials or additives that could enhance selectivity and stability. Additionally, the impact of N2O on the overall economics of the process, such as the cost of the oxidant and the potential for waste management, should also be considered in the evaluation of its feasibility for industrial-scale application.

1. 硝酸氧化氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，与其它氧化剂相比。关键的优势在于其能够以较低的副产物形成率选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，这使其在工业应用中可能成为更可取的选择，特别是当丙烯纯度至关重要时。

2. 在ODHP过程中使用多种催化剂，其中六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氧化物支持是其中最具代表性的一些材料。这些材料因其高效性和丙烯选择性而被选用来转化丙烷。这些催化剂的选择性和效率受表面化学和能促进所需反应途径的活性位点的影响因素影响。

3. 催化剂的失活和稳定性问题是在ODHP过程中实现实际应用的主要限制。催化剂可能会因暴露于反应物和产物而降解，导致活动性和选择性降低。此外，在操作条件下保持催化剂稳定性可能是困难的，需要精确控制诸如温度、压力和反应物比例等参数。

4. 为了使N2O-ODHP更有可能成为实用选项，可以采用策略来解决这些限制并增强其可行性。这包括开发更耐用的催化剂配方，以在恶劣的操作条件下保持不变。研究修改催化剂表面性质以增强其选择性和丙烯生产是至关重要的。此外，集成先进的监测技术，如同步辐射真空紫外线光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS），可以实现对反应进程和产品分布的实时分析，从而优化工艺参数以维持高产率和选择性。

5. 考虑到N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的潜力，未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计和操作条件，以最大化丙烯产量和纯度。这包括调查N2O在反应机制中的作用以及探索与其他催化剂材料或添加剂协同工作的可能性，以增强选择性和稳定性。此外，N2O对整个过程经济性的评估，包括氧化剂成本和废物管理的可能性，也应在评估其工业规模应用的可行性时考虑。
