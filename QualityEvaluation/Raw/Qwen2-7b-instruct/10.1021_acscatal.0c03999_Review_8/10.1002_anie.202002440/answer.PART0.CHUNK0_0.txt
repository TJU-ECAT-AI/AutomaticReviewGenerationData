[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
[5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."
[6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. One key advantage is the high efficiency of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts in facilitating the ODHP process, particularly through the involvement of gas-phase radical mechanisms. Direct experimental evidence has been provided for the presence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, which supports the existence of gas-phase radical pathways.

In the context of catalysts employed in this process, h-BN stands out for its ability to selectively convert propane to propylene with minimal formation of carbon oxides. This is in contrast to traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts, which often produce significant amounts of carbon oxides. The ODHP reaction over h-BN follows a different mechanism, primarily involving the heterolytic cleavage of propane's CH bonds on the surface of the boron oxide sites, rather than through conventional redox reactions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include the potential for catalyst degradation over time and the requirement for specific conditions to maintain optimal performance. Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of more durable catalyst materials or the implementation of process conditions that minimize catalyst exposure to deactivating agents. Research directions could focus on improving catalyst stability, enhancing selectivity, and optimizing operating parameters to achieve a more sustainable and economically viable ODHP process using N2O as an oxidant.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。一个关键的优势是，六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氧化物支持催化剂在促进ODHP过程方面的高效率，特别是通过涉及气相自由基途径。已经提供了直接实验证据，证明了在硼基催化剂上进行ODHP反应时存在气相自由基路径中的甲基自由基（CH3.）的存在。

在所使用的催化剂上下文中，h-BN因其能够以极低的碳氧化物形成率选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯而脱颖而出。这与传统的以过渡金属氧化物为基础的红ox催化剂形成对比，这些催化剂通常会产生大量碳氧化物。ODHP反应在h-BN中遵循不同的机制，主要涉及在硼氧化物位点表面裂解丙烷的CH键，而不是通过传统的氧化还原反应。

催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战包括催化剂随时间降解的可能性以及维持最佳性能所需的特定条件。应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料或实施减少催化剂接触有害活性物质的过程条件。研究方向可以集中在提高催化剂稳定性、增强选择性和优化操作参数，以实现使用N2O作为氧化剂的更可持续和经济可行的ODHP过程。
