[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[4] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[5] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."
[6] "Combined with this experimental phenomenon, we can speculate that propyl radicals are not formed, or the contribution is very limit in this reaction system."
[7] "This suggests that the working BN catalysts and the BOx/SiO2 indeed may have similar surface-active sites for the ODHP reaction."
[8] "In our DFT study, a surface model was constructed from B2O3 containing surface BO3 units (Supporting Information, FigureS23; further discussion of surface model therein)."
[9] "As shown in Figure3, the first step in ODHP is the CH activation of propane, which we find to most likely occur via a heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active site (Supporting Information, FigureS28)."
[10] "This step occurs with a barrier of 1.73eV to form a co-adsorbed B-C3H7 on the boron and a hydrogen on the B-O-B oxygen (steps AC in Figure3)."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights the efficiency of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst for this process. However, the reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of radical chemistry, remain unclear. The first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts demonstrates the existence of gas-phase radical pathways. This finding provides new insights into understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts. The detection of nitric oxide (NO) on the catalyst during the reaction further elucidates the complexity of the process. The direct detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts confirms the presence of radical chemistry in this system. The absence of propyl radicals suggests that the formation of C1 and C2 products might occur through competitive pathways on the surface or in the gas-phase. The DFT calculations support the proposed mechanism, showing that the first step in ODHP involves the heterolytic cleavage of propane's CH bonds over a BO pair in a BO3 active site, leading to propene formation. The redox-poor surface of the catalyst catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by the reduction of gas-phase oxidants, akin to other redox-poor oxides like MgO. This mechanism offers a potential pathway for selective alkane conversions in the absence of conventional oxidants.

Challenges in making N2O-ODHP a practical option include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Strategies to address these limitations might involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability, optimizing reaction conditions to prevent deactivation, and exploring the use of additives or modifiers that could improve the catalytic activity and selectivity. Research directions could focus on developing new catalyst materials with enhanced stability and selectivity, investigating the impact of operating parameters on catalyst performance, and refining the reaction mechanism to better understand the role of radical chemistry in the ODHP process. These efforts could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using nitrous oxide as an oxidant.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，文献指出六方硼氮化物（h-BN）作为这种催化剂的有效性。然而，反应机制，特别是关于系统中自由基化学的机制，仍然未知。首次直接实验证据显示，在以硼基催化剂为载体的ODHP反应中存在气相甲基自由基（CH3.），揭示了气相自由基途径的存在。这一发现为理解硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了新的见解。检测到ODHP反应过程中BN-T-high催化剂上的硝酸盐（NO）进一步阐明了该过程的复杂性。直接检测由h-BN和BOx/SiO2催化剂催化下的气相甲基自由基证实了该系统中存在的自由基化学。丙基自由基的缺失表明C1和C2产品的形成可能通过表面或气相竞争途径发生。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持提出的机制，显示ODHP过程的第一步涉及在BO3活性位点上对丙烷的CH键的异裂，导致丙烯形成。催化剂表面的还原性较差催化反应通过异裂CH键，随后通过气相氧化剂的还原来实现，类似于其他还原性较差的氧化物，如MgO。这一机制为在没有传统氧化剂的情况下选择性烷烃转化提供了一条潜在途径。

N2O-ODHP实现实用化的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题。解决这些限制的策略可能包括改进催化剂设计以提高稳定性，优化反应条件以防止失活，并探索可以改善催化活性和选择性的添加剂或改性剂。研究方向可以集中在开发具有增强稳定性和选择性的新催化剂材料，探究操作参数对催化剂性能的影响，并细化反应机制以更好地理解自由基化学在ODHP过程中的作用。

这些努力可能导致使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢过程更加高效和可持续。
