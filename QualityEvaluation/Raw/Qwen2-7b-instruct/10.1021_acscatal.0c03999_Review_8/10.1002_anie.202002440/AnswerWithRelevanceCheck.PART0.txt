          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Recent studies have identified hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, although the detailed reaction mechanisms, especially those involving radical chemistry, remain unclear. The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, confirmed by online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), provides new insights into the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process.

          The results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 forming through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by BOB oxygen is explained by the surface's poor redox ability, distinguishing it from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant like O2, the C3H7 intermediate is relatively inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, but gas-phase unimolecular cleavage can still occur.

          These findings are significant for understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

          使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，尤其在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，与其它氧化剂相比。最近的研究已经确认六方硼氮化物（h-BN）是ODHP过程中的高效催化剂，尽管此过程的具体反应机制，特别是涉及到自由基化学的部分，仍然难以捉摸。在线同步辐射真空紫外光离子质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）证实了在硼基催化剂上进行ODHP反应时存在气相甲基自由基（CH3.），这一发现为理解该过程中存在的气相自由基途径提供了新见解。

          密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的结果表明，丙烯主要在催化剂表面上从丙烷的CH键激活产生，C2和C1产品则通过表面介导和气相途径形成。随后由BOB氧引发的CH激活的高热力学（和动力学）不利性是由表面的弱氧化还原能力所解释的，这与传统ODHP催化剂如钒酸盐和其他过渡金属氧化物有别。在缺乏如O2这样的氧化剂时，C3H7中间体相对不易于表面介导的CH激活和进一步氧化，但气相单分子裂解仍可能发生。

          这些发现对于理解硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制以及开发用于烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的高效选择性催化剂具有重要意义。

          [1] "The ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism"
          [2] "hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts"
          [3] "hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts involve the gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways with unambiguously identified gas-phase methyl radicals"
          [4] "both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products"

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

          当由过渡金属氧化物催化剂催化时，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程通常遵循氧化还原机制。六方硼氮化物（h-BN）对碳氧化物的选择性很低，但与基于钒（V）的催化剂相比，对乙烯的选择性相对较高。在ODHP过程中使用h-BN催化剂涉及气相自由基机制和途径，已明确识别出气相甲基自由基。表面介导和气相反应均对C1和C2产品的形成有所贡献，而主要通过表面反应，涉及丙烷的CH键裂解，形成了丙烯。

          The first direct experimental proof of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction over boron-based catalysts was accomplished using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). This method allowed for the detection of gas-phase radicals in the ODHP process. The detection of NO on the BN-T-high catalyst during the ODHP reaction at 600°C, as observed with SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), indicates the influence of NO on the reaction system. Our SVUV-PIMS results directly and unambiguously revealed the presence of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. The recent demonstration in catalyst-free propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in empty reactors at approximately 500°C, in the presence of O2, showed that the presence of NO can affect the formation of gas-phase radicals in the alkane reaction system.
