The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was explored. Ferric zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) catalysts were synthesized through grafting techniques. Propylene selectivity is crucial for assessing the efficiency of ODHP methods. A significant hurdle in the ODHP process involves catalyst deactivation and instability.
