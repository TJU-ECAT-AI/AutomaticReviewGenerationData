Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Different catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, were utilized in this process. However, the study also highlighted challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Potential strategies to overcome these limitations include altering the catalyst composition or adjusting operational parameters.
