Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this study emphasizes its application over other oxidants, focusing on propylene selectivity. The Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared through grafting, is utilized in this process. The document discusses the advantages of N2O in terms of selectivity and compares it with alternative oxidants. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, and potential solutions are suggested to enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation.
