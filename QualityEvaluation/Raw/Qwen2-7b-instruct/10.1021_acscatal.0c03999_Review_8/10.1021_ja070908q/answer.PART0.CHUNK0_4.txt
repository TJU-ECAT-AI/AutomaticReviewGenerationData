The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, primarily due to its low cost and environmental benefits. In this process, N2O has been recognized as a promising alternative for propylene production. Various catalysts, including metal-based catalysts such as copper, silver, and molybdenum, as well as oxide-supported catalysts, have been utilized in the ODHP process. Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and instability, which hinder the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP technology on an industrial scale.
