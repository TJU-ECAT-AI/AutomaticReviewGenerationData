Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants are evident due to its environmental benefits. The process typically employs catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions. However, critical challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability have posed limitations for the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. Strategies or research directions to address these limitations might involve developing more stable catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, or exploring innovative ways to mitigate deactivation mechanisms.
