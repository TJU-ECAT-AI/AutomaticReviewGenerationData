1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is considered as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its potential environmental benefits. Compared to other oxidants, N2O exhibits advantages in propylene selectivity. A range of catalysts, such as ceria-based materials, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability persist.
2. Strategies to tackle these limitations might include altering the catalyst composition or adjusting operational conditions.
