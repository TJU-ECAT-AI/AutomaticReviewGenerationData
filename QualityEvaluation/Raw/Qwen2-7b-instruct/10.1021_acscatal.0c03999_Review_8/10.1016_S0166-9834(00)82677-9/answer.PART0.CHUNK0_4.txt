[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding uia carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures."
[4] "Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process."
[5] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[6] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[7] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane."
[8] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[9] "As can be seen in Table I practically no alkenes are formed."
[10] "Although this hydrogenolysis reaction is unfavorable because it leads to products less valuable than propane, it also has a positive effect because it causes a diminishing of the hydrogen partial pressure and thus will stimulate the propane dehydrogenation."

1. Zeolite H-ZSM-5 is a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions due to its strong acidic properties, making it ideal for converting highly reactive small alkenes into a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. This conversion is often performed at moderate temperatures, utilizing the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes from methanol, as demonstrated in the Mobil MTG process.

2. The 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples exhibited different catalytic behavior compared to other catalysts. The Pt particles within the zeolite pores near the acid sites positively influenced the propane conversion.

3. The H/C ratio remained constant during the reaction, indicating no loss of hydrogen in molecular form. Hydrogen from propene formation was utilized for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.

4. Practically no alkenes were formed during the conversion process, possibly due to the presence of Pt particles within the zeolite pores. 

5. The hydrogenolysis reaction, though unfavorable as it results in less valuable products, has a positive impact by reducing hydrogen pressure, stimulating the propane dehydrogenation.

1. 由于其强大的酸性特性，沸石H-ZSM-5是烃反应的理想催化剂，特别是用于将高度反应性的小型烯烃转化为烷烃和芳香烃混合物。这些转化通常在中等温度下进行，利用甲醇的酸催化形成小型烯烃，这是在美孚MTG工艺中所采用的方法。

2. 0.4%和4%的Pt/H-ZSM-5样品与其它催化剂相比，表现出不同的催化行为。铂颗粒位于接近酸性位点的沸石孔内，对丙烷转化产生了积极影响。

3. 反应过程中氢/C比保持不变，表明没有分子形式的氢损失。丙烯形成的氢被用于氢化和氢解。

4. 实际上几乎没有烯烃形成，这可能归因于铂颗粒存在于沸石孔内。

5. 尽管氢解反应不那么有利，因为它导致价值较低的产品形成，但它通过降低氢压，刺激丙烷脱氢而产生积极影响。
