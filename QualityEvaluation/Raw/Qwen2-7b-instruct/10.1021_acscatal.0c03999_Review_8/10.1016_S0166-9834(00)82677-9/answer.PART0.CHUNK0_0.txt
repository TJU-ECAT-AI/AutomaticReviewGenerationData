[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[4] "The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures."
[5] "In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures,over Pt/H-ZSM-5. Thus we got information about the initial reactions occurring before the formation of aromatics starts."
[6] "The conversion experiments however, were badly reproducible. At 300C the initial conversion to higher products fluctuates around 7 C%."
[7] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[8] "The main product formed initially was butane (see Table I)."
[9] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[10] "The conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[11] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[12] "The conversion started at about 200C and increased with temperature to about 18% for the 4 wt% and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C."
[13] "The amount of propene compared with the 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, was higher whereas no products with more than 3 carbon atoms were formed."
[14] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[15] "Butanes appear to be the main higher products formed at low temperatures from propane over the bifunctional catalysts."
[16] "Taking into account the low coverage of the acid sites, it is likely that both species will react again with propene to form C7 and C8 respectively."
[17] "When we look more closely to the butane formed over the Pt loaded catalysts (Figure 5) we see that theiso/normal butane ratio in the temperature range ZOO-330C lies below the thermodynamical value."
[18] "We think that this suggests that during our propane conversion experiments the initially formed propene oligomerizes to linear or monobrached (LS) carbenium ions."
[19] "Consequently also low hydrocarbons (methane, ethane), and mainly saturated hydrocarbons are formed."
[20] "Indirectly the obtained results suggest that, most likely due to steric constraints, at higher temperatures propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not discussed in the provided document. The document focuses on the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons over a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst under moderate temperatures. There are no details regarding the advantages of using N2O over other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, or the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Furthermore, there is no mention of strategies or research directions to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

Answer: No relevant quotes for the provided questions exist in the document.
