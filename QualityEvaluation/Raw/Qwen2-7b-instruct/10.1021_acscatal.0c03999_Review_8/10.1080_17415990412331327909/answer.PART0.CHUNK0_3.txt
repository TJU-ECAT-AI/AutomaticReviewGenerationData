[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[2] "Therefore, it is still very challenging to be able to carry out the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a high propene yield."
[3] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."
[4] "It has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."
[5] "For catalytic ODH experiments, the catalyst was packed at the beginning of the hot zone where the feed gases were introduced."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, high selectivity losses occur with increased conversion, primarily due to propene re-adsorption followed by oxidation to CO and CO2, resulting in propene yields below 30%. Achieving a high propene yield remains a significant challenge.

2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has not been extensively explored as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The literature does not compare N2O to other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity or discuss the specific catalysts employed in this process. 

3. The introduction of H2S in the feed gas during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times significantly enhances propene yield. This method demonstrates promise for improving propene production efficiency.

4. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was utilized in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane experiments, packed at the start of the hot zone where feed gases were introduced.

5. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP involving N2O might include optimizing catalyst composition, enhancing catalyst support materials, or employing innovative synthesis methods to improve catalyst longevity and selectivity. Research could also focus on developing more efficient reaction conditions, modifying catalyst surfaces, or integrating post-reaction treatments to regenerate catalysts. These approaches aim to make N2O-ODHP a more practical industrial option.

1. 在丙烷脱氢氧化生成丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，选择性损失特别显著，主要是由于丙烯的重新吸附以及随后被氧化成二氧化碳和一氧化碳导致丙烯产率低于30%。实现高丙烯产率仍然具有挑战性。

2. 至今尚未见有文献探讨将亚硝酸氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷脱氢氧化过程中的应用，以及与其它氧化剂相比，N2O对丙烯选择性的优势。关于用于此反应过程的具体催化剂信息，文献中没有提供详细说明。

3. 在短停留时间内向丙烷脱氢氧化生成丙烯过程中引入硫化氢（H2S），可以显著提高丙烯产率。这一方法显示出提高丙烯生产效率的潜力。

4. 在使用亚硝酸氮（N2O）进行催化丙烷脱氢氧化实验时，催化剂被放置于热区的前端，此处是引入气态反应物的位置。

5. 针对使用N2O进行丙烷脱氢氧化反应中催化剂的失活和稳定性问题，可能采取的策略包括优化催化剂组成、增强支撑材料性能、或采用创新合成方法以延长催化剂寿命和提高选择性。研究也可以集中在开发更高效的反应条件、修改催化剂表面、或者整合后处理步骤以再生催化剂。这些方法旨在使N2O-丙烷脱氢氧化成为更具可行性的工业应用选项。
