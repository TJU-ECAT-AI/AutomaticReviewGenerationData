[1] "Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."
[2] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems, with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[3] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."
[4] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[5] "In comparison, V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C."
[6] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[7] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1."
[8] "Overall the yield of propene was noted to increase (dashed line in figure 1B) with an increase in the temperature, although the selectivity to propene declined significantly."
[9] "Further work is currently in progress to identify more active and selective catalysts, and also to elucidate the active role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is discussed in the literature. N2O has advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly in the context of catalysts employed for this process. Vanadium- and molybdate-based oxide catalysts are highlighted as alternatives to noble metal Pt catalyst systems, which have been the focus of previous studies. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the feed gas significantly enhances the yield of propene during ODHP at short contact times, as shown in the study. The selectivity losses in propene yield with increasing conversion are attributed to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2). 

V2O5/A12O3 catalysts are noted for their ability to selectively form COx rather than propene in the absence of H2S. However, in the presence of H2S, these catalysts demonstrate improved selectivity for propene formation. The literature reports that the rate of reaction of oxygen with H2S is significantly higher than with hydrocarbons, suggesting that the sulfur dioxide (SO2) product acts as an active species similar to oxygen in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Higher temperatures lead to increased propene yield, albeit with a decline in selectivity. 

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, necessitating further research. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more practical option involve identifying more active and selective catalysts and elucidating the role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. These directions aim to optimize the process and enhance propene yields efficiently.

文献中讨论了在短接触时间内使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在催化剂使用时表现出在丙烯选择性方面的优势。特别指出的是，以钒和钼为基的氧化物催化剂作为一种替代贵金属铂催化剂系统的可能性，受到了关注。研究显示，在引入硫化氢（H2S）的情况下，通过优化反应条件，能够显著提高短接触时间下丙烷氧化脱氢过程的丙烯产率。

随着转化率的增加，丙烯选择性损失的问题被提及，这主要归因于丙烯再吸附和随后氧化成二氧化碳（CO和CO2），导致丙烯产率低于30%。在没有H2S存在时，V2O5/A12O3催化剂在700°C下显示出选择性形成COx而非丙烯的特性。然而，当添加H2S时，这些催化剂表现出对丙烯形成的高选择性。

文献提到，在反应过程中观察到大量二氧化硫（SO2）产物的存在，这表明氧气与H2S反应的速度远高于与烃类化合物的反应速度。由此推断，SO2产物可以作为类似于氧气的活性物种，在选择性氧化脱氢过程中催化丙烷转化为丙烯。提高温度可以增加丙烯产率，但同时丙烯的选择性会显著下降。

催化剂失活和稳定性问题被提出，并需要进一步研究来解决。为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项，策略包括识别更活跃和选择性的催化剂以及阐明H2S在氧化脱氢过程中的作用。这些方向旨在优化过程并提高丙烯产率的效率。
