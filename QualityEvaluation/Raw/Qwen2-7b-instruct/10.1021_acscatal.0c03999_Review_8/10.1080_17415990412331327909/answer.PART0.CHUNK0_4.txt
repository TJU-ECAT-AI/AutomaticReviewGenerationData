[1] "Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."
[2] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."
[3] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[4] "In recent years attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention."
[5] "Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted in to a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times."
[6] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[7] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study. Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights its potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, the introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the feed mixture enhances the yield of propene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at short contact times. This improvement is attributed to the suppression of propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, which typically limits propene yields in ODHP processes.

The catalysts employed in this process include γ-Al2O3 and V2O5/Al2O3. The V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst, in particular, demonstrates high selectivity for the formation of propene in the presence of H2S, offering an olefin selectivity of up to 81% at high propane conversion rates. This indicates that N2O-ODHP could potentially be a feasible option for practical implementation with proper optimization of the reaction conditions and catalyst selection.

However, critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are mentioned. The literature proposes strategies or research directions to address these limitations. One approach involves identifying more active and selective catalysts that can maintain high propene yields even under varying conditions. Another strategy could focus on understanding the active role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, potentially leading to the development of enhanced catalyst formulations or reaction conditions that optimize the use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP.

Overall, while the literature demonstrates the potential of N2O-ODHP for producing propene with high selectivity, addressing catalyst deactivation and stability remains an area of ongoing research that could make this process more practical and efficient for industrial application.

在氧化脱氢作用下丙烷生成丙烯的过程中，利用二氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂分析其优势。文献表明，在短接触时间内引入硫化氢（H2S）到反应气体中可以显著提高丙烯的产率。这一改进归因于对丙烯再吸附和随后氧化为二氧化碳的抑制，这通常是丙烷氧化脱氢过程中导致丙烯产率低于30%的原因。

在该过程中使用的催化剂包括γ-Al2O3和V2O5/Al2O3。其中，V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在存在H2S时显示出高选择性生成丙烯的能力，其提供的烯烃选择性高达81%，在高丙烷转化率下。这表明使用N2O作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢过程有可能成为工业应用的可行选项，前提是正确优化反应条件和催化剂选择。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题是关键挑战。文献提出了策略或研究方向来解决这些问题。一种方法是识别更活跃和选择性的催化剂，即使在变化条件下也能保持高丙烯产率。另一种策略可能专注于理解H2S在氧化脱氢过程中的活性作用，从而可能引导开发增强的催化剂配方或反应条件，以优化N2O-ODHP过程的使用。

总的来说，虽然文献显示了N2O-ODHP在高选择性生产丙烯方面的潜力，但解决催化剂失活和稳定性的挑战仍然是正在进行的研究领域，这将使该过程更加实用和高效地应用于工业应用。
