[1] "Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."
[2] "For the propane ODH, up to 60% selectivity to total olefins (propene selectivity below 30%) at nearly 100% conversion of propane has been achieved with a catalyst contact time of 5 ms at 800–1000 °C."
[3] "In addition, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,can effectively promote the selectivity for propene."
[4] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[5] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can offer several advantages over other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O promotes the selectivity for propene formation, especially in comparison to CO2. This makes it an attractive alternative for enhancing propylene yields in the ODHP process. Various catalysts, including vanadium- and molybdate-based oxide catalysts, have been employed in this process. However, the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and instability remain critical limitations. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing reaction conditions, developing more stable catalyst materials, or exploring synergistic effects with other promoters like H2S. Research directions could focus on identifying more active and selective catalysts, understanding the role of different oxidants in the ODHP mechanism, and improving the overall efficiency and stability of the process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂可以提供几种相对于其他氧化剂的优势。文献中提到，N2O能够有效促进丙烯选择性形成，特别是在与CO2相比时。这使得它成为提高ODHP过程丙烯产量的有吸引力的选择。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括范德华-和钼基氧化物催化剂，在此过程中。然而，催化剂失活和不稳定性的问题仍然是关键的限制因素。为了应对这些局限性，可能的策略包括优化反应条件、开发更稳定的催化剂材料或探索与H2S等其他促进剂的协同作用。研究方向可以集中在识别更活跃和选择性的催化剂、理解不同氧化剂在ODHP机制中的作用以及提高过程的整体效率和稳定性上。
