[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[2] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."
[3] "The effects of temperature on the catalytic ODH performance of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S with a 0.005 s contact time are shown in figure 1. This figure shows that the conversion of C3H8 increased with reaction temperature, whereas that of H2S appeared to decrease (figure 1A), while nearly all O2 was consumed at the studied temperatures ranging from 500700 C."
[4] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[5] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study. Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity as conversion increases due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to yields lower than 30%. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the feed gas and optimization of reaction conditions can significantly enhance propene yield.

2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The study utilizes vanadium-alumina (V2O5/A12O3) catalysts, showing that H2S promotes propene formation even at short contact times. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability issues, particularly related to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2).

3. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize side reactions, and enhancing the efficiency of H2S utilization in the system. Research could focus on understanding the mechanism of H2S interaction with the catalyst to improve propene yield and selectivity.

1. 特别是在丙烷脱氢制丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性损失非常严重，这主要归因于丙烯的再吸附和随后氧化为二氧化碳（CO和CO2），导致丙烯产率低于30%。

2. 研究表明，在短停留时间内向丙烷氧化脱氢过程中引入硫化氢（H2S）可以显著提高丙烯产量。这表明，通过在进料中加入H2S并优化反应条件，可以实现高产丙烯。

3. 在使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，与其它氧化剂相比，它可能具有提高丙烯选择性的潜力。该研究使用了钒-氧化铝（V2O5/A12O3）催化剂，发现H2S的加入甚至在极短停留时间内都能有效促进丙烯形成。面临的挑战包括催化剂的失活和稳定性问题，特别是碳氧化物（CO和CO2）的生成。

4. 为了使N2O-ODHP更适用于实际应用，可以采取策略来解决这些限制，包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂、优化反应条件以减少副反应，并提高系统中H2S的利用效率。研究可以集中在理解催化剂与H2S的相互作用机制，以提高丙烯产率和选择性。
