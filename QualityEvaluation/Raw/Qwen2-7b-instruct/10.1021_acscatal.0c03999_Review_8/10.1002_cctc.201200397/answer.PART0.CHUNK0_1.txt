[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[3] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[4] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "In exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sites-reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Adding 0.5wt% Ni to the Cr/Si catalyst improved stability and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.
2. The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst produced propylene effectively in the ODHP process.
3. Ni promotes CO2 dissociation into CO and activated oxygen, enhancing the reaction's oxidizing capability.
4. The three-step TPR analysis confirmed CO2's enhanced oxidizing ability, aiding in the regeneration of active Cr3+ sites.
5. Ni retained the catalyst's active Cr3+ state, preventing its rapid transformation into inactive Cr2+.

1. 添加0.5wt% Ni到Cr/Si催化剂后，ODHP反应中的催化活性和选择性得到提高。
2. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂在ODHP过程中有效地产生了丙烯。
3. Ni促进了CO2的分解为CO和激活氧，增强了反应的氧化能力。
4. 三步TPR分析证实了CO2增强的氧化能力，有助于活性Cr3+状态的再生。
5. Ni保留了催化剂的活性Cr3+状态，防止其迅速转变为无活性的Cr2+。
