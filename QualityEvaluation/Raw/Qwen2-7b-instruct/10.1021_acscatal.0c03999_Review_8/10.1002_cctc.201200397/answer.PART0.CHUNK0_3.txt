[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "CO2 can also be used as an oxygen transfer agent or as a soft oxidant."
[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction."
[4] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[5] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[6] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[7] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process benefits from the utilization of greenhouse gas CO2 as a soft oxidant, which eliminates coke deposition and facilitates the reoxidation of reduced active phases. The challenge lies in the rapid deactivation of CrOx/silica catalysts due to coke deposition and reduction of active sites, transforming coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ into the inactive Cr2+ state. 

Strategies to address these limitations involve the introduction of Ni as a promoter, enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2 through its dissociation to CO and generation of activated oxygen (O*ads). This leads to the reoxidation of Cr2+ back to Cr3+, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction. The use of Ni promotes stable production of propylene by maintaining the active Cr3+ phase, thus stabilizing the catalyst and making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

在丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，该过程从温室气体CO2作为软氧化剂的利用中获益，这消除了焦炭沉积并促进了活性位点的重新氧化。挑战在于CrOx/silica催化剂的快速失活，由于焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原，导致配合不饱和的Cr3+转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。

为了解决这些限制，可以通过将Ni引入作为促进剂，通过Ni对CO2的分解产生CO和活性氧（O*ads），从而增强CO2的氧化能力。这导致Cr2+的重新氧化回Cr3+，这是ODHP反应中的活性位点。通过Ni的使用，可以实现稳定的丙烯生产，维持活性的Cr3+相，从而稳定催化剂，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择。
