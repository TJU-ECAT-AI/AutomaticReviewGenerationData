The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It allows for the utilization of the greenhouse gas CO2, making the process environmentally friendly. However, CO2's limited oxidizing ability poses a challenge in reoxidizing reduced CrOx species, which are crucial for the ODHP reaction. To address this limitation and maintain a stable selectivity for propylene, the development of a suitable promoter is essential. Nitrous oxide has been shown to effectively activate CO2, enhancing its oxidizing ability. This is achieved through the dissociation of CO2 to CO and the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads) near Ni-containing catalysts. The regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the presence of Ni has been confirmed through three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. These findings suggest that Ni-based catalysts can improve the stability and selectivity of the ODHP reaction, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂具有多项优势，尤其是在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比。它允许利用温室气体CO2，使该过程更加环保。然而，CO2的有限氧化能力使得重新氧化还原的CrOx物种成为一个挑战，这些物种对于ODHP反应至关重要。为了应对这一限制并保持丙烯的选择性稳定，开发合适的促进剂是必要的。N2O已被证明能够有效激活CO2，增强其氧化能力。这通过CO2的分解为CO以及在其附近Ni催化剂上生成活化氧（O*ads）来实现。通过三步温度程序化还原（TPR）分析和离线X射线光电子能谱（XPS）测量确认了活性Cr3+状态的再生。这些发现表明Ni基催化剂可以提高ODHP反应的稳定性和选择性，从而使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
