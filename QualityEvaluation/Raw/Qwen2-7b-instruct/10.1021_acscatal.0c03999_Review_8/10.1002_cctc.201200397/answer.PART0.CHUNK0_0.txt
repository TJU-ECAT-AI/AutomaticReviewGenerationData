[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[3] "CO2 can also be used as an oxygen transfer agent or as a soft oxidant.5 By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."
[4] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."
[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined from CHNS analysis (CHNS-932; LECO)."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process benefits from enhanced propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to eliminate coke deposition and facilitate the reoxidation of the reduced active phase. The employment of nitrous oxide allows for a more environmentally friendly approach, particularly in the utilization of greenhouse gases as oxygen sources. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are addressed through the introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter. Nickel enables the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which in turn regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) to maintain high stability and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. This approach significantly mitigates the issues caused by coke deposition and the reduction of active CrOx species, transforming them back into the inactive Cr2+ state. To quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, chemical analysis techniques such as CHNS (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulphur) are utilized, providing insights into the effectiveness of the ODHP process and catalyst performance.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，该过程相对于其他氧化剂的优势在于提高了丙烯的选择性，特别是由于它能够消除积碳沉积并促进活性相的重新氧化。通过利用N2O作为氧气源，这种方法在利用温室气体作为氧气来源时显得更为环保。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战通过引入镍（Ni）作为促进剂得以解决。镍能够使CO2分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads），进而再生还原的铬氧化物（CrOx），从而保持高稳定性和选择性。这种方法显著减少了由积碳沉积和活性CrOx物种的减少所引起的问题，将它们转变回无活性的Cr2+状态。为了量化沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量，使用诸如CHNS（碳、氢、氮、硫）这样的化学分析技术，这些技术提供了关于ODHP过程有效性和催化剂性能的见解。
