[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[3] "The Ni-promoted catalyst maintains the active phase of its Cr3+ states."
[4] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

1. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst significantly improves its stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.
2. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst effectively produces propylene in the ODHP reaction.
3. By incorporating Ni, the catalyst maintains its active Cr3+ phase throughout the reaction, contributing to its stability.
4. Ni not only activates CO2, enabling its dissociation into CO and activated O, but also regenerates the active Cr3+ sites in CrOx, ensuring a stable yield of propylene.

1. 向10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni后，该催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的活性和选择性显著提高。
2. Ni促进的Cr/Si催化剂有效生成丙烯在ODHP反应中。
3. 通过引入Ni，催化剂在其反应过程中保持其活性Cr3+相，从而确保其稳定性。
4. Ni不仅激活CO2，使其分解为CO和活化O，还能在CrOx中再生活性Cr3+位点，确保丙烯的稳定产量。
