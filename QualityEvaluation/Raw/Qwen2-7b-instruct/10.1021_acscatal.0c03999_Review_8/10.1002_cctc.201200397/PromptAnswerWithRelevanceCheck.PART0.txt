[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[3] "CO2 can also be used as an oxygen transfer agent or as a soft oxidant.5 By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."
[4] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."
[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined from CHNS analysis (CHNS-932; LECO)."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process benefits from enhanced propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to eliminate coke deposition and facilitate the reoxidation of the reduced active phase. The employment of nitrous oxide allows for a more environmentally friendly approach, particularly in the utilization of greenhouse gases as oxygen sources. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are addressed through the introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter. Nickel enables the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which in turn regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) to maintain high stability and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. This approach significantly mitigates the issues caused by coke deposition and the reduction of active CrOx species, transforming them back into the inactive Cr2+ state. To quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, chemical analysis techniques such as CHNS (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulphur) are utilized, providing insights into the effectiveness of the ODHP process and catalyst performance.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，该过程相对于其他氧化剂的优势在于提高了丙烯的选择性，特别是由于它能够消除积碳沉积并促进活性相的重新氧化。通过利用N2O作为氧气源，这种方法在利用温室气体作为氧气来源时显得更为环保。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战通过引入镍（Ni）作为促进剂得以解决。镍能够使CO2分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads），进而再生还原的铬氧化物（CrOx），从而保持高稳定性和选择性。这种方法显著减少了由积碳沉积和活性CrOx物种的减少所引起的问题，将它们转变回无活性的Cr2+状态。为了量化沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量，使用诸如CHNS（碳、氢、氮、硫）这样的化学分析技术，这些技术提供了关于ODHP过程有效性和催化剂性能的见解。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process benefits from the utilization of greenhouse gas CO2 as a soft oxidant, which eliminates coke deposition and facilitates the reoxidation of reduced active phases. The challenge lies in the rapid deactivation of CrOx/silica catalysts due to coke deposition and reduction of active sites, transforming coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ into the inactive Cr2+ state. 

Strategies to address these limitations involve the introduction of Ni as a promoter, enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2 through its dissociation to CO and generation of activated oxygen (O*ads). This leads to the reoxidation of Cr2+ back to Cr3+, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction. The use of Ni promotes stable production of propylene by maintaining the active Cr3+ phase, thus stabilizing the catalyst and making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

在丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，该过程从温室气体CO2作为软氧化剂的利用中获益，这消除了焦炭沉积并促进了活性位点的重新氧化。挑战在于CrOx/silica催化剂的快速失活，由于焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原，导致配合不饱和的Cr3+转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。

为了解决这些限制，可以通过将Ni引入作为促进剂，通过Ni对CO2的分解产生CO和活性氧（O*ads），从而增强CO2的氧化能力。这导致Cr2+的重新氧化回Cr3+，这是ODHP反应中的活性位点。通过Ni的使用，可以实现稳定的丙烯生产，维持活性的Cr3+相，从而稳定催化剂，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It allows for the utilization of the greenhouse gas CO2, making the process environmentally friendly. However, CO2's limited oxidizing ability poses a challenge in reoxidizing reduced CrOx species, which are crucial for the ODHP reaction. To address this limitation and maintain a stable selectivity for propylene, the development of a suitable promoter is essential. Nitrous oxide has been shown to effectively activate CO2, enhancing its oxidizing ability. This is achieved through the dissociation of CO2 to CO and the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads) near Ni-containing catalysts. The regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the presence of Ni has been confirmed through three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. These findings suggest that Ni-based catalysts can improve the stability and selectivity of the ODHP reaction, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂具有多项优势，尤其是在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比。它允许利用温室气体CO2，使该过程更加环保。然而，CO2的有限氧化能力使得重新氧化还原的CrOx物种成为一个挑战，这些物种对于ODHP反应至关重要。为了应对这一限制并保持丙烯的选择性稳定，开发合适的促进剂是必要的。N2O已被证明能够有效激活CO2，增强其氧化能力。这通过CO2的分解为CO以及在其附近Ni催化剂上生成活化氧（O*ads）来实现。通过三步温度程序化还原（TPR）分析和离线X射线光电子能谱（XPS）测量确认了活性Cr3+状态的再生。这些发现表明Ni基催化剂可以提高ODHP反应的稳定性和选择性，从而使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
