[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."
[3] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
[4] "Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[5] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[6] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O allows for higher selectivity towards propylene production, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts like carbon. This is due to N2O's ability to partially oxidize the catalyst, leading to a state of V2O4 rather than the complete V2O5 state achieved with other oxidants. This partial oxidation helps in maintaining a higher selectivity towards propylene.

2. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including vanadium oxide (V2O5), tungsten oxide (WO3), and combinations thereof. These catalysts play a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently. The addition of tungsten to vanadium oxide promotes dispersion of VOx species, thereby preventing their clustering and inhibiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. This enhances the selectivity towards propylene production.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the risk of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, which can reduce its activity over time. To address this limitation, strategies such as incorporating promoters, modifying the catalyst surface chemistry, and optimizing the reaction conditions can be explored. Research directions might involve developing new catalyst materials with enhanced stability and activity, improving the understanding of the reaction mechanisms, and implementing advanced regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst performance.

1.N2O作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O能提供更高的丙烯选择性，减少副产品的生成，如碳。这是因为N2O能够部分氧化催化剂，使其达到V2O4状态，而不是使用其他氧化剂时完全达到的V2O5状态。这种部分氧化有助于维持更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 在ODHP过程中，已使用多种催化剂，包括钒氧化物（V2O5）、钨氧化物（WO3）以及它们的组合。这些催化剂在有效促进脱氢反应方面发挥着关键作用。向V2O5中添加钨可以促进VOx物种的分散，防止其聚集并抑制非选择性氧物种的形成。这增强了丙烯生成的选择性。

3.N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战包括表面碳沉积的风险，这会随时间逐渐降低催化剂活性。解决这一限制的策略可能包括引入促进剂、修改催化剂表面化学性质以及优化反应条件。研究方向可能涉及开发具有增强稳定性和活性的新催化剂材料，深入理解反应机制，并实施先进的再生技术以保持催化剂性能。
