[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[3] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene."
[4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
[5] "Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. It reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane, leading to higher selectivity towards propylene production. 

2. Various catalysts are employed in ODHP processes, including WOx and VOx species supported on porous silica. These catalysts hinder the clustering of VOx species during reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the likelihood of CO2 formation.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP using N2O as an oxidant include the inability of N2O to completely re-oxidize the catalyst to its V2O5 state, only allowing oxidation to V2O4. This partial oxidation affects the catalyst's activity and stability over time.

4. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation might include developing new catalyst compositions that can better withstand partial oxidation or exploring ways to recycle or regenerate the catalyst after partial oxidation by N2O.

1.Nitrous氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂具有优势。它降低了二氧化碳形成的可能性，从而提高了丙烯的生产率。

2.在ODHP过程中使用的催化剂包括钨酸盐和二氧化钒支持在多孔硅胶上的物种。这些催化剂阻止了VOx物种的聚集，在反应中，防止了非选择性氧的形成，这减少了丙烷完全氧化的可能性。

3.使用N2O作为氧化剂时，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括N2O无法将催化剂完全还原为V2O5状态，仅允许氧化至V2O4。这种部分氧化影响了催化剂的活性和稳定性。

4.为了使N2O-ODHP更具实际应用可行性，可能需要采取策略，如开发新的催化剂组成，使其更能抵抗部分氧化，或者探索回收或再生催化剂的方法，以应对N2O导致的部分氧化问题。
