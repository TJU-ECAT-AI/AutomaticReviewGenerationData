[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."

[2] "CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."

[3] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

[4] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
