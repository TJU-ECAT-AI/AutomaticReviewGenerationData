[1] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%) NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."
[2] "The performance were evaluated over the materials that were equilibrated for over 5 h under the reaction environment in order to avoid any potential influence from catalyst restructuring."
[3] "In particular, a single-pass yield of C3H6 up to 50% at 95% selectivity could be obtained over CrPO, rivaling the best systems reported to date in POC and surpassing any other propylene production technology."
[4] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[5] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that the process is advantageous in terms of propylene selectivity due to the unique properties of N2O. The selectivity to propylene is notably high, reaching up to 95-98% for CrPO and FePO systems, surpassing other catalysts. This high selectivity is attributed to the materials' ability to efficiently dehydrochlorinate propyl chloride into propylene, while hindering the evolution of molecular chlorine, which would otherwise lead to over-oxidation and the formation of coke or other undesirable byproducts.

Various catalysts are employed in ODHP, including copper phosphate (CuPO), vanadium phosphate (VPO), cobalt phosphate (CoPO), chromium phosphate (CrPO), iron phosphate (FePO), manganese phosphate (MnPO), nickel phosphate (NiPO), and titanium phosphate (TiPO). Each catalyst exhibits different reactivity and product distribution profiles, with chromium phosphate (CrPO) being identified as the most selective system, capable of achieving up to 50% propylene yield with 95-98% selectivity.

However, the use of N2O in ODHP faces several critical challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Over time, catalysts can undergo structural changes, leading to reduced activity and selectivity. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more robust catalyst formulations that maintain their structure and functionality over prolonged operation periods. Research could also focus on understanding the mechanisms of catalyst degradation, which would enable the design of more durable catalysts.

Moreover, optimizing operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, could enhance the efficiency and selectivity of N2O-ODHP processes. Implementing advanced monitoring and control systems to detect and mitigate catalyst deactivation could also improve the practical feasibility of N2O-ODHP for industrial applications. By addressing these challenges through targeted research and technological advancements, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable option for propylene production, offering environmental benefits and economic advantages over traditional methods.

在使用二氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，我们发现该过程在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，这归因于N2O的独特性质。丙烯的选择性高达95-98%，对于铬磷酸盐和铁磷酸盐系统来说，超越了其他催化剂。这种高选择性归因于材料能够高效地将丙基氯化物转化为丙烯，同时阻止分子氯的生成，从而避免过度氧化和形成焦炭或其他不希望的副产品。

在ODHP中使用的催化剂包括铜磷酸盐（CuPO）、钒磷酸盐（VPO）、钴磷酸盐（CoPO）、铬磷酸盐（CrPO）、铁磷酸盐（FePO）、锰磷酸盐（MnPO）、镍磷酸盐（NiPO）和钛磷酸盐（TiPO）。每种催化剂都展现出不同的反应性和产物分布特性，其中铬磷酸盐（CrPO）被确定为最选择性的系统，能够实现高达50%的丙烯产率和95-98%的选择性。

然而，在ODHP中使用N2O面临几个关键挑战，主要是催化剂失活和稳定性问题。随着时间的推移，催化剂可能会发生结构变化，导致活性和选择性降低。解决这些限制的战略可以涉及开发更坚固的催化剂配方，以保持其结构和功能长期运行。研究还可以专注于理解催化剂降解的机制，这将有助于设计更耐用的催化剂。

此外，优化操作条件，如温度、压力和反应物的比例，可以提高N2O-ODHP过程的效率和选择性。通过实施先进的监控和控制系统来检测并缓解催化剂失活，也可以提高N2O-ODHP在工业应用中的实际可行性。通过针对这些挑战进行有针对性的研究和技术进步，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产的一个更可行的选择，提供环境效益和经济优势超过传统方法。
