Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights its potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Various catalysts, including noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides like CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.
