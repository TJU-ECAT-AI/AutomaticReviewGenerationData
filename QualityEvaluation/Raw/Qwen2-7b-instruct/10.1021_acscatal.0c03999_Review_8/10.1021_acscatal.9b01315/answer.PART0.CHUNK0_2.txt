[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane.6,7 Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.8"
[3] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[4] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1).19,20"
[5] "CrPO was found as the most selective system,reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
[6] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
[7] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, it faces challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Catalysts commonly employed in N2O-ODHP include metal phosphates, which are known for their unique electronic properties due to the encapsulation of metal oxide clusters within a phosphate matrix. The most selective system identified in this study is chromium phosphate (CrPO), capable of achieving propylene yields that rival the best catalysts reported to date. While manganese phosphate (MnPO) exhibits low chlorine evolution performance and a similar combustion tendency to CrPO, its high propensity for propane cracking limits the selectivity for propylene production. Conversely, copper phosphate (CuPO) and vanadium phosphate (VPO) exhibit low propylene selectivity due to their hindered dehydrochlorination ability and high tendency to generate chlorine, leading to coke formation and a strong propensity for combustion. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

在使用硝酸氧化剂作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂时，与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面显示出一些优势。然而，它面临催化剂失活和稳定性的问题。在N2O-ODHP中常用的催化剂包括金属磷酸盐，这些磷酸盐因其独特的电子性质而被广泛使用，这些电子性质源于金属氧化物簇被包含在一个磷酸盐矩阵内。本研究中发现的最选择性的系统是铬磷酸盐（CrPO），能够实现与目前报道的最佳催化剂相当的丙烯产率。虽然锰磷酸盐（MnPO）表现出较低的氯化氢释放性能和与CrPO相似的燃烧倾向，但其较高的丙烷裂解倾向限制了丙烯生产的选择性。相反，铜磷酸盐（CuPO）和钒磷酸盐（VPO）由于其受限的氯化氢分解能力和产生氯的高倾向，导致焦炭形成，并表现出强烈的燃烧倾向，这限制了它们在ODHP过程中的丙烯选择性。为了使N2O-ODHP更适用于实际应用，可能需要采取策略来解决这些局限性并增强其可行性，这些策略可以涉及开发更稳定和选择性更高的催化剂、优化反应条件以及优化过程以减少副反应并提高丙烯的选择性。
