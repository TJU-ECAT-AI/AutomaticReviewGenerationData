The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This process is typically carried out using catalysts such as CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are recognized, and potential solutions have been suggested to enhance the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.
