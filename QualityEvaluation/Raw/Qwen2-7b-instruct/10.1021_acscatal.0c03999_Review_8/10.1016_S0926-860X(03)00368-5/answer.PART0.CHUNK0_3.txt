<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking.</p>
<p>However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming.</p>
<p>A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere.</p>
<p>The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations, propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Ga2O3 in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide were investigated under similar conditions.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 presents the catalytic performance in both processes as a function of the reaction time.</p>
<p>The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was observed only in the initial state of the reaction.</p>
<p>Under carbon dioxide atmosphere after reaction period 0.2 h, the propene yield reached 30.6%, while under argon 23.0%.</p>
<p>These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The effect of the reaction temperature on the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3 catalyst was examined.</p>
<p>Propene yield and selectivity as a function of reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>With increase of the reaction temperature, the propene yield markedly increased from 0.7% at 673 K to 30.6% at 873 K, whereas the selectivity to propene decreased from 100% at 673 K to 93.3% at 873 K, but the selectivities were still over 90% at all temperatures.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is discussed, focusing on its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants.
2. The process aims to reduce the exothermic nature of the reaction by efficiently managing heat removal and avoiding overoxidation, ensuring high propene selectivity.
3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is highlighted as a viable oxidant for ODHP, offering the benefit of performing the dehydrogenation process at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity towards propene.
4. Thermodynamic considerations support the enhancement of propane conversion through coupling with the water-gas shift reaction.
5. Carbon dioxide consumption during the reaction shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products, thereby improving the efficiency of the process.
6. The initial stage of the reaction shows a pronounced promotional role of carbon dioxide on the catalytic performance of gallium oxide (Ga2O3).
7. Under carbon dioxide atmosphere, the propene yield reaches a higher value (30.6%) compared to argon atmosphere (23.0%) after a reaction period of 0.2 hours.
8. Carbon dioxide does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction, indicating a need for further optimization to maintain catalytic activity.
9. The effect of reaction temperature on the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3 catalyst is examined, showing a significant increase in propene yield (from 0.7% to 30.6%) with a corresponding decrease in selectivity (from 100% to 93.3%) upon increasing the temperature from 673 K to 873 K.
10. Potassium addition to gallium oxide catalysts results in a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the acidic sites of the catalyst are responsible for the dehydrogenation process.
