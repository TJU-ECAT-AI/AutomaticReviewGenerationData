<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst. After 0.2 h of reaction periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively, while in the presence of argon only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity are achieved under the same condition.</p>
<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane can be considered as follows: CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2 (3) H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O (4)</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>
<p>The amount of CO slightly decreased from 5.4 × 104 to 1.6×104 mmol after treatment of the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen. The amount of CO after second reduction cycle () with hydrogen was similar to that after the first cycle ( ). These results suggest that the carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface.</p>
<p>For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For Ga2O3-K2 catalyst additionally K2CO3 was detected (Fig. 7c).</p>

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that its application presents advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O allows for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity to C3H6. Various catalysts such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have been utilized in this process. The acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst significantly influence its activity, with supported gallium oxides showing preference over zeolites due to their weaker acidity. However, the Lewis acid sites within the catalyst are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation.

The promotion of the Ga2O3 catalyst by carbon dioxide (CO2) enhances its initial activity, achieving propane conversion and propene selectivity of 33% and 93%, respectively, after 0.2 hours of reaction. In contrast, the presence of argon yields only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity under similar conditions.

In the context of using CO2 as a mild oxidant, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be performed at lower temperatures with high selectivity. This process involves the conversion of propane into propene, accompanied by the consumption of hydrogen produced in the reaction. The role of CO2 is pivotal in shifting the equilibrium towards products, thereby improving propane conversion.

The introduction of potassium (K) to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a loss of catalytic activity. This suggests that the reaction occurs primarily on the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

Pulse reaction studies demonstrate that CO2 can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface, possibly through a redox cycle. This interaction may contribute to the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. The XRD analyses of the catalysts reveal that the major phase detected is -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, additional K2CO3 was identified.

To address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability, future research directions might focus on optimizing catalyst design and structure to enhance stability and selectivity. This could involve modifying the catalyst's acidity/basicity properties, exploring the use of alternative promoters, or developing novel catalyst supports. Additionally, investigating the role of CO2 beyond initial enhancement and exploring its potential as a mild oxidant in the reaction pathway could lead to more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，我们发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。N2O允许在相对较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，生成高选择性的C3H6。不同催化剂如镓氧化物（Ga2O3）已被应用于这一过程。催化剂的酸碱性质对其活性有显著影响，支持的镓氧化物由于其较弱的酸性而更受青睐，相比于沸石。然而，催化剂中的Lewis酸位点被认为是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

通过碳二氧（CO2）促进的Ga2O3催化剂表现出增强的初始活性，在0.2小时内反应后，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性分别达到33%和93%。相比之下，在氩气存在下，仅实现25%转化率和90%选择性。

在使用CO2作为温和氧化剂的情况下，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程可以在较低温度下以高选择性进行。此过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，并伴随产生的氢气的消耗。CO2在反应中的作用至关重要，通过与水反应，促进了平衡向产物的移动，从而提高了丙烷转化率。

向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾（K）导致催化活性的损失。这表明反应主要发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂并未表现出高活性。

脉冲反应研究表明，CO2可以与吸附在Ga2O3表面的氢反应，可能通过一个还原-氧化循环。这种相互作用可能有助于去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物。X射线衍射分析显示，所有Ga2O3样品的主要相为-Ga2O3，这是Ga2O3已知的唯一稳定形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。

为了应对催化剂失活和不稳定性的问题，未来的研究方向可能集中在优化催化剂设计和结构以提高稳定性和选择性上。这可能包括修改催化剂的酸碱性质、探索替代促进剂的应用或开发新型催化剂支撑材料。此外，研究CO2的作用超越初始增强，并探索其在反应途径中的潜在作用，可以推动更高效和可持续的ODHP过程的发展。
