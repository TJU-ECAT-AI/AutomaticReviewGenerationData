<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13], propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>
<p>The catalytic activities of the potassium promoted catalysts are much lower than those observed with unpromoted catalyst. The propane conversion and propene selectivity dramatically decrease with increasing K/Ga atomic ratio.</p>

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature highlights the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an advantageous oxidant due to its ability to perform the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity to C3H6. The literature mentions that the introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction may proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst. Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and stability could involve modifying the acidity properties of the catalyst or exploring the use of alternative catalysts with improved stability and selectivity. Research directions might focus on developing new catalysts that can effectively utilize N2O as an oxidant in ODHP, potentially making this process more feasible for practical implementation by improving selectivity and stability.

该文献中没有提及将N2O用作氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用。然而，文献指出使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为有利的氧化剂，因为它能够在较低温度下进行丙烷到丙烯的脱氢反应，并且具有高选择性。文献提到向镓氧化物中引入钾会导致催化活性的损失，这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。策略可以包括修改催化剂的酸碱性质或探索具有更好稳定性和选择性的替代催化剂。研究方向可能集中在开发能够有效利用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP的新催化剂，通过提高选择性和稳定性使其过程更适用于实际应用。
