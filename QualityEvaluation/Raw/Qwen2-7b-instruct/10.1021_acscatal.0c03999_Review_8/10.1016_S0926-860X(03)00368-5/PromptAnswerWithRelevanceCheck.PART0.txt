<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13], propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>
<p>The catalytic activities of the potassium promoted catalysts are much lower than those observed with unpromoted catalyst. The propane conversion and propene selectivity dramatically decrease with increasing K/Ga atomic ratio.</p>

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature highlights the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an advantageous oxidant due to its ability to perform the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity to C3H6. The literature mentions that the introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction may proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst. Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and stability could involve modifying the acidity properties of the catalyst or exploring the use of alternative catalysts with improved stability and selectivity.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that its application presents advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O allows for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity to C3H6. Various catalysts such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have been utilized in this process. The acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst significantly influence its activity, with supported gallium oxides showing preference over zeolites due to their weaker acidity. However, the Lewis acid sites within the catalyst are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation.

The promotion of the Ga2O3 catalyst by carbon dioxide (CO2) enhances its initial activity, achieving propane conversion and propene selectivity of 33% and 93%, respectively, after 0.2 hours of reaction. In contrast, the presence of argon yields only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity under similar conditions.

In the context of using CO2 as a mild oxidant, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be performed at lower temperatures with high selectivity. This process involves the conversion of propane into propene, accompanied by the consumption of hydrogen produced in the reaction. The role of CO2 is pivotal in shifting the equilibrium towards products, thereby improving propane conversion.

The introduction of potassium (K) to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a loss of catalytic activity. This suggests that the reaction occurs primarily on the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

Pulse reaction studies demonstrate that CO2 can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface, possibly through a redox cycle. This interaction may contribute to the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. The XRD analyses of the catalysts reveal that the major phase detected is -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, additional K2CO3 was identified.

To address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability, future research directions might focus on optimizing catalyst design and structure to enhance stability and selectivity. This could involve modifying the catalyst's acidity/basicity properties, exploring the use of alternative promoters, or developing novel catalyst supports. Additionally, investigating the role of CO2 beyond initial enhancement and exploring its potential as a mild oxidant in the reaction pathway could lead to more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，我们发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。N2O允许在相对较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，生成高选择性的C3H6。不同催化剂如镓氧化物（Ga2O3）已被应用于这一过程。催化剂的酸碱性质对其活性有显著影响，支持的镓氧化物由于其较弱的酸性而更受青睐，相比于沸石。然而，催化剂中的Lewis酸位点被认为是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

通过碳二氧（CO2）促进的Ga2O3催化剂表现出增强的初始活性，在0.2小时内反应后，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性分别达到33%和93%。相比之下，在氩气存在下，仅实现25%转化率和90%选择性。

在使用CO2作为温和氧化剂的情况下，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程可以在较低温度下以高选择性进行。此过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，并伴随产生的氢气的消耗。CO2在反应中的作用至关重要，通过与水反应，促进了平衡向产物的移动，从而提高了丙烷转化率。

向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾（K）导致催化活性的损失。这表明反应主要发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂并未表现出高活性。

脉冲反应研究表明，CO2可以与吸附在Ga2O3表面的氢反应，可能通过一个还原-氧化循环。这种相互作用可能有助于去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物。X射线衍射分析显示，所有Ga2O3样品的主要相为-Ga2O3，这是Ga2O3已知的唯一稳定形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。

为了应对催化剂失活和不稳定性的问题，未来的研究方向可能集中在优化催化剂设计和结构以提高稳定性和选择性上。这可能包括修改催化剂的酸碱性质、探索替代促进剂的应用或开发新型催化剂支撑材料。此外，研究CO2的作用超越初始增强，并探索其在反应途径中的潜在作用，可以推动更高效和可持续的ODHP过程的发展。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers certain advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the document, the introduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant enhances the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This is due to the ability of CO2 to consume hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards the production of propene. The document also highlights that the presence of potassium (K) on the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a decrease in catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely occurs on the acidic sites of the catalyst, where potassium promotion inhibits this activity.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are significant limitations in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. Catalyst deactivation often involves the formation of coke, which reduces the efficiency of the reaction. Strategies to address these limitations could include modifying the acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst to suppress coke formation or exploring the use of different catalysts with desirable selectivity. Research directions might focus on developing new catalysts with enhanced selectivity for propene production or improving the design of existing catalysts to maintain their activity over multiple reaction cycles. Additionally, studying the effects of various operating conditions, such as temperature and pressure, could help optimize the process for better performance and stability.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有一定的优势。根据文档，二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂增强丙烷脱氢为丙烯的能力。这是由于CO2消耗氢气，使平衡向丙烯生产方向转移的结果。文档还指出，钾（K）在镓氧化物催化剂上的存在导致催化活性降低，表明反应可能发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂活性不高。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题是实现N2O-ODHP过程的实际应用的关键挑战。催化剂失活通常涉及焦炭的形成，这会降低反应效率。应对这些限制的策略可以包括修改催化剂的酸碱性质以抑制焦炭形成或探索使用具有高选择性的不同催化剂。研究方向可能集中在开发具有更好丙烯产率的新催化剂或改进现有催化剂的设计，以维持其在多个反应周期内的活动性。此外，研究各种操作条件，如温度和压力，可以帮助优化过程以获得更好的性能和稳定性。

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as an alternative to traditional methods, particularly due to its potential for high propylene selectivity at relatively low temperatures. This makes N2O-ODHP an attractive option for practical implementation, especially considering the environmental benefits of using N2O over other oxidants.

2. Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and its potassium-promoted versions (Ga2O3-K1, Ga2O3-K2). The effectiveness of these catalysts varies depending on their properties and the specific conditions under which they are used.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, which can significantly reduce the activity and efficiency of the process. Another challenge is the potential loss of catalytic activity when potassium is introduced to the Ga2O3 catalyst, likely due to the blocking of active sites for dehydrogenation.

4. Strategies to address these limitations might include optimizing the conditions for N2O usage, such as adjusting the flow rates, temperature, and pressure to maximize selectivity and minimize coke formation. Research could also focus on developing new catalyst materials or modifying existing ones to improve their stability and activity, possibly by enhancing their ability to resist coke formation or by finding ways to remove coke deposits effectively.

5. Potential research directions could involve exploring alternative oxidants besides N2O that might offer even better performance in terms of selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, studying the fundamental mechanisms of the ODHP process, such as the role of acidic sites on catalysts and the interactions between the oxidant, reactants, and catalyst surfaces, could provide insights into how to design more efficient catalysts and optimize operating parameters for N2O-ODHP.
