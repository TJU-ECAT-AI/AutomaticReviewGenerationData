The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers certain advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the document, the introduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant enhances the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This is due to the ability of CO2 to consume hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards the production of propene. The document also highlights that the presence of potassium (K) on the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a decrease in catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely occurs on the acidic sites of the catalyst, where potassium promotion inhibits this activity.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are significant limitations in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. Catalyst deactivation often involves the formation of coke, which reduces the efficiency of the reaction. Strategies to address these limitations could include modifying the acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst to suppress coke formation or exploring the use of different catalysts with desirable selectivity. Research directions might focus on developing new catalysts with enhanced selectivity for propene production or improving the design of existing catalysts to maintain their activity over multiple reaction cycles. Additionally, studying the effects of various operating conditions, such as temperature and pressure, could help optimize the process for better performance and stability.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有一定的优势。根据文档，二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂增强丙烷脱氢为丙烯的能力。这是由于CO2消耗氢气，使平衡向丙烯生产方向转移的结果。文档还指出，钾（K）在镓氧化物催化剂上的存在导致催化活性降低，表明反应可能发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂活性不高。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题是实现N2O-ODHP过程的实际应用的关键挑战。催化剂失活通常涉及焦炭的形成，这会降低反应效率。应对这些限制的策略可以包括修改催化剂的酸碱性质以抑制焦炭形成或探索使用具有高选择性的不同催化剂。研究方向可能集中在开发具有更好丙烯产率的新催化剂或改进现有催化剂的设计，以维持其在多个反应周期内的活动性。此外，研究各种操作条件，如温度和压力，可以帮助优化过程以获得更好的性能和稳定性。
