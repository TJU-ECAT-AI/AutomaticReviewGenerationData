[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "Stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[5] "This catalytic process leads to the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O and can be economically applied for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O, e.g. in tail-gases of chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it demonstrates higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Iron zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, are found to be highly efficient catalysts in this process, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at 723 K.

2. The primary challenge associated with this process is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. However, the reversibility of this deactivation process enables the development of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production. This involves alternating reaction and regeneration cycles to sustain catalyst activity.

3. To optimize the cyclic process, tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) studies have been employed. These studies allow for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes, providing valuable insights into activity, deactivation, and regeneration.

4. Over iron zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, stable propene yields exceeding 20% were achieved during cyclic experiments lasting 2000 minutes. The reaction and regeneration were conducted at temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively.

5. The N2O-ODHP process is economically viable for on-site propylene production, utilizing a low-cost source of N2O from chemical processes that produce high concentrations of this gas.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，因为它在与其他氧化剂相比时表现出更高的丙烯选择性。铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Fe-β）被发现是高效催化剂，能够在723 K下达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。

2. 这个过程的主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。然而，这种失活过程的可逆性使得开发连续丙烯生产的循环操作过程成为可能。这涉及到交替反应和再生周期来保持催化剂活性。

3. 为了优化循环过程，应用了锥形元件振荡微天平（TEOM）研究。这些研究允许同时测量反应和质量变化，提供了有关活性、失活和再生的重要见解。

4. 特别是在铁沸石（尤其是FeZSM-5）上，实现了超过20%的稳定丙烯产率，在长达2000分钟的循环实验中。反应和再生分别在723 K和823 K下进行。

5. N2O-ODHP过程适用于现场丙烯生产，利用化学过程中产生的高浓度N2O作为低成本来源。
