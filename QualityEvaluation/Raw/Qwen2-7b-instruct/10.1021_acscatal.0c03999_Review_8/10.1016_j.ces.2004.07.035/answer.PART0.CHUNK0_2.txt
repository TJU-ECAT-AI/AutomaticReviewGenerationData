[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "Stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[5] "This catalytic process leads to the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O and can be economically applied for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O, e.g. in tail-gases of chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantage lies in achieving high propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Iron zeolites, including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, are efficient catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP, yielding up to 25% propene at 723 K. However, they face the critical challenge of deactivation due to coking. To overcome this limitation, a cyclically-operated process with alternating reaction and regeneration cycles has been developed. This process employs a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) for correlating activity and deactivation through simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking. Stable propene yields exceeding 20% were achieved over 2000 minutes in a configuration of two fixed-bed reactors, with reaction at 723 K and regeneration at 823 K. This catalytic process enables the simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of N2O, making it a feasible option for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O.

Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP include enhancing catalyst stability through optimization of reaction conditions, improving catalyst design, and exploring alternative reactor configurations. Research directions could focus on identifying the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, developing more robust catalysts, and optimizing the integration of heat management during the exothermic regeneration process. Additionally, studying the effects of adding oxygen to the reaction mixture could help minimize carbon deposition and improve propylene selectivity. By addressing these limitations, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable and cost-effective method for propylene production.

分析在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的优势在于，与其它氧化剂相比，它能实现较高的丙烯选择性。铁沸石（包括FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Feβ）是使用N2O介导的ODHP过程中的高效催化剂，在723 K时可达到25%的初始丙烯产率。然而，它们面临着催化剂失活的问题，主要是由于结焦导致的。为了克服这一限制，已经开发了一种循环操作过程，通过交替进行反应和再生周期。该过程利用锥形元件振荡微天平（TEOM）对反应和结焦进行在线分析，以合理设计循环实验的序列。在两个并联的固定床反应器中，实现了超过20%的稳定丙烯产率长达2000分钟，反应温度为723 K，再生温度为823 K。这种催化过程同时实现了丙烷的催化功能化和N2O的利用，使其成为利用高浓度N2O作为低成本来源进行现场丙烯生产的一种可行方法。

解决N2O-ODHP限制的策略包括通过优化反应条件来增强催化剂稳定性、改进催化剂设计以及探索替代反应器配置。研究方向可以集中在确定催化剂失活和焦炭形成机制、开发更耐用的催化剂以及优化再生过程中热管理的集成上。此外，研究向反应混合物中添加氧气的效果，可以帮助减少碳沉积并提高丙烯选择性。通过解决这些限制，N2O-ODHP有可能成为一种更为经济有效且成本效益高的丙烯生产方法。
