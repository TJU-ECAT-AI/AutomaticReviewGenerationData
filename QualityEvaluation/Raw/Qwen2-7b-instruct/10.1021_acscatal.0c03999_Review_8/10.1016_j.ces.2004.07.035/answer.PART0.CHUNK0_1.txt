The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages compared to other oxidants. N2O specifically functions as a monooxygen donor, providing the necessary oxygen for dehydrogenation reactions. This specificity allows for efficient conversion of propane to propylene, with initial yields up to 25% at 723 K. Iron-zeolites, notably FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, are highly effective catalysts in this process, capable of achieving propene yields in the range of 20-25% at operating temperatures of 723-773 K. However, a significant challenge arises from catalyst deactivation due to coking, which involves the formation of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface. This deactivation process is reversible, allowing for the development of cyclically-operated processes to maintain continuous propene production.

Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP involve the rational design of catalyst sequences within cyclic processes. By utilizing the TEOM technique to monitor activity, deactivation, and regeneration simultaneously, researchers can optimize the reaction and regeneration cycles. For instance, a configuration involving two fixed-bed reactors in parallel, alternating between reaction (at 723 K) and regeneration (at 823 K), was found to enable the maintenance of propene yields greater than 20% over a 2000-minute period. This innovative approach not only utilizes N2O effectively but also addresses the issue of catalyst deactivation through strategic regeneration methods.

Future research directions could focus on enhancing catalyst stability and reducing the rate of coke formation. This might involve developing new catalyst compositions, modifying existing iron forms in zeolites to improve resistance against coking, or optimizing reaction conditions to minimize the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Alternatively, exploring alternative reactor configurations or catalyst moving systems could offer solutions for continuous propene production with improved efficiency and reduced deactivation rates.

In summary, the application of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP presents a promising avenue for propylene synthesis, especially when combined with cyclic processes and optimized catalyst designs. Addressing the challenges of catalyst deactivation remains crucial for realizing the full potential of this technology.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优势，与其它氧化剂相比。N2O作为单氧供体的特定性允许高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，初始产率可达25%，在723 K时。铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Fe贝塔）是高效的催化剂，能够在723-773 K的操作温度下达到20-25%的丙烯产率。然而，催化剂的失活问题由于焦炭形成而出现，这涉及催化剂表面上碳材料的形成。这种失活过程是可逆的，允许开发循环操作过程以维持连续的丙烯生产。

用于解决N2O-ODHP限制的战略包括在循环过程中合理设计催化剂序列。通过使用微平衡元素振荡器（TEOM）技术同时监测活性、失活和再生，研究人员可以优化反应和再生周期。例如，在两个并联固定床反应器中，交替进行反应（在723 K下）和再生（在823 K下），被发现能够使丙烯产率大于20%在2000分钟的时间内。这一创新方法不仅有效地利用了N2O，而且通过战略再生方法解决了催化剂失活的问题。

未来的研究方向可能集中在提高催化剂稳定性并减少焦炭形成的速度上。这可能涉及开发新的催化剂组成，改进现有铁形态在沸石中的表现以增强抵抗焦炭形成的能力，或者优化反应条件以最小化碳质沉积物的形成。另外，探索替代反应器配置或催化剂移动系统也可能为连续丙烯生产提供解决方案，同时提高效率并降低失活率。

综上所述，将N2O用作ODHP中的氧化剂提供了有前景的技术途径，特别是当结合循环过程和优化催化剂设计时。解决催化剂失活的挑战对于实现这项技术的全部潜力至关重要。
