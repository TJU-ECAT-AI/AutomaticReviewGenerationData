[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[4] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[5] "Initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[6] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied,decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."
[7] "Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation poses the problem of catalytic activity restoration, which is commonly reached via oxidative treatment of coke catalyst with air or oxygen-containing mixtures at high temperatures."
[8] "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) as well as isothermal oxidation experiments in air were carried out in order to determine the optimal regeneration conditions (temperature and duration) of the coke-deactivated zeolites."
[9] "The performance of regenerated FeZSM-5 at 723 K is shown in Fig. 5. This sample was obtained after reaction at 723 K during 400 min, followed by a temperature ramp in He to 823 K (10 K min-1), air-regeneration at 823 K for 5 min, and cooling in He to 723 K (10 K min-1)."
[10] "Remarkably, the residual propylene yield over fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 is very similar."

### Analysis of N2O as an Oxidant in Propane Dehydrogenation

#### Advantages of Using N2O in ODHP

1. **High Propylene Selectivity**: N2O acts as a highly specific monooxygen donor in the ODHP process, leading to high initial propene yields (up to 25% at 723 K) compared to other oxidants, enhancing the efficiency of propylene production.
   
#### Various Catalysts Employed in N2O-ODHP Process

1. **Iron Zeolites**: FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta are utilized due to their ability to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, efficiently dehydrogenating propane.

#### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Catalyst Deactivation**: The process faces significant challenges due to catalyst deactivation, primarily through coke formation, which reduces propene yield and requires periodic regeneration.

#### Strategies to Address Limitations

1. **Cyclic Operation**: Implementing a cyclically-operated process with alternating reaction and regeneration cycles helps maintain catalyst stability and efficiency over prolonged periods.
   
2. **Optimal Regeneration Conditions**: Utilizing techniques like temperature-programmed oxidation and isothermal oxidation in air allows for determining ideal regeneration conditions, improving catalyst recovery.

3. **Regenerated Catalyst Performance**: The ability to recover initial performance after regeneration indicates the potential for sustainable operation and economic viability.

4. **Continuous Production**: The demonstration of continuous propene production through a cyclically-operated process showcases the practical applicability of N2O-ODHP, particularly in utilizing N2O-rich tail-gases.

#### Research Directions

1. **Catalyst Characterization**: Detailed analysis of spent and regenerated zeolites to better understand the deactivation mechanism and catalyst degradation patterns.
   
2. **Reactor Design Optimization**: Investigating alternative reactor configurations that could improve heat management and extend catalyst lifetime, such as radial-flow moving-bed reactors or fluidized-bed reactors.
   
3. **Catalyst Stability Enhancement**: Developing strategies to enhance catalyst stability against coke formation, possibly through modifying the catalyst composition or operating conditions.
   
4. **Economic Viability Assessment**: Conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to determine the economic feasibility of implementing N2O-ODHP in industrial settings, considering the cost of N2O and energy requirements.
