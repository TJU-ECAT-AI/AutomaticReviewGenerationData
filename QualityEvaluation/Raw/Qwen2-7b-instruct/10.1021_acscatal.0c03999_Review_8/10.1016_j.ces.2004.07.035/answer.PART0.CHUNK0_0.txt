Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, including higher propylene selectivity and the ability to utilize environmentally harmful gases. Iron zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, have proven to be highly efficient catalysts for this process, achieving initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation due to coking presents a significant challenge. The reversibility of this deactivation allows for the development of a cyclically-operated process, alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles, to maintain continuous propene production. 

The use of a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with online analysis of products has proven crucial in correlating activity and deactivation, allowing for the rational design of the cyclic process. This approach led to stable propene yields greater than 20% during a period of 2000 minutes, utilizing reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively. To address the limitations and challenges associated with catalyst deactivation, strategies include tailoring catalyst properties such as the active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. This innovative catalytic process not only functionalizes propane but also utilizes N2O simultaneously, making it a promising option for practical implementation in tail-gases of chemical processes producing N2O in high concentration.

Strategies to improve the process could involve:
1. Tailoring the catalyst properties to reduce the rate of coke deactivation, potentially through optimization of the active phase, texture, diffusion length, or reaction conditions.
2. Developing alternative reactor configurations or engineering options that can handle the exothermic nature of both the reaction and regeneration processes more efficiently, such as a battery of parallel reactors or configurations like the Lummus Catofin process for non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
3. Investigating the specific mechanisms of coke formation and deactivation to design measures that maintain the stability of the fresh catalyst in the first period of the ODHP reaction.
4. Exploring the use of additional oxidants or modifiers in the reaction mixture to minimize coke formation or enhance propylene selectivity.
5. Implementing continuous monitoring and adjustment of process parameters to optimize yield and efficiency.
6. Conducting detailed characterization of the spent and regenerated zeolites to better understand the deactivation mechanism and catalyst stability.

These research directions aim to address the challenges and limitations associated with N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a more feasible option for practical implementation in industrial settings.

在氧化脱氢过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，N2O具有多个优势，包括更高的丙烯选择性和利用有害环境气体的能力。铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Fe-β）已被证明是使用N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢的高效催化剂，在723 K时可实现高达25%的初始丙烯产率。然而，由于结焦导致的催化剂失活是一个挑战。由于这种失活是可逆的，分析了循环操作过程的可能性，该过程通过交替反应和再生周期来实现连续丙烯生产，以维持连续丙烯生产。

通过耦合到在线产品分析的锥形元素振动微平衡（TEOM）的应用，在设计循环实验序列时至关重要，这有助于关联活性和失活。这种方法导致了在长达2000分钟的周期中稳定地获得大于20%的丙烯产率，使用反应和再生温度分别为723和823 K。为了解决与催化剂失活相关的限制和挑战，策略包括调整催化剂性质，如活性相、结构、扩散长度以及反应条件。这种创新催化过程不仅使丙烷功能化，还同时利用N2O，使其成为在高浓度N2O产生的化学过程尾气中实施的有前景的选择。

改善此过程的策略可能包括：
1. 调整催化剂特性以降低焦炭失活速率，可能通过优化活性相、结构、扩散长度或反应条件。
2. 开发能够更有效地处理反应和再生过程的热管理问题的替代反应器配置或工程选项，例如并联反应器电池或Lummus Catofin过程中的非氧化脱氢。
3. 探索特定的焦炭形成和失活机制，以设计措施保持新鲜催化剂在第一阶段ODHP反应中的稳定性。
4. 研究反应混合物中额外氧化剂或修饰剂的使用，以减少焦炭形成或增强丙烯选择性。
5. 实施连续监控和调整过程参数，以优化产率和效率。
6. 对使用过的和再生的沸石进行详细表征，以更好地理解失活机制和催化剂稳定性。

这些研究方向旨在解决与N2O-ODHP相关的问题和限制，有可能使其成为工业应用中的可行选择。
