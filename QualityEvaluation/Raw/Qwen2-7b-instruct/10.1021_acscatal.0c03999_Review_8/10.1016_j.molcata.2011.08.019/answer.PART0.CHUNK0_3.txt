[1] "Many recent investigations have focused on dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "These investigations have been encouraged by a strong demand for propene,which has become one of the most important petrochemicals used for the production of a variety of polymers and chemical intermediates,such as:polypropylene,acrylonitile,OXO alcohols,isopropyl alcohol,acrylic acid and propylene oxide."
[3] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[4] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst,while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst."
[5] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."

Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been a focus of recent research due to the high demand for propene, a key petrochemical used in various polymer and chemical intermediate production. Materials containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga) have shown to be the most active and selective in this process. Contrary to the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, CO2 has a negative impact, whereas it promotes activity over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials depends on factors such as chromium species' oxidation states, structure, and interaction with silica.

最近的研究重点放在丙烷在二氧化碳存在的脱氢上，这是由于对丙烯的高需求，丙烯是用于各种聚合物和化学中间体生产的最重要石油化工之一，如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、氧化乙烯醇、异丙醇、丙烯酸和丙二醇。含铬（Cr）或镓（Ga）的材料在这一过程中表现出最高的活性和选择性。与Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂相反，二氧化碳对其有负面影响，但其促进了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性。二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物材料的活性取决于铬物种的氧化状态、结构以及与二氧化硅的相互作用等因素。
