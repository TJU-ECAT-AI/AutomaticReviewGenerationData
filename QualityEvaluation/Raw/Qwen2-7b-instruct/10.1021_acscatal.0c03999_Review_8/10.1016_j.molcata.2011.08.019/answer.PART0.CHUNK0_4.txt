[1] "Many recent investigations have focused on dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."

[3] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[4] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."

[6] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."

[7] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."

[8] "These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

[9] "In this work we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica."

[10] "Using various physicochemical characterization techniques we investigated the influence of Cr loading and supports properties on the surface composition and Cr dispersion."

[11] "Finally based on the characterization results of catalysts we discussed the catalytic performance in the DHPCO2 process."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature does not directly address N2O as an oxidant. However, it does discuss the use of various catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, which can be analogous to the role of N2O in ODHP processes. The key advantages highlighted in the context of other oxidants, such as CO2, are increased propylene selectivity and the potential for chemical CO2 utilization. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are common across different catalyst systems, including those used for ODHP.

Strategies or research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible might include:

1. **Optimizing catalyst design**: Developing new catalysts or modifying existing ones to enhance their stability and selectivity towards propylene production while minimizing side reactions.

2. **Process optimization**: Tuning the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and gas flow rates, to maximize propylene yield and minimize energy consumption.

3. **Material science advancements**: Improving the physical and chemical properties of catalyst supports to increase the surface area and dispersion of active sites, thereby improving the efficiency of the ODHP.

4. **Integration with CO2 capture and utilization technologies**: Combining ODHP with CO2 capture systems to reduce environmental impact and enhance economic viability by utilizing CO2 as a raw material.

5. **Modeling and simulation**: Utilizing computational tools to predict and optimize the performance of ODHP systems, which can guide experimental design and aid in identifying promising catalysts and operating conditions.

6. **Continuous flow processing**: Implementing continuous flow reactors to maintain optimal reaction conditions and facilitate efficient mass transfer, potentially leading to improved product yields and lower costs.

7. **Scale-up considerations**: Addressing the challenges of scaling up laboratory-scale processes to industrial scales, focusing on maintaining catalyst activity and stability under industrial conditions.

By addressing these areas, researchers and engineers can potentially overcome the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，文献没有直接讨论N2O作为氧化剂。然而，它确实讨论了在CO2存在下使用不同催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的过程，这可以类比于N2O在ODHP过程中的作用。其他氧化剂的优势，如CO2，在提高丙烯选择性和化学CO2利用方面得到了强调。与不同催化剂系统相关的催化剂失活和稳定性问题普遍存在。

有可能使N2O-ODHP更具可行性的策略或研究方向包括：

1. **优化催化剂设计**：开发新的催化剂或修改现有催化剂以增强其稳定性和丙烯产率，同时减少副反应。

2. **过程优化**：调整温度、压力和气体流速等反应条件，以最大化丙烯产率并减少能耗。

3. **材料科学进步**：改进催化剂支撑物的物理和化学性质，增加表面积和活性位点的分散性，从而提高ODHP的效率。

4. **集成CO2捕获和利用技术**：结合ODHP与CO2捕获系统，通过利用CO2作为原料来降低环境影响并增强经济可行性。

5. **建模和仿真**：利用计算工具预测和优化ODHP系统的性能，指导实验设计并帮助识别有前景的催化剂和操作条件。

6. **连续流动处理**：实施连续流动反应器以维持最佳反应条件并促进高效质量传递，可能带来更高的产品产率和更低的成本。

7. **放大考虑**：解决从实验室规模到工业规模过程的挑战，重点是保持催化剂活性和稳定性在工业条件下。

通过这些领域的工作，研究人员和工程师可以潜在地克服催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选择。
