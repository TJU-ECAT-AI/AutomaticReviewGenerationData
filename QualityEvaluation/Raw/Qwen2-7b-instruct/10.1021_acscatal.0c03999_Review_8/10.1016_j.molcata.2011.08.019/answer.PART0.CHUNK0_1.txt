[1] "Many recent investigations have focused on dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "These investigations have been encouraged by a strong demand for propene,which has become one of the most important petrochemicals used for the produc- tion of a variety of polymers and chemical intermediates,such as:polypropylene,acrylonitile,OXO alcohols,isopropyl alcohol,acrylic acid and propylene oxide."
[3] "So far,different bulk and supported oxide-based materials con- taining active species,such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn  [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."
[4] "In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[5] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation path- ways."
[6] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[7] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."
[8] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
[9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
[10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, focusing on various catalysts such as chromium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide, vanadium oxide, indium oxide, and manganese oxide. It mentions that these catalysts are active in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways when CO2 is present. Chromium and gallium materials were found to be the most active and selective among the studied catalysts. The activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials depends on factors like the oxidation state of chromium species, their structure, and the interaction with silica. High dispersion of chromium species, especially in the form of Cr6+ species, is crucial for high activity. However, the presence of crystalline Cr2O3 forms on the silica surface negatively impacts catalytic activity due to its resistance to hydrogen and oxygen, rendering it ineffective as a catalyst.

文献讨论了在二氧化碳存在的条件下丙烷脱氢，重点关注如铬氧化物、镓氧化物、锌氧化物、铁氧化物、钒氧化物、铟氧化物和锰氧化物等各种催化剂。提到这些催化剂在二氧化碳存在下同时具有脱氢和氧化脱氢途径。铬和镓材料被发现是最活跃且选择性高的催化剂。二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物材料的活性取决于铬物种的氧化状态、结构以及与二氧化硅的相互作用等因素。高分散的铬物种，尤其是Cr6+物种的存在对于高活性至关重要。然而，表面的结晶Cr2O3形式对催化活性有负面影响，因为它对氢气和氧气的抵抗性很高，使其作为催化剂无效。
