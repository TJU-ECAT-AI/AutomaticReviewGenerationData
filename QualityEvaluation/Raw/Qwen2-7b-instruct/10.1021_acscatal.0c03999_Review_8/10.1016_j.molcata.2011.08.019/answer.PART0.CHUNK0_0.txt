[1] "Many recent investigations have focused on dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "These investigations have been encouraged by a strong demand for propene,which has become one of the most important petrochemicals used for the production of a variety of polymers and chemical intermediates,such as:polypropylene,acrylonitile,OXO alcohols,isopropyl alcohol,acrylic acid and propylene oxide."
[3] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst,while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."
[4] "In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[5] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:"

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) involves considering its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, the types of catalysts utilized, and the key challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. The literature highlights that N2O is employed in ODHP processes due to its potential in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It enables the simultaneous occurrence of dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, contributing to the production of propene. However, critical challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the catalyst composition, improving the reaction conditions, and developing more stable catalysts. Research directions could focus on exploring novel catalysts, modifying existing ones, and enhancing the understanding of reaction mechanisms to improve ODHP efficiency and feasibility for practical applications.
