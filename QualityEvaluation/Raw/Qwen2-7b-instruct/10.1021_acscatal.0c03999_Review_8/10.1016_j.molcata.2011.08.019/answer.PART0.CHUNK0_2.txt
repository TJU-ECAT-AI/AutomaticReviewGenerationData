[1] "Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure."
[2] "In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[3] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions: (i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[4] "The first, direct oxidative pathway with CO2 was proposed in the case of redox oxides (Cr, V, and Fe), whereas in the case of non-redox materials, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 participates mainly in the removal of H2 in the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[5] "The presence of Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
[6] "Moreover, crystalline α-Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."
[7] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts, which were impregnated onto conventional amorphous silicas and mesoporous siliceous sieves with different pore structures. These catalysts were used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, where propene is obtained through both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. The presence of CO2 facilitates the oxidative pathway in redox oxides like chromium, vanadium, and iron, while in non-redox materials, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 primarily participates in removing hydrogen via the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The study highlights the importance of a high dispersion of chromium species on the catalyst surface for achieving high activity, as this allows for better accessibility of reactant molecules. However, the presence of certain chromium oxides, like α-Cr2O3, can negatively impact catalytic activity due to their resistance to hydrogen and oxygen.

文献讨论了将四种系列的含铬氧化物催化剂制备并浸渍到常规无定形硅胶和具有不同孔结构的多孔硅质筛上。这些催化剂用于在二氧化碳的存在下进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，通过脱氢和氧化脱氢途径同时获得丙烯。二氧化碳促进了红氧化物（如铬、钒和铁）中的氧化途径，而在非红氧化物材料，如镓氧化物基催化剂中，二氧化碳主要参与通过逆水煤气变换反应去除氢气。研究强调了催化剂表面高铬物种分散的重要性以实现高活性，因为这可以提高反应分子的可接近性。然而，某些铬氧化物，如α-Cr2O3，由于其对氢气和氧气的抵抗性，会负面影响催化活性。
