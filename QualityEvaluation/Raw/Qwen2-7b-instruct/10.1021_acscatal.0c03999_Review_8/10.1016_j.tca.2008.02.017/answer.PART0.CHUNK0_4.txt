[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:"
[3] "(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10];"
[4] "(2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [1114];"
[5] "(3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[6] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]."
[7] "Some of these studies have demonstrated that promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane strongly depends on properties of support [9,10,13,15,21]."
[8] "The real role of this support in the studied reaction has been discussed basing on the results of TG analysis of fresh and used chromium oxide supported on active carbon in inert and oxidizing (the presence of air or CO2) atmospheres."
[9] "The nature and size of pores were not essentially changed after the modification with chromium oxide."
[10] "For the samples containing Cr (not shown), submicropores still play a dominant role."
[11] "The specific surface area determined formally using the BET or Langmuir equation decreases with raising the Cr loading (Table 1)."
[12] "On the other hand, the micropore volume exceeds 0.250 cm3/g."
[13] "Therefore, it could be concluded that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based samples."
[14] "An effect of temperature on the rate of homogeneous phase reaction (empty reactor) and the catalytic performance of the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is comparatively presented in Fig. 4A and B, respectively."
[15] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."
[16] "The rate of activity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane, ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6."
[17] "It is observed that the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared to inert one."
[18] "This effect could be attributed to the higher yield of propene formed in the reaction performed in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[19] "However, the catalysts lose their activity in the formation of cracking products faster than in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[20] "The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic surface sites."
[21] "Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."
[22] "The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss."
[23] "It should be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."
[24] "Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation."
[25] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."
[26] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."
[27] "Finally, the interaction between CO2 and the active carbon-based samples was studied by TG."
[28] "The resulting DTG profiles are shown in Fig. 9."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature indicates several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. CO2, for instance, enhances the ODHP process by participating in direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption through reverse water-gas shift reactions, and coke gasification, which slows down catalyst deactivation. The literature highlights that the effectiveness of CO2 in enhancing the dehydrogenation of propane is significantly influenced by the properties of the support material.

Various catalysts, including chromium oxide, have been tested in the presence of CO2, showing that the promoting effect of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the support material's characteristics. The role of the active carbon support in this process has been thoroughly investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TG) of fresh and used catalysts in inert and oxidizing atmospheres. The TG results reveal that the support exhibits carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species that play a crucial role in the catalytic process. However, these species' concentration decreases over time, leading to the formation of an inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface.

Despite these advantages, the active carbon-based catalysts experience rapid deactivation over time, primarily due to the removal of surface carbonyl and carboxyl groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface. The literature suggests that CO2 can protect the catalyst against deactivation to some extent, but its effectiveness is limited by the reaction conditions used during the catalytic process. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing new catalysts with improved stability, optimizing the reaction conditions to enhance CO2's effectiveness, or employing advanced materials with enhanced resistance to deactivation.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, further research could focus on:
1. Developing novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity for propylene production.
2. Optimizing the reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield and minimize the formation of cracking products.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects of multiple gases (e.g., CO2 and N2O) to enhance the dehydrogenation process.
4. Employing advanced materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the ODHP process without experiencing rapid deactivation.
5. Enhancing the understanding of the deactivation mechanisms to develop effective mitigation strategies.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，文献表明与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在提高丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。CO2通过直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯、氢消耗以及逆水煤气变换反应，参与丙烷脱氢过程，并且通过促进焦炭气化来减缓催化剂失活。文献指出，CO2在促进丙烷脱氢过程中的效果很大程度上取决于支持材料的特性。

多种催化剂，包括铬氧化物，已经在CO2的存在下被测试，表明CO2对丙烷脱氢的促进效果高度依赖于支持材料的性质。活性碳支持在这一过程中发挥了关键作用，通过热重分析（TG）方法研究了新鲜和使用过的催化剂在惰性和氧化性气氛下的行为。TG结果表明，支持材料表面存在羰基和羧基等表面物种，在催化过程中起着至关重要的作用。然而，这些物种的浓度随时间逐渐降低，导致催化剂表面形成不可活性的碳沉积物。

尽管如此，活性碳基催化剂在使用过程中经历快速失活，主要原因是表面羰基和羧基团的去除以及催化剂表面上形成不可活性的焦炭。文献提出，CO2可以在一定程度上保护催化剂免受失活，但其有效性受到催化过程所用条件的限制。为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业实施选项，可以采取以下策略：
1. 开发具有增强稳定性和丙烯选择性的新型催化剂。
2. 优化反应条件以最大化丙烯产率并减少裂解产物的生成。
3. 探索多种气体（例如CO2和N2O）的协同效应以增强脱氢过程。
4. 使用能够承受ODHP过程苛刻条件且不易失活的先进材料。
5. 增强对失活机制的理解，开发有效的缓解策略。
