[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "Recently, the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has been studied [68] as an alternative technology for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10]; (2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [1114]; (3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[4] "Some of these studies have demonstrated that promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane strongly depends on properties of support [9,10,13,21]."
[5] "The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reaction performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature of 600 C."
[6] "The non-modified active carbon support exhibits a quite reasonable activity in the process, which can be carried out with propane conversion of 16.5% in this case."
[7] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst."
[8] "The rate of activity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane, ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6."

1. The growing demand for propene, driven by various industries, is driving research into alternative methods of propene production and improving conventional production techniques. The dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 is considered an alternative technology that yields propene with higher efficiency.

2. The promoting effect of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to its ability to directly oxidize propane to propene, consume hydrogen through reverse water-gas shift reactions, and slow down catalyst deactivation through coke gasification.

3. The effectiveness of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation depends on the properties of the catalyst support, indicating that the right support can enhance CO2's promoting effect.

4. Chromium (Cr)-modified active carbons are highly effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, achieving high conversion rates. The best results were obtained with a Cr content of around 5%.

5. Active carbons used as supports in propane dehydrogenation catalysts undergo deactivation over time, which is partly due to the partial decomposition of surface oxygen-containing groups.

6. The use of chromium oxide (CrOx) in the catalyst enhances the propane conversion process, especially at higher temperatures. However, the deactivation of the catalyst is accelerated in the presence of air compared to inert gases.

7. The presence of oxygen-containing surface species on the catalyst is crucial for the catalytic process. Their reduction during the reaction indicates a potential mechanism for catalyst deactivation.

8. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst begins to degrade at a lower temperature (300°C) compared to when exposed to air. This degradation may be due to the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

9. CO2 acts as a less effective oxidizing agent than air, suggesting that the conditions used in the catalytic process might not fully exploit CO2's potential for catalyst deactivation.

1. 由于聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯氧化物和对甲苯等产品的市场需求增长，正在推动研究寻找替代的丙烯生产方法以及改进传统的丙烯生产工艺。在使用二氧化碳进行丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烯的产量更高。

2. 二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢中的促进作用归因于其直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯、消耗氢气通过逆向水煤气变换反应，以及通过焦炭气化降低催化剂失活速率的能力。

3. 二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢中的促进效果取决于催化剂支撑材料的性质，这表明选择合适的支撑材料可以增强二氧化碳的促进效果。

4. 铬（Cr）改性的活性碳是高效的丙烷脱氢催化剂，特别是在大约5%的铬含量下，取得了最佳的丙烷转化率。

5. 在丙烷脱氢催化剂中使用活性碳作为支持材料会经历随着时间推移的失活过程，部分原因是表面氧含有的组分分解。

6. 铬氧化物（CrOx）的存在提高了催化剂的丙烷转化过程，尤其是在较高温度下。然而，在空气中的催化剂失活速度比在惰性气体中更快。

7. 催化剂表面存在的氧含有的表面物种对于催化过程至关重要。这些物种在反应期间的减少可能是一种催化剂失活的潜在机制。

8. Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在较低温度（300°C）开始降解，这可能是由于催化剂表面形成碳质沉积物导致的。

9. 二氧化碳作为氧化剂的作用远不如空气，这表明所使用的催化工艺条件可能未能充分利用二氧化碳的失活潜力。
