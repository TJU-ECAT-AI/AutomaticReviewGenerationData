The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The document highlights the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhancing propene production through three mechanisms: direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and coke gasification, which reduces catalyst deactivation rates. Active carbon support was found to play a crucial role in this process, with the presence of carbon dioxide being instrumental in promoting the catalytic activity.

However, the process faces challenges, including catalyst deactivation due to the formation of inactive carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface. This deactivation is exacerbated by the inability of CO2 to effectively remove these deposits, leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency over time.

Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more stable catalysts that can withstand the deactivation effects of CO2, improving the design of the catalytic system to facilitate the removal of carbonaceous deposits, or exploring alternative oxidants that may offer better stability and selectivity. Research could also focus on optimizing the operating conditions to enhance the efficiency of the process while minimizing catalyst deactivation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂提供了一些优势，特别是在与其它氧化剂相比时，丙烯选择性方面。文档强调了二氧化碳（CO2）通过三种机制增强丙烯生产的角色：直接氧化丙烷为丙烯、氢消耗通过逆向水煤气变换反应以及焦炭气化，这些都能降低催化剂的失活速率。活性碳支持在这一过程中扮演关键角色，二氧化碳的存在对促进催化活性至关重要。

然而，该过程面临挑战，包括由于在催化剂表面形成无活性的碳沉积物导致催化剂失活。CO2无法有效去除这些沉积物，从而导致催化剂效率随时间逐渐下降。

应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，使其能够承受CO2的失活影响，改进催化系统的设计以促进沉积物的去除，或者探索可能提供更好稳定性和选择性的其他氧化剂。研究还可以集中在优化操作条件上，以提高过程效率的同时减少催化剂失活。

1. The growing demand for propene, driven by various industries, is driving research into alternative methods of propene production and improving conventional production techniques. The dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 is considered an alternative technology that yields propene with higher efficiency.

2. The promoting effect of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to its ability to directly oxidize propane to propene, consume hydrogen through reverse water-gas shift reactions, and slow down catalyst deactivation through coke gasification.

3. The effectiveness of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation depends on the properties of the catalyst support, indicating that the right support can enhance CO2's promoting effect.

4. Chromium (Cr)-modified active carbons are highly effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, achieving high conversion rates. The best results were obtained with a Cr content of around 5%.

5. Active carbons used as supports in propane dehydrogenation catalysts undergo deactivation over time, which is partly due to the partial decomposition of surface oxygen-containing groups.

6. The use of chromium oxide (CrOx) in the catalyst enhances the propane conversion process, especially at higher temperatures. However, the deactivation of the catalyst is accelerated in the presence of air compared to inert gases.

7. The presence of oxygen-containing surface species on the catalyst is crucial for the catalytic process. Their reduction during the reaction indicates a potential mechanism for catalyst deactivation.

8. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst begins to degrade at a lower temperature (300°C) compared to when exposed to air. This degradation may be due to the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

9. CO2 acts as a less effective oxidizing agent than air, suggesting that the conditions used in the catalytic process might not fully exploit CO2's potential for catalyst deactivation.

7. 催化剂表面存在的氧含有的表面物种对于催化过程至关重要。这些物种在反应期间的减少可能是一种催化剂失活的潜在机制。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O provides a mild oxidizing environment, allowing for selective conversion of propane to propylene without excessive formation of byproducts. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including metal oxides, zeolites, and supported catalysts. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are significant issues in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. These challenges include the gradual decrease in surface concentration of active sites due to poisoning or decomposition, leading to a decline in catalytic activity over time.

Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst supports, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the optimization of reaction conditions to maximize selectivity and yield. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of novel catalyst materials, the exploration of synergistic effects between multiple catalyst components, and the implementation of continuous flow reactor systems to maintain optimal conditions and enhance process efficiency. Through these efforts, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable option for propylene production, offering environmental benefits due to reduced energy consumption and potential for lower emissions compared to conventional methods.

在丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O，相对于其他氧化剂而言，在丙烯选择性方面具有明显优势。N2O提供了一个温和的氧化环境，允许选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的形成。各种催化剂已被用于ODHP过程，包括金属氧化物、沸石和负载型催化剂。催化剂失活和稳定性问题在N2O-ODHP的实用实施中是重大挑战。这些挑战包括活性位点表面浓度逐渐降低，导致活性下降。

应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂支撑材料、设计具有增强抗失活能力的催化剂以及优化反应条件以最大化选择性和产率。研究方向可以集中在新型催化剂材料的合成、多个催化剂组分之间的协同效应探索，以及连续流反应系统的应用，以维持最佳条件并提高工艺效率。通过这些努力，N2O-ODHP有可能成为丙烯生产的一个更可行的选择，由于减少了能源消耗和潜在的较低排放量，这将带来环境效益。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature indicates several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. CO2, for instance, enhances the ODHP process by participating in direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption through reverse water-gas shift reactions, and coke gasification, which slows down catalyst deactivation. The literature highlights that the effectiveness of CO2 in enhancing the dehydrogenation of propane is significantly influenced by the properties of the support material.

Various catalysts, including chromium oxide, have been tested in the presence of CO2, showing that the promoting effect of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the support material's characteristics. The role of the active carbon support in this process has been thoroughly investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TG) of fresh and used catalysts in inert and oxidizing atmospheres. The TG results reveal that the support exhibits carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species that play a crucial role in the catalytic process. However, these species' concentration decreases over time, leading to the formation of an inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface.

Despite these advantages, the active carbon-based catalysts experience rapid deactivation over time, primarily due to the removal of surface carbonyl and carboxyl groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface. The literature suggests that CO2 can protect the catalyst against deactivation to some extent, but its effectiveness is limited by the reaction conditions used during the catalytic process. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing new catalysts with improved stability, optimizing the reaction conditions to enhance CO2's effectiveness, or employing advanced materials with enhanced resistance to deactivation.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, further research could focus on:
1. Developing novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity for propylene production.
2. Optimizing the reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield and minimize the formation of cracking products.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects of multiple gases (e.g., CO2 and N2O) to enhance the dehydrogenation process.
4. Employing advanced materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the ODHP process without experiencing rapid deactivation.
5. Enhancing the understanding of the deactivation mechanisms to develop effective mitigation strategies.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，文献表明与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在提高丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。CO2通过直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯、氢消耗以及逆水煤气变换反应，参与丙烷脱氢过程，并且通过促进焦炭气化来减缓催化剂失活。文献指出，CO2在促进丙烷脱氢过程中的效果很大程度上取决于支持材料的特性。

多种催化剂，包括铬氧化物，已经在CO2的存在下被测试，表明CO2对丙烷脱氢的促进效果高度依赖于支持材料的性质。活性碳支持在这一过程中发挥了关键作用，通过热重分析（TG）方法研究了新鲜和使用过的催化剂在惰性和氧化性气氛下的行为。TG结果表明，支持材料表面存在羰基和羧基等表面物种，在催化过程中起着至关重要的作用。然而，这些物种的浓度随时间逐渐降低，导致催化剂表面形成不可活性的碳沉积物。

尽管如此，活性碳基催化剂在使用过程中经历快速失活，主要原因是表面羰基和羧基团的去除以及催化剂表面上形成不可活性的焦炭。文献提出，CO2可以在一定程度上保护催化剂免受失活，但其有效性受到催化过程所用条件的限制。为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业实施选项，可以采取以下策略：
1. 开发具有增强稳定性和丙烯选择性的新型催化剂。
2. 优化反应条件以最大化丙烯产率并减少裂解产物的生成。
3. 探索多种气体（例如CO2和N2O）的协同效应以增强脱氢过程。
4. 使用能够承受ODHP过程苛刻条件且不易失活的先进材料。
5. 增强对失活机制的理解，开发有效的缓解策略。
