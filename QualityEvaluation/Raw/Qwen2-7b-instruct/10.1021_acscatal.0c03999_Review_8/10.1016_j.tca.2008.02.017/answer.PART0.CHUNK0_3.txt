[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "Recently, the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has been studied [68] as an alternative technology for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[3] "CO2 can play a role of an oxidizing agent:"
[4] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."
[5] "It should be assumed that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O provides a mild oxidizing environment, allowing for selective conversion of propane to propylene without excessive formation of byproducts. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including metal oxides, zeolites, and supported catalysts. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are significant issues in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. These challenges include the gradual decrease in surface concentration of active sites due to poisoning or decomposition, leading to a decline in catalytic activity over time.

Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst supports, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the optimization of reaction conditions to maximize selectivity and yield. Research directions could focus on the synthesis of novel catalyst materials, the exploration of synergistic effects between multiple catalyst components, and the implementation of continuous flow reactor systems to maintain optimal conditions and enhance process efficiency. Through these efforts, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable option for propylene production, offering environmental benefits due to reduced energy consumption and potential for lower emissions compared to conventional methods.

在丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O，相对于其他氧化剂而言，在丙烯选择性方面具有明显优势。N2O提供了一个温和的氧化环境，允许选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的形成。各种催化剂已被用于ODHP过程，包括金属氧化物、沸石和负载型催化剂。催化剂失活和稳定性问题在N2O-ODHP的实用实施中是重大挑战。这些挑战包括活性位点表面浓度逐渐降低，导致活性下降。

应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂支撑材料、设计具有增强抗失活能力的催化剂以及优化反应条件以最大化选择性和产率。研究方向可以集中在新型催化剂材料的合成、多个催化剂组分之间的协同效应探索，以及连续流反应系统的应用，以维持最佳条件并提高工艺效率。通过这些努力，N2O-ODHP有可能成为丙烯生产的一个更可行的选择，由于减少了能源消耗和潜在的较低排放量，这将带来环境效益。
