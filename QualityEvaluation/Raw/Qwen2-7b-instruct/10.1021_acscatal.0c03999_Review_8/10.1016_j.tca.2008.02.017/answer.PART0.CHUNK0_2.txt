[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O); (2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium; (3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst."
[3] "A negative effect of activity decay with time-on-stream was found. The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[4] "It should, however, be noted that an additional mass loss at about 920 C is observed for Cr(5.0)/AC. This effect can be assigned to reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium by carbonaceous support."
[5] "The presence of the introduced chromium oxide results in lower total mass loss (86.89%) than for the AC material."
[6] "On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface."
[7] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

1. The growing demand for propene, particularly due to the increasing demand for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cumene, has spurred research into new methods of propene production from alternative sources and improvements in conventional production techniques. CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing propene yields through direct oxidation of propane, reverse water-gas shift reactions, and coke gasification, which can slow down catalyst deactivation.

2. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. CO2 promotes propene formation through direct oxidation, shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation process, and slowing down catalyst deactivation by gasifying coke. However, N2O-ODHP faces challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly concerning the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface.

3. Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP might include optimizing catalyst design to enhance stability and selectivity, developing more robust catalysts capable of withstanding the harsh conditions imposed by the presence of CO2, and refining the operating conditions to ensure efficient utilization of N2O as an oxidant. Research directions could involve studying the interaction between N2O and active carbon supports under various conditions to determine the optimal temperature and pressure for efficient propene production, as well as exploring the potential synergies between N2O and other oxidants or promoters to improve the overall process efficiency.

1. 由于对聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯氧化物和苯甲酸的日益增长的需求，促进了从替代来源寻找新方法生产丙烯以及改进传统生产方法的研究。二氧化碳在通过直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯、逆向水煤气转换反应消耗氢气，以及通过碳化生成催化活性降低来减缓催化剂失活的过程中，提高了丙烯的产量。

2. 在使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，N2O相对于其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。二氧化碳通过直接氧化丙烷、逆向水煤气转换反应和碳化作用促进丙烯形成，这些过程可以减慢催化剂的失活速度。然而，N2O-ODHP面临着催化剂失活和稳定性的挑战，特别是催化剂表面上形成的无活性焦炭。

3. 应对N2O-ODHP限制的策略可能包括优化催化剂设计以提高稳定性和选择性，开发能够承受CO2条件的更坚固催化剂，以及调整操作条件以有效利用N2O作为氧化剂。研究方向可能涉及在不同条件下研究N2O与活性碳支持物的相互作用，以确定高效生成丙烯所需的最优温度和压力，同时探索N2O与其他氧化剂或促进剂的协同作用，以提高整个过程的效率。
