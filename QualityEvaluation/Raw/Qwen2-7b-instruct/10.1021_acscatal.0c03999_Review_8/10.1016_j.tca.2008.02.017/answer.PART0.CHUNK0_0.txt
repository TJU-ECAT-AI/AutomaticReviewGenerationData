[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[3] "This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O); (2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium; (3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst."
[4] "In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[5] "It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers."
[6] "Moreover, a formation of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed."
[7] "The rate of deactivation expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane, ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The document highlights the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhancing propene production through three mechanisms: direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and coke gasification, which reduces catalyst deactivation rates. Active carbon support was found to play a crucial role in this process, with the presence of carbon dioxide being instrumental in promoting the catalytic activity.

However, the process faces challenges, including catalyst deactivation due to the formation of inactive carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface. This deactivation is exacerbated by the inability of CO2 to effectively remove these deposits, leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency over time.

Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more stable catalysts that can withstand the deactivation effects of CO2, improving the design of the catalytic system to facilitate the removal of carbonaceous deposits, or exploring alternative oxidants that may offer better stability and selectivity. Research could also focus on optimizing the operating conditions to enhance the efficiency of the process while minimizing catalyst deactivation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂提供了一些优势，特别是在与其它氧化剂相比时，丙烯选择性方面。文档强调了二氧化碳（CO2）通过三种机制增强丙烯生产的角色：直接氧化丙烷为丙烯、氢消耗通过逆向水煤气变换反应以及焦炭气化，这些都能降低催化剂的失活速率。活性碳支持在这一过程中扮演关键角色，二氧化碳的存在对促进催化活性至关重要。

然而，该过程面临挑战，包括由于在催化剂表面形成无活性的碳沉积物导致催化剂失活。CO2无法有效去除这些沉积物，从而导致催化剂效率随时间逐渐下降。

应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，使其能够承受CO2的失活影响，改进催化系统的设计以促进沉积物的去除，或者探索可能提供更好稳定性和选择性的其他氧化剂。研究还可以集中在优化操作条件上，以提高过程效率的同时减少催化剂失活。
