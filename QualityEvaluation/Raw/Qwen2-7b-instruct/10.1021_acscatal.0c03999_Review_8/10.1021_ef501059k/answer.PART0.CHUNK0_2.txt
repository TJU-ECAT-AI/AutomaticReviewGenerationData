[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been widely studied for the production of propylene."
[2] "One of the key challenges in ODHP processes is the selection of appropriate oxidants and catalysts that can efficiently convert propane into propylene."
[3] "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been considered as an alternative oxidant due to its unique properties."
[4] "The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages, including higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants."
[5] "However, the process also faces significant challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability."
[6] "Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of novel catalysts or modifications to the reaction conditions."
