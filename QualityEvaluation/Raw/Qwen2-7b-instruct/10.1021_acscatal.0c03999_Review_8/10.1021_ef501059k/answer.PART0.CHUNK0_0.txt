Answer: There are no specific quotes provided regarding the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, or the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, there are no proposed strategies or research directions addressing these limitations.

Given the absence of relevant quotes, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis based on the document. However, it can be assumed that the document likely discusses the process of oxidative dehydrogenation, possibly including the role of different oxidants, catalysts, and the issues faced during the process. For a comprehensive understanding, further reading of the document or additional literature would be required.

答案：文档中没有提供关于使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢的氧化剂、与其它氧化剂相比其在丙烯选择性方面的优势、此过程中使用的各种催化剂，以及催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战的具体引文。此外，也没有提出解决这些限制的策略或研究方向。

鉴于缺乏相关引文，无法基于文档提供详细分析。然而，可以假设文档可能讨论了氧化脱氢过程，包括不同氧化剂、催化剂的作用以及过程中遇到的问题。为了全面理解，需要进一步阅读文档或额外的文献。
