[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising route for producing high-value chemicals such as propylene."
[2] "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been proposed as an alternative oxidant in ODHP due to its potential environmental benefits."
[3] "The use of N2O in ODHP can lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like air."
[4] "However, catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant challenges in N2O-ODHP processes."
[5] "Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of novel catalyst materials and improved process conditions."

Hydraulic fracturing additives can contribute to the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas production. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is suggested as an alternative oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Its advantage lies in higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional oxidants like air. The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP processes involve catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to overcome these limitations might involve developing new catalyst materials and optimizing process conditions.
