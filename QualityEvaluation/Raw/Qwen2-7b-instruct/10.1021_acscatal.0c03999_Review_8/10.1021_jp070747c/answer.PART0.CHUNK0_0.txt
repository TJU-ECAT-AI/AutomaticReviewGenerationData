[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
[2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
[3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
[4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. 

The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. 

Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the synthesis of VOx species to enhance dispersion and prevent microcrystalline V2O5 formation. Research could also focus on developing more stable catalyst supports that reduce the propensity for nonselective reactions. Additionally, refining the process conditions to maximize the reoxidation efficiency of N2O while minimizing the formation of nonselective oxygen species could lead to a more practical implementation of N2O-ODHP technology.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，将亚硝酸氮（N2O）用作氧化剂时，文献强调了与使用其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的几个优势。特别是，N2O被发现可以提供比氧气（O2）更高的丙烯选择性，这归因于其独特的能力，能够更慢地重新氧化还原的钒氧化物（VOx）物种，从而影响这些物种的还原程度。这种还原程度对实现高丙烯选择性和抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化到碳氧化物至关重要。

研究采用包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48在内的各种催化剂，以探讨不同氧化剂对ODHP反应的影响。通过原位UV/vis分析深入研究了VOx物种的还原动力学，揭示了参与丙烷和丙烯选择性和非选择性转化的活性氧物种的性质。

为解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的局限性，可能的策略包括优化VOx物种的合成，以增强分散度并防止微晶V2O5的形成。研究还可以集中在开发减少非选择性反应倾向的更稳定的催化剂支撑材料上。此外，通过最大化N2O的重新氧化效率同时减少非选择性氧物种的形成，调整工艺条件，可以使N2O-ODHP技术的实用实施成为可能。
