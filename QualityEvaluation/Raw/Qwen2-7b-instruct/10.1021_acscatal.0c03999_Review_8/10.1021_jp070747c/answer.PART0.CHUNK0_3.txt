[1] "Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
[2] "The ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
[3] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The key catalysts employed in this process involve vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include maintaining high propene selectivity while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx).

To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, strategies could focus on:

1. Optimizing the reduction degree of VOx species. The degree of reduction affects the ability of N2O to reoxidize these species, impacting propene selectivity.
   
2. Investigating the nature of oxygen species produced during the reaction. The study suggests that N2O does not generate nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which can catalyze undesired reactions.

3. Enhancing the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species. This separation reduces the density of active oxygen species, which is crucial for minimizing nonselective reactions.

4. Conducting further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.

These approaches aim to refine the N2O-ODHP process, optimizing the balance between propene selectivity and COx formation, thereby enhancing its feasibility for practical applications.

分析硝酸氧化氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。所使用的关键催化剂包括二氧化硅（SiO2）支持的钒（VOx）、介孔硅基材料（MCM、SBA）以及氧化铝。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括在保持高丙烯选择性的同时，尽量减少碳氧化物（COx）的形成。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际操作性，可以采取以下策略：

1. 最优控制VOx物种的还原程度。还原程度影响N2O重新氧化这些物种的能力，进而影响丙烯的选择性。
   
2. 研究反应过程中产生的氧气物种的性质。研究指出，N2O不会生成非选择性吸附氧气物种，这些物种可能催化不希望的反应。

3. 提高活性晶格氧物种的空间分离。这种分离减少了活性氧气物种的密度，对于减少非选择性反应至关重要。

4. 进行进一步的实验机制研究和理论（密度泛函理论）计算，以精确定义从O2和N2O生成的还原VOx物种的氧气物种的性质。

这些方法旨在优化N2O-ODHP过程，平衡丙烯选择性和COx形成之间的关系，从而提高其实际应用的可能性。
