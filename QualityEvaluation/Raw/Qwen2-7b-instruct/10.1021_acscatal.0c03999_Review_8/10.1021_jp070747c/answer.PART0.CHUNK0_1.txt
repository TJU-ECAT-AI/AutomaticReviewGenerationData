[1] "The in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode enabled to distinguish the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[2] "Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
[3] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in terms of enhancing propylene selectivity. N2O enables higher propene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2, which is crucial for maintaining high product purity. This is attributed to its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species and prevent the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that could catalyze undesired reactions.

2. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including vanadium-based materials supported on mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) and amorphous silica. These catalysts exhibit varying degrees of propene selectivity depending on the nature of the support and the vanadium loading. The selectivity is influenced by factors such as the reducibility of vanadium oxide species, their structure, and electronic properties, which can vary with the type of supporting material.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP processes involve maintaining optimal reaction conditions to prevent catalyst poisoning, degradation, and loss of activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations could include developing more stable and selective catalysts, optimizing operating conditions, and implementing effective regeneration techniques. Research directions might focus on modifying catalyst composition, enhancing support properties, and exploring novel catalytic mechanisms that could improve ODHP efficiency and sustainability.

4. The role of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP processes is pivotal in achieving high propene selectivity. N2O achieves this by reducing the degree of reduction of vanadium species on the catalyst surface, thus minimizing nonselective reactions that lead to the formation of unwanted carbon oxides. Additionally, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are responsible for undesirable consecutive propene oxidation. These advantages highlight the potential of N2O as a feasible option for practical implementation in ODHP, although further research is needed to optimize process conditions and catalyst design for enhanced performance.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有多项优势，特别是提高丙烯选择性。N2O能够提高丙烯选择性并抑制连续丙烯氧化至CO和CO2，这对于保持高产品纯度至关重要。这是由于其能够降低活性氧物种表面密度并防止形成可能催化不希望反应的非选择性吸附氧物种。

2. 在ODHP过程中已采用多种催化剂，包括基于范德华材料支持的微孔硅基材料（MCM、SBA）和无定形硅。这些催化剂根据支撑材料的性质和范德华负载表现出不同的丙烯选择性。选择性受因素如范德华氧化物物种的可还原性、结构和电子性质的影响，这些性质会随着支撑材料的不同而变化。

3. ODHP过程中的关键挑战涉及维持最佳反应条件以防止催化剂中毒、降解和活动随时间的丧失。应对这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂、优化操作条件以及实施有效的再生技术。研究方向可能集中在修改催化剂组成、增强支撑性能以及探索能够改善ODHP效率和可持续性的新型催化机制。

4. N2O在ODHP过程中作为氧化剂的角色至关重要，有助于实现高丙烯选择性。N2O通过减少催化剂表面上的范德华物种的还原程度，从而最小化导致生成不希望的碳氧化物的非选择性反应来实现这一点。此外，N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，这会导致连续丙烯氧化。这些优势表明N2O作为ODHP可行选项的潜力，尽管仍需要进一步的研究来优化过程条件和催化剂设计以提高性能。
