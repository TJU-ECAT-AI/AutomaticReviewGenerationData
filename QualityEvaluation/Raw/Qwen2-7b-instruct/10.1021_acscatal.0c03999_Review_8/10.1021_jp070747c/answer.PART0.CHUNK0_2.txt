1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity.

2. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics.

3. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, which are responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

4. The study reveals that N2O not only improves propylene selectivity but also affects the nature of oxygen species involved in the reaction. It suggests that N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. This is attributed to the different mechanisms of oxygen adsorption and decomposition over reducible metal oxides, with N2O yielding mononuclear oxygen species considered as selective ones.

1. 硝酸二氧（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比，具有明显优势。具体而言，N2O能够实现更高的初步丙烯选择性和抑制连续丙烯氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高整体选择性和活性。

2. 本研究采用包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48在内的多种催化剂，对ODHP过程进行研究。这些材料通过表征其表面性质、宏观特性以及催化性能，提供关于它们如何影响反应动力学的见解。

3. 使用N2O的关键优势在于其能够降低催化剂表面上活性氧物种的密度。这种活性氧物种的空间分离减少了非选择性氧物种的形成，这些物种负责催化非选择性丙烷/丙烯氧化为碳氧化物。

4. 研究表明，N2O不仅提高了丙烯选择性，还影响了参与反应的氧物种的性质。它建议N2O不产生来自O2的非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种是通过复杂还原过程形成的，并催化非选择性连续丙烯氧化为碳氧化物。这是由于不同机制的氧吸附和分解在可还原金属氧化物上，N2O产生被认为具有选择性的单核氧物种。
