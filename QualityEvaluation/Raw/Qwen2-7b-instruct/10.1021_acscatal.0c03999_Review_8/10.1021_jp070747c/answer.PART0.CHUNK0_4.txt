[1] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, 20,36 it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."
[2] "Since the ODP activity with N2O was lower than with O2,20 we suggested that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity."
[3] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
[4] "However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for superior performance of N2O as compared to O2. On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key advantages are highlighted compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O significantly enhances propylene selectivity over vanadia-based catalysts, as evidenced by the increase in propene selectivity when replacing O2 with N2O. This improvement is attributed to the ability of N2O to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst, thereby suppressing nonselective reactions and promoting more efficient propene formation.

The catalysts employed in this process include alumina- and silica-supported vanadia materials, with the silica-supported catalysts demonstrating particularly promising results. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are common in ODHP, often stemming from the complex interactions between the catalyst and the oxidant. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more robust catalyst compositions, optimizing the catalyst preparation methods, and exploring novel reaction conditions that mitigate unwanted side reactions.

Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include further elucidating the detailed mechanisms of oxygen species adsorption and reactivity on the catalyst surfaces. This involves detailed characterization of the active oxygen species generated from both O2 and N2O, and understanding how these species influence the selectivity towards propene and carbon oxides. Additionally, efforts could focus on enhancing catalyst stability and durability under industrially relevant conditions, such as by incorporating protective layers or modifying the catalyst structure to resist deactivation. 

By combining insights from in-situ UV/vis analysis, transient isotopic studies, and catalytic tests, researchers can refine catalyst designs and operational parameters to optimize propene selectivity while maintaining reasonable activity levels. This approach not only improves the efficiency of the ODHP process but also paves the way for the broader adoption of N2O as an environmentally friendly oxidant in industrial applications.

在氧化脱氢作用于丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂显示出一些关键优势，特别是在与其它氧化剂相比时。具体而言，N2O显著提高了丙烯选择性，在用N2O替代O2时，丙烷选择性增加。这种改善归因于N2O降低催化剂表面活性氧物种密度的能力，从而抑制非选择性反应并促进更有效的丙烯形成。

用于此过程的催化剂包括铝酸盐和硅酸盐支持的钒基催化剂，特别是硅酸盐支持的催化剂显示出特别有前景的结果。与ODHP相关的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战是常见的，通常源自催化剂与氧化剂之间的复杂相互作用。为解决这些局限性，可能的策略包括开发更坚固的催化剂组成，优化催化剂制备方法，并探索能减少不希望的副反应的新反应条件。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用中更可行的选择，研究方向可以包括进一步阐明氧物种在催化剂表面上吸附和反应的详细机制。这涉及对从O2和N2O生成的活性氧物种的详细表征，以及理解这些物种如何影响向丙烯和碳氧化物的选择性。此外，努力可以集中在增强催化剂在工业相关条件下稳定性和耐久性的方法上，例如通过引入保护层或修改催化剂结构来抵抗失活。

结合原位紫外/可见光分析、瞬态同位素研究和催化测试的见解，研究人员可以精炼催化剂设计和操作参数，以优化丙烯选择性的同时保持合理的活性水平。这种方法不仅提高了ODHP过程的效率，而且为N2O作为一种环保型氧化剂在工业应用中的广泛应用铺平了道路。
