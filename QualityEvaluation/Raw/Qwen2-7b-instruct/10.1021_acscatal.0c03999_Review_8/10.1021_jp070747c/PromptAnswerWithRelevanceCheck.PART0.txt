[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
[2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
[3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
[4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. 

The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. 

Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the synthesis of VOx species to enhance dispersion and prevent microcrystalline V2O5 formation. Research could also focus on developing more stable catalyst supports that reduce the propensity for nonselective reactions. Additionally, refining the process conditions to maximize the reoxidation efficiency of N2O while minimizing the formation of nonselective oxygen species could lead to a more practical implementation of N2O-ODHP technology.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，将亚硝酸氮（N2O）用作氧化剂时，文献强调了与使用其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的几个优势。特别是，N2O被发现可以提供比氧气（O2）更高的丙烯选择性，这归因于其独特的能力，能够更慢地重新氧化还原的钒氧化物（VOx）物种，从而影响这些物种的还原程度。这种还原程度对实现高丙烯选择性和抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化到碳氧化物至关重要。

研究采用包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48在内的各种催化剂，以探讨不同氧化剂对ODHP反应的影响。通过原位UV/vis分析深入研究了VOx物种的还原动力学，揭示了参与丙烷和丙烯选择性和非选择性转化的活性氧物种的性质。

为解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的局限性，可能的策略包括优化VOx物种的合成，以增强分散度并防止微晶V2O5的形成。研究还可以集中在开发减少非选择性反应倾向的更稳定的催化剂支撑材料上。此外，通过最大化N2O的重新氧化效率同时减少非选择性氧物种的形成，调整工艺条件，可以使N2O-ODHP技术的实用实施成为可能。

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in terms of enhancing propylene selectivity. N2O enables higher propene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2, which is crucial for maintaining high product purity. This is attributed to its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species and prevent the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that could catalyze undesired reactions.

2. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including vanadium-based materials supported on mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) and amorphous silica. These catalysts exhibit varying degrees of propene selectivity depending on the nature of the support and the vanadium loading. The selectivity is influenced by factors such as the reducibility of vanadium oxide species, their structure, and electronic properties, which can vary with the type of supporting material.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP processes involve maintaining optimal reaction conditions to prevent catalyst poisoning, degradation, and loss of activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations could include developing more stable and selective catalysts, optimizing operating conditions, and implementing effective regeneration techniques. Research directions might focus on modifying catalyst composition, enhancing support properties, and exploring novel catalytic mechanisms that could improve ODHP efficiency and sustainability.

4. The role of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP processes is pivotal in achieving high propene selectivity. N2O achieves this by reducing the degree of reduction of vanadium species on the catalyst surface, thus minimizing nonselective reactions that lead to the formation of unwanted carbon oxides. Additionally, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are responsible for undesirable consecutive propene oxidation. These advantages highlight the potential of N2O as a feasible option for practical implementation in ODHP, although further research is needed to optimize process conditions and catalyst design for enhanced performance.

4. N2O在ODHP过程中作为氧化剂的角色至关重要，有助于实现高丙烯选择性。N2O通过减少催化剂表面上的范德华物种的还原程度，从而最小化导致生成不希望的碳氧化物的非选择性反应来实现这一点。此外，N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，这会导致连续丙烯氧化。这些优势表明N2O作为ODHP可行选项的潜力，尽管仍需要进一步的研究来优化过程条件和催化剂设计以提高性能。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The key catalysts employed in this process involve vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include maintaining high propene selectivity while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx).

To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, strategies could focus on:

1. Optimizing the reduction degree of VOx species. The degree of reduction affects the ability of N2O to reoxidize these species, impacting propene selectivity.
   
2. Investigating the nature of oxygen species produced during the reaction. The study suggests that N2O does not generate nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which can catalyze undesired reactions.

3. Enhancing the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species. This separation reduces the density of active oxygen species, which is crucial for minimizing nonselective reactions.

4. Conducting further experimental mechanistic studies and theoretical (density functional theory) calculations to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.

These approaches aim to refine the N2O-ODHP process, optimizing the balance between propene selectivity and COx formation, thereby enhancing its feasibility for practical applications.

分析硝酸氧化氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。所使用的关键催化剂包括二氧化硅（SiO2）支持的钒（VOx）、介孔硅基材料（MCM、SBA）以及氧化铝。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括在保持高丙烯选择性的同时，尽量减少碳氧化物（COx）的形成。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际操作性，可以采取以下策略：

1. 最优控制VOx物种的还原程度。还原程度影响N2O重新氧化这些物种的能力，进而影响丙烯的选择性。
   
2. 研究反应过程中产生的氧气物种的性质。研究指出，N2O不会生成非选择性吸附氧气物种，这些物种可能催化不希望的反应。

3. 提高活性晶格氧物种的空间分离。这种分离减少了活性氧气物种的密度，对于减少非选择性反应至关重要。

4. 进行进一步的实验机制研究和理论（密度泛函理论）计算，以精确定义从O2和N2O生成的还原VOx物种的氧气物种的性质。

这些方法旨在优化N2O-ODHP过程，平衡丙烯选择性和COx形成之间的关系，从而提高其实际应用的可能性。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key advantages are highlighted compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O significantly enhances propylene selectivity over vanadia-based catalysts, as evidenced by the increase in propene selectivity when replacing O2 with N2O. This improvement is attributed to the ability of N2O to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst, thereby suppressing nonselective reactions and promoting more efficient propene formation.

The catalysts employed in this process include alumina- and silica-supported vanadia materials, with the silica-supported catalysts demonstrating particularly promising results. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are common in ODHP, often stemming from the complex interactions between the catalyst and the oxidant. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more robust catalyst compositions, optimizing the catalyst preparation methods, and exploring novel reaction conditions that mitigate unwanted side reactions.

Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include further elucidating the detailed mechanisms of oxygen species adsorption and reactivity on the catalyst surfaces. This involves detailed characterization of the active oxygen species generated from both O2 and N2O, and understanding how these species influence the selectivity towards propene and carbon oxides. Additionally, efforts could focus on enhancing catalyst stability and durability under industrially relevant conditions, such as by incorporating protective layers or modifying the catalyst structure to resist deactivation. 

By combining insights from in-situ UV/vis analysis, transient isotopic studies, and catalytic tests, researchers can refine catalyst designs and operational parameters to optimize propene selectivity while maintaining reasonable activity levels. This approach not only improves the efficiency of the ODHP process but also paves the way for the broader adoption of N2O as an environmentally friendly oxidant in industrial applications.

用于此过程的催化剂包括铝酸盐和硅酸盐支持的钒基催化剂，特别是硅酸盐支持的催化剂显示出特别有前景的结果。与ODHP相关的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战是常见的，通常源自催化剂与氧化剂之间的复杂相互作用。为解决这些局限性，可能的策略包括开发更坚固的催化剂组成，优化催化剂制备方法，并探索能减少不希望的副反应的新反应条件。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用中更可行的选择，研究方向可以包括进一步阐明氧物种在催化剂表面上吸附和反应的详细机制。这涉及对从O2和N2O生成的活性氧物种的详细表征，以及理解这些物种如何影响向丙烯和碳氧化物的选择性。此外，努力可以集中在增强催化剂在工业相关条件下稳定性和耐久性的方法上，例如通过引入保护层或修改催化剂结构来抵抗失活。

结合原位紫外/可见光分析、瞬态同位素研究和催化测试的见解，研究人员可以精炼催化剂设计和操作参数，以优化丙烯选择性的同时保持合理的活性水平。这种方法不仅提高了ODHP过程的效率，而且为N2O作为一种环保型氧化剂在工业应用中的广泛应用铺平了道路。
