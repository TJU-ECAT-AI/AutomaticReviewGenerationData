<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 was performed over a series of mixed GaxAl10xO15 oxides (with x varying from 0 to 10) synthesized through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway.</p>
<p>Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8. Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content.</p>
<p>A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity.</p>
<p>The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which makes GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction.</p>

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process presents several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The study focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over a series of mixed GaxAl10xO15 oxides, with the highest activity observed for x = 8. The enhanced stability of the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst stands out as a significant finding. Galliaalumina solid solutions have proven to be highly active and stable for the reaction, indicating their potential for practical implementation. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are mainly related to coke formation on the surface. Strategies to address these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which contribute to coke formation. This approach could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial application.

分析使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，该过程在与其他氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。本研究关注了一系列GaxAl10xO15氧化物的催化脱氢反应，其中活性最高的是x=8。Ga5Al5O15催化剂表现出显著的稳定性增强，是研究中的一项重要发现。显示，含镓铝固溶体表现出高活性和稳定性，这表明它们有可能在工业应用中实现商业化。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题主要与催化剂表面焦炭的形成有关。解决这些限制的方法可能包括调整催化剂组成以减少表面中等强度酸位点的密度，这些酸位点有助于焦炭的形成。这种策略可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选择。
