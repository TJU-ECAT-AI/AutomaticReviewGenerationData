[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[2] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[3] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
[4] "Compared the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

1. The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. 
2. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels in the ODHP process.  
3. The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is attributed to the abundance of specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, which arise from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems.  
4. The NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity indicate that weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and stability in the ODHP process.

1. 在GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物催化剂系列中，x=8的组成下观察到了最大初始活性和丙烯产量。
2. Ga5Al5O15在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出显著的高转化率稳定性。
3. GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的增强催化活性归因于形成Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体后在混合氧化物系统中产生的丰富的特定表面酸位，这些酸位与四面体表面Ga3+离子有关。  
4. NH3-TPD结果和丙烷脱氢反应表明，表面弱酸性，特别是表面弱Lewis酸位密度，对于实现高活性和稳定性在ODHP过程中至关重要。
