[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
[5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights several advantages and challenges. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，文献中提到了一些优势和挑战。与传统氧化剂相比，N2O-ODHP具有高丙烯选择性，因此是一个有吸引力的选择。该过程利用一系列GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物作为催化剂，在x=8时观察到最大初始活性。值得注意的是，Ga5Al5O15显示出在高转化率水平下显著增强的稳定性。增强的活性源于Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体中表面四面体Ga3+位点相关的丰富弱表面酸性。弱表面酸性而不是中强酸性对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。为了解决催化剂失活和不稳定性的问题，可以采取优化Ga-Al比例、探索不同支持材料以及提高催化剂再生方法等策略。
