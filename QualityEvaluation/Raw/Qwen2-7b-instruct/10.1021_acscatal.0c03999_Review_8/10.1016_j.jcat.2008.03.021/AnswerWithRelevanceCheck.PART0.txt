          [1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
          [2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge from the provided literature. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

          分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，文献中揭示了一些关键点。与传统氧化剂相比，N2O-ODHP具有高丙烯选择性，因此是一个有吸引力的选择。该过程利用了一系列GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物作为催化剂，在x=8时观察到最大初始活性。值得注意的是，Ga5Al5O15在高转化率水平下显示出显著的稳定性增强。增强的活性源于Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体中表面四面体Ga3+位点相关的丰富弱表面酸性。弱表面酸性而不是中强酸性对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。为了解决催化剂失活和不稳定的问题，可以采取优化Ga-Al比例、探索不同支持材料以及提高催化剂再生方法等策略。

          The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

          在GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物催化剂系列中，x=8的组成下观察到了最大初始活性和丙烯产量。Ga5Al5O15在高转化率水平下表现出显著的稳定性增强，表明其在实际应用中的潜力。高活性归因于大量与四面体Ga3+离子相关的表面酸位。Ga2O3与Al2O3之间形成spinel型γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3固溶体有助于表面镓位的分散和分布，从而促进增强的活性和稳定性。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题主要与催化剂表面焦炭的形成有关。解决这些限制可能涉及调整催化剂组成以减少表面中等强度酸位点的密度，这些酸位点更容易形成焦炭。
