[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[2] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[3] "In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low pass yields are obtained."
[4] "Moreover it was noted by Petro-Tcx that of the three halogen pronioters used. iodine was the most effective producing highest once-through yields ( - 807,) when present in smallest molar ratios, i.e. 0.001-0.002 moles I2 per mole hydrocarbon feed."
[5] "Under these conditions iodine proves to be the best promoter of all the halogens."
[6] "Although the thermodynamic equilibria shown above are for the use of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogen promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichionmetric proportions of halogens."
[7] "Thermodynamically HI can be oxidized to iodine more easily than HRr to Br2 to Clz. In fact it can be seen that the oxidation of HCI becomes equilibrium limited at temperatures in excess of i0Oo"F indicating that larger quantities of HCI must be present in the reaction mixture (to produce a sufficiently high concentration of Clz for dehydrogenation) than either HBr or HI."
[8] "On the other hand chlorine is a poorer promoter due to the unfavourable thermodynamics for the HCI oxidation reaction."
[9] "An attempt has been made in Table 3 to explain the above (soincrimes called "synergistic") effect by indicating the two additional reactions which probably occur when a mixed halogen system (Clz + I2 for example) is used in the oxydehydrogena- tion reaction."
[10] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions,principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
[11] "However, when the above materials are suitably impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, good catalysts are achieved ( 4 * 6 ) ,"
[12] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the HZS oxidation reaction to supply,insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halo- gens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[13] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
