[1] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low pass yields are obtained."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[4] "High yields were achieved (b)."
[5] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
[6] "Although the thermodynamic equilibria shown above are for the use of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogen promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichionic proportions of halogens."
[7] "This is because the halogen promoters are used in much less than stoichiometric quantities (0.0014.2 mole) and must therefore take part in the desired reaction over and over again to produce high yields of olefins."
[8] "However, when both chlorine and iodine were present together in the feed in the same molar ratios as previously, a 64% butadiene yield, at 81% butene conversion and 79% butadiene selectivity, was achieved."
[9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as a potential alternative to conventional oxidants. However, the document does not provide specific details about N2O usage in ODHP. The document discusses the use of halogens, such as iodine, chlorine, and bromine, as promoters for oxidative dehydrogenation processes. It highlights that these halogen promoters, when used in sub-stoichiometric quantities, can achieve high yields of olefins due to their ability to regenerate quickly in the presence of oxygen. The document also mentions the use of sulfur in combination with halogens as a possible substitute for iodine, due to its lower cost and comparable efficiency. 

Strategies to improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP might include optimizing the conditions under which the reaction takes place, developing more efficient catalysts that can handle N2O effectively, and finding ways to prevent catalyst deactivation and maintain stability over time. Research directions could focus on understanding the specific reaction mechanisms involved when N2O is used as an oxidant, as well as identifying any potential by-products or side reactions that might affect the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

Potential challenges associated with using N2O as an oxidant in ODHP could include issues related to its reactivity, stability, and handling under high temperature and pressure conditions typically required for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Addressing these challenges might involve modifying the reactor design, improving the catalytic properties of the materials used, and developing new methods for controlling the reaction kinetics and product selectivity.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化剂（N2O）的使用已经作为传统氧化剂的潜在替代品进行了探索。然而，文档并未提供关于N2O在ODHP中使用的具体细节。文档讨论了碘、氯和溴等卤素作为氧化脱氢化过程促进剂的使用。它强调了当这些卤素促进剂以亚化学计量的比例使用时，可以实现高产率的烯烃，由于它们能够在氧气的存在下快速再生。文档还提到了在卤素中使用硫作为可能的碘替代品，由于其较低的成本和相似的效率。

提高N2O-ODHP可行性的方法可能包括优化反应进行的条件，开发更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂能够有效地处理N2O，并且找到防止催化剂失活并保持稳定性的方法。研究方向可以集中在理解N2O作为氧化剂时的具体反应机制，以及识别任何可能影响产物选择性和效率的潜在副产品或副反应。

与使用N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的挑战相关的潜在问题可能包括其反应性、稳定性以及在通常需要高温高压条件下的处理。解决这些挑战可能涉及修改反应器设计，改善所用材料的催化特性，并开发新的方法来控制反应动力学和产物选择性。
