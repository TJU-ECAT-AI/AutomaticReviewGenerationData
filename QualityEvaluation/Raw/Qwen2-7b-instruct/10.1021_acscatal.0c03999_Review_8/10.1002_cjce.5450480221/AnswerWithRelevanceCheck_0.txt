Quotes:
1. "These considerations indicate that high product yields should also be possible with the new system if suitable catalysts are used."
2. "In recent years oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has"
3. "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
4. "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
5. "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

English Answer:
The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, primarily due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity. The process is not equilibrium-limited, as it produces a thermodynamically stable product (water) alongside olefinic products, which facilitates the reaction pathway. This contrasts with the use of pure oxygen, where low product yields are observed due to uncontrolled combustion reactions that produce undesirable byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

Catalysts play a crucial role in the ODHP process, helping to achieve high yields of olefins. The effectiveness of catalysts is critical in ensuring the reaction proceeds efficiently and selectively towards the desired product. Challenges in the process include catalyst deactivation and stability issues, which can reduce the efficiency and economic viability of the process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical application, several strategies can be explored:

1. **Developing Advanced Catalysts:** Focus on creating catalysts that can withstand the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the N2O-ODHP process without deactivating prematurely. Research into catalyst supports that are robust and resistant to degradation could significantly improve catalyst longevity and performance.

2. **Optimizing Reaction Conditions:** Adjusting the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, can help achieve better selectivity and yield. Fine-tuning these parameters can lead to enhanced product quality and efficiency.

3. **Incorporating Promoters:** The use of sulfur or halogens as promoters can help maintain catalyst activity and improve propylene yield. These additives can potentially extend the life of the catalyst and increase the overall efficiency of the process.

4. **Process Design Improvements:** Modifying the reactor design to optimize heat and mass transfer can enhance the performance of the N2O-ODHP process. Efficient reactor design can lead to better control of reaction kinetics and improved product selectivity.

5. **Byproduct Management:** Developing methods to recover and utilize byproducts, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, can reduce environmental impact and increase the economic viability of the process.

Chinese Answer:
在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化剂（N2O）具有多个优势，与其它氧化剂相比，主要得益于其提高丙烯选择性的能力。该过程不受平衡限制，因为它在生成烯烃的同时产生热力学稳定的产物（水），这促进了反应途径。这与仅使用纯氧的情况形成对比，在这种情况下，由于生成不可控燃烧反应导致碳一氧化碳和二氧化碳等副产品的形成而观察到低产率。

催化剂在ODHP过程中起着至关重要的作用，帮助实现高产率的烯烃。催化剂的有效性对于确保反应高效且选择性地向目标产物进行至关重要。过程中的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题，这会降低过程的效率和经济可行性。

为解决这些问题并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项，可以探索以下策略：

1. **开发高级催化剂**：集中研究能够承受N2O-ODHP过程典型高温和苛刻条件，而不会过早失活的催化剂。对催化剂支撑材料的研究，使其更加坚固且不易降解，可以显著提高催化剂的寿命和性能。

2. **优化反应条件**：调整反应条件，包括温度、压力和反应物的比例，可以帮助实现更好的选择性和产率。对这些参数进行精细调整可导致产品质量和效率的增强。

3. **引入促进剂**：硫或卤素作为促进剂的使用可以帮助保持催化剂的活性并提高丙烯产量。这些添加剂可能有助于延长催化剂的使用寿命并增加过程的整体效率。

4. **过程设计改进**：修改反应器设计以优化热量和质量传递，可以提高N2O-ODHP过程的性能。高效的反应器设计可以更好地控制反应动力学并提高产品选择性。

5. **管理副产品**：开发回收和利用副产品（如一氧化碳和氮氧化物）的方法可以减少环境影响并增加过程的经济可行性。
