[1] "These considerations indicate that high product yields should also be possible with the new system if suitable catalysts are used."
[2] "In recent years oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has"
[3] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[5] "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[6] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
[7] "This could allow the replacement of much of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur."
[8] "Halogen atoms obtained by the dissociation of molecular halogen X2 (reaction 7) abstract a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon feed to produce a hydrocarbon radical and hydrogen halide, HX (reaction 8)."
[9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
[10] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
[11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
[12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

Analysis of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests several advantages and challenges. The document highlights that the use of sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, can potentially replace iodine and bromine as promoters in the ODHP process, offering a more cost-effective solution. The key advantage of N2O compared to other oxidants is its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, which is crucial for the production of olefinic monomers. 

Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, including CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips, to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. However, a significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of these catalysts, leading to reduced efficiency and product yields. Catalysts must be designed to maintain high activity and stability under the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the ODHP process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more practical option, several strategies could be explored. First, developing advanced catalysts that can withstand the high temperatures required for N2O reactions without deactivating prematurely would be crucial. Researchers could focus on creating catalyst supports that are more robust and resistant to degradation. Second, optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, could help achieve better selectivity and yield. Lastly, investigating the potential for synergistic effects when combining N2O with other reagents or modifying the reaction environment might lead to improved performance and efficiency.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，具有几个优势和挑战。文献表明，硫，尤其是与其他卤素如溴和氯的组合使用，可以潜在地替代碘和溴作为促进剂在ODHP过程中，提供更经济有效的解决方案。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O的关键优势在于提高丙烯选择性，这对于生产烯烃单体至关重要。

在ODHP过程中采用多种催化剂，包括CeO2和CaO在Vycor芯片上，以促进碳氢化合物转化为烯烃。然而，催化剂的失活和稳定性问题是一个重大挑战，导致效率和产品产量降低。催化剂必须设计成能够在高温度和苛刻条件下保持高度活性和稳定性的能力。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选项，可以探索几种策略。首先，开发能够承受N2O反应所需高温而不提前失活的高级催化剂至关重要。研究者可以专注于创建更坚固且不易降解的催化剂支持材料。其次，优化反应条件，例如温度、压力和反应物的比例，可以帮助实现更好的选择性和产率。最后，探讨结合N2O与其他试剂或改变反应环境的潜在协同效应，可能有助于提高性能和效率。
