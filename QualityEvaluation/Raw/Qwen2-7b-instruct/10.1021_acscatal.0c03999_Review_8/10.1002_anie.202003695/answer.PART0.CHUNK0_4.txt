[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[3] "In contrast, the well-studied vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages, particularly concerning propylene selectivity. N2O-ODHP offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, which is attributed to its ability to generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane. This process leads to faster radical propagation in the gas phase, which is a key factor in establishing the distribution of available propyl species.

Various catalysts are employed in this process, including boron-based materials. The use of boron catalysts is particularly advantageous because they facilitate the generation of reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate propane in the gas phase. This mechanism differs significantly from that of well-studied vanadium-based catalysts, which primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface. The vanadium-based catalysts tend to exhibit rapid loss in selectivity as the propane conversion increases due to stronger interactions of reaction intermediates with the catalyst surface and possibly with the propylene product.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are addressed by proposing strategies that focus on optimizing the void space in the catalyst bed and developing catalysts capable of generating HOO. radicals instead of alkyl radicals. This approach could enhance the efficiency of the N2O-ODHP process and potentially make it more feasible for practical implementation.

Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option might include:
1. Enhancing the stability of catalysts against deactivation by modifying the catalyst's surface chemistry or composition to prevent rapid interactions with reaction intermediates and products.
2. Developing advanced reactor designs that optimize the distribution of N2O and propane, ensuring efficient gas-phase reactions and minimizing the risk of surface oxidation.
3. Investigating the use of alternative oxidants or dual oxidant systems that might offer better selectivity or stability compared to N2O alone.
4. Conducting detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies to better understand the reaction pathways involved in N2O-ODHP, which could guide the design of more effective catalysts and reaction conditions.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，文献强调了几个优势，特别是对于丙烯选择性的提高。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O-ODHP提供了更高的丙烯选择性，这归因于其能够生成有利于丙烷中次级CH键脱氢的活性物种，从而在气相中快速引发自由基链反应。这一过程是通过催化剂生成活性物种（HOO.自由基），这些自由基在气相中激活丙烷，进而促进丙烷脱氢反应，从而建立气相中可用丙基物种的分布。

在该过程中使用的催化剂包括硼基材料。硼基催化剂特别有利，因为它们能够促进在气相中激活丙烷的活性物种（HOO.自由基）的生成。这种机制与广泛研究的钒基催化剂大不相同，后者主要在表面激活丙烷中的CH键。钒基催化剂倾向于随着丙烷转化率的增加而迅速失去选择性，这是由于反应中间体与催化剂表面和可能与丙烯产物的强烈相互作用造成的。

与催化剂失活和稳定相关的挑战可以通过提出以下策略来解决，以使N2O-ODHP过程更具有实际实施的可能性：
1. 通过修改催化剂的表面化学或组成，防止快速与反应中间体和产物相互作用，增强催化剂的稳定性。
2. 开发先进的反应器设计，优化N2O和丙烷的分布，确保高效的气相反应，并最小化表面氧化的风险。
3. 探索替代氧化剂或双氧化剂系统，这些系统相对于单独使用N2O可能提供更好的选择性或稳定性。
4. 进行详细的动力学和机理研究，以更好地理解N2O-ODHP过程中的反应路径，这可以指导设计更有效的催化剂和反应条件。
