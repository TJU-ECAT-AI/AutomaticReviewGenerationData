[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "Optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is advantageous due to its ability to provide high propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, including boron-containing materials, have been employed in this process. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more stable catalysts, optimizing operating conditions, or exploring alternative oxidants. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms, improving catalyst design, and enhancing the stability and selectivity of N2O-ODHP processes.
