[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase."
[3] "We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis."
[4] "For example, initial mechanisms that rationalized the reactivity of boron nitride during ODH had to be updated to account for the reactivity of other boron-containing materials, such as B4C, NiB2, and amorphous boron."
[5] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[6] "Our computational studies also highlight the complexity of this oxidation, leading to a variety of boron species with different reactivities."
[7] "We emphasize that heating BN in the presence of oxygen only does not result in surface oxidation, implying that the oxyfunctionalization goes hand-in-hand with the gas-phase radical chemistry."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O is less reactive than other oxidants, allowing for a more controlled reaction process. This results in higher propylene selectivity, as the formation of unwanted by-products is minimized. Various catalysts, including boron nitride (hBN), have been employed in ODHP processes. These catalysts facilitate the surface-initiated radical reactions that propagate via gas-phase chemistry, leading to efficient propylene production.

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are critical issues in ODHP. Catalysts can lose activity over time due to poisoning, sintering, or the formation of inactive species. To address these limitations, researchers might focus on developing more stable catalyst formulations that can withstand harsh operating conditions. Strategies could include modifying the catalyst composition to enhance resistance against poisoning agents, improving the catalyst's mechanical strength to prevent sintering, or incorporating stabilizers that protect the catalyst's active sites.

Moreover, understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O-ODHP, particularly the roles of surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation, could lead to more efficient catalyst designs. Computational studies and kinetic analyses can provide insights into the formation and behavior of reactive species, guiding the development of catalysts that optimize propylene selectivity. Research directions might explore the use of novel catalyst supports, the incorporation of co-catalysts to improve activity and selectivity, or the design of catalyst architectures that enhance mass and heat transfer.

In summary, optimizing the use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP requires addressing catalyst deactivation and stability challenges through advanced materials design, enhanced catalyst understanding, and innovative process engineering approaches.

在氧化脱氢作用于丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，具有在与其他氧化剂相比时提高丙烯选择性的优点。N2O的反应性较低，允许更可控的反应过程，从而实现更高的丙烯选择性，减少副产品的生成。已使用各种催化剂，如六方硼氮化物（hBN），在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂促进表面引发的自由基反应，这些反应通过气相化学传播，有效生产丙烯。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题是ODHP的关键挑战。催化剂可能会因中毒、烧结或形成无活性物种而逐渐失去活性。为解决这些问题，研究人员可能需要关注开发更能抵抗苛刻操作条件的稳定催化剂配方。策略可能包括修改催化剂组成以增强对中毒剂的抵抗力，提高催化剂的机械强度以防止烧结，或引入保护催化剂活性位点的稳定剂。

此外，深入了解N2O-ODHP的详细机制，特别是表面引发反应和气相自由基传播的作用，可以引导更高效的催化剂设计。计算研究和动力学分析可以提供有关活性物种形成和行为的见解，指导优化丙烯选择性的催化剂设计。研究方向可能探索新型催化剂支撑材料的应用，共催化剂的集成以改善活性和选择性，或设计能够增强质量与热传递的催化剂结构。

总之，通过高级材料设计、增强催化剂理解以及创新工艺工程方法，优化N2O作为ODHP氧化剂的使用需要解决催化剂失活和稳定性问题。
