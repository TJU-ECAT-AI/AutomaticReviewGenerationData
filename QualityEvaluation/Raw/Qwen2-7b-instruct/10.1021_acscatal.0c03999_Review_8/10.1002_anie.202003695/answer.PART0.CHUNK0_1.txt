[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "Indeed, those systems operate via a Mars van Krevelen mechanism where oxidized vanadium species presumably homolytically activate a CH bond of propane."
[4] "Although never observed experimentally, the nascent radicals are assumed to remain adsorbed to the surface and react consecutively with propylene via a second H abstraction (so-called rebound mechanism)."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
