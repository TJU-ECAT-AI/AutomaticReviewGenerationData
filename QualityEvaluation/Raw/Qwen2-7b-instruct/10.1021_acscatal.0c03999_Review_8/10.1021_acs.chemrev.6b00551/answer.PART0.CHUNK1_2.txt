Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Supported noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru) have been widely employed as catalysts in this process. However, significant challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability have been reported. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP faces limitations such as high costs and corrosiveness. Strategies to address these limitations include developing more stable catalysts and improving reaction conditions.

分析将硝酸氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程，我们发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。广泛使用的催化剂包括如铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）和钌（Ru）等贵金属的支持形式。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题已报告出现。使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP面临高成本和腐蚀性的限制。解决这些限制的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂和改进反应条件。
