The use of bromine in upgrading processes offers simplicity in operation. Among the various halogen-mediated processes, only the bromine-aided upgrading process has been demonstrated at a pilot scale. Implementing halogen-mediated processes, particularly bromine, depends on several factors including the efficient use of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, and managing corrosion issues. The resurgence of interest in these processes is attributed to advancements in these areas.
