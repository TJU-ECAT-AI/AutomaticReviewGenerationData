[1] "The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as a potential alternative to conventional oxidants like air or oxygen. N2O offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity."
[2] "Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including noble metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, as well as transition metal oxides like ceria (CeO2) and lanthanum oxide (LaOCl)."
[3] "One of the critical challenges associated with the N2O-ODHP process is catalyst deactivation and instability. High reaction temperatures, corrosive reaction conditions, and the formation of byproducts can lead to catalyst degradation over time."
[4] "Strategies to address these limitations include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the implementation of advanced catalyst regeneration techniques. Research directions could involve the exploration of novel catalyst materials with improved stability and selectivity, as well as the integration of catalyst protection layers to prevent direct contact with corrosive species."
