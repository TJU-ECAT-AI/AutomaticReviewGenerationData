[1] "The halogen-mediated routes are not new, and since the discovery of halogens in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they are constantly employed in industrial manufacturing."
[2] "Berthelot isolated methyl chloride from the above process in 1858, which can be readily hydrolyzed to methanol and thus providing an opportunity to utilize methane as a feedstock for chemicals and fuels."
[3] "However, the contemporary development of high-pressure methanol synthesis from syngas diverted the focus of methane activation from gas-phase chlorination."
[4] "This is substantiated by performing the process in two steps: (i) chlorination of hydrocarbons by copper chloride, employed as the chlorinating agent, and (ii) regeneration of the reduced copper chloride by reacting with HCl and O2 or air."
[5] "It should be emphasized that the implementation of a halogen-mediated process relies on a number of factors, such as the availability and efficiency of utilization of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, management of corrosion issues, etc."
[6] "The renaissance in this well-known area could be ascribed to the recent developments in the above-mentioned field."
[7] "The focus will be placed on understanding the structure-function relationships and the stability aspects of the catalysts."
[8] "The catalyst developments in this field will be assessed form the aspects of choice of support, reaction mechanism, side reactions, and the role of promoters."
[9] "The origin of VCM formation on ceria was understood by different experiments. It was revealed that VCM comes consecutively from in situ EDC dehydrochlorination, which was hinted by experiments involving the variation of residence time, which evidenced an increase of VCM selectivity at the expense of EDC formation."
[10] "The formation of VCM was noteworthy over this system."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) involves several key aspects. N2O offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is primarily due to its ability to selectively oxidize propane without excessively consuming hydrogen, which is crucial for maintaining high propylene yields. Various catalysts are employed in this process, including metal-based catalysts such as noble metals like platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh), as well as non-metallic catalysts like zeolites. These catalysts are chosen based on their ability to facilitate the oxidation of propane while minimizing the formation of byproducts.

Challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Catalysts can deactivate over time due to poisoning, sintering, or leaching, leading to reduced activity and selectivity. Strategies to address these limitations include developing more stable catalyst materials, optimizing catalyst preparation and support, and employing advanced catalyst regeneration techniques. Research directions could involve exploring new catalyst compositions, modifying existing catalysts to improve their stability, and developing innovative reactor designs to enhance heat and mass transfer efficiency.

Proposed solutions to make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation might include the development of more robust catalyst formulations, the integration of advanced catalyst regeneration systems, and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize byproduct formation. Additionally, improving the selectivity and efficiency of the process through the use of synergistic catalyst combinations or the incorporation of co-catalysts could further enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP as a viable industrial process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）涉及到几个关键方面。N2O在与其他氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，主要是因为它能够选择性地氧化丙烷，而不会过度消耗氢气，这对于保持高丙烯产率至关重要。在这一过程中使用的催化剂包括铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）、铑（Rh）等贵金属以及沸石等非金属催化剂。这些催化剂根据其促进丙烷氧化的能力以及同时减少副产物形成的特性进行选择。

N2O-ODHP面临的挑战包括催化剂活性和稳定性问题。催化剂随着时间的推移可能会失效，导致活性和选择性降低，这可能是由于中毒、烧结或流失等原因造成的。解决这些问题的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂材料、优化催化剂制备和支持方式以及采用先进的催化剂再生技术。研究方向可能涉及探索新的催化剂组成、修改现有催化剂以提高其稳定性，以及开发创新的反应器设计以增强热量和质量传递效率。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为可行的工业过程，可能需要开发更耐用的催化剂配方、集成先进的催化剂再生系统以及优化反应条件以减少副产物形成。此外，通过使用协同催化剂组合或引入共催化剂来进一步提高选择性和效率，可以进一步增强N2O-ODHP的可行性。
