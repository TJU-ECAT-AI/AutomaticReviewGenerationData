Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this approach has garnered attention due to its potential to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The advantages of N2O include its capability to maintain a more stable reaction environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of byproduct formation. Transition metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and nickel (Ni) are commonly utilized as catalysts in N2O-ODHP, effectively facilitating the reaction. However, significant challenges remain in terms of catalyst deactivation and instability, which hinder its practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations involve optimizing catalyst design, enhancing support materials, and developing advanced regeneration techniques to improve catalyst longevity and efficiency.

分析使用硝酸氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，这种方法因其提高丙烯选择性的潜力而受到关注。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O的优势在于其能够维持更稳定的反应环境，降低副产品的形成风险。铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）和镍（Ni）等过渡金属通常被用作N2O-ODHP的催化剂，有效促进反应。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性不足是阻碍将其作为可行选项的主要限制。为解决这些限制，策略包括优化催化剂设计、增强支持材料以及开发先进的再生技术，以提高催化剂的寿命和效率。
