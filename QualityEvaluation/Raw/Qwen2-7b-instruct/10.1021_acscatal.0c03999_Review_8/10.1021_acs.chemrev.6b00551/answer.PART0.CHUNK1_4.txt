Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its primary advantage lies in the higher propylene selectivity it offers compared to other oxidants. This process benefits from the substantial amount of water in the feed that can vaporize and remove the reaction heat associated with the exothermic nature of the oxybromination reaction. Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including precious metals, metal oxides/oxychlorides, and metal phosphate catalysts. Challenges faced include catalyst deactivation and stability issues, particularly due to the high corrosiveness of halogens in the presence of moisture. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more robust catalyst formulations that can withstand the corrosive environment and improving the process design to enhance heat management and minimize catalyst exposure to moisture. Research directions might focus on understanding the surface chemistry of catalysts in the presence of water and halogenated compounds to optimize their performance in ODHP.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的主要优势在于其在与其他氧化剂相比时更高的丙烯选择性。该过程得益于大量水分的存在，可以蒸发并移除与氧溴化反应相关的反应热。已采用各种催化剂进行此过程，包括贵金属、金属氧化物/氧氯化物和金属磷酸盐催化剂。面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题，特别是由于卤素在水分存在下的高腐蚀性。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更耐用的催化剂配方，以承受腐蚀环境，并改进过程设计以增强热量管理并减少催化剂对水分的暴露。研究方向可能集中在理解催化剂表面化学在水分和卤化物化合物存在的条件下的性能，以优化其在ODHP中的表现。
