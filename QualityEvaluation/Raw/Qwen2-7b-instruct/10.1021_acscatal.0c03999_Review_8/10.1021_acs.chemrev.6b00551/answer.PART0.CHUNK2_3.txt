[1] "The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates has been systematically studied based on a set of comparative experiments."
[2] "Investigation of the gas-phase methane bromination and catalyzed oxybromination at similar reaction conditions revealed a similar onset temperature (675 K) and the trends in methane conversion and product distribution of brominated products."
[3] "Increasing productivity of the bromomethanes was observed to be accompanied by decreasing HBr conversion and bromine yield, with a rise of reaction temperature."
[4] "Thus, the outstanding performance of vanadium phosphate was rationalized by the high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation."
[5] "Small alterations in product distribution at similar methane conversions and a strong enhancement of the CH3Br productivity were observed, demonstrating the scalability of the catalyst performance."
