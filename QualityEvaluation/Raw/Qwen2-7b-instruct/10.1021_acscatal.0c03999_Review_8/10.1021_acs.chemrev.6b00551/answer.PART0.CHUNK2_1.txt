1. The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates in propane oxychlorination has been thoroughly investigated through comparative experiments. 
2. The gas-phase methane bromination and catalyzed oxybromination reactions at similar conditions exhibit a similar onset temperature of 675 K, with consistent trends in methane conversion and product distribution.
3. Boosting the production of bromomethanes is correlated with reduced HBr conversion and bromine yield, as the reaction temperature increases.
4. The vanadium phosphate catalyst is optimized for high CH3Br yield by adjusting reaction parameters.
5. The vanadium phosphate catalyst demonstrates exceptional robustness in a 100-hour test at 753 K, maintaining stable performance with 25% methane conversion and 64% CH3Br selectivity.
