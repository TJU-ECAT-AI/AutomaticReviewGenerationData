Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process presents several advantages. Specifically, the propylene selectivity achieved with N2O-ODHP surpasses that of other oxidants. Various catalysts have been utilized in this context, notably noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and gold (Au). Challenges encountered include catalyst deactivation and instability, primarily due to coke formation and sintering. Strategies to tackle these limitations could involve the development of new catalyst materials with enhanced stability. Research directions might concentrate on optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and extend catalyst longevity.
