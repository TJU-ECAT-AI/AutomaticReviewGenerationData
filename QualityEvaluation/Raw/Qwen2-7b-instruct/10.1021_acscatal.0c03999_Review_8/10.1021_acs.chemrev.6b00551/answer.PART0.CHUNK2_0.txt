[1] "The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates has been systematically studied based on a set of comparative experiments."
[2] "The reaction mechanism of propylene oxychlorination over PdCl2 catalysts was proposed by Fujimoto et al., (317, 326) in which π-allylic intermediate was formed by the interaction between Pd0 and propylene (eq 15)."

[4] "It is noteworthy that the conversions of both CH2Br2 and C3H8 are highly dependent on the addition of iodine."
[5] "This is based on the following considerations: (i) hydrocarbon activation with halogens generally yields alkyl halides instead of ultimate bulk chemicals, thus, a sequential upgrading step is required; (ii) the recovery of halogens is imperative in order to keep the process competitive and sustainable; and (iii) offering a package of technologies enables a reliable assessment of a chemical process."

1. The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates in methane oxybromination has been studied systematically. The mechanism involves the formation of π-allylic intermediate by the interaction between Pd0 and propylene, as proposed by Fujimoto et al. The promotion effect of Zr on the reaction was observed when used with sintered alumina-silica support but not when replaced with SiC, suggesting interactions between Zr and the sintered alumina-silica support. The conversions of CH2Br2 and C3H8 are highly dependent on the addition of iodine in the reaction.

2. In the context of halogen-mediated alkane upgrading, a sequential upgrading step is required due to the conversion of hydrocarbons to alkyl halides. Recovery of halogens is essential for sustainability and competitiveness. Offering a package of technologies allows for a comprehensive assessment of the chemical process.

1. 硒磷酸盐在甲烷氧溴化中的反应机制已经系统地研究。机制涉及通过Fujimoto等人提出的Pd0与丙烯之间的相互作用形成π-异丙基中间体。当使用烧结氧化铝-硅时，Zr的存在促进了反应，但当替换为SiC时未观察到这种效果，这表明Zr与烧结氧化铝-硅支持物之间存在相互作用。CH2Br2和C3H8的转化高度依赖于碘的添加。

2. 在卤素介导的烷烃升级中，需要一个连续升级步骤，因为烷烃被转化为烷基卤化物。卤素的回收对于可持续性和竞争力至关重要。提供一系列技术可以进行全面的过程评估。
