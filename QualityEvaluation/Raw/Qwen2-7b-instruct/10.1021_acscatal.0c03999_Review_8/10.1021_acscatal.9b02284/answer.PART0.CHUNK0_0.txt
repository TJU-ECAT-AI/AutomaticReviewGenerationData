The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants. It provides superior propylene selectivity due to its unique chemical properties. Different types of catalysts, such as supported boron oxide, are utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, particularly related to catalyst deactivation and stability. To overcome these issues, researchers are exploring the development of novel catalyst materials and refining reaction conditions.
