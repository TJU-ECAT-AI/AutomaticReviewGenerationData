Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this study highlights several key aspects. Firstly, the propylene selectivity obtained through the use of N2O was notably higher compared to other oxidants, indicating a potential advantage in terms of product purity and efficiency. A variety of catalysts, including metal-based catalysts and supported boron oxide catalysts, were employed in the process. However, a significant challenge encountered is the catalyst deactivation and instability under the reaction conditions, which hinders the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP technology.
