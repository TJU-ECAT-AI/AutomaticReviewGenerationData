[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."
[2] "The system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."
[3] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."
[4] "In an effort to overcome these problems, experiments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane."
[5] "In the case of ethane dehydrogenation, more severe conditions - 1300F (705C) - are required due to the absence of such activated hydrogen atoms."
[6] "This paper describes the experimental program to develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene, the optimization of these systems and their application to other feedstocks such as ethane, propane, butene and ethylbenzene."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
