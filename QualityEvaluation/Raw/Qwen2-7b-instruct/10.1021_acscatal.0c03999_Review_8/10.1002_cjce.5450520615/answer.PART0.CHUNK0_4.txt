[1] "In the cases of butene or ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation is achieved at relatively mild conditions of temperature,i.e. 1000-1200F (640-650C). This is made possible by the allylic nature of the hydrogen atom to be removed caused by the existing double bond in butene or the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene."
[2] "In the case of ethane dehydrogenation, more severe conditions - 1300F (705C) - are required due to the absence of such activated hydrogen atoms."
[3] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."
[4] "A molten salt system, LiC1/KC1/MnC12, has been defined which gives high yields of C ,olefins from butane by hydrogen sulphide promoted oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "This system was found to be universally effective for other HPS promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
