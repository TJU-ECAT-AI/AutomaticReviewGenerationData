[1] "The system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."
[2] "In the cases of butene or ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation is achieved at relatively mild conditions of temperature,i.e. 1000-1200F (640-650C)."
[3] "This is made possible by the allylic nature of the hydrogen atom to be removed caused by the existing double bond in butene or the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene."
[4] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."

[6] "This paper describes the experimental program to develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene, the optimization of these systems and their application to other feedstocks such as ethane, propane, butene and ethylbenzene."
[7] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages and challenges. The process is efficient for the conversion of various hydrocarbons, including ethane, propane, butene, and ethylbenzene, to their respective olefinic counterparts. For butene and ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation can be achieved at moderate temperatures (1000-1200°F or 640-650°C), facilitated by the allylic nature of the hydrogen atom to be removed, which is bound to a double bond in butene or within the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene. However, the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases significantly more heat than other reactions, exacerbating the risk of feed degradation through burning and cracking.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored the use of molten salts as a medium for the sulfur-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane. Molten salts offer superior heat transfer properties, enabling rapid dissipation of reaction heat and preventing the formation of hot spots that can degrade the feed and products. Additionally, the judicious selection of salts might lead to the development of a molten catalyst system specifically for sulfur-promoted dehydrogenation reactions.

Despite these advancements, the use of N2O-ODHP still faces limitations. For instance, previous attempts by Phillips Petroleum Company on C4 and higher paraffins using an unpromoted system yielded very low yields of olefinic products. To enhance efficiency, the optimal sulfur concentration was determined to be 4 moles of H2S per mole of C4 at 1200°F (649°C), which corresponds to twice the stoichiometric amount. Further optimization led to the identification of LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 as the best melt for hydrogen sulfide-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane, achieving a 52.9% yield with a selectivity of 65.3% at 80.9% conversion.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, strategies could focus on improving catalyst stability and activity, developing more effective sulfur promoters, and refining the process conditions to reduce heat generation and enhance product selectivity. Research could also explore alternative oxidants or catalysts that mitigate the heat release issue, making the process more efficient and safer for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优点和挑战。该过程对于将各种烃类，包括乙烷、丙烷、丁烯和乙基苯，转化为相应的不饱和化合物是高效的。对于丁烯和乙基苯而言，在约1000-1200°F（640-650°C）的温和温度下，可以通过双键上连接的氢原子的盟主性实现脱氢，这可能与丁烯中的双键或乙基苯中的苯核相关联。然而，将丁烷转化为丁二烯释放的热量远高于其他反应，这加剧了对原料降解的风险，尤其是通过燃烧和裂解。

为了克服这些挑战，研究人员已经探索了使用熔盐作为硫促进氧化脱氢的介质。熔盐提供了优越的热传递性能，能够快速散发反应热量并防止形成可能导致原料和产品降解的热点。此外，合理选择盐类可能有助于开发特定于硫促进脱氢反应的熔融催化剂系统。

尽管如此，N2O-ODHP的使用仍然面临限制。例如，Phillips石油公司先前在C4和更高碳数的烃类上使用未促进系统的尝试仅获得了非常低的不饱和产物产率。为了提高效率，确定最佳硫浓度为每摩尔C4摩尔H2S的4摩尔，在1200°F（649°C）时，相当于理论上的两倍。进一步的优化导致LiCl/KCl + MnCl2被识别为氢硫化物促进的最优熔融介质，用于但烷的氧化脱氢，实现了52.9%的产率和65.3%的选择性，转化率为80.9%。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选项，可以采用策略来改善催化剂的稳定性和活性，开发更有效的硫促进剂，并优化工艺条件以减少热量产生并增强产品的选择性。研究还可以探索替代氧化剂或催化剂，以减轻热量释放问题，使过程更加高效和安全。
