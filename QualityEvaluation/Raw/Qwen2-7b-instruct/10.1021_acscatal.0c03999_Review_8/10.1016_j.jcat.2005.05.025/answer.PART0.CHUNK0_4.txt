[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[2] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."
[3] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key points emerge. Firstly, N2O enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its ability to inhibit direct propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx through the spatial separation of active surface lattice oxygen species. For the design of effective catalysts, it is crucial to ensure high dispersion of reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should readily be reduced by hydrocarbons instead of being re-oxidized by the oxidant, thus spatially isolating active lattice oxygen species and favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

在使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，几个关键点浮出水面。首先，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提高了丙烯的选择性。这归因于其通过隔离表面活性晶格氧物种的活性位点，抑制直接丙烷和连续丙烯氧化至COx的能力，从而避免了COx的生成。在催化剂设计中，确保可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）在惰性支撑上的高分散非常重要。这些金属氧化物应能容易地由碳氢化合物还原，而不是被氧化剂氧化，从而在MeOx聚合物中隔离活性晶格氧物种，有利于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。
