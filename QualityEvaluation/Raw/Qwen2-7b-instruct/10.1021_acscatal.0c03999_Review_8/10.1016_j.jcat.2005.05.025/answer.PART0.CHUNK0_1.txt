[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity. However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[2] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[3] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, the highly dispersed surface VOx species, which are active in the ODHP process, show similar intrinsic catalytic activity regardless of vanadium loading. However, when N2O is used as the oxidant, the measured activity of these species is lower than when oxygen (O2) is used. This difference is attributed to the reduced ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, rather than re-oxidation by O2. 

2. Across all the vanadium/MCM-41 catalyst materials tested, the use of N2O instead of O2 leads to a preference for selective propane oxidation to produce propene, rather than the total combustion of propane or propene.

3. The beneficial impact of N2O in the ODHP process can be linked to the spatial isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species. This isolation inhibits direct deep propane and subsequent propene oxidation to COx, thus enhancing propene selectivity.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出相对于其他氧化剂的优势。具体而言，高度分散的表面VOx物种，在不同钒含量下显示相似的内在催化活性。然而，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，这些物种的测量活性低于使用氧气（O2）。这种差异归因于N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，而不是由O2重新氧化。

2. 对所有范德华/MCM-41催化剂材料进行测试的结果表明，与使用氧气相比，使用N2O代替氧气在丙烷氧化过程中更倾向于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而非完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。

3. N2O对ODHP过程的有益影响可以归结为表面活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离。这种隔离抑制了直接深丙烷和随后的丙烯氧化到COx，从而提高丙烯的选择性。
