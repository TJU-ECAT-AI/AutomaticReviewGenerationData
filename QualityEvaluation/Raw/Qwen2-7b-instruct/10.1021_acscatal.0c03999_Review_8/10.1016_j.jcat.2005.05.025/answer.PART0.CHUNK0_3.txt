[1] "The catalytic performance of these materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of O2 and N2O depends on the distribution of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the nature of the oxidant."
[2] "The use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[3] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 improves propene selectivity."
[4] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It achieves this by influencing the distribution of vanadium oxide species (VOx) on the catalyst surface and altering the nature of the oxidation process.

2. N2O provides an improved propene selectivity in ODHP reactions over the traditional oxidant, molecular oxygen (O2). This is due to its unique ability to inhibit direct propane oxidation and the subsequent oxidation of propene to COx products, which enhances the selectivity towards propene formation.

3. Across various vanadium/MCM-41 catalyst materials, the substitution of O2 with N2O leads to enhanced propene selectivity in the ODHP process. This improvement is consistent across the range of catalysts tested, indicating the potential for wider applicability.

4. The effectiveness of N2O in ODHP is attributed to the spatial isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species on the catalyst. This isolation inhibits the direct deep propane oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, thus favoring selective propene formation over total combustion reactions.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂，相对于其他氧化剂而言，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。这通过影响催化剂表面的VOx物种分布和改变氧化过程来实现。

2. N2O在与氧气（O2）相比时，为丙烷氧化脱氢反应提供了提高丙烯选择性的效果。这是由于其独特的能力抑制直接丙烷氧化和随后的丙烯到COx产品的连续氧化，从而增强了丙烯形成的选择性。

3. 对于各种范德华/MCM-41催化剂材料，用N2O替换O2导致ODHP过程中的丙烯选择性提高。这种改善是一致的，适用于测试的催化剂范围，表明更广泛的适用性潜力。

4.N2O在ODHP中的有效性归因于催化剂表面上活性表面晶格氧物种的空间隔离。这种隔离抑制了直接的深丙烷氧化和随后的丙烯到COx的连续氧化，从而有利于选择性丙烯形成，而不是总燃烧反应。
