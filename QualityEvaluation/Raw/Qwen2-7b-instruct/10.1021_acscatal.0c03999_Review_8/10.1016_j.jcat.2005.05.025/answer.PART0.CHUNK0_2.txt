[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity. However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[2] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[3] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."
[4] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The use of N2O allows for selective propane oxidation to propene, which is favored over the total combustion of propane or propene. This selective process is due to the site isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. 

2. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP, including vanadia-supported on high-surface-area mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts display similar intrinsic catalytic activity for highly dispersed surface VOx species, but the activity is lower when N2O is used as an oxidant compared to O2. The difference lies in the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species.

3. Research directions to address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible involve focusing on catalyst design. It is crucial to ensure a high dispersion of reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbons rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates would favor selective oxidation over combustion reactions. 

4. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP processes include the need for activity and selectivity improvements, ensuring sufficient availability of N2O, and conducting economic feasibility studies for practical implementation. Addressing these challenges could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for commercial use.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸盐（N2O）作为氧化剂相对于其他氧化剂具有优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。与使用O2相比，使用N2O有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯，而不是完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。这种选择性的过程归因于表面活性晶格氧物种的位点隔离，从而抑制了直接深丙烷和连续丙烯氧化为COx。

2. 在ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，包括在高比表面积的MCM-41分子筛上负载的钒。这些催化剂显示，高度分散的表面VOx物种具有相似的内在催化活性，但在使用N2O作为氧化剂时，这些物种的活性较低。差异在于N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱。

3. 研究方向以解决限制并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选项涉及催化剂设计的关注。确保可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）在惰性支持上的高分散是关键。这些金属氧化物应容易由碳氢化合物还原，而非被氧化剂再氧化。这将空间隔离活性晶格氧物种在MeOx团簇中，促进选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。

4. N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战包括活动性和选择性的改进需求、确保足够的N2O可用性以及进行经济可行性研究以实现商业应用。解决这些挑战可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选项。
