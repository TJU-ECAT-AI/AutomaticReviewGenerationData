[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[2] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."
[3] "With respect to process design, it is well known that N2O is also a suitable oxidant for selective benzene oxidation to phenol. Whether such a process operation can be also applied to selective alkane oxidation remains to be seen."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages. Firstly, N2O enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Secondly, the improvement in selectivity is attributed to the spatial separation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Lastly, N2O's suitability extends to selective benzene oxidation to phenol, suggesting potential for alkane oxidation applications. However, practical implementation requires addressing catalyst deactivation, stability, and ensuring adequate N2O supply.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优势。首先，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提高了丙烯的选择性。其次，选择性提高的原因在于表面活性晶格氧物种的位点隔离，这抑制了直接深丙烷和连续丙烯氧化到COx。最后，N2O适用于选择性苯氧化到苯酚，暗示其可能用于烷烃氧化应用。然而，实际实施需要解决催化剂失活、稳定性问题，并确保充足的N2O供应。
