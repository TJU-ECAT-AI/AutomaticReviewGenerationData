[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[2] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."
[3] "With respect to process design, it is well known that N2O is also a suitable oxidant for selective benzene oxidation to phenol. Whether such a process operation can be also applied to selective alkane oxidation remains to be seen."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages. Firstly, N2O enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Secondly, the improvement in selectivity is attributed to the spatial separation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Lastly, N2O's suitability extends to selective benzene oxidation to phenol, suggesting potential for alkane oxidation applications. However, practical implementation requires addressing catalyst deactivation, stability, and ensuring adequate N2O supply.

[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity. However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[2] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[3] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, the highly dispersed surface VOx species, which are active in the ODHP process, show similar intrinsic catalytic activity regardless of vanadium loading. However, when N2O is used as the oxidant, the measured activity of these species is lower than when oxygen (O2) is used. This difference is attributed to the reduced ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, rather than re-oxidation by O2. 

2. Across all the vanadium/MCM-41 catalyst materials tested, the use of N2O instead of O2 leads to a preference for selective propane oxidation to produce propene, rather than the total combustion of propane or propene.

3. The beneficial impact of N2O in the ODHP process can be linked to the spatial isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species. This isolation inhibits direct deep propane and subsequent propene oxidation to COx, thus enhancing propene selectivity.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出相对于其他氧化剂的优势。具体而言，高度分散的表面VOx物种，在不同钒含量下显示相似的内在催化活性。然而，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，这些物种的测量活性低于使用氧气（O2）。这种差异归因于N2O重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力较低，而不是由O2重新氧化。

2. 对所有范德华/MCM-41催化剂材料进行测试的结果表明，与使用氧气相比，使用N2O代替氧气在丙烷氧化过程中更倾向于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而非完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。

3. N2O对ODHP过程的有益影响可以归结为表面活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离。这种隔离抑制了直接深丙烷和随后的丙烯氧化到COx，从而提高丙烯的选择性。

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The use of N2O allows for selective propane oxidation to propene, which is favored over the total combustion of propane or propene. This selective process is due to the site isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. 

2. Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP, including vanadia-supported on high-surface-area mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts display similar intrinsic catalytic activity for highly dispersed surface VOx species, but the activity is lower when N2O is used as an oxidant compared to O2. The difference lies in the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species.

3. Research directions to address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible involve focusing on catalyst design. It is crucial to ensure a high dispersion of reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbons rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates would favor selective oxidation over combustion reactions. 

4. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP processes include the need for activity and selectivity improvements, ensuring sufficient availability of N2O, and conducting economic feasibility studies for practical implementation. Addressing these challenges could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for commercial use.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸盐（N2O）作为氧化剂相对于其他氧化剂具有优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。与使用O2相比，使用N2O有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯，而不是完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。这种选择性的过程归因于表面活性晶格氧物种的位点隔离，从而抑制了直接深丙烷和连续丙烯氧化为COx。

2. 在ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，包括在高比表面积的MCM-41分子筛上负载的钒。这些催化剂显示，高度分散的表面VOx物种具有相似的内在催化活性，但在使用N2O作为氧化剂时，这些物种的活性较低。差异在于N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱。

3. 研究方向以解决限制并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选项涉及催化剂设计的关注。确保可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）在惰性支持上的高分散是关键。这些金属氧化物应容易由碳氢化合物还原，而非被氧化剂再氧化。这将空间隔离活性晶格氧物种在MeOx团簇中，促进选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。

4. N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战包括活动性和选择性的改进需求、确保足够的N2O可用性以及进行经济可行性研究以实现商业应用。解决这些挑战可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选项。

[1] "The catalytic performance of these materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of O2 and N2O depends on the distribution of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the nature of the oxidant."
[2] "The use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[3] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 improves propene selectivity."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It achieves this by influencing the distribution of vanadium oxide species (VOx) on the catalyst surface and altering the nature of the oxidation process.

2. N2O provides an improved propene selectivity in ODHP reactions over the traditional oxidant, molecular oxygen (O2). This is due to its unique ability to inhibit direct propane oxidation and the subsequent oxidation of propene to COx products, which enhances the selectivity towards propene formation.

3. Across various vanadium/MCM-41 catalyst materials, the substitution of O2 with N2O leads to enhanced propene selectivity in the ODHP process. This improvement is consistent across the range of catalysts tested, indicating the potential for wider applicability.

4. The effectiveness of N2O in ODHP is attributed to the spatial isolation of active surface lattice oxygen species on the catalyst. This isolation inhibits the direct deep propane oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, thus favoring selective propene formation over total combustion reactions.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂，相对于其他氧化剂而言，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。这通过影响催化剂表面的VOx物种分布和改变氧化过程来实现。

2. N2O在与氧气（O2）相比时，为丙烷氧化脱氢反应提供了提高丙烯选择性的效果。这是由于其独特的能力抑制直接丙烷氧化和随后的丙烯到COx产品的连续氧化，从而增强了丙烯形成的选择性。

3. 对于各种范德华/MCM-41催化剂材料，用N2O替换O2导致ODHP过程中的丙烯选择性提高。这种改善是一致的，适用于测试的催化剂范围，表明更广泛的适用性潜力。

4.N2O在ODHP中的有效性归因于催化剂表面上活性表面晶格氧物种的空间隔离。这种隔离抑制了直接的深丙烷氧化和随后的丙烯到COx的连续氧化，从而有利于选择性丙烯形成，而不是总燃烧反应。

在使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，几个关键点浮出水面。首先，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提高了丙烯的选择性。这归因于其通过隔离表面活性晶格氧物种的活性位点，抑制直接丙烷和连续丙烯氧化至COx的能力，从而避免了COx的生成。在催化剂设计中，确保可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）在惰性支撑上的高分散非常重要。这些金属氧化物应能容易地由碳氢化合物还原，而不是被氧化剂氧化，从而在MeOx聚合物中隔离活性晶格氧物种，有利于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。
