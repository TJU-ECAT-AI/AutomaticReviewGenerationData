[1] "In essence, only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons."
[2] "This hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple pathways in these reactions over different catalysts but also the understanding of the impact of the alkane structure on this complex oxychlorination reaction network."
[3] "When comparing with the reaction rates based on the surface area of the material (Equation (4)), differences were observed in the relative order between the catalysts (Figure S4, Supporting Information), although the identified categories remained unchanged."
[4] "Interestingly, while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and (VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra) and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates, which are not taken into account when considering a surface area-based reaction rate."
[5] "Furthermore, while chlorocarbons were mainly produced in EOC and only little in POC, limited coking was only observed in BOC, which might be due to further transformation of generated chlorocarbons in this reaction, which are known coke precursors and their chemical and/or thermal stability generally decreases with increasing carbon number."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages and challenges. Its primary benefit lies in propylene selectivity, which often surpasses that of other oxidants. Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including metal oxides, phosphates, oxychlorides, and others. However, catalyst deactivation and stability are critical issues that limit the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more stable catalysts that maintain their activity over longer periods. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O interaction with the catalysts and the propane molecule, aiming to optimize the reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield and selectivity. Additionally, exploring new catalyst compositions or modifications that enhance stability and efficiency could make N2O-ODHP a more viable industrial process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）具有几个优势和挑战。其主要优点在于丙烯选择性，通常高于其他氧化剂。已使用各种催化剂进行此过程，包括金属氧化物、磷酸盐、氧氯化物等。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性是限制N2O-ODHP实际应用的关键问题。

解决这些局限性的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，使其在较长时间内保持活性。研究方向可以集中在深入了解N2O与催化剂和丙烷分子之间的相互作用机制，以优化反应条件以获得最大丙烯产率和选择性。此外，探索新的催化剂组成或修改，以增强稳定性和效率，可以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业流程。
