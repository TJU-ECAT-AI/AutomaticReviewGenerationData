The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored with reports highlighting its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. A variety of catalysts, including metal oxides, metal phosphates, and mixed metal oxides, have been utilized in this process. However, critical challenges exist regarding catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to address these limitations include developing new catalysts with enhanced stability, optimizing reaction conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration techniques. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in N2O-ODHP, exploring alternative oxidants, and developing innovative reactor designs.
