[1] "In essence,only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons"
[2] "This hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple pathways in these reactions over different catalysts but also the understanding of the impact of the alkane structure on this complex oxychlorination reaction network."
[3] "Interestingly,while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and (VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra) and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates,which are not taken into account when considering a surface areabased reaction rate."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that its primary advantage lies in the enhanced propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is due to the unique properties of N2O, which facilitate a more controlled and selective oxidation process. However, the process faces several challenges, including catalyst deactivation and instability. Catalysts such as ceria (CeO2), vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), titania (TiO2), and europium oxychloride (EuOCl) have been employed in this process. The critical challenge associated with these catalysts is their deactivation and instability over time, which can significantly affect the efficiency and longevity of the process. Strategies to address these limitations may include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, improving the reaction conditions, and optimizing the process parameters to enhance catalyst stability. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of catalyst deactivation, developing novel catalysts with improved stability, and exploring alternative oxidants that offer better selectivity and stability in the ODHP process.
