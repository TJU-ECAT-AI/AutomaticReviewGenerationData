[1] "In essence, only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons."
[2] "This hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple pathways in these reactions over different catalysts but also the understanding of the impact of the alkane structure on this complex oxychlorination reaction network."
[3] "The product distribution over the catalysts was compared at 20% alkane conversion (Figure 4, S1S3, Supporting Information)."
[4] "Interestingly, while virtually all catalysts selectively (80%) produced the olefin in EOC, a much wider range of selectivity patterns (9831% olefin selectivity) was observed in POC, whereas olefin generation in BOC was found limited (selectivity 66%) or even completely inhibited."
[5] "Furthermore, while chlorocarbons were mainly produced in EOC and only little in POC, limited coking was only observed in BOC, which might be due to further transformation of generated chlorocarbons in this reaction, which are known coke precursors and their chemical and/or thermal stability generally decreases with increasing carbon number."
[6] "In BOC, both 1-C4H8 and 2-C4H8 compounds were observed at the reactor outlet, typical products also of catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation."

The literature does not contain information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, the literature does not propose strategies or research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

文献中没有关于作为氧化脱氢过程中的丙烷（ODHP）的氧化剂的使用，N2O的优势，与其他氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面，此过程中所使用的各种催化剂，以及催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战的信息。此外，文献中没有提出策略或研究方向来解决这些限制并可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
