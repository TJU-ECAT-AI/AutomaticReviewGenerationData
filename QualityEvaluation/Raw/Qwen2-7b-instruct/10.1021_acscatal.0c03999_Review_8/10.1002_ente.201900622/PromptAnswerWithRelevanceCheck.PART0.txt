[1] "In essence, only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons."
[2] "This hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple pathways in these reactions over different catalysts but also the understanding of the impact of the alkane structure on this complex oxychlorination reaction network."
[3] "When comparing with the reaction rates based on the surface area of the material (Equation (4)), differences were observed in the relative order between the catalysts (Figure S4, Supporting Information), although the identified categories remained unchanged."
[4] "Interestingly, while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and (VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra) and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates, which are not taken into account when considering a surface area-based reaction rate."
[5] "Furthermore, while chlorocarbons were mainly produced in EOC and only little in POC, limited coking was only observed in BOC, which might be due to further transformation of generated chlorocarbons in this reaction, which are known coke precursors and their chemical and/or thermal stability generally decreases with increasing carbon number."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages and challenges. Its primary benefit lies in propylene selectivity, which often surpasses that of other oxidants. Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including metal oxides, phosphates, oxychlorides, and others. However, catalyst deactivation and stability are critical issues that limit the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more stable catalysts that maintain their activity over longer periods. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O interaction with the catalysts and the propane molecule, aiming to optimize the reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield and selectivity. Additionally, exploring new catalyst compositions or modifications that enhance stability and efficiency could make N2O-ODHP a more viable industrial process.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that its primary advantage lies in the enhanced propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is due to the unique properties of N2O, which facilitate a more controlled and selective oxidation process. However, the process faces several challenges, including catalyst deactivation and instability. Catalysts such as ceria (CeO2), vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), titania (TiO2), and europium oxychloride (EuOCl) have been employed in this process. The critical challenge associated with these catalysts is their deactivation and instability over time, which can significantly affect the efficiency and longevity of the process. Strategies to address these limitations may include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, improving the reaction conditions, and optimizing the process parameters to enhance catalyst stability. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of catalyst deactivation, developing novel catalysts with improved stability, and exploring alternative oxidants that offer better selectivity and stability in the ODHP process.
