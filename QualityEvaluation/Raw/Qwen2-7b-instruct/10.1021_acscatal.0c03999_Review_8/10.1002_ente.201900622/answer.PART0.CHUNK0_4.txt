[1] "In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorination of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2),and cerium oxide (CeO2)."
[2] "The product distribution over the catalysts was compared at 20% alkane conversion (Figure 4, S1S3, Supporting Information)."
[3] "Interestingly, a strong variability was observed as a function of the alkane source."
[4] "Consequently, cracking and combustion pathways were found significant in POC over TiO2, Mn3(PO4)2, (VO)2P2O7, and CeO2, and particularly in BOC over all the investigated systems."
[5] "Finally, we have assessed the olefin selectivity as a function of the alkane conversion in EOC, POC, and BOC over the catalysts, which was varied by adjusting the reaction temperature (Figure 5, S1S3,"

In the study, the role of alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution during oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various catalysts was elucidated. The product distribution varied significantly depending on the alkane source, with cracking and combustion pathways becoming more prominent in propane and butane oxychlorinations. Olefin selectivity was found to depend on the alkane conversion, influenced by factors like alkane structure, catalyst type, and operational conditions.
