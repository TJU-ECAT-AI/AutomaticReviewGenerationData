Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this study highlights its advantages, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, notably those based on vanadium, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist regarding catalyst deactivation and stability. To address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical application, researchers suggest strategies such as optimizing catalyst composition and operating conditions.
