The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the study, CO2 was found to yield a significantly higher propylene selectivity than other oxidants. Various catalysts, particularly vanadia supported on alumina, were utilized in this process. Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were noted. Strategies to mitigate these limitations involve adjusting the catalyst composition and operational parameters.

在氧化脱氢过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，它在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。研究中发现，二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，丙烯的选择性显著高于其他氧化剂。各种催化剂，尤其是铝酸盐支持的钒催化剂，被用于这一过程。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战被识别为关键限制。缓解这些限制的策略包括调整催化剂组成和操作条件。
