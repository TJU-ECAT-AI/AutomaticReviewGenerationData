The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied. N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were employed in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability were identified. To address these limitations, strategies were suggested.
