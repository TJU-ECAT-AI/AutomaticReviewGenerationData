Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Different catalysts, including alumina-supported vanadia, were employed in this process. However, critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were identified. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation could involve optimizing catalyst formulations, enhancing operational conditions, and developing methods to mitigate deactivation and improve stability.

分析作为氧化脱氢作用下丙烷（ODHP）的氧化剂使用，N2O显示出与其他氧化剂相比更高的丙烯选择性。在这一过程中，使用了各种催化剂，包括氧化铝支持的钒催化剂。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题被发现。为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选择，可以采取的策略可能包括优化催化剂配方、改进操作条件以及开发方法以减少失活并提高稳定性。
