[1] "Regarding the synthesis of VMCM-41, the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method in which a vanadium source such as VO(C2O4) or VO(SO4) is added directly to synthesis gel containing a silicon source and an organic template prior to hydrothermal synthesis has mainly been reported so far (814)."
[2] "For the oxidation of C3H8 or i-C4H10, higher selectivity to C3H6 or i-C4H8 was obtained over the DHT samples,probably due to the higher isolation of vanadium sites in these samples."
[3] "It should be stressed that the DHT samples showed very different catalytic properties toward C2H6 and C3H8 or i-C4H10. As shown in Fig. 7B, the DHT samples with high vanadium content are not appropriate for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, but they are selective for the formations of C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 (Figs. 9B, 9C, and 13B)."

The direct hydrothermal (DHT) method is a common approach for synthesizing vanadium-containing mesoporous molecular sieves, where a vanadium source is directly added to the synthesis gel. This method allows for the introduction of vanadium sites primarily within the framework of MCM-41. When applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the DHT catalysts demonstrate selective production of propylene. However, these catalysts are not ideal for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane due to their lack of selectivity towards ethylene. The DHT samples exhibit superior selectivity for the formation of propylene and isobutene in the oxidations of propane and isobutane, respectively. This selectivity is attributed to the higher isolation of vanadium sites within the samples.

直接水热法（DHT）是合成含钒介孔分子筛的一种常见方法，其中将钒源直接添加到包含硅源和有机模板的合成胶中，然后进行水热合成。这种方法允许在MCM-41中引入主要位于框架内的钒位点。当应用于丙烷的氧化脱氢时，DHT催化剂表现出对丙烯的选择性生成。然而，这些催化剂不适合乙烯的氧化脱氢，因为它们无法选择性地向乙烷转化。DHT样品在丙烷和异丁烷的氧化反应中分别形成了丙烯和异丁烯，显示出极高的选择性。这种选择性归因于样品中钒位点的更高孤立性。
