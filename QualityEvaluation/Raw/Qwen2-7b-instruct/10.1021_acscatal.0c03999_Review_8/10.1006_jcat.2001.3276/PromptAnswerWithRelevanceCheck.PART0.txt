[1] "Regarding the synthesis of VMCM-41, the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method in which a vanadium source such as VO(C2O4) or VO(SO4) is added directly to synthesis gel containing a silicon source and an organic template prior to hydrothermal synthesis has mainly been reported so far (814)."
[2] "The DHT samples showed very different catalytic properties toward C2H6 and C3H8 or i-C4H10. As shown in Fig. 7B, the DHT samples with high vanadium content are not appropriate for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, but they are selective for the formations of C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 (Figs. 9B, 9C, and 13B)."
[3] "The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."
[4] "Acrolein is probably formed by the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the acid sites with medium strength in the catalyst are suggested to play roles in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate and thus contribute to the formation of acrolein."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

Advantages of N2O in ODHP compared to other oxidants include its ability to selectively produce propylene, especially when used with vanadium-containing catalysts. This is due to the unique properties of N2O, which allows for efficient oxidation of propane without significant side reactions leading to other products. The catalysts employed typically involve vanadium-based materials, which are known for their activity in promoting the desired reaction pathways. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability often stem from the high reactivity of vanadium compounds and the potential for poisoning by other impurities. Strategies to address these limitations might include developing more stable vanadium compounds, optimizing the catalyst preparation process, and improving the design of the reaction system to minimize contact with deactivating agents. Research directions could focus on exploring alternative catalyst systems, modifying existing catalysts to enhance their stability and selectivity, and investigating novel reaction conditions that could improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of the process.

分析硝酸氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，讨论与其它氧化剂相比，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势，以及该过程中使用的各种催化剂，以及催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。此外，提出策略或研究方向，以解决这些限制，并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。

N2O在ODHP过程中相对于其他氧化剂的优势在于其能够选择性地生成丙烯，特别是在与含钒催化剂结合使用时效果显著。这是由于N2O的独特性质，使得它能够在不引起其他副反应的情况下高效氧化丙烷。通常使用的催化剂涉及基于钒的材料，这些材料因其促进所需反应途径的能力而闻名。催化剂失活和稳定性的挑战往往源于钒化合物的高活性和可能由其他杂质引起的中毒。为应对这些限制，可以考虑开发更稳定的钒化合物、优化催化剂制备过程以及改进反应系统设计以减少接触导致催化剂失效的物质。研究方向可能包括探索替代催化剂系统、对现有催化剂进行改性以增强其稳定性和选择性，以及研究可以提高效率并减少过程环境影响的新反应条件。

[1] "The vanadium species introduced by the template-ion exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordination, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41."
[2] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[3] "TIE catalysts, however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8."
[4] "The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also increased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed as the vanadium content became high."
[5] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[6] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions."

The direct hydrothermal (DHT) method is a common approach for synthesizing vanadium-containing mesoporous molecular sieves, where a vanadium source is directly added to the synthesis gel. This method allows for the introduction of vanadium sites primarily within the framework of MCM-41. When applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the DHT catalysts demonstrate selective production of propylene. However, these catalysts are not ideal for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane due to their lack of selectivity towards ethylene. The DHT samples exhibit superior selectivity for the formation of propylene and isobutene in the oxidations of propane and isobutane, respectively. This selectivity is attributed to the higher isolation of vanadium sites within the samples.

直接水热法（DHT）是合成含钒介孔分子筛的一种常见方法，其中将钒源直接添加到包含硅源和有机模板的合成胶中，然后进行水热合成。这种方法允许在MCM-41中引入主要位于框架内的钒位点。当应用于丙烷的氧化脱氢时，DHT催化剂表现出对丙烯的选择性生成。然而，这些催化剂不适合乙烯的氧化脱氢，因为它们无法选择性地向乙烷转化。DHT样品在丙烷和异丁烷的氧化反应中分别形成了丙烯和异丁烯，显示出极高的选择性。这种选择性归因于样品中钒位点的更高孤立性。
