The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00103-0"},

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},
