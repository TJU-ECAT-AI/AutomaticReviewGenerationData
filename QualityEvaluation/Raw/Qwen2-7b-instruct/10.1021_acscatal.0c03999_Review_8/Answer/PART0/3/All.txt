The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized.

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.", "Chinese": "在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，可以得出关于反应条件对催化剂性能和组成的几个结论。研究表明，单个钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）在稳态条件下的组成依赖于所使用的氧化剂，无论是O2还是N2O。考虑含氧混合物（C3H8/O2 = 2），其中丙烷和氧化剂的浓度都很低（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(O2) < 10%），钒物种主要稳定在五价和四价氧化态。在N2O存在下，当控制丙烷和氧化剂的转化率（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(N2O) < 10%）时，钒的氧化态较低。钒在O2和N2O之间的氧化态差异归因于N2O比O2更低的还原性，难以重新氧化还原的VOx物种。这一发现表明，那些在使用O2时表现不佳的个别钒氧化物在使用N2O时可以成为ODHP反应的选择性催化剂。由于N2O的存在，钒氧化物的催化性能得到改善，这与反应条件下催化剂的还原程度和由O2和N2O产生的氧物种的性质有关。这些知识最终有助于设计改进的ODHP过程催化剂。为了在容易还原/氧化的氧化物上建立适当的结构-活性关系，应在控制的丙烷和氧化剂转化率下对催化剂进行表征，并应尽量减小催化剂床中成分浓度的梯度。在773 K下，个体钒氧化物的稳态产品选择性并不完全取决于新鲜钒氧化物的性质，而是由ODHP条件下氧化物的内部和表面状态的反应诱导变化所决定。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},

The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.", "Chinese": "在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，可以得出关于反应条件对催化剂性能和组成的几个结论。研究表明，单个钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）在稳态条件下的组成依赖于所使用的氧化剂，无论是O2还是N2O。考虑含氧混合物（C3H8/O2 = 2），其中丙烷和氧化剂的浓度都很低（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(O2) < 10%），钒物种主要稳定在五价和四价氧化态。在N2O存在下，当控制丙烷和氧化剂的转化率（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(N2O) < 10%）时，钒的氧化态较低。钒在O2和N2O之间的氧化态差异归因于N2O比O2更低的还原性，难以重新氧化还原的VOx物种。这一发现表明，那些在使用O2时表现不佳的个别钒氧化物在使用N2O时可以成为ODHP反应的选择性催化剂。由于N2O的存在，钒氧化物的催化性能得到改善，这与反应条件下催化剂的还原程度和由O2和N2O产生的氧物种的性质有关。这些知识最终有助于设计改进的ODHP过程催化剂。为了在容易还原/氧化的氧化物上建立适当的结构-活性关系，应在控制的丙烷和氧化剂转化率下对催化剂进行表征，并应尽量减小催化剂床中成分浓度的梯度。在773 K下，个体钒氧化物的稳态产品选择性并不完全取决于新鲜钒氧化物的性质，而是由ODHP条件下氧化物的内部和表面状态的反应诱导变化所决定。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},
