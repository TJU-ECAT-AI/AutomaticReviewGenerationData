Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Different catalysts, including alumina-supported vanadia, were employed in this process. However, critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were identified. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation could involve optimizing catalyst formulations, enhancing operational conditions, and developing methods to mitigate deactivation and improve stability.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the presence of N2O correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes under reaction conditions. The ratio of kinetic constants can be used to assess the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The primary reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane from the CH-C-H-N2O feed.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that the process is advantageous in terms of propylene selectivity due to the unique properties of N2O. The selectivity to propylene is notably high, reaching up to 95-98% for CrPO and FePO systems, surpassing other catalysts. This high selectivity is attributed to the materials' ability to efficiently dehydrochlorinate propyl chloride into propylene, while hindering the evolution of molecular chlorine, which would otherwise lead to over-oxidation and the formation of coke or other undesirable byproducts.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, thereby facilitating their reduction. As the amount of N2O increases, the depth of catalyst reduction becomes greater. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The first direct experimental proof of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction over boron-based catalysts was accomplished using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). This method allowed for the detection of gas-phase radicals in the ODHP process. The detection of NO on the BN-T-high catalyst during the ODHP reaction at 600°C, as observed with SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), indicates the influence of NO on the reaction system. Our SVUV-PIMS results directly and unambiguously revealed the presence of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. The recent demonstration in catalyst-free propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in empty reactors at approximately 500°C, in the presence of O2, showed that the presence of NO can affect the formation of gas-phase radicals in the alkane reaction system.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of reaction conditions on catalyst performance and composition. The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.

Discussing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is highlighted that N2O provides several advantages over other oxidants, notably in increasing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, have been utilized in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP, such as the formation of undesired byproducts and the risk of catalyst poisoning, require attention.

Using the in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This suggests that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, which reduces the surface density of active oxygen species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) was investigated as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to other oxidants like air and O2, N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity.

Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) was investigated as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to other oxidants like air and O2, N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, specifically Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions, were used in this process. The study addressed the key challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability and suggested strategies such as creating more stable catalysts and refining reaction conditions to overcome these limitations.

Observing the development of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a promising technique for the synthesis of propylene, a crucial component in the petrochemical industry, it becomes apparent that nitrous oxide (N2O) has garnered considerable interest owing to its prospective environmental advantages and high propylene selectivity. Well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been extensively studied for their exceptional activity and selectivity in the ODHP process. Nonetheless, these catalysts face challenges related to deactivation and maintaining stability, especially when N2O is employed as the oxidant.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants.

Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation could involve optimizing catalyst formulations, enhancing operational conditions, and developing methods to mitigate deactivation and improve stability.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the presence of N2O correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes under reaction conditions. The ratio of kinetic constants can be used to assess the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The primary reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane from the CH-C-H-N2O feed.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that the process is advantageous in terms of propylene selectivity due to the unique properties of N2O. The selectivity to propylene is notably high, reaching up to 95-98% for CrPO and FePO systems, surpassing other catalysts. This high selectivity is attributed to the materials' ability to efficiently dehydrochlorinate propyl chloride into propylene, while hindering the evolution of molecular chlorine, which would otherwise lead to over-oxidation and the formation of coke or other undesirable byproducts.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, thereby facilitating their reduction. As the amount of N2O increases, the depth of catalyst reduction becomes greater. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The first direct experimental proof of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction over boron-based catalysts was accomplished using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). This method allowed for the detection of gas-phase radicals in the ODHP process. The detection of NO on the BN-T-high catalyst during the ODHP reaction at 600°C, as observed with SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), indicates the influence of NO on the reaction system. Our SVUV-PIMS results directly and unambiguously revealed the presence of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. The recent demonstration in catalyst-free propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in empty reactors at approximately 500°C, in the presence of O2, showed that the presence of NO can affect the formation of gas-phase radicals in the alkane reaction system.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of reaction conditions on catalyst performance and composition. The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.

Discussing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is highlighted that N2O provides several advantages over other oxidants, notably in increasing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, have been utilized in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP, such as the formation of undesired byproducts and the risk of catalyst poisoning, require attention.

Using the in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This suggests that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity.

To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.

Discussing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is highlighted that N2O provides several advantages over other oxidants, notably in increasing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, have been utilized in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP, such as the formation of undesired byproducts and the risk of catalyst poisoning, require attention.

Using the in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This suggests that the degree of reduction of VOx species might be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, which reduces the surface density of active oxygen species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) was investigated as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to other oxidants like air and O2, N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, specifically Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions, were used in this process. The study addressed the key challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability and suggested strategies such as creating more stable catalysts and refining reaction conditions to overcome these limitations.

Observing the development of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a promising technique for the synthesis of propylene, a crucial component in the petrochemical industry, it becomes apparent that nitrous oxide (N2O) has garnered considerable interest owing to its prospective environmental advantages and high propylene selectivity. Well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been extensively studied for their exceptional activity and selectivity in the ODHP process. Nonetheless, these catalysts face challenges related to deactivation and maintaining stability, especially when N2O is employed as the oxidant.
