          [1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5%."
          [3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides, such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
          [4] "For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide, but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method exhibited higher selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen than the sample prepared by the TIE method."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, such as chromium-based catalysts, are employed in this process. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability over time. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the catalyst composition, enhancing support material properties, or developing more stable catalyst precursors. Research directions could focus on understanding the precise coordination structures of chromium species on the catalysts and how they influence reaction outcomes, aiming to improve selectivity and efficiency in ODHP processes using N2O as an oxidant.

          在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）中使用N2O作为氧化剂，我们发现与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提供了更高的丙烯选择性。各种催化剂，如铬基催化剂，被用于这一过程。面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和维持稳定性随时间。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成、增强支撑材料性能或开发更稳定的催化剂前体。研究方向可以集中在理解催化剂上铬物种的确切配位结构以及它们如何影响反应结果，旨在通过使用N2O作为氧化剂改进ODHP过程的选择性和效率。

          [1] "Several types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample by the TIE method."
          [2] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
          [3] "The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
          [4] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

          In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.

          在模板离子交换（TIE）方法中，多种类型的铬物种，包括单重铬酸盐和多重铬酸盐，在样品上共存。两种合成的铬-微孔分子筛在丙烷脱氢与二氧化碳反应中的催化性能相似。二氧化碳增强了两种样品的丙烷转化率。在脱氢反应期间，两种样品上的铬酸盐物种转化为聚集的Cr(III)并具有八面体配位。使用直接水热合成（DHT）方法制备的样品在甲烷部分氧化与氧气反应中对甲醛的选择性明显高于通过TIE方法制备的样品。
