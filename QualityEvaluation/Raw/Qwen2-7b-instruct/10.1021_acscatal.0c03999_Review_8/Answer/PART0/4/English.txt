Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides advantages in propylene selectivity over other oxidants. The study utilized Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared through grafting for this process. Challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability were encountered. Potential solutions include refining reaction conditions, adjusting catalyst formulation, and enhancing regeneration techniques.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over vanadia-based catalysts has received extensive attention, with improvements in activity and propylene selectivity achieved through the addition of secondary surface metal oxides like CeO2, ZrO2, and TiO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has proven effective as an oxidant in the ODHP process, yielding higher propylene yields compared to alternatives such as oxygen or air. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has also been considered as an oxidant in the ODHP process, highlighting potential advantages in propylene selectivity. However, challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are paramount, particularly when N2O is employed. Solutions to these limitations could involve creating more stable catalyst supports, refining the catalyst composition, or adjusting the reaction conditions.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has shown promise, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes under specific reaction conditions. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used as a measure of the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. A notable feature of the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The main reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane from the CH-C-H-N2O feed.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the detailed mechanisms, particularly concerning the radical chemistry involved, are still largely unknown. Recent studies have provided the first direct evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts through online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), highlighting the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process. Combining these findings with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it has been shown that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 derived through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is attributed to the surface's limited redox capability, differing from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is resistant to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, yet gas-phase unimolecular cleavage remains possible. Our discoveries offer new perspectives on understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts, with implications for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Addressing these limitations requires strategies such as adjusting catalyst composition, enhancing synthesis conditions, and optimizing reaction parameters.

Additionally, the study explores the reoxidation ability of the oxidant towards reduced VOx species and the nature of both selective and nonselective oxygen species, shedding light on how these factors influence the overall process.

Addressing the pressing concerns surrounding catalyst deactivation and stability, it is clear that different types of catalysts are integral to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process.

The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes under specific reaction conditions. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used as a measure of the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. A notable feature of the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The main reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane from the CH-C-H-N2O feed.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the detailed mechanisms, particularly concerning the radical chemistry involved, are still largely unknown. Recent studies have provided the first direct evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts through online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), highlighting the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process. Combining these findings with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it has been shown that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 derived through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is attributed to the surface's limited redox capability, differing from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is resistant to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, yet gas-phase unimolecular cleavage remains possible. Our discoveries offer new perspectives on understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts, with implications for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Analyzing the role of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is acknowledged that N2O serves as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are commonly applied in ODHP processes. A major challenge in ODHP involves catalyst degradation and stability. Addressing these limitations requires strategies such as adjusting catalyst composition, enhancing synthesis conditions, and optimizing reaction parameters.

In this work, we examine the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study presents the physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials, detailing their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction, and the redox dynamics of VOx species as analyzed through in-situ UV/vis techniques. The improving effect of N2O is linked to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, which leads to a reduction in the surface density of active oxygen species. Additionally, the study explores the reoxidation ability of the oxidant towards reduced VOx species and the nature of both selective and nonselective oxygen species, shedding light on how these factors influence the overall process.

Addressing the pressing concerns surrounding catalyst deactivation and stability, it is clear that different types of catalysts are integral to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process.
