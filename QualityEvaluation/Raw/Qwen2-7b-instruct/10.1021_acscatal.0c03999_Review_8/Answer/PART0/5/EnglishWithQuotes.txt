As the amount of N2O increases, the depth of catalyst reduction becomes greater. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00103-0"},
