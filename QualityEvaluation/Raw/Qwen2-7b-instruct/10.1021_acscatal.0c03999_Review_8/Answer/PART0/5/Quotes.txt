          [2] "The ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. The former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
          [3] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
          [4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

          [4] "The values of k decrease in the order C-H rel 3 8)C-H)CHfHfC-H, benzene being found to be as reactive as CH and H."
          [5] "A remarkable feature of CH-C-H-N2O conversion over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products CO, CO and enhanced amount of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane."
          [6] "For CH-C-H-N2O feed, the main reaction route for Tol and Xy formation is the oxidative methylation of aromatic ring with methane."

[1] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [3] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."

          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."

          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."
