Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this study emphasizes its application over other oxidants, focusing on propylene selectivity. The Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared through grafting, is utilized in this process. The document discusses the advantages of N2O in terms of selectivity and compares it with alternative oxidants.

The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, especially concerning propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the presence of N2O is linked to the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes under specific reaction conditions. The ratio of kinetic constants can serve as a metric for assessing the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The principal reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane from the CH-C-H-N2O feed.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, thereby facilitating their reduction. As the amount of N2O increases, the depth of catalyst reduction becomes greater. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for catalytic performance. N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is significant for the production of propylene due to its economic benefits and environmental advantages. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are frequently used in this process. A major hurdle in ODHP is the degradation and instability of catalysts. To tackle these obstacles, strategies such as adjusting the catalyst formula, improving synthesis methods, and optimizing reaction parameters can be implemented.

Since the activity of N2O in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was found to be lower than that of O2, it was hypothesized that the degree of reduction of VOx species could be crucial for achieving high propene selectivity. The study emphasizes the importance of the oxidant's ability to reoxidize reduced VOx species and the nature of selective versus nonselective oxygen species, indicating that the former property modulates the reduction level of vanadium species; the less oxidizing capability, the greater the reduction of VOx species. Furthermore, N2O is noted for not generating nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which originate from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.
