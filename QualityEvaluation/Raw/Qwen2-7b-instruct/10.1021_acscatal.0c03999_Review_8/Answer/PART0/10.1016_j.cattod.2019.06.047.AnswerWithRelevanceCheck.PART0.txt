          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over vanadia-based catalysts has received extensive attention, with improvements in activity and propylene selectivity achieved through the addition of secondary surface metal oxides like CeO2, ZrO2, and TiO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has proven effective as an oxidant in the ODHP process, yielding higher propylene yields compared to alternatives such as oxygen or air. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has also been considered as an oxidant in the ODHP process, highlighting potential advantages in propylene selectivity. However, challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are paramount, particularly when N2O is employed. Solutions to these limitations could involve creating more stable catalyst supports, refining the catalyst composition, or adjusting the reaction conditions.
