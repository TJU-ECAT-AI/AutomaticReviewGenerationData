          [1] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of alkane to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [2] "On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."
          [3] "Some studies have also been performed on the effect of H2S or other sulfur species on the ODH reactions of light alkanes."
          [4] "Therefore, the present work aims at acquiring a better understanding of the effect of H2S in the alkane ODH reaction."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

          在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用二氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，分析显示N2O可以提高丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比具有优势。具体而言，N2O/O2混合物被发现可以将用范迪催化剂催化丙烷ODHP反应时的丙烯选择性提高25%，但这种选择性的提升仅能在较低的丙烷转化率（110%）下实现。这表明N2O可能在增强丙烯选择性方面有利，但其操作条件可能会限制其实用性。与ODHP过程相关的催化剂失活和稳定性问题是一些关键挑战。所使用的催化剂包括范迪和混合金属氧化物，这些物质以其高热稳定性、大表面积、有利于脱氢活性和选择性的还原性和碱性而著称。然而，这些系统尚未显示出与当前工业技术用于生产烯烃的产量相当的产品。为应对这些局限性，可以采取的策略包括改进催化剂设计以增强稳定性和防止失活，优化操作条件以最大化选择性而不牺牲转化率，并探索不同氧化剂的新型组合或添加剂以进一步提高丙烯选择性，同时降低过氧化或反应失控的风险。研究方向可能包括研究不同氧化剂与特定催化剂的协同作用效果，探究硫物种在烷烃ODHP反应中决定产物选择性的作用，以及开发具有改进选择性和稳定性的新型催化剂以实现N2O-ODHP的实用实施。
