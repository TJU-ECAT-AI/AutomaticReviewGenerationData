          [2] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

[1] "The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention due to its unique properties."
          [2] "Compared to other oxidants, N2O offers several advantages, including higher propylene selectivity and lower formation of unwanted byproducts."
          [3] "A variety of catalysts have been utilized in the ODHP process, including well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
          [4] "Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability remain major obstacles in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP."

[1] "Several types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample by the TIE method."
          [2] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
          [3] "The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
          [4] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."
