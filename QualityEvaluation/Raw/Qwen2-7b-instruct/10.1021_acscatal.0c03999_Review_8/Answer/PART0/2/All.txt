The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.", "Chinese": "将氧气替换为硝酸氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，导致所有研究温度下的初始产品形成速率降低。然而，根据总钨含量进行归一化的速率在4.6 wt.%/-Al2O3催化剂（表2）中达到峰值。在以孤立钨物种为主的催化剂与包含孤立和聚合型钨物种的催化剂之间观察到的最大差异体现在选择性和转化率图（图8）。对于聚合型钨物种的催化剂，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯被氧化为COx。另一方面，以孤立钨物种为主的催化剂主要直接从丙烷产生丙烯和COx。用N2O替换氧气导致的催化活性下降可以归因于氧化剂氧化催化剂还原材料的能力，这由氧化脱氢过程的氧化还原机制（方程（1）和（2））解释。这一发现与复杂混合氧化物材料上的氧化脱氢过程的先前研究[26]以及广为人知的站点隔离理论[27]是一致的，后者强调受控数量的活性位点在选择性氧化反应中优于燃烧反应的重要性。", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5"},
