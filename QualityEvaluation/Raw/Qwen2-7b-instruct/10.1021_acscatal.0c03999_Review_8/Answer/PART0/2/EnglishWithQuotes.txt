The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8).

The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)).

According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp410750c"},

Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst.

A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
