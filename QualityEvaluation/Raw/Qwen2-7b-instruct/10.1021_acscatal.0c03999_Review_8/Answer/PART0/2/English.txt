Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Ferric zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) catalysts were synthesized through grafting techniques. Propylene selectivity is crucial for assessing the efficiency of ODHP methods. A significant hurdle in the ODHP process involves catalyst deactivation and instability.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the study, the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives on the performance of vanadia-based catalysts were explored. N2O was found to demonstrate higher propylene selectivity than other oxidants. Alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were employed in this process, and strategies to address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability were suggested.

The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support. The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts. Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts.

In the context of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document outlines several advantages over other oxidants. Notably, N2O facilitates higher propylene selectivity due to its distinctive chemical characteristics and reaction dynamics. The process typically employs a range of catalysts, including noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru), which are recognized for their efficacy in catalyzing the desired reaction pathways. The text also addresses the pivotal challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, highlighting how these factors can profoundly affect the efficiency and durability of the ODHP process.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, especially in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the conversion on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Under specific reaction conditions, methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Remarkably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CH-C-H-N2O feed has been utilized to understand the pathways of product formation.

The document does not provide specific information on the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, or potential strategies or research directions to address these limitations.

The investigation of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process highlights its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. Multiple catalysts, such as CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, have been applied in this context. Significant challenges, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and stability, specifically temperature control and catalyst regeneration, are encountered. Addressing these limitations may involve refining reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and creating effective regeneration techniques.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, including metal phosphates, are employed in this process. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are major obstacles to practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical application could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature does not directly discuss N2O as an oxidant in ODHP. However, it does provide insights into the use of other oxidants and catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The key points that could be related to N2O include:

          Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants: The literature suggests that when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the reactions can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields and the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By contrast, the use of iodine as a promoter allows for higher product yields, especially when used in sub-stoichiometric proportions. This implies that N2O might offer similar benefits in terms of selectivity and efficiency, especially if it can be effectively controlled to prevent unwanted reactions.

          Various catalysts employed in this process: The literature mentions the use of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, including transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides. While it does not specifically mention N2O, these catalysts could be adapted for use with N2O to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

          Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability: The literature discusses the difficulties in maintaining high yields in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly when using iodine. Similar challenges would apply to N2O-based processes, requiring careful optimization of catalyst conditions and stability.

          Strategies or research directions to address these limitations: To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option, researchers could focus on developing advanced catalyst systems that are specifically optimized for use with N2O. This could involve:

          1. Investigating the interaction between N2O and potential catalysts to understand how they affect the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.
          2. Designing catalysts that can effectively control the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions, such as combustion, while promoting the desired dehydrogenation.
          3. Studying the stability and deactivation mechanisms of N2O-based catalytic systems to identify ways to prolong their operational life.
          4. Developing novel reaction conditions or process designs that minimize the formation of byproducts and maximize propylene selectivity.
          5. Conducting comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic studies to better understand the N2O-ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize process parameters.

          By addressing these challenges through targeted research and development, N2O-ODHP could become a viable alternative for practical implementation in the chemical industry.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for the catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2), particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, have been employed in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, including high operation costs and potential toxicity, require strategies such as refining catalyst composition, improving process conditions, and creating more efficient and less toxic catalysts.

In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising method for propylene production, with nitrous oxide (N2O) being commonly used for its environmental benefits. Catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are used in this process, but difficulties with catalyst deactivation and stability have hindered the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Examining the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O attracts considerable interest due to its distinctive characteristics. Compared to other oxidants, N2O provides several benefits, such as increased propylene selectivity and reduced production of undesired byproducts. The ODHP process frequently involves a wide array of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, continue to pose significant impediments to the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising method for propylene production, with nitrous oxide (N2O) being commonly used for its environmental benefits. Catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are used in this process, but difficulties with catalyst deactivation and stability have hindered the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Examining the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O attracts considerable interest due to its distinctive characteristics. Compared to other oxidants, N2O provides several benefits, such as increased propylene selectivity and reduced production of undesired byproducts. The ODHP process frequently involves a wide array of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, continue to pose significant impediments to the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Ferric zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) catalysts were synthesized through grafting techniques. Propylene selectivity is crucial for assessing the efficiency of ODHP methods. A significant hurdle in the ODHP process involves catalyst deactivation and instability.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the study, the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives on the performance of vanadia-based catalysts were explored. N2O was found to demonstrate higher propylene selectivity than other oxidants. Alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were employed in this process, and strategies to address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability were suggested.

The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support. The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts. Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts.

In the context of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document outlines several advantages over other oxidants. Notably, N2O facilitates higher propylene selectivity due to its distinctive chemical characteristics and reaction dynamics. The process typically employs a range of catalysts, including noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru), which are recognized for their efficacy in catalyzing the desired reaction pathways. The text also addresses the pivotal challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, highlighting how these factors can profoundly affect the efficiency and durability of the ODHP process.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, especially in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the conversion on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Under specific reaction conditions, methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Remarkably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CH-C-H-N2O feed has been utilized to understand the pathways of product formation.

The document does not provide specific information on the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, or potential strategies or research directions to address these limitations.

The investigation of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process highlights its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. Multiple catalysts, such as CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, have been applied in this context. Significant challenges, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and stability, specifically temperature control and catalyst regeneration, are encountered. Addressing these limitations may involve refining reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and creating effective regeneration techniques.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, including metal phosphates, are employed in this process. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are major obstacles to practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical application could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature does not directly discuss N2O as an oxidant in ODHP. However, it does provide insights into the use of other oxidants and catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The key points that could be related to N2O include:

          Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants: The literature suggests that when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the reactions can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields and the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By contrast, the use of iodine as a promoter allows for higher product yields, especially when used in sub-stoichiometric proportions. This implies that N2O might offer similar benefits in terms of selectivity and efficiency, especially if it can be effectively controlled to prevent unwanted reactions.

          Various catalysts employed in this process: The literature mentions the use of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, including transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides. While it does not specifically mention N2O, these catalysts could be adapted for use with N2O to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

          Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability: The literature discusses the difficulties in maintaining high yields in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly when using iodine. Similar challenges would apply to N2O-based processes, requiring careful optimization of catalyst conditions and stability.

          Strategies or research directions to address these limitations: To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option, researchers could focus on developing advanced catalyst systems that are specifically optimized for use with N2O. This could involve:

          1. Investigating the interaction between N2O and potential catalysts to understand how they affect the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.
          2. Designing catalysts that can effectively control the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions, such as combustion, while promoting the desired dehydrogenation.
          3. Studying the stability and deactivation mechanisms of N2O-based catalytic systems to identify ways to prolong their operational life.
          4. Developing novel reaction conditions or process designs that minimize the formation of byproducts and maximize propylene selectivity.
          5. Conducting comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic studies to better understand the N2O-ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize process parameters.

          By addressing these challenges through targeted research and development, N2O-ODHP could become a viable alternative for practical implementation in the chemical industry.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for the catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2), particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, have been employed in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, including high operation costs and potential toxicity, require strategies such as refining catalyst composition, improving process conditions, and creating more efficient and less toxic catalysts.

In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable.

In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising method for propylene production, with nitrous oxide (N2O) being commonly used for its environmental benefits. Catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are used in this process, but difficulties with catalyst deactivation and stability have hindered the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Examining the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O attracts considerable interest due to its distinctive characteristics. Compared to other oxidants, N2O provides several benefits, such as increased propylene selectivity and reduced production of undesired byproducts. The ODHP process frequently involves a wide array of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, continue to pose significant impediments to the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Ferric zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) catalysts were synthesized through grafting techniques. Propylene selectivity is crucial for assessing the efficiency of ODHP methods. A significant hurdle in the ODHP process involves catalyst deactivation and instability.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the study, the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives on the performance of vanadia-based catalysts were explored. N2O was found to demonstrate higher propylene selectivity than other oxidants. Alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were employed in this process, and strategies to address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability were suggested.

The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support. The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts. Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts.

In the context of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document outlines several advantages over other oxidants. Notably, N2O facilitates higher propylene selectivity due to its distinctive chemical characteristics and reaction dynamics. The process typically employs a range of catalysts, including noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru), which are recognized for their efficacy in catalyzing the desired reaction pathways. The text also addresses the pivotal challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, highlighting how these factors can profoundly affect the efficiency and durability of the ODHP process.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, especially in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the conversion on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Under specific reaction conditions, methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Remarkably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CH-C-H-N2O feed has been utilized to understand the pathways of product formation.

The investigation of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process highlights its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. Multiple catalysts, such as CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, have been applied in this context. Significant challenges, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and stability, specifically temperature control and catalyst regeneration, are encountered. Addressing these limitations may involve refining reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and creating effective regeneration techniques.

Various catalysts, including metal phosphates, are employed in this process. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are major obstacles to practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical application could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature does not directly discuss N2O as an oxidant in ODHP. However, it does provide insights into the use of other oxidants and catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The key points that could be related to N2O include:

          Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants: The literature suggests that when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the reactions can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields and the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By contrast, the use of iodine as a promoter allows for higher product yields, especially when used in sub-stoichiometric proportions. This implies that N2O might offer similar benefits in terms of selectivity and efficiency, especially if it can be effectively controlled to prevent unwanted reactions.

          Various catalysts employed in this process: The literature mentions the use of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, including transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides. While it does not specifically mention N2O, these catalysts could be adapted for use with N2O to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

          Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability: The literature discusses the difficulties in maintaining high yields in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly when using iodine. Similar challenges would apply to N2O-based processes, requiring careful optimization of catalyst conditions and stability.

          Strategies or research directions to address these limitations: To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option, researchers could focus on developing advanced catalyst systems that are specifically optimized for use with N2O. This could involve:

          1. Investigating the interaction between N2O and potential catalysts to understand how they affect the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.
          2. Designing catalysts that can effectively control the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions, such as combustion, while promoting the desired dehydrogenation.
          3. Studying the stability and deactivation mechanisms of N2O-based catalytic systems to identify ways to prolong their operational life.
          4. Developing novel reaction conditions or process designs that minimize the formation of byproducts and maximize propylene selectivity.
          5. Conducting comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic studies to better understand the N2O-ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize process parameters.

          By addressing these challenges through targeted research and development, N2O-ODHP could become a viable alternative for practical implementation in the chemical industry.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for the catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2), particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2), particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, have been employed in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, including high operation costs and potential toxicity, require strategies such as refining catalyst composition, improving process conditions, and creating more efficient and less toxic catalysts.

In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising method for propylene production, with nitrous oxide (N2O) being commonly used for its environmental benefits. Catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are used in this process, but difficulties with catalyst deactivation and stability have hindered the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Examining the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O attracts considerable interest due to its distinctive characteristics. Compared to other oxidants, N2O provides several benefits, such as increased propylene selectivity and reduced production of undesired byproducts. The ODHP process frequently involves a wide array of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, continue to pose significant impediments to the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it was found that N2O demonstrated higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Ferric zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) catalysts were synthesized through grafting techniques. Propylene selectivity is crucial for assessing the efficiency of ODHP methods. A significant hurdle in the ODHP process involves catalyst deactivation and instability.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the study, the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives on the performance of vanadia-based catalysts were explored. N2O was found to demonstrate higher propylene selectivity than other oxidants. Alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were employed in this process, and strategies to address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability were suggested.

The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support. The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts. Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts.

In the context of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document outlines several advantages over other oxidants. Notably, N2O facilitates higher propylene selectivity due to its distinctive chemical characteristics and reaction dynamics. The process typically employs a range of catalysts, including noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru), which are recognized for their efficacy in catalyzing the desired reaction pathways. The text also addresses the pivotal challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, highlighting how these factors can profoundly affect the efficiency and durability of the ODHP process.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, especially in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the conversion on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Under specific reaction conditions, methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Remarkably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CH-C-H-N2O feed has been utilized to understand the pathways of product formation.

The investigation of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process highlights its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. Multiple catalysts, such as CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, have been applied in this context. Significant challenges, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and stability, specifically temperature control and catalyst regeneration, are encountered. Addressing these limitations may involve refining reaction conditions, enhancing catalyst design, and creating effective regeneration techniques.

Various catalysts, including metal phosphates, are employed in this process. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are major obstacles to practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical application could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature does not directly discuss N2O as an oxidant in ODHP. However, it does provide insights into the use of other oxidants and catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The key points that could be related to N2O include:

          Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants: The literature suggests that when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the reactions can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields and the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By contrast, the use of iodine as a promoter allows for higher product yields, especially when used in sub-stoichiometric proportions. This implies that N2O might offer similar benefits in terms of selectivity and efficiency, especially if it can be effectively controlled to prevent unwanted reactions.

          Various catalysts employed in this process: The literature mentions the use of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, including transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides. While it does not specifically mention N2O, these catalysts could be adapted for use with N2O to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

          Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability: The literature discusses the difficulties in maintaining high yields in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly when using iodine. Similar challenges would apply to N2O-based processes, requiring careful optimization of catalyst conditions and stability.

          Strategies or research directions to address these limitations: To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option, researchers could focus on developing advanced catalyst systems that are specifically optimized for use with N2O. This could involve:

          1. Investigating the interaction between N2O and potential catalysts to understand how they affect the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.
          2. Designing catalysts that can effectively control the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions, such as combustion, while promoting the desired dehydrogenation.
          3. Studying the stability and deactivation mechanisms of N2O-based catalytic systems to identify ways to prolong their operational life.
          4. Developing novel reaction conditions or process designs that minimize the formation of byproducts and maximize propylene selectivity.
          5. Conducting comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic studies to better understand the N2O-ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize process parameters.

          By addressing these challenges through targeted research and development, N2O-ODHP could become a viable alternative for practical implementation in the chemical industry.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for the catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V).

          Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants: The literature suggests that when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the reactions can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields and the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By contrast, the use of iodine as a promoter allows for higher product yields, especially when used in sub-stoichiometric proportions. This implies that N2O might offer similar benefits in terms of selectivity and efficiency, especially if it can be effectively controlled to prevent unwanted reactions.

          Various catalysts employed in this process: The literature mentions the use of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, including transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides. While it does not specifically mention N2O, these catalysts could be adapted for use with N2O to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

          Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability: The literature discusses the difficulties in maintaining high yields in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly when using iodine. Similar challenges would apply to N2O-based processes, requiring careful optimization of catalyst conditions and stability.

          Strategies or research directions to address these limitations: To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option, researchers could focus on developing advanced catalyst systems that are specifically optimized for use with N2O. This could involve:

          1. Investigating the interaction between N2O and potential catalysts to understand how they affect the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.
          2. Designing catalysts that can effectively control the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions, such as combustion, while promoting the desired dehydrogenation.
          3. Studying the stability and deactivation mechanisms of N2O-based catalytic systems to identify ways to prolong their operational life.
          4. Developing novel reaction conditions or process designs that minimize the formation of byproducts and maximize propylene selectivity.
          5. Conducting comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic studies to better understand the N2O-ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize process parameters.

          By addressing these challenges through targeted research and development, N2O-ODHP could become a viable alternative for practical implementation in the chemical industry.

The addition of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts could have significant implications for the catalytic performance. N2O can induce the reduction of the catalyst's surface by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 due to its presence at the catalyst's surface, which slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst. Higher concentrations of N2O lead to greater reduction of the catalysts. The presence of N2O requires molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption. Propylene production from propane in the presence of pure N2O might only occur under temporary conditions as N2O typically needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process typically follows a redox mechanism when catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibits low selectivity towards carbon oxides but shows relatively high selectivity for ethylene compared to catalysts based on vanadium (V). The use of h-BN catalysts in the ODHP process involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with the identification of unambiguously gas-phase methyl radicals. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products, while propene is predominantly produced through surface reactions involving the cleavage of propane's CH bonds.

Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2), particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity. Different catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, have been employed in this process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, including high operation costs and potential toxicity, require strategies such as refining catalyst composition, improving process conditions, and creating more efficient and less toxic catalysts.

In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

The maximum initial activity and propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) were observed at a composition where x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalyst series. Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. The high activity is attributed to a large number of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. The formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 facilitates the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, contributing to the enhanced activity and stability. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are primarily related to the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst. Addressing these limitations could involve adjusting the catalyst composition to minimize the density of medium-strong acid sites, which are more susceptible to coke formation.

The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising method for propylene production, with nitrous oxide (N2O) being commonly used for its environmental benefits. Catalysts such as Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are used in this process, but difficulties with catalyst deactivation and stability have hindered the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

Examining the utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O attracts considerable interest due to its distinctive characteristics. Compared to other oxidants, N2O provides several benefits, such as increased propylene selectivity and reduced production of undesired byproducts. The ODHP process frequently involves a wide array of catalysts, such as well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, continue to pose significant impediments to the practical application of N2O-ODHP.

In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.
