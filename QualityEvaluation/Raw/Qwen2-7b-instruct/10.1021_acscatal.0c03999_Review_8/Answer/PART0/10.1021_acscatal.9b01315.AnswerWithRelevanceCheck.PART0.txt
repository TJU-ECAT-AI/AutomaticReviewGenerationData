          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights its potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Various catalysts, including noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides like CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.

          [1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
          [2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane.6,7 Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.8"
          [3] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
          [4] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1).19,20"

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, including metal phosphates, are employed in this process. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are major obstacles to practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical application could involve developing more stable and selective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and optimizing the process to minimize side reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.

          [1] "CrPO was found as the most selective system,reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
          [2] "Despite MnPO showed the lowest chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited C3H6 selectivity in POC."
          [3] "Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and strong propensity towards combustion."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that the process is advantageous in terms of propylene selectivity due to the unique properties of N2O. The selectivity to propylene is notably high, reaching up to 95-98% for CrPO and FePO systems, surpassing other catalysts. This high selectivity is attributed to the materials' ability to efficiently dehydrochlorinate propyl chloride into propylene, while hindering the evolution of molecular chlorine, which would otherwise lead to over-oxidation and the formation of coke or other undesirable byproducts.

          分析使用二氧化氮（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，我们发现该过程在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，这归因于N2O的独特性质。丙烯的选择性非常高，对于CrPO和FePO系统来说，超过了其他催化剂，达到了95-98%。这种高选择性归因于材料能够高效地将丙基氯化物转化为丙烯，同时阻止分子氯的生成，从而避免过度氧化和形成焦炭或其他不希望的副产品。
