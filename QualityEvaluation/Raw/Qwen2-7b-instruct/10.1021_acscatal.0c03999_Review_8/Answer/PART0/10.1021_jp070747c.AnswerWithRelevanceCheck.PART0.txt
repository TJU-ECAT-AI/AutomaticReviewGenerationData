          [1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

          在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，将亚硝酸氮（N2O）用作氧化剂时，文献强调了与使用其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的几个优势。特别是，N2O被发现可以提供比氧气（O2）更高的丙烯选择性，这归因于其独特的能力，能够更慢地重新氧化还原的钒氧化物（VOx）物种，从而影响这些物种的还原程度。这种还原程度对实现高丙烯选择性和抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化到碳氧化物至关重要。研究采用包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48在内的各种催化剂，以探讨不同氧化剂对ODHP反应的影响。通过原位UV/vis分析深入研究了VOx物种在不同条件下的氧化还原动力学，揭示了参与丙烷和丙烯选择性和非选择性转换的活性氧物种的性质。除了影响VOx物种的还原程度外，N2O不会产生由O2形成的非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化到碳氧化物。

          In analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O enables a higher primary propylene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to improved overall selectivity and activity. The study employs a variety of catalysts, including vanadium (VOx) supported over silica (SiO2), mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA), and alumina, to investigate the ODHP process. These materials are characterized for their surface properties, bulk characteristics, and catalytic performance, providing insights into how they affect the reaction dynamics. The key advantage of using N2O lies in its ability to reduce the surface density of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which minimizes the formation of nonselective oxygen species, responsible for catalyzing nonselective propane/propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study distinguishes the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species. It suggests that the former oxidant property tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

          分析硝酸氧化氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，发现与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。具体而言，N2O能够实现更高的初步丙烯选择性和抑制连续丙烯氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高整体选择性和活性。研究采用包括二氧化硅（SiO2）支持的钒（VOx）、介孔硅基材料（MCM、SBA）以及氧化铝在内的多种催化剂，对ODHP过程进行研究。这些材料通过表征其表面性质、宏观特性以及催化性能，提供了关于它们如何影响反应动力学的见解。使用N2O的关键优势在于其能够降低催化剂表面上活性氧物种的密度，这减少了非选择性氧物种的形成，这些物种负责催化非选择性丙烷/丙烯氧化为碳氧化物。研究区分了氧化剂重新氧化还原VOx物种的能力及其选择性和非选择性氧物种的性质。它建议前者氧化剂性质调节钒物种的还原程度；氧化能力越低，VOx物种的还原程度越高。除了影响VOx物种的还原程度之外，N2O不会生成非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种是从O2形成的，并催化非选择性连续丙烯氧化为碳氧化物。

          Since the activity of N2O in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was found to be lower than that of O2, it was hypothesized that the degree of reduction of VOx species could be crucial for achieving high propene selectivity. The study emphasizes the importance of the oxidant's ability to reoxidize reduced VOx species and the nature of selective versus nonselective oxygen species, indicating that the former property modulates the reduction level of vanadium species; the less oxidizing capability, the greater the reduction of VOx species. Furthermore, N2O is noted for not generating nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which originate from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.
