          [3] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
          [4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
          [5] "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
          [6] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
          [7] "This could allow the replacement of much of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur."

          [9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
          [10] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
          [11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
          [12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
          [2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
          [4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
          [5] "N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."
          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
          [8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant has been studied extensively due to its potential environmental benefits."
          [2] "This study focuses on the use of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O as the oxidant."
          [3] "Propylene selectivity is a crucial factor in the ODHP process, and N2O has been shown to offer advantages over other oxidants in this regard."
          [4] "The catalysts employed in this process include supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, which are known for their high activity and stability."
          [5] "However, catalyst deactivation and stability are significant challenges in the ODHP process, particularly when using N2O as an oxidant."
          [6] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods."

[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
          [2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          [2] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

[1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5%."
          [3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides, such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
          [4] "For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide, but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials."

          [4] "The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%) FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%)  NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion."

          [4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
          [5] "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
          [6] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
          [7] "This could allow the replacement of much of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur."

          [9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
          [10] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
          [11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
          [12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
          [8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant has been studied extensively due to its potential environmental benefits."
          [2] "This study focuses on the use of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O as the oxidant."
          [3] "Propylene selectivity is a crucial factor in the ODHP process, and N2O has been shown to offer advantages over other oxidants in this regard."
          [4] "The catalysts employed in this process include supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, which are known for their high activity and stability."
          [5] "However, catalyst deactivation and stability are significant challenges in the ODHP process, particularly when using N2O as an oxidant."
          [6] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods."

[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."

          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

          [11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
          [12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."

          [4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
          [5] "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

          [9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
          [10] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
          [11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
          [12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
          [2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
          [4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
          [5] "N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."
          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
          [8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant has been studied extensively due to its potential environmental benefits."
          [2] "This study focuses on the use of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O as the oxidant."
          [3] "Propylene selectivity is a crucial factor in the ODHP process, and N2O has been shown to offer advantages over other oxidants in this regard."
          [4] "The catalysts employed in this process include supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, which are known for their high activity and stability."
          [5] "However, catalyst deactivation and stability are significant challenges in the ODHP process, particularly when using N2O as an oxidant."
          [6] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods."

[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
          [2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          [3] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
          [4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
          [5] "When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
          [6] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
          [7] "This could allow the replacement of much of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur."
          [8] "Halogen atoms obtained by the dissociation of molecular halogen X2 (reaction 7) abstract a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon feed to produce a hydrocarbon radical and hydrogen halide, HX (reaction 8)."
          [9] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
          [10] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
          [11] "Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone."
          [12] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.)"

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
          [2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
          [4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
          [5] "N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."
          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
          [8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant has been studied extensively due to its potential environmental benefits."
          [2] "This study focuses on the use of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O as the oxidant."
          [3] "Propylene selectivity is a crucial factor in the ODHP process, and N2O has been shown to offer advantages over other oxidants in this regard."
          [4] "The catalysts employed in this process include supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, which are known for their high activity and stability."
          [5] "However, catalyst deactivation and stability are significant challenges in the ODHP process, particularly when using N2O as an oxidant."
          [6] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods."

[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."
          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
          [2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

[1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5%."
          [3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides, such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
          [4] "For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide, but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials."

          [6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
          [8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
          [9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."
          [5] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation (Supporting Information, FigureS32), though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur."

          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

          [6] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods."

[1] "On the basis of the above background, the present paper was aimed to provide new experimental insights into the governing factors concerning the superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the ODP reaction over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48."
          [2] "The results of physicochemical characterization of VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials; their catalytic performance in the ODP reaction; and redox dynamics of VOx species from in-situ UV/vis analysis are presented in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively."
          [3] "This means that the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species is also responsible for the lower ODP activity with N2O than with O2 as was previously suggested for VOx/MCM-4120 and VOx/γ-Al2O336 catalytic materials."
          [4] "From this difference in the oxidizing ability of O2 and N2O, it is easy to understand why the average oxidation state of VOx species under C3H8O2 conditions is higher than under C3H8N2O (Figure 6)."

          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."

          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5%."
          [3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides, such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
          [4] "For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide, but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials."

          [5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
          [2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
          [3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
          [4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
          [5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

[1] "The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been investigated due to its potential environmental benefits."
          [2] "Compared to other oxidants, N2O shows advantages in terms of propylene selectivity."
          [3] "A variety of catalysts have been employed in this process, including ceria-based materials."
          [4] "Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant issues."
          [5] "Strategies to address these limitations may involve modifying the catalyst composition or operating conditions."

[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
          [2] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

[1] "The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored due to its potential benefits."
          [2] "Propylene selectivity is often higher when using N2O as an oxidant compared to other oxidants such as oxygen."
          [3] "A variety of catalysts have been utilized in the ODHP process, including well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
          [4] "Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant issues in the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP."

[1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5%."
          [3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides, such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
          [4] "For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide, but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method exhibited higher selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen than the sample prepared by the TIE method."
