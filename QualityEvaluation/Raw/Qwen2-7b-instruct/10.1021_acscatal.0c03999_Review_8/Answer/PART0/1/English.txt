Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its unique interaction with the catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock, which correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, yielding toluene and xylenes. This selective conversion is further supported by the ratio of kinetic constants, which can be used to gauge the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, the use of N2O in this process leads to the absence of deep oxidation products like CO, CO, and instead increases the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed is utilized to elucidate the pathways of product formation. However, there are some discrepancies in the labeling patterns, such as less labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph than expected, and the presence of non-labeled molecules contributing to their formation along with scrambled 13C labels.

Various catalysts, including noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides like CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.

Analysis of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests several advantages and challenges. The use of sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, can potentially replace iodine and bromine as promoters in the ODHP process, offering a more cost-effective solution. The key advantage of N2O compared to other oxidants is its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, which is crucial for the production of olefinic monomers. Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, including CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips, to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. However, a significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of these catalysts, leading to reduced efficiency and product yields. Catalysts must be designed to maintain high activity and stability under the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the ODHP process.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. In certain conditions, propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, but this likely occurs only temporarily since N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Recent studies have identified hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, although the detailed reaction mechanisms, especially those involving radical chemistry, remain unclear. The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, confirmed by online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), provides new insights into the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process.

          The results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 forming through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by BOB oxygen is explained by the surface's poor redox ability, distinguishing it from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant like O2, the C3H7 intermediate is relatively inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, but gas-phase unimolecular cleavage can still occur.

          These findings are significant for understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When N2O replaces O2, overall activity decreases, but the selectivity towards propene formation increases, especially for the same degree of propane conversion. This is due to the unique properties of N2O that allow for more selective oxidation of propane to propene rather than combustion reactions. The redox mechanism of the process, which does not depend on the oxidant, explains why replacing O2 with N2O can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, this decrease in activity is compensated by the increased selectivity towards propene. The selectivity and conversion plots demonstrate that under certain conditions, the products formed are primarily CO, CO2, and C3H6, indicating the nature of the reactions taking place. The use of vanadia-based catalysts with polymeric vanadium species shows that propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx, while isolated vanadium species mainly form propene and COx directly from propane. This behavior is consistent with the site-isolation theory, which suggests that a controlled number of active sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction over different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential environmental benefits, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity.

However, challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability, especially when using N2O, necessitate strategies such as improving catalyst formulation, optimizing operating conditions, and enhancing catalyst regeneration techniques.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge from the provided literature. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promising improvements in propylene selectivity. It modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, resulting in increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane, oxygen, and CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the mixture is significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. This process is attributed to the dissociation of CO2 molecules at the catalyst surface, yielding activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) that can either oxidize methane molecules or improve catalyst activity by altering its oxidation state and increasing overall catalytic efficiency.

Potential solutions include modifying the catalyst composition or operational conditions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms. High-performance catalysts such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are used, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The role of iron is critical, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with the rapid and complete deactivation seen in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times less iron content), yet residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O highlights the essential role of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to differences in iron constitution and/or the unique porous structure associated with the original zeolite framework containing aluminum.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its unique interaction with the catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock, which correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, yielding toluene and xylenes. This selective conversion is further supported by the ratio of kinetic constants, which can be used to gauge the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, the use of N2O in this process leads to the absence of deep oxidation products like CO, CO, and instead increases the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed is utilized to elucidate the pathways of product formation. However, there are some discrepancies in the labeling patterns, such as less labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph than expected, and the presence of non-labeled molecules contributing to their formation along with scrambled 13C labels.

Various catalysts, including noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides like CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.

Analysis of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests several advantages and challenges. The use of sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, can potentially replace iodine and bromine as promoters in the ODHP process, offering a more cost-effective solution. The key advantage of N2O compared to other oxidants is its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, which is crucial for the production of olefinic monomers. Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, including CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips, to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. However, a significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of these catalysts, leading to reduced efficiency and product yields. Catalysts must be designed to maintain high activity and stability under the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the ODHP process.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. In certain conditions, propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, but this likely occurs only temporarily since N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Recent studies have identified hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, although the detailed reaction mechanisms, especially those involving radical chemistry, remain unclear. The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, confirmed by online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), provides new insights into the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process.

          The results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 forming through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by BOB oxygen is explained by the surface's poor redox ability, distinguishing it from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant like O2, the C3H7 intermediate is relatively inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, but gas-phase unimolecular cleavage can still occur.

          These findings are significant for understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When N2O replaces O2, overall activity decreases, but the selectivity towards propene formation increases, especially for the same degree of propane conversion. This is due to the unique properties of N2O that allow for more selective oxidation of propane to propene rather than combustion reactions. The redox mechanism of the process, which does not depend on the oxidant, explains why replacing O2 with N2O can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, this decrease in activity is compensated by the increased selectivity towards propene. The selectivity and conversion plots demonstrate that under certain conditions, the products formed are primarily CO, CO2, and C3H6, indicating the nature of the reactions taking place. The use of vanadia-based catalysts with polymeric vanadium species shows that propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx, while isolated vanadium species mainly form propene and COx directly from propane. This behavior is consistent with the site-isolation theory, which suggests that a controlled number of active sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction over different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential environmental benefits, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity.

However, challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability, especially when using N2O, necessitate strategies such as improving catalyst formulation, optimizing operating conditions, and enhancing catalyst regeneration techniques.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge from the provided literature. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promising improvements in propylene selectivity. It modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, resulting in increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane, oxygen, and CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the mixture is significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. This process is attributed to the dissociation of CO2 molecules at the catalyst surface, yielding activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) that can either oxidize methane molecules or improve catalyst activity by altering its oxidation state and increasing overall catalytic efficiency.

Potential solutions include modifying the catalyst composition or operational conditions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms. High-performance catalysts such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are used, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The role of iron is critical, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with the rapid and complete deactivation seen in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times less iron content), yet residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O highlights the essential role of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to differences in iron constitution and/or the unique porous structure associated with the original zeolite framework containing aluminum.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its unique interaction with the catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock, which correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, yielding toluene and xylenes. This selective conversion is further supported by the ratio of kinetic constants, which can be used to gauge the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, the use of N2O in this process leads to the absence of deep oxidation products like CO, CO, and instead increases the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed is utilized to elucidate the pathways of product formation. However, there are some discrepancies in the labeling patterns, such as less labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph than expected, and the presence of non-labeled molecules contributing to their formation along with scrambled 13C labels.

Various catalysts, including noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides like CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.

Analysis of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests several advantages and challenges. The use of sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, can potentially replace iodine and bromine as promoters in the ODHP process, offering a more cost-effective solution. The key advantage of N2O compared to other oxidants is its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, which is crucial for the production of olefinic monomers. Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, including CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips, to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. However, a significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of these catalysts, leading to reduced efficiency and product yields. Catalysts must be designed to maintain high activity and stability under the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the ODHP process.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. In certain conditions, propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, but this likely occurs only temporarily since N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Recent studies have identified hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, although the detailed reaction mechanisms, especially those involving radical chemistry, remain unclear. The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, confirmed by online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), provides new insights into the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process.

          The results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 forming through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by BOB oxygen is explained by the surface's poor redox ability, distinguishing it from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant like O2, the C3H7 intermediate is relatively inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, but gas-phase unimolecular cleavage can still occur.

          These findings are significant for understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When N2O replaces O2, overall activity decreases, but the selectivity towards propene formation increases, especially for the same degree of propane conversion. This is due to the unique properties of N2O that allow for more selective oxidation of propane to propene rather than combustion reactions. The redox mechanism of the process, which does not depend on the oxidant, explains why replacing O2 with N2O can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, this decrease in activity is compensated by the increased selectivity towards propene. The selectivity and conversion plots demonstrate that under certain conditions, the products formed are primarily CO, CO2, and C3H6, indicating the nature of the reactions taking place. The use of vanadia-based catalysts with polymeric vanadium species shows that propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx, while isolated vanadium species mainly form propene and COx directly from propane. This behavior is consistent with the site-isolation theory, which suggests that a controlled number of active sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction over different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential environmental benefits, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity.

However, challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability, especially when using N2O, necessitate strategies such as improving catalyst formulation, optimizing operating conditions, and enhancing catalyst regeneration techniques.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge from the provided literature. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promising improvements in propylene selectivity. It modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, resulting in increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane, oxygen, and CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the mixture is significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. This process is attributed to the dissociation of CO2 molecules at the catalyst surface, yielding activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) that can either oxidize methane molecules or improve catalyst activity by altering its oxidation state and increasing overall catalytic efficiency.

Potential solutions include modifying the catalyst composition or operational conditions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms. High-performance catalysts such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are used, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The role of iron is critical, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with the rapid and complete deactivation seen in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times less iron content), yet residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O highlights the essential role of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to differences in iron constitution and/or the unique porous structure associated with the original zeolite framework containing aluminum.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it appears that N2O can enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, a N2O/O2 mixture was found to increase propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this improvement was only possible at low propane conversion levels (110%). This suggests that N2O can be advantageous in enhancing propylene selectivity, but the operational conditions might limit its practical application. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the ODHP process are critical issues. Catalysts employed in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, which are known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity. However, these systems have not yet shown product yields comparable to those obtained by current industrial technologies for olefin production. Strategies to address these limitations could involve improving catalyst design to enhance stability and deactivation resistance, optimizing operating conditions to maximize selectivity without compromising conversion, and exploring novel oxidants or additives that can further enhance propylene selectivity without increasing the risk of overoxidation or reaction runaway. Research directions might include studying the synergistic effects of different oxidants in combination with specific catalysts, investigating the role of sulfur species in dictating product selectivity in alkane ODH reactions, and developing advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its unique interaction with the catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock, which correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, yielding toluene and xylenes. This selective conversion is further supported by the ratio of kinetic constants, which can be used to gauge the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, the use of N2O in this process leads to the absence of deep oxidation products like CO, CO, and instead increases the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed is utilized to elucidate the pathways of product formation. However, there are some discrepancies in the labeling patterns, such as less labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph than expected, and the presence of non-labeled molecules contributing to their formation along with scrambled 13C labels.

However, significant challenges exist, including catalyst deactivation and instability. These issues stem from risks of poisoning, formation of unwanted byproducts, and catalyst degradation through sintering or attrition.

Analysis of using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) suggests several advantages and challenges. The use of sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, can potentially replace iodine and bromine as promoters in the ODHP process, offering a more cost-effective solution. The key advantage of N2O compared to other oxidants is its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, which is crucial for the production of olefinic monomers. Various catalysts are employed in the ODHP process, including CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips, to facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. However, a significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of these catalysts, leading to reduced efficiency and product yields. Catalysts must be designed to maintain high activity and stability under the high temperatures and harsh conditions typical of the ODHP process.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. In certain conditions, propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, but this likely occurs only temporarily since N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process offers several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Recent studies have identified hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, although the detailed reaction mechanisms, especially those involving radical chemistry, remain unclear. The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, confirmed by online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), provides new insights into the existence of gas-phase radical pathways in this process.

          The results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane's CH bonds, with products of C2 and C1 forming through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) inefficiency of subsequent CH activation by BOB oxygen is explained by the surface's poor redox ability, distinguishing it from conventional ODHP catalysts like vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant like O2, the C3H7 intermediate is relatively inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, but gas-phase unimolecular cleavage can still occur.

          These findings are significant for understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts and for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When N2O replaces O2, overall activity decreases, but the selectivity towards propene formation increases, especially for the same degree of propane conversion. This is due to the unique properties of N2O that allow for more selective oxidation of propane to propene rather than combustion reactions. The redox mechanism of the process, which does not depend on the oxidant, explains why replacing O2 with N2O can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, this decrease in activity is compensated by the increased selectivity towards propene. The selectivity and conversion plots demonstrate that under certain conditions, the products formed are primarily CO, CO2, and C3H6, indicating the nature of the reactions taking place. The use of vanadia-based catalysts with polymeric vanadium species shows that propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx, while isolated vanadium species mainly form propene and COx directly from propane. This behavior is consistent with the site-isolation theory, which suggests that a controlled number of active sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction over different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its potential environmental benefits, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity.

However, challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability, especially when using N2O, necessitate strategies such as improving catalyst formulation, optimizing operating conditions, and enhancing catalyst regeneration techniques.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Specifically, N2O is found to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) due to its unique ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species more slowly, thus influencing the reduction degree of these species. This reduction degree plays a critical role in achieving high propylene selectivity and suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. The study employs various catalysts, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, to investigate the impact of oxidant choice on the ODHP reaction. The redox dynamics of VOx species under different conditions are thoroughly characterized through in-situ UV/vis analysis, revealing insights into the nature of active oxygen species involved in both selective and nonselective transformations of propane and propene. Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to carbon oxides.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge from the provided literature. N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promising improvements in propylene selectivity. It modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, resulting in increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane, oxygen, and CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the mixture is significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. This process is attributed to the dissociation of CO2 molecules at the catalyst surface, yielding activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) that can either oxidize methane molecules or improve catalyst activity by altering its oxidation state and increasing overall catalytic efficiency.

Potential solutions include modifying the catalyst composition or operational conditions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms. High-performance catalysts such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are used, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The role of iron is critical, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with the rapid and complete deactivation seen in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times less iron content), yet residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O highlights the essential role of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to differences in iron constitution and/or the unique porous structure associated with the original zeolite framework containing aluminum.
