          [1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
          [2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
          [3] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature."
          [4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
          [5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
          [6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
          [7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. When N2O replaces O2, overall activity decreases, but the selectivity towards propene formation increases, especially for the same degree of propane conversion. This is due to the unique properties of N2O that allow for more selective oxidation of propane to propene rather than combustion reactions. The redox mechanism of the process, which does not depend on the oxidant, explains why replacing O2 with N2O can lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. However, this decrease in activity is compensated by the increased selectivity towards propene. The selectivity and conversion plots demonstrate that under certain conditions, the products formed are primarily CO, CO2, and C3H6, indicating the nature of the reactions taking place. The use of vanadia-based catalysts with polymeric vanadium species shows that propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx, while isolated vanadium species mainly form propene and COx directly from propane. This behavior is consistent with the site-isolation theory, which suggests that a controlled number of active sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

          使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，相比于其他氧化剂，丙烯选择性得到了提升。当N2O取代O2时，整体活性降低，但丙烯形成的选择性增加，特别是在相同的丙烷转化率下。这是由于N2O的独特特性，允许更选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯，而非燃烧反应。该过程的氧化还原机制并不依赖于氧化剂，解释了为什么用N2O代替O2可能导致催化活性的下降。然而，这种活性的降低被丙烯选择性的增加所补偿。选择性和转化率图显示，在某些条件下，形成的产物主要是CO、CO2和C3H6，这表明正在进行的反应的性质。基于钨的催化剂使用聚型钨物种显示出，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯被氧化为COx，而孤立的钨物种主要直接从丙烷形成丙烯和COx。这种行为与站点隔离理论一致，该理论指出，受控数量的活性位点有利于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。

          [2] "However, the rates normalised with respect to the total vanadium content have a maximum for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 (Table 2)."

          Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures. However, the normalized rates with respect to the total vanadium content exhibit a peak for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 2). The most significant differences observed between catalysts with predominantly isolated vanadia species and those with both isolated and polymeric vanadia species are reflected in the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). In the case of catalysts with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, followed by propene oxidation to COx. On the other hand, catalysts with isolated vanadia species primarily produce propene and COx directly from propane. The decrease in catalytic activity when replacing oxygen with N2O can be attributed to the oxidant's ability to oxidize the catalytically reduced material, as explained by the redox mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation process (Equations (1) and (2)). This finding is consistent with previous studies on oxidative dehydrogenation over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-established site-isolation theory [27], which emphasizes the importance of a controlled number of active sites in favoring selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions.

          将氧气替换为硝酸氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，导致所有研究温度下的初始产品形成速率降低。然而，根据总钨含量进行归一化的速率在4.6 wt.%/-Al2O3催化剂（表2）中达到峰值。在以孤立钨物种为主的催化剂与包含孤立和聚合型钨物种的催化剂之间观察到的最大差异体现在选择性和转化率图（图8）。对于聚合型钨物种的催化剂，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯被氧化为COx。另一方面，以孤立钨物种为主的催化剂主要直接从丙烷产生丙烯和COx。用N2O替换氧气导致的催化活性下降可以归因于氧化剂氧化催化剂还原材料的能力，这由氧化脱氢过程的氧化还原机制（方程（1）和（2））解释。这一发现与复杂混合氧化物材料上的氧化脱氢过程的先前研究[26]以及广为人知的站点隔离理论[27]是一致的，后者强调受控数量的活性位点在选择性氧化反应中优于燃烧反应的重要性。
