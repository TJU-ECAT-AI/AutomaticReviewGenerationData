N2O-ODHP offers high propylene selectivity, making it an attractive alternative to traditional oxidants. The process utilizes a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, with the maximum initial activity observed at x = 8. Notably, Ga5Al5O15 shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity stems from abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution. Weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.03.021"},

A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K.
