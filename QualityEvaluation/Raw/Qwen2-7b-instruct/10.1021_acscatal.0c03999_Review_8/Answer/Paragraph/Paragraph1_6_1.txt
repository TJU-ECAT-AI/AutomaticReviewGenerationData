        Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers enhanced propylene selectivity over other oxidants, thanks to studies using alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, various catalysts like metal oxides, transition metal complexes, and mixed metal oxide systems, and the use of vanadium oxide catalysts. Challenges like catalyst deactivation and stability are addressed through optimized composition and conditions. Advanced research aims to overcome these limitations, making N2O-ODHP a more viable industrial option.

        The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity. Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including metal oxides, transition metal complexes, and mixed metal oxide systems. Critical challenges in the N2O-ODHP process include catalyst deactivation and stability, which limit its practical implementation.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) excels in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its superior propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2), thanks to its slower reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This influences the reduction degree of VOx, enhancing propylene yield. Studies highlight N2O's ability to suppress nonselective propene oxidation to carbon oxides by avoiding the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, a contrast to O2 usage.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an ODHP oxidant boosts propylene selectivity, thanks to its unique chemistry, outperforming other oxidants. Catalysts like Pt, Pd, and Ru are pivotal for efficiency, yet challenges like deactivation and stability limit its practicality. Research aims to develop strategies to maintain catalyst performance and address these limitations, making N2O-ODHP a viable industrial process.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers enhanced propylene selectivity due to its ability to reduce catalyst oxidation rates. Its effectiveness varies with N2O concentration, impacting catalyst stability and deactivation. Higher N2O levels deepen catalyst reduction, affecting propane conversion, propylene yield, and CO2 formation. While N2O needs molecular oxygen for consistent propylene production, it promotes catalyst reduction under certain conditions, offering a potential avenue for optimization.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers advantages in propylene selectivity, thanks to its oxygen atom donation capability. High-performing catalysts like FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, activated by steam, achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K under high space velocities. Iron plays a critical role, with FeZSM-5 showing superior resistance against deactivation compared to FeBEA. Steam activation is essential for enhanced catalytic performance.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers environmental benefits and propylene selectivity advantages over alternatives, utilizing catalysts like supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3. Challenges in catalyst stability and deactivation require strategies like improving catalyst formulation, optimizing operating conditions, and advancing catalyst regeneration methods. Research aims to overcome these limitations, making N2O-ODHP a viable industrial option.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) excels in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to enhanced propylene selectivity, attributed to the reduced re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced vanadium species. This leads to higher catalyst stability and selectivity compared to oxygen (O2). However, challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability necessitate advanced research for practical implementation.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for its lower oxygen consumption, distinguishing it from other oxidants. Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly employed in this process. However, challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Insights from studies highlight N2O's selective propylene production and the need for advanced research to overcome limitations, aiming for practical implementation.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leverages high propylene selectivity. Utilizing GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, the optimal catalyst is Ga5Al5O15, showing enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The catalyst's enhanced activity is attributed to abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites. Key findings suggest that weak surface acidity, rather than medium-strong acidity, is vital for achieving high activity and stability.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers higher propylene selectivity, reducing costs and increasing yields. Utilized catalysts include CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2. Challenges with catalyst deactivation and stability require strategies like developing more durable materials and optimizing conditions. Research focuses on enhancing selectivity and stability through alternative oxidants or catalyst modifications, aiming to make N2O-ODHP more practical.

        Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promise in enhancing propylene selectivity. Various catalysts, including noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Rh, and metal oxides such as CeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, are utilized. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and instability, stemming from poisoning, byproduct formation, and degradation.

        These considerations indicate that high product yields should also be possible with the new system if suitable catalysts are used. Much attention has been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product. When oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

        An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine. This could allow the replacement of much of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur. Halogen atoms obtained by the dissociation of molecular halogen X2 (reaction 7) abstract a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon feed to produce a hydrocarbon radical and hydrogen halide, HX (reaction 8). Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions, principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized.

        When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst, consisting of 5% CeO2 and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at 1152°F, the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butene conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity. Moreover, the chlorine being a more efficient hydrogen abstractor also makes hydrocarbon radicals more readily available for reaction with iodine than if the latter were present alone.

        Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F1.). In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4. The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2.

        Neither mass-spectroscopy or 13C NMR data have shown any insertion of carbon label in the aromatic ring of phenol. Number of labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph is found to be less than theoretically expected. Substantial number of non-labeled molecules of Ind and Naph and those containing only one 13C atom show the notable contribution of benzene to their formation accompanied with intense scrambling of 13C label.

        In summary, the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been extensively studied for its potential advantages, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity. The unique chemistry of N2O enables it to offer enhanced selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly when utilized with catalysts such as vanadia, supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, and Fe-ZSM-5. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability, however, remain significant obstacles to practical implementation. Advanced research is essential to address these limitations, focusing on developing more robust catalysts, optimizing operating conditions, and improving catalyst regeneration methods. Strategies to overcome these challenges could involve refining catalyst composition, exploring novel catalyst systems, and enhancing our understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior under different conditions. By doing so, nitrous oxide-aided oxidative dehydrogenation processes have the potential to become more viable options for the production of valuable olefins and other hydrocarbon derivatives in industrial settings.
