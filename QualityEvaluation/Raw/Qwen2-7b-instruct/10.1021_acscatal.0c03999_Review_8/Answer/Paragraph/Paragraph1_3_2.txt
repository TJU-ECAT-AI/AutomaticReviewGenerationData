High-performance catalysts like FeZSM-5 and FeBEA achieve up to 25% propylene yield at 723 K and 400,000 ml/h/g cat space velocity. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, show remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with FeBEA's rapid deactivation.

The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 may be attributed to its unique iron constitution and porous structure.

        By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. For low amounts of vanadia, i.e., 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivity-conversion plots show that all the main products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) are of primary nature. Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species, propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane.

        A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of aquathermolysis, metal sulfide reductive removal (MSR), and thermal sulfur recovery (TSR). For TSR, it was shown that steady-state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system. Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production. In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation.

        The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of N2O has been found to correlate with the strength of C-H bond. Under reaction conditions, methane is able to alkylate the aromatic ring of benzene giving toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used as a relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. A remarkable feature of CHCHN2O4662 conversion over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products CO, CO and enhanced amount of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed has been employed to elucidate the routes of product formation. Neither mass-spectroscopy nor 13C NMR data have shown any insertion of carbon label in the aromatic ring of phenol. Number of labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph is found to be less than theoretically expected, indicating complex pathways of product formation. Strategies for addressing these limitations could involve developing more stable catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and exploring alternative oxidants to enhance efficiency and practicality in industrial applications.

        Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over-oxidation of alkane to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway. On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%). Some studies have also been performed on the effect of H2S or other sulfur species on the ODH reactions of light alkanes. Therefore, the present work aims at acquiring a better understanding of the effect of H2S in the alkane ODH reaction.
