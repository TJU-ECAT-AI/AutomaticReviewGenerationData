        Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive. Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides. In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation, though gas-phase unimolecular cleavage could still occur. Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH.

        The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an area of growing interest due to its potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. An intensive review of the literature reveals that the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an intriguing area of research. Catalysts like noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) and metal oxides (CeO2, TiO2, Al2O3) are utilized, but challenges include catalyst deactivation and instability due to poisoning, byproduct formation, and degradation. Phosphate catalysts show distinct reactivity patterns, with CrPO and FePO being the most effective for propylene production. Advanced research is needed to address these limitations, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

        A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) MSR and (iii) TSR. For TSR, it was shown that steady state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system. Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production. In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation. These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants. The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates. These insights from oil and gas production highlight the role of oxidants and reductants, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) delay mechanisms. Research directions aim to address catalyst limitations, enhancing N2O's feasibility in practical ODHP applications.

        Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar. The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions. The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

        The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8. The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15. The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems. Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability. Optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods are proposed strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability, making N2O-ODHP a more practical option.

        By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature. It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant. Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane. From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replacing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material. This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of active sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction.
