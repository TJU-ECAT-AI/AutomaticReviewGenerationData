        The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been widely studied, showcasing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants. Catalysts such as vanadia, supported boron oxide, Fe-ZSM-5, and others have been employed in this process, each offering unique properties and challenges. Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability have been identified, particularly in the context of N2O's ability to induce catalyst reduction and slow down oxidation rates.

        Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst composition and operating conditions, developing more robust catalyst materials, and exploring alternative oxidants or catalyst modifications to enhance selectivity and stability. For instance, the redox dynamics of N2O, its unique interaction with hydrocarbons, and its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms without causing extensive oxidation, contribute to its superior propylene selectivity. The presence of sulfur species, such as H2S, can also influence the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways, offering new insights and potential avenues for developing highly selective catalysts.

        The need for advanced research is evident in overcoming catalyst deactivation and stability challenges. Future efforts should focus on understanding the precise coordination structures of catalyst species, developing stable precursors, and refining catalyst design to ensure long-term activity and selectivity. Additionally, exploring alternative oxidants or catalyst modifications could lead to more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes, making N2O-ODHP a more practical option for industrial implementation.

        In summary, while N2O presents promising advantages in propylene selectivity and reaction efficiency, the challenges in catalyst stability and deactivation require targeted research to fully harness its potential. Advanced catalyst development and optimized operational parameters are essential steps toward realizing the practicality of N2O-ODHP technology.
