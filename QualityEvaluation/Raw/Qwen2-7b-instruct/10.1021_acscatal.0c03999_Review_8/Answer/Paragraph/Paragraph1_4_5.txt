        Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h−1 g−1 cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.

        In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4. The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2.

        By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. For low amounts of vanadia, i.e., 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivity-conversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) are of primary nature.

Under reaction conditions, methane is able to alkylate the aromatic ring of benzene giving toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions 1,2 kskrk can be used as a relative reactivity of hydrocarbons.
