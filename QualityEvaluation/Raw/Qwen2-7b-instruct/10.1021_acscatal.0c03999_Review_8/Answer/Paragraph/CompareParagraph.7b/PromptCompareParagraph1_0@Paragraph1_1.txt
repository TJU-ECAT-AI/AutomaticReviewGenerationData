Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.8b00650]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.03.021], [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2013.08.051]. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity and lower oxygen consumption. Catalysts such as CeO2, NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, and supported boron oxide play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency of the process. However, critical challenges, including catalyst deactivation and stability, are ongoing issues in the field. Strategies to address these limitations include the development of more robust catalyst materials and the optimization of reaction conditions. Research directions could involve exploring alternative oxidants or catalyst modifications to enhance selectivity and stability, aiming to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
