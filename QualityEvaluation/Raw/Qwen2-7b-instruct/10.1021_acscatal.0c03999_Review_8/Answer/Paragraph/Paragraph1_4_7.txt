            Nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers enhanced propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its unique properties. Catalysts like CeO2 and CaO on Vycor chips are utilized, yet face challenges like deactivation and instability. Quoted studies suggest that sulfur, alongside other halogens, might replace costly promoters like iodine, making N2O-ODHP a more viable, economical option. Further research is essential to overcome these limitations, aiming for catalyst stabilization and improved efficiency.

            Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity include higher yields and lower production costs. Key catalysts, like CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals, are employed. Challenges in catalyst stability and deactivation require strategies such as developing more resilient materials and optimizing conditions. Future research could explore alternative oxidants or catalyst modifications to enhance selectivity and stability, making N2O-ODHP a viable industrial option.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) in ODHP offers propylene selectivity advantages, with supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts known for activity and stability. Challenges include deactivation and stability, especially with N2O. Strategies involve improved catalyst formulations, optimized operating conditions, and enhanced regeneration techniques. This approach aims to make N2O-ODHP more practical.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) was utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering lower oxygen consumption compared to other oxidants. Iron-ZSM-5 catalysts were employed, but challenges emerged with catalyst deactivation and stability. Research directions aim to enhance N2O's efficiency and feasibility in practical applications, addressing these limitations.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an ODHP oxidant offers superior propylene selectivity, thanks to studies using supported boron oxide catalysts. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies involve developing new materials and optimizing conditions, as highlighted by experts. N2O's advantages and potential solutions are pivotal for practical implementation.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an area of growing interest due to its potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. An intensive review of the literature reveals that the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an intriguing area of research. Catalysts like noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) and metal oxides (CeO2, TiO2, Al2O3) are utilized, but challenges include catalyst deactivation and instability due to poisoning, byproduct formation, and degradation.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers propylene selectivity benefits over other oxidants due to its unique interaction with hydrocarbon feedstocks. Catalysts like HZSM-5 play a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane production, while minimizing deep oxidation products. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability, exacerbated by discrepancies in carbon labeling observed in product formation studies. Research aiming to optimize catalyst formulations and enhance stability could make N2O-ODHP a more viable industrial process.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) excels as an oxidant in propane's oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP), offering high propylene selectivity. FeZSM-5 and FeBEA catalysts, activated with steam, efficiently convert propane to propylene, achieving yields up to 25% at 723 K, under high space velocities. Key challenges include catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. Iron's role is pivotal; steam-activated Fe-zeolites show remarkable deactivation resistance compared to FeBEA. While initial yields are notably higher with FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, residual activities are similar after prolonged operation. The essential role of N2O in propane dehydrogenation is underscored by its absence in reactions without the oxidant. Steam activation is crucial for superior catalytic performance. The enhanced deactivation resistance of FeZSM-5 could be attributed to its distinct iron constitution and/or porous structure.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O)-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) yields high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it as an efficient alternative. Utilizing GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides as catalysts, optimal activity and propylene yield are achieved at x=8, with Ga5Al5O15 showing enhanced stability at high conversion levels. The enhanced activity is attributed to abundant weak surface acidity linked to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, crucial for high activity and stability. Optimizing the Ga-Al ratio, exploring different support materials, and enhancing catalyst regeneration methods are proposed strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability, making N2O-ODHP a more practical option.

            By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivityconversion plots show that all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of primary nature. It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant. Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane. From the redox mechanism of ODP, the decrease of catalytic activity on replacing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material. This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials and the well-known site-isolation theory, which claims that a statistically controlled number of active sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers high propylene selectivity. Key factors are gold particle size and interaction with support; diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis yields well-dispersed small particles, enhancing specific activity. Concentrated solutions lead to ineffective large clusters. Catalysts like metal oxides and transition metal complexes are employed. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability, affecting practical implementation. Advanced research aims to improve stability and deactivation resistance, making N2O-ODHP more viable.

            Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity. Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including metal oxides, transition metal complexes, and mixed metal oxide systems. Critical challenges in the N2O-ODHP process include catalyst deactivation and stability, which limit its practical implementation. Strategies to address these limitations may involve modifying the catalyst composition or operating conditions.

            硝酸氧化（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的使用提供了与其它氧化剂相比更高的丙烯选择性，这得益于其独特的性质。CeO2和CaO在Vycor芯片上的催化剂被使用，但面临催化剂失活和不稳定的挑战。引用的研究表明，硫，与其他卤素一起使用，可能替代昂贵的促进剂如碘，使N2O-ODHP成为更经济可行的选择。进一步的研究是必需的以克服这些限制，旨在提高催化剂稳定性并增强效率。

            硝酸氧化（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用是一个研究热点，由于其在丙烯选择性方面的潜在优势。文献综述揭示了将硝酸氧化（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的研究是一个有吸引力的领域。铂、钯、铑等贵金属和金属氧化物（CeO2、TiO2、Al2O3）被用作催化剂，但挑战包括催化剂失活和不稳定，由于中毒、副产品形成和降解。

            硝酸氧化（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的作用优于其他氧化剂，由于其与碳氢化合物进料的独特相互作用。HZSM-5催化剂在提高对苯二甲酸、乙苯、邻苯二酚和二苯基甲烷产物的选择性方面发挥着关键作用，同时减少深度氧化产物的产生。挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性，加剧了碳标记在产物形成研究中观察到的不一致性。为了优化催化剂配方并增强稳定性，需要进行研究，以使N2O-ODHP成为更实用的工业过程。

            硝酸氧化（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，提供了高丙烯选择性，使其区别于其他氧化剂。利用GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物作为催化剂，最优活性和丙烯产量在x=8时实现，Ga5Al5O15在高转化水平下显示出增强的稳定性。活动增加归因于与四面体表面Ga3+位点相关的大量弱表面酸性，这对于高活性和稳定性至关重要。优化Ga-Al比率、探索不同支撑材料以及增强催化剂再生方法是解决催化剂失活和不稳定性的策略，使N2O-ODHP成为更实用的选项。

            将氧气替换为N2O后，总体活性降低，而相同程度的丙烷转化率下的丙烯形成选择性增加。用N2O代替氧气导致所有主要产品的初始生成速率在所有研究的温度下降低。对于0.5wt.%和1wt.%的五氧化二钒，选择性转化图显示所有主要产品（CO、CO2和C3H6）均为初级性质。应该注意的是，氧化脱氢（ODP）方案不依赖于氧化剂。对于聚集体的钒物种，丙烷最初被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯被氧化为COx，而对于孤立的钒物种，主要形成的丙烯和COx产品直接来自丙烷。从ODP的还原机制来看，替换氧气为N2O导致催化活性下降的原因可能是氧化剂能够氧化催化剂还原物质的能力。这一建议与我们在复杂混合氧化物材料上进行的ODP结果和广为人知的站点隔离理论一致，后者声称控制的活性位点数量有利于选择性氧化反应而不是燃烧反应。

            硝酸氧化（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的作用提供了高丙烯选择性。重要因素是金颗粒尺寸及其与支撑的相互作用；稀释的金属蒸汽合成产生了分散良好的小颗粒，增强了特定活性。浓度较高的溶液导致无效的大簇。金属氧化物和过渡金属复合物等催化剂被使用。挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性，影响实际实施。高级研究旨在提高稳定性和失活抵抗力，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的选择。
