[1] "The present communication deals with preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of propane and propane with sulphur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst."
[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[3] "The reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as:3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO (1)"
[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide."
[5] "In one experiment the selectivity to propylene formation increased from 14.8 to 20.3% over a period of 50 min."
[6] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored. The study found that adding SO2 to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion. However, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased significantly. The reaction of propane with SO2 was represented by the equation 3C3Hg + S02 -> 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO. The presence of additional products like HzS, H2O, and CO2 in the reaction indicated a complex mechanism. The selectivity to propylene formation increased over time, suggesting potential optimization possibilities for improving propylene yield in ODHP processes.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，硫化物（SO2）作为氧化剂的应用被研究。研究发现，向丙烯流中添加SO2增加了转化率的总体速度。然而，丙烯选择性显著降低。丙烷与SO2反应的方程式表示为：3C3Hg + S02 -> 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO。反应产物中额外含有HzS、H2O和CO2，表明了机制的复杂性。丙烯形成的选择性随着时间的推移而增加，这可能为提高丙烯产率提供优化的可能性。
