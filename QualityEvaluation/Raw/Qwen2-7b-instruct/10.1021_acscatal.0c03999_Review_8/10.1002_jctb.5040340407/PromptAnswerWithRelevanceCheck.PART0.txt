The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored. The study found that adding SO2 to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion. However, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased significantly. The reaction of propane with SO2 was represented by the equation 3C3Hg + S02 -> 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO. The presence of additional products like HzS, H2O, and CO2 in the reaction indicated a complex mechanism. The selectivity to propylene formation increased over time, suggesting potential optimization possibilities for improving propylene yield in ODHP processes.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using a palladium-alumina catalyst, demonstrating that the presence of sulfur dioxide enhances the overall conversion rate while decreasing propylene selectivity. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, particularly concerning the formation of coke and the subsequent loss of activity. Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of more stable catalysts, optimization of operating conditions, and the integration of regeneration processes to maintain high conversion rates without compromising selectivity. Research directions could explore the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other promoters to enhance both propylene yield and selectivity, aiming to make N2O-ODHP a more practical and efficient process for industrial implementation.

[1] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[2] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."
[3] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to an increase in the overall rate of conversion, yet significantly decreases the selectivity towards propylene formation. At 855 K, the selectivity to propylene drops from 93.1% to 20.6% when 0.0134 mol of SO2 is added to the feed. This suggests that while the reaction rate might improve, the efficiency of propylene production suffers. The formation of CO2 indicates that either the initial propane reaction is non-selective or that some of the propylene produced is oxidized further to CO2 and water. This complexity in the mechanism implies that the effect of SO2 on the ODHP process is multifaceted, impacting both the rate of reaction and the selectivity of the desired product.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硫化物（SO2）作为氧化剂，总体转化率会增加，但丙烯选择性显著降低。在855 K下，添加0.0134摩尔SO2到流体中时，丙烯的选择性从93.1%降至20.6%。这表明虽然反应速率可能会提高，但目标产物的生产效率却会下降。CO2的形成表明，可能初始的丙烷反应是无选择性的，或者部分丙烯产品会被进一步氧化为CO2和水。这一机制的复杂性意味着SO2对ODHP过程的影响是多方面的，既影响反应速率也影响所需产品的选择性。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored in the literature. While the specific advantages of N2O in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, the investigation of the process typically involves the utilization of various catalysts. The text highlights the employment of metal-based catalysts, including palladium-alumina (Pd-Al2O3), in the reaction. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, particularly noting the potential for coke formation, which affects catalyst activity. Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst materials, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the exploration of alternative catalyst supports that can withstand higher temperatures or resist deactivation over time. Research directions could focus on enhancing the selectivity of the process by modifying the catalyst structure or composition to improve propylene production while minimizing byproduct formation, such as carbon dioxide (CO2).
