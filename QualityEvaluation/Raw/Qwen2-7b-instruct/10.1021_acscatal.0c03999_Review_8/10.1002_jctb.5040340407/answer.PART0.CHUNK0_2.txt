Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using a palladium-alumina catalyst, demonstrating that the presence of sulfur dioxide enhances the overall conversion rate while decreasing propylene selectivity. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, particularly concerning the formation of coke and the subsequent loss of activity. Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of more stable catalysts, optimization of operating conditions, and the integration of regeneration processes to maintain high conversion rates without compromising selectivity. Research directions could explore the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other promoters to enhance both propylene yield and selectivity, aiming to make N2O-ODHP a more practical and efficient process for industrial implementation.
