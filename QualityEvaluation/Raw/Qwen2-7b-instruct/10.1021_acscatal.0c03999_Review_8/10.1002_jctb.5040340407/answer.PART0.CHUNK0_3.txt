[1] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[2] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."
[3] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."

The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) leads to an increase in the overall rate of conversion, yet significantly decreases the selectivity towards propylene formation. At 855 K, the selectivity to propylene drops from 93.1% to 20.6% when 0.0134 mol of SO2 is added to the feed. This suggests that while the reaction rate might improve, the efficiency of propylene production suffers. The formation of CO2 indicates that either the initial propane reaction is non-selective or that some of the propylene produced is oxidized further to CO2 and water. This complexity in the mechanism implies that the effect of SO2 on the ODHP process is multifaceted, impacting both the rate of reaction and the selectivity of the desired product.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硫化物（SO2）作为氧化剂，总体转化率会增加，但丙烯选择性显著降低。在855 K下，添加0.0134摩尔SO2到流体中时，丙烯的选择性从93.1%降至20.6%。这表明虽然反应速率可能会提高，但目标产物的生产效率却会下降。CO2的形成表明，可能初始的丙烷反应是无选择性的，或者部分丙烯产品会被进一步氧化为CO2和水。这一机制的复杂性意味着SO2对ODHP过程的影响是多方面的，既影响反应速率也影响所需产品的选择性。
