[1] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[2] "The present communication deals with preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of propane and propane with sulphur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst."
[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[4] "The reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as:3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO (1)"
[5] "In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is less explored compared to other oxidants like oxygen, halogens, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide. 
2. The study focuses on the kinetic investigation of propane reacting with sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst. 
3. Adding sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed increases the overall rate of conversion but significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation.
4. The reaction of propane with sulfur dioxide follows the equation: 3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO.
5. The effluent from the reaction contains not only H2S and H2O but also a substantial amount of carbon dioxide, suggesting potential side reactions or incomplete conversion.

1. 硝酸氧化剂（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用研究较少，与氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和羰基硫等其他氧化剂相比。
2. 当前的研究侧重于丙烷与硫化物在钯氧化铝催化剂上的动力学调查。
3. 在丙烯流中添加硫化物增加了转化率，但显著降低了丙烯的选择性。
4. 丙烷与硫化物反应遵循以下方程式：3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO。
5. 反应产物不仅包含H2S和H2O，还含有大量二氧化碳，这可能暗示潜在的副反应或不完全转化。
