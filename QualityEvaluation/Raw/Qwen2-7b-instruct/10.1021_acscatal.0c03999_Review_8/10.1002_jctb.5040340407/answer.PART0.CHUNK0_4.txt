[1] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K."
[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[4] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored in the literature. While the specific advantages of N2O in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, the investigation of the process typically involves the utilization of various catalysts. The text highlights the employment of metal-based catalysts, including palladium-alumina (Pd-Al2O3), in the reaction. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are acknowledged, particularly noting the potential for coke formation, which affects catalyst activity. Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst materials, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the exploration of alternative catalyst supports that can withstand higher temperatures or resist deactivation over time. Research directions could focus on enhancing the selectivity of the process by modifying the catalyst structure or composition to improve propylene production while minimizing byproduct formation, such as carbon dioxide (CO2).

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）已被文献探讨。虽然文本中没有明确指出与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性方面的具体优势，但在该过程的实施通常涉及到各种催化剂的使用。文本强调了在反应中利用金属基催化剂，包括钯铝氧化物（Pd-Al2O3）。文本承认与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战，特别是由于焦炭形成而影响催化剂活性的问题。为解决这些限制，可能的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂材料、优化反应条件以及探索可以承受更高温度或抗失活时间的催化剂支撑。研究方向可以集中在通过修改催化剂结构或组成来提高选择性，以增强丙烯生产同时减少副产品形成，如二氧化碳（CO2），从而改进过程。
