[1] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. This might be due to the rapid for- mation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[3] "The difference in the nature of surface oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O could also be the reason for the different catalytic performance observed in the ODH of propane over VOx/MCM-41 with O2 and N2O [13,14]."
[4] "This surprising difference could be related to the different redox potential of the active metal ions and/ or to the local pore environment, in which the latter are located."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The key advantage is that N2O leads to higher propene selectivity. This is because, unlike oxygen (O2), reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species with N2O is slower. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. Consequently, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed, leading to enhanced propene selectivity.

Various catalysts, particularly those containing vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous silica materials, perform well in ODHP processes. These catalysts offer high surface areas and dispersion of vanadium oxide sites, which increases propene selectivity compared to those with larger vanadium clusters. Tetrahedrally coordinated vanadium sites are generally more selective than octahedrally coordinated ones.

A significant challenge in ODHP processes is catalyst deactivation and instability. This can be addressed through research aimed at improving catalyst stability and selectivity. Strategies might include modifying catalyst composition, enhancing support materials, optimizing operating conditions, or developing new catalyst synthesis techniques. Understanding the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species can provide insights into how to tailor catalysts for better performance.

The redox potential of active metal ions and the local pore environment play a crucial role in determining the catalytic behavior of N2O in ODHP. Further research could focus on identifying these factors and how they influence the formation of active oxygen species. This knowledge could guide the development of more effective catalysts for practical implementation of N2O-ODHP processes.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸盐作为氧化剂具有以下优势，尤其是在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比。关键优势在于N2O能提供更高的丙烯选择性。这是因为与氧气（O2）不同，用N2O重新氧化还原的钒氧化物物种时，重新氧化过程较慢。这导致了活性氧原子层中活性氧原子浓度的降低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，进而提高了丙烯的选择性。

各种催化剂，特别是那些包含在多孔硅材料上的钒氧化物的催化剂，表现良好在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂提供了高表面积和分散的钒氧化物位点，相比于具有较大钒簇的催化剂，这增加了丙烯选择性。四面体配位的钒位点通常比八面体配位的位点更具有选择性。

ODHP过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性是一个重大挑战。可以通过改进催化剂稳定性、提高催化剂选择性来解决这一问题的研究策略包括修改催化剂组成、增强支撑材料、优化操作条件或开发新的催化剂合成技术。理解从O2和N2O重新氧化还原的还原钒氧化物种形成活性氧物种的性质可以提供指导如何定制催化剂以实现更好的性能。

活性金属离子的还原电势和局部孔环境对N2O在ODHP中的催化行为起着关键作用。进一步研究可以集中于识别这些因素以及它们如何影响活性氧物种的形成。这种知识可以指导开发更有效的催化剂用于N2O-ODHP过程的实际应用。
