[1] "Compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites."
[2] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. This might be due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[3] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[4] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."
[5] "Interestingly, the fact whether O species are formed from O2 or N2O seems to depend very much on the nature of the catalyst."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers certain advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. One key advantage is that N2O leads to a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which helps suppress consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thus improving propene selectivity. However, this advantage comes with the challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability. When N2O is used, the reaction likely proceeds through the formation of nucleophilic oxide ions, which are less reactive than the paramagnetic oxygen species formed upon reoxidation with O2. This results in higher propene selectivity but lower activity compared to using O2.

Various catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides (VOx) on mesoporous silica materials like MCM-41, have been employed in ODHP processes. These catalysts exhibit high surface areas and can provide a high dispersion of active surface VOx sites, leading to increased propene selectivity. However, the performance and selectivity can vary depending on the structure of VOx species, surface acid-base properties, and the nature of the oxidant used. For instance, when N2O is used, the catalysts tend to form nucleophilic oxide ions rather than paramagnetic oxygen species, affecting the reaction pathway and product distribution.

To address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and potentially make it more feasible for practical implementation, researchers could focus on developing catalysts that can efficiently utilize N2O while maintaining high propene selectivity. Strategies might include optimizing the structure and composition of the catalysts to facilitate the formation of reactive oxygen species, improving the stability of the catalysts under N2O conditions, and exploring the synergistic effects of multiple oxidants. Additionally, understanding the differences in oxygen species formation from O2 versus N2O could guide the design of catalysts that selectively promote desired reaction pathways, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and practicality of N2O-ODHP processes.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂具有某些优势。一个关键的优势是，与N2O相比，使用O2时，活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，这有助于抑制丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高丙烯选择性。然而，这种优势伴随着催化剂失活和稳定性的挑战。当使用N2O时，反应可能通过形成核给电子氧离子进行，这些离子的反应性低于在使用O2时形成的顺磁性氧物种，导致更高的丙烯选择性但更低的活性。

已使用多种催化剂，如包含范德华氧化物（VOx）的介孔硅材料（如MCM-41），在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂具有高比表面积，可以提供活性表面VOx位点的高度分散，从而增加丙烯选择性。然而，性能和选择性可能会根据VOx物种的结构、表面酸碱性质以及所使用的氧化剂的性质而变化。例如，当使用N2O时，催化剂倾向于形成核给电子氧离子而不是顺磁性氧物种，影响反应途径和产物分布。

为了应对N2O-ODHP的局限性和使其更适用于实际应用，研究者可以专注于开发能够有效利用N2O同时保持高丙烯选择性的催化剂。策略可能包括优化催化剂的结构和组成以促进反应性氧物种的形成，提高催化剂在N2O条件下的稳定性，并探索多种氧化剂的协同效应。此外，理解从O2到N2O形成的氧物种之间的差异可以指导设计既能促进所需反应途径又能增强N2O-ODHP过程整体效率的催化剂。
