[1] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[2] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
[3] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,21-23]."
[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[5] "In contrast, neither such paramagnetic Vn+  O site nor any other EPR-active oxygen radical species could be detected upon reoxidation of the same prereduced VOx/MCM-41 by N2O."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, and proposing strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation involves several key points.

1. **Advantages of N2O**: The document highlights that N2O can significantly improve propene selectivity over other oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), in the ODHP process. This improvement is attributed to the higher activity of the catalysts when using N2O, which leads to a better balance between the production of propene and the consumption of other products like carbon oxides.

2. **Catalysts Employed**: The document discusses the use of supported vanadium oxides (VOx) on mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41) as catalysts for ODHP. These materials offer high surface areas and potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites, contributing to enhanced propene selectivity compared to bulk vanadium oxides or iron-containing zeolites.

3. **Challenges**: A significant challenge is the deactivation and instability of catalysts during the ODHP process, particularly concerning the formation of active oxygen species that can react with propane and other hydrocarbons. The document suggests that the formation of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species with O2 can lead to lower propene selectivity, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species formed with N2O are more selective.

4. **Strategies and Research Directions**: To address the limitations of N2O-ODHP, researchers could focus on developing catalysts that maintain their stability and activity over multiple reaction cycles. This could involve modifying the catalyst composition or structure to reduce the formation of highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, studying the kinetics of the ODHP process with N2O could provide insights into optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design. The document also hints at the importance of understanding the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O, which could guide the development of more selective catalysts.

The proposed strategies emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in ODHP with N2O, including the role of active oxygen species and the impact of catalyst properties on product selectivity. Addressing these aspects could pave the way for more efficient and stable N2O-ODHP processes that are more feasible for practical implementation in industry.

分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的优势，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的优势，所使用的催化剂及其在该过程中面临的催化剂失活和稳定性问题的关键挑战，并提出解决这些问题并可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业应用策略的方向涉及几个关键点。

1.N2O的优点：文献指出，与分子氧（O2）等其他氧化剂相比，N2O可以显著提高ODHP过程中的丙烯选择性。这种改进归因于使用N2O时催化剂活性的增加，这导致了丙烯生产与碳氧化物消耗之间的更好平衡。

2. 所用催化剂：文献讨论了在MCM-41等多孔硅材料上负载的范德华氧化物（VOx）作为ODHP催化剂的使用。这些材料提供了高比表面积和潜在的表面VOx位点高度分散能力，与纯范德华氧化物或铁基沸石相比，有助于增强丙烯选择性。

3. 挑战：一个主要的挑战是催化剂在ODHP过程中的失活和不稳定性，特别是与从O2和N2O形成的活性氧物种有关的问题。文献表明，使用O2形成的高度反应性的亲电氧物种可能导致较低的丙烯选择性，而N2O形成的亲核氧物种则更为选择性。

4. 策略和研究方向：为解决N2O-ODHP的局限性，研究人员可以集中于开发保持其稳定性和活性的催化剂，以克服多个反应周期的问题。这可能包括通过修改催化剂组成或结构来减少高度反应性氧物种的形成。此外，研究N2O ODHP过程的热力学特性可以提供优化反应条件和催化剂设计的见解。文献也暗示了理解从O2和N2O形成的活性氧物种性质的重要性，这可以指导开发更选择性的催化剂。

提出的策略强调需要对ODHP中N2O的作用机制有更深入的理解，包括活性氧物种的作用以及催化剂性质对产物选择性的影响。解决这些问题可以铺平道路，使N2O-ODHP过程更高效且稳定，从而使其在工业应用中更具可行性。
