[1] "In contrast, the higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[2] "In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."
[3] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Unlike molecular oxygen (O2), N2O leads to a slower reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppression of consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides enhances propene selectivity. The formation of nucleophilic oxide ions from N2O is considered to be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in ODHP reactions over vanadium-based catalysts when N2O is used as an oxidant. 

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP include the potential for direct total oxidation of propane, especially when N2O and O2 are used as oxidants. Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing catalyst composition and structure, enhancing mass transport within the catalyst pores, and developing more selective oxygen species. Research directions might focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of oxygen species formation and reactivity, as well as exploring alternative catalyst materials and conditions that could improve propene selectivity while maintaining high activity.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸盐（N2O）提供了与其它氧化剂相比的优势，尤其是在丙烯选择性方面。与分子氧（O2）不同，N2O导致还原的钒氧化物物种的缓慢再氧化，从而产生较低的稳态活性氧原子位点浓度。这抑制了丙烯的连续氧化至碳氧化物，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。N2O生成的亲核氧化物离子被认为是使用N2O作为氧化剂时丙烷氧化反应中丙烯选择性较高的原因。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括在ODHP中直接氧化丙烷的可能性，特别是当使用N2O和O2作为氧化剂时。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成和结构、增强孔内物质传输以及开发更具有选择性的氧物种。研究方向可能集中在理解氧物种形成和活性的详细机制，以及探索能够提高丙烯选择性同时保持高活性的其他催化剂材料和条件。
