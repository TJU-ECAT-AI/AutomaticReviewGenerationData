The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive  catalytic route for  C3H6 production. In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable  energy source of  solar thermal energy  , thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2  for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500.

The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising catalytic pathway for the production of propylene (C3H6). By exploring various ways to utilize CO2 for the conversion of hydrocarbons with the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were performed for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius.
