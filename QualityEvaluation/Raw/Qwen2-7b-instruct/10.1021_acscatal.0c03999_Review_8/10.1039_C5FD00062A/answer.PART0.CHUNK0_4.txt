The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an advantageous process for producing propylene (C3H6). This process highlights the enhanced potential of propane compared to its lighter and heavier homologues, ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10), respectively. Thermodynamic calculations show that further cracking of propylene affects the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products. The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane is a significant factor. This study aims to explore the thermodynamics of using CO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane as a promising method for utilizing CO2, especially in conditions where solar thermal energy can be applied efficiently. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the system indicates that propane is the most suitable alkane for CO2 utilization under certain temperature conditions. Higher alkane homologues have a higher resistance to cracking, making propane the preferred choice for this process.

在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下，丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢化是生产丙烯（C3H6）的一种有优势的过程。这一过程凸显了丙烷与较轻和较重的同系物乙烷（C2H6）和丁烷（C4H10）相比的增强潜力。热力学计算显示，丙烯进一步裂解会影响最终产物的产量和选择性。CO2在脱氢化丙烷过程中的平衡位移是一个重要的因素。这项研究旨在探索使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢化方法的热力学，尤其是当太阳能热化学过程可以有效应用的温度条件下。系统中每个反应的吉布斯自由能（ΔG）表明，在特定温度条件下，丙烷是最适合用于CO2利用的烷烃。更高的烷烃同系物对裂解的抵抗力较高，使丙烷成为此过程的理想选择。
