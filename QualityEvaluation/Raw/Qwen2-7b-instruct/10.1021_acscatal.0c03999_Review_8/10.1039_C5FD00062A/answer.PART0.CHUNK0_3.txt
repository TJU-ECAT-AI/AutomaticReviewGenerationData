An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The of each reaction in our thermodynamic modelling of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicated that neither the reverse water gas shift nor the coke gasification with CO2 are favoured at 300-500.

The use of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) for dehydrogenation shows significant potential compared to its lighter (C2H6) and heavier (C4H10) homologues. This potential comes from both the activation of CO2 and the resistance against coking across the targeted temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. In the thermodynamic modeling of this process, it was found that neither the reverse water gas shift nor the coke gasification with CO2 are favored within this temperature range.

在300-500度的温度范围内，丙烷（C3H8）在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下进行脱氢具有显著潜力，与更轻的（C2H6）和更重的（C4H10）同系物相比。这种潜力来自于CO2的激活以及在这一温度范围内的焦化抵抗。在对这个过程的热力学建模中发现，在这个温度范围内，逆水煤气变换和与CO2的焦化都不是有利的。

The key finding is that propane (C3H8) offers superior potential compared to its lighter (C2H6) and heavier (C4H10) counterparts in terms of CO2 activation and resistance to coking within the 300-500 degree Celsius temperature range. The thermodynamic modeling of dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 suggests that neither the reverse water gas shift nor CO2-assisted coke formation are favored processes within this temperature bracket.

关键发现是，相对于其较轻的（C2H6）和较重的（C4H10）同系物而言，丙烷（C3H8）在300-500度的温度范围内，在CO2激活和焦化抵抗方面都显示出更大的潜力。在CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢的热力学建模表明，在这个温度区间内，逆水煤气转换和CO2辅助焦化都不是优选的反应路径。
