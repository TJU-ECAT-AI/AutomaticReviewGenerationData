[1] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[2] "The increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "The high thermo-stability of the present catalyst makes it attractive to scale-up to a moving bed or even a fluid bed reactor for catalyst regeneration."

1. The document highlights the superior potential of propane (C3H8) compared to its lighter (C2H6) and heavier (C4H10) homologues in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance within the temperature range of 300-500°C. This is advantageous for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation and reducing the coking effect on catalysts.
2. Increasing the partial pressure of propane leads to a significant enhancement of propylene (C3H6) selectivity in the dehydrogenation process. This is because competitive adsorption between the produced propylene and the inactivated propane molecules inhibits further cracking effects on propylene, thus preserving its selectivity.
3. The high thermal stability of the current catalyst is a crucial factor in enabling its scalability to larger-scale operations, such as moving bed or fluid bed reactors, facilitating catalyst regeneration processes.

1. 文档强调了丙烷（C3H8）相对于其较轻（C2H6）和较重（C4H10）同系物在300-500°C温度范围内的CO2激活和结焦抵抗方面的优势。这有利于在CO2作为温和氧化剂的情况下进行丙烷脱氢，从而推动产物形成并减少催化剂上的结焦。
2. 提高丙烷的分压对增强丙烯（C3H6）的选择性有显著益处。这是因为生成的丙烯与失活的丙烷分子之间的竞争吸附抑制了丙烯的进一步裂解效应，从而保持其选择性。
3. 当前催化剂的高热稳定性是实现其在移动床或流化床反应器等更大规模操作中的可扩展性以及催化剂再生过程的关键因素。
