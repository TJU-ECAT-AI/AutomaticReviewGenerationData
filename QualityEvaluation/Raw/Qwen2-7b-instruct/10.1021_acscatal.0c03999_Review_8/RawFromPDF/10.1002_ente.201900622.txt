Alkane Functionalization via Catalytic Oxychlorination:
Performance as a Function of the Carbon Number
Guido Zichittella, James Lüthi, Vladimir Paunovi´
c, and Javier Pérez-Ramírez*
Catalytic alkane oxychlorination has recently been demonstrated as attractive for
the selective conversion of natural gas into oleﬁns, which are pivotal com-
modities of the chemical industry. Herein, the oxychlorination of ethane, pro-
pane, and butane over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, and V), europium oxychloride,
titanium oxide, and cerium oxide is investigated to assess the role of the carbon
number on the reactivity and product distribution. Three categories of catalysts
are distinguished: systems showing the highest activity in the oxychlorination of
ethane CeO2, (VO)2P2O7, propane (EuOCl, FePO4, TiO2), or butane (Mn3(PO4)2).
All catalysts achieve high (70–95%) selectivity toward ethylene in ethane oxy-
chlorination, whereas they favor combustion and cracking pathways in the case
of propane and particularly of butane. Furthermore, the catalytic oxidation of
alkane and of HCl and alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination is assessed to ratio-
nalize the catalytic performance, revealing a linear correlation between the
reactivity of the catalysts and the ability of the material to evolve chlorine, which
weakens with increasing carbon number. In addition, the oleﬁn selectivity in
alkane oxychlorination is found to be driven by the rate of alkyl chloride dehy-
drochlorination and the propensity toward alkane cracking and combustion over
the catalysts, both increasing from ethane to butane.
1. Introduction
Vast conventional and unconventional natural-gas reserves are
rich in ethane, propane, and butane, offering a great potential
as feedstock to produce ethylene, propylene, and butylene,
the platform molecules for the manufacture of virtually all
chemicals, polymers, and fuels.[1–5] Currently, these oleﬁns are
predominantly manufactured via steam- and ﬂuid-catalytic crack-
ing of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogena-
tion of light alkanes.[1,6–9] Nevertheless, these technologies
are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated
as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry,
globally
consuming
around
3  1018 J
per
year.[10]
Conse-
quently, these processes are economical only at large scales in
centralized plants, which prevent the use of a signiﬁcant share
(≥30%) of the world’s natural-gas reserves
that are located in remote and scattered
areas due to their prohibitive shipping
costs.[2] It was predicted that the develop-
ment of exothermic, one-step, “on-purpose”,
selective alkane oxidation processes that can
be implemented in compact plants amena-
ble to decentralization would enable to
unlock this potential, resulting into enor-
mous economic beneﬁts.[11] In this direc-
tion,
various
routes,
including
partial
oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation
of light alkanes have been proposed and
extensively investigated in the last decades,
disclosing several catalytic systems, mainly
based on metal oxides.[12–19] Still, although
yields of up to 75% can be achieved in
ethane-to-ethylene processes, oleﬁn produc-
tion from propane and particularly butane
in these reactions remains signiﬁcantly
more limited, resulting in yields of ≤30%
due to side cracking and combustion path-
ways over typical catalytic systems, such as
alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and
multi-metal oxides.[12–14] This is most likely
due to the weaker C—H and C—C bonds in propane and espe-
cially butane (Figure 1),[20,21] which renders selectivity control a
great challenge. To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes
and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive
approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydro-
carbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pres-
sure.[2] Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents
and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halo-
gens,[22,23] dibromomethane,[24] and/or molten metal halides or
oxyhalides,[25,26] alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reac-
tion of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and
proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydro-
chlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach
to selectively (≤95%) generate oleﬁns from ethane and pro-
pane.[27–29] Intensive research efforts led to the discovery of efﬁ-
cient catalysts including ceria (CeO2) and nickel oxide–modiﬁed
CeO2 (NiO–CeO2), vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), titania
(TiO2), titanium silicon carbide composite (TiC–SiC), iron phos-
phate (FePO4), and europium oxychloride (EuOCl), reaching
ethylene and propylene yields of ≤90% and ≤55%, respectively,
at high (80–95%) oleﬁn selectivity.[27–31] Despite these results,
almost no studies have tackled butane oxychlorination. In essence,
only one patent describes a process for the production of
1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes
production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons

(butane, butene, and/or butadiene) over a Cu-based catalyst, and
no formation of oleﬁns was reported.[2] In addition, seminal work
has assessed the kinetics of ethane and propane oxychlorination
and the dehydrochlorination of the corresponding alkyl chlorides
in detail, particularly over a wide range of catalytic systems.[29,32]
This hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple
pathways in these reactions over different catalysts but also the
understanding of the impact of the alkane structure on this com-
plex oxychlorination reaction network.
In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on
the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorina-
tion of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over
metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2),
and cerium oxide (CeO2). The systematic evaluation of the oxy-
chlorination and oxidation of the alkanes, HCl oxidation, as well
as the dehydrochlorination of the alkyl chlorides enabled to
extract kinetic footprints, rationalizing the observed activity
and selectivity patterns as a function of the carbon number.
Characterization of the fresh and used catalysts revealed differ-
ences in structural stability that are dependent on the alkane
substrate.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Evaluation of Catalysts in Alkane Oxychlorination
2.1.1. Catalyst Characterization and Reactivity in Alkane
Oxychlorination
The EOC, POC, and BOC were investigated at atmospheric pres-
sure over phosphates of Fe (FePO4), Mn (Mn3(PO4)2), and
V ((VO)2P2O7), EuOCl, TiO2, and CeO2, which are known oxy-
chlorination catalysts.[27–29] The textural and structural properties
of the as-synthesized materials were assessed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and N2-sorption (Figure 2). The speciﬁc surface areas of
the catalysts were in the range of 12–34 m2 g1, with the only
exception of FePO4 that exhibited a lower surface area (5 m2 g1). The
XRD spectra of virtually all systems exhibited the reﬂections of
single phases, with the exception of Mn3(PO4)2 (Figure 2). In the
latter case, its diffractogram, in addition to β 0-Mn3(PO4)2, evi-
denced the presence of MnP4O11, MnP4, and non-stoichiometric
α-Mn0.98O2 phases. These materials were then evaluated in
EOC, POC, and BOC in a broad range of temperatures
(573–848 K) (Figure S1–S3, Supporting Information). The activ-
ity and product distribution were evaluated over the materials
equilibrated under the reaction environment for over 5 h to avoid
any potential inﬂuence from catalyst restructuring (vide infra).
The reaction rates expressed with respect to the mass of catalyst
(Equation (3)) and measured at 673 K under kinetically controlled
conditions (conversion <20%) reﬂected the activity differences
between the catalysts in all reactions investigated (Figure 3).
In particular, the oxychlorination activity could be ranked as fol-
lows in EOC: CeO2 > (VO)2P2O7 >> TiO2 > EuOCl > FePO4 
Mn3(PO4)2;
in
POC:
CeO2 > (VO)2P2O7 > TiO2 > EuOCl >
FePO4 >> Mn3(PO4)2;
and
in
BOC:
CeO2  (VO)2P2O7 >
TiO2 > Mn3(PO4)2 > EuOCl  FePO4.
Although
CeO2
and
(VO)2P2O7 were found to be the most reactive catalysts among
all systems and in all reactions, the relative activity of each cata-
lytic material changed as a function of the alkane (Figure 3).
Accordingly, three categories could be distinguished: systems
showing the highest activity in 1) EOC (CeO2 (VO)2P2O7);
2) POC (TiO2, EuOCl, FePO4); and 3) BOC (Mn3(PO4)2). When
comparing with the reaction rates based on the surface area of
the material (Equation (4)), differences were observed in the rela-
tive
order
between
the
catalysts
(Figure
S4,
Supporting
Information), although the identiﬁed categories remained unal-
tered. In particular, the oxychlorination activity was ranked
in EOC as: CeO2 > (VO)2P2O7 >> TiO2 > EuOCl > FePO4 >
Mn3(PO4)2; in POC as: FePO4 > (VO)2P2O7 > TiO2 > CeO2 >
EuOCl >> Mn3(PO4)2;
and
in
BOC
as:
(VO)2P2O7 >
CeO2 > Mn3(PO4)2 > TiO2 > EuOCl > FePO4.
Interestingly,
while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences
were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to pos-
sible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ
generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and
(VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra)
and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates,
which are not taken into account when considering a surface
area–based reaction rate.[27,29] Similar differences in rate-based
comparisons were observed in methane oxyhalogenation, where
gas-phase pathways are of signiﬁcant importance.[33,34] Still, the
aforementioned reaction rates do not necessarily express the
inherent catalyst activity. Rigorously, the latter is measured by
the turnover frequency (TOF), which however necessitates the
exact
knowledge
of
the
surface
density
of
active
sites.
Accordingly, any attempt to estimate this information for a
real-life polycrystalline material, will necessitate precise meas-
urements on the size, shape, structure, and speciation of the true
active sites at the reaction conditions, which, in addition
to changing dramatically among different types of systems

(e.g., metal oxides, phosphates, oxychlorides), represents one of
the greatest challenges in catalysis research today. Therefore,
despite not reﬂecting TOF in its core deﬁnition, the normaliza-
tion of the reaction rate with respect to the mass of the catalyst, its
volume, or its surface area represents a good approximation of
the inherent catalyst activity and is currently a widely accepted
approach in catalysis.[35] The latter is indeed useful as it 1) pro-
vides information on the productivity per unit of space or mass,
which is highly relevant for potential reactor and process design;
2) enables the kinetics comparison of different catalytic and
non-catalytic potential reactions; and 3) allows to compare dis-
tinct catalytic systems with very different properties. After 5 h
equilibration in EOC and POC, the X-ray diffractograms of
the catalysts exhibited no changes in the crystal structure of
all samples, with the only exception of Mn3(PO4)2, which partially
reduced to Mn2P2O7 (Figure 2). On the other hand, after 5 h
equilibration in BOC, almost all catalysts, excluding EuOCl
and (VO)2P2O7, evidenced material restructuring or reduction,
which in the case of Mn3(PO4)2 and FePO4 affected virtually
the full bulk structure. Finally, N2-sorption analysis indicated
partial sintering of the textural properties after the reactions
for all materials except for FePO4, which generally increased
from EOC till BOC.
2.1.2. Selectivity Patterns in Alkane Oxychlorination as a Function
of the Carbon Number
The product distribution over the catalysts was compared at 20%
alkane conversion (Figure 4, S1–S3, Supporting Information). In
particular, ﬁve classes of compounds were identiﬁed: 1) the
desired oleﬁn, 2) chlorocarbons, 3) cracking products that repre-
sent all hydrocarbons formed with a lower carbon number than
the starting alkane, 4) carbon oxides (COx; CO þ CO2), and
5) coke. Accordingly, the catalysts were ranked based on the selec-
tivity to the desired oleﬁn in EOC as: EuOCl (95%)  FePO4
(93%) > TiO2 (90%) > Mn3(PO4)2 (81%)  (VO)2P2O7 (80%) >>

(0%). Interestingly, a strong variability was observed as a function
of the alkane source. In essence, while virtually all catalysts selec-
tively (≥80%) produced the oleﬁn in EOC, a much wider range
of selectivity patterns (98–31% oleﬁn selectivity) was observed
in POC, whereas oleﬁn generation in BOC was found limited
(selectivity ≤66%) or even completely inhibited. Consequently,
cracking and combustion pathways were found signiﬁcant in
POC over TiO2, Mn3(PO4)2, (VO)2P2O7, and CeO2, and particu-
larly in BOC over all the investigated systems. Furthermore, while
chlorocarbons were mainly produced in EOC and only little in
POC, limited coking was only observed in BOC, which might
be due to further transformation of generated chlorocarbons in
this reaction, which are known coke precursors and their chemical
and/or thermal stability generally decreases with increasing car-
bon number.[32,36] In BOC, both 1-C4H8 and 2-C4H8 compounds
were observed at the reactor outlet, typical products also of catalytic
dehydrogenation
and
oxidative
dehydrogenation,[1,14]
whose
molar 2-C4H8:1-C4H8 ratio varied between 1.1 (Mn3(PO4)2) and
2.5 (EuOCl); however, no butadiene (C4H6) was detected after
the reaction (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Finally, we have
assessed the oleﬁn selectivity as a function of the alkane con-
version in EOC, POC, and BOC over the catalysts, which was
varied by adjusting the reaction temperature (Figure 5, S1–S3,
Supporting Information). Interestingly, the selectivity to the oleﬁn
remained rather constant or increased in EOC, until all systems
exhibited selective (75–95%) oleﬁn generation at high (40–75%)
alkane conversion. In POC, instead, three regions could be iden-
tiﬁed at moderate (20–60%) propane conversion based on the
production of propylene: 1) highly (≥95%; EuOCl, FePO4),
2) moderately (45–67%; TiO2, CeO2, Mn3(PO4)2), and 3) poorly
(30%; (VO)2P2O7) selective systems. Finally, in BOC, all catalysts
exhibited decreasing oleﬁn generation at moderate (20–60%)
butane conversion, and ranged from intermediate (40–66% selec-
tivity; FePO4, EuOCl, CeO2) until low (0–15% selectivity; TiO2,
Mn3(PO4)2, (VO)2P2O7). These results indicate that the product
distribution is primarily a function of the alkane substrate,
whereas the catalyst plays a lesser role particularly in EOC and
in BOC, where all systems exhibited good and poor performance,
respectively. Still, in POC, a wider distribution of catalytic behav-
iors was observed, suggesting that the intermediate reactivity of
propane and its derivatives can allow for stark differentiations
among catalyst performance, which is an important factor that
can facilitate the studying of material properties and/or reaction
networks.[29] To generalize these ﬁndings, we have calculated
the distribution of selectivity patterns in EOC, POC, and BOC
(Figure 6) in which the mean corresponds to the arithmetical
average of the selectivity to a certain class of products (oleﬁns,
chlorocarbons, cracking, COx, coke) determined at 20% alkane
conversion, as shown in Figure 4, whereas the variance (contour)
accounts for the differences in performance obtained over distinct
catalysts. Accordingly, this ﬁgure gives an overall perspective on
how the product distribution changes as a function of the alkane
substrate. In particular, oleﬁn production on average decreases
going from EOC, to POC (although more variable), and ﬁnally
to BOC, at the expenses of an increase in the generation of

(e.g., 1-C4H8, 2-C4H8) and chlorocarbons (e.g., 1-C4H9Cl, 2-C4H9Cl) with
the same carbon number of the reactant, respectively, whereas cracking
products (e.g., C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CH3Cl) represent all the hydrocarbons
formed with a lower carbon number than the starting alkane. Reaction con-
ditions: alkane:HCl:O2:Ar:He ¼ 6:6:3:4.5:80.5, FT:Wcat ¼ 6000 cm3 h1 gcat

cracking products and especially COx. In contrast, generation of
chlorocarbons and of coke is on average limited. This overview
suggests that while ethane and propane can be ideal substrates
for oleﬁn production as long as a selective catalyst is provided,
especially in POC, the high reactivity of butane and/or its deriv-
atives hampers the selective generation of the oleﬁn via oxychlori-
nation chemistry.
2.2. Rationalization of the Catalytic Performance in Alkane
Oxychlorination
2.2.1. Rationalization of the Reactivity in Alkane Oxychlorination
Previous kinetic analyses in EOC and POC over FePO4, EuOCl,
and CeO2-based catalysts have given strong insights on the mech-
anism of these reactions that mainly proceeds via catalytic
generation of the alkyl chloride and its subsequent dehydrochlo-
rination into the oleﬁn,[27,29,31,32] as schematized in Figure 7.
Furthermore, this reaction mechanism was proven for FePO4
in EOC in a recent study, which uncovered the bifunctionality
of this catalyst at a mechanistic level, thus disclosing the iron site
responsible for alkane activation and its chlorine-modiﬁed coun-
terpart that allows to dehydrochlorinate the alkyl chloride.[28] No
kinetic analysis of BOC has been reported to date, although the
formation chlorobutanes and their subsequent dehydrochlorina-
tion is plausible based on the knowledge gathered from EOC and
POC. Still, the direct catalytic dehydrogenation of the alkane
cannot be excluded especially when moving from ethane until
butane, although this route has generally been shown negligible
in oxyhalogenation chemistry.[28,29] Nevertheless, the alkyl chlo-
ride could also be formed by the non-catalytic reaction of the
alkane with Cl2, which can be generated over the catalyst surface
Figure 6. Contour of product distribution in EOC, POC, and BOC deter-
mined at 20% alkane conversion, as shown in Figure 4, illustrating how
selectivity patterns change on average with increasing carbon number. The
center of the distribution corresponds to the arithmetical average of the sele-
ctivity to product j in a speciﬁc reaction over all catalysts, whereas the vari-
ance (contour) accounts for the differences among the distinct catalysts.

by the reaction of HCl and O2 (Figure 7), as observed over
several alkane oxyhalogenation systems.[27,29] If Cl2 is produced
during alkane oxychlorination, it will react in the gas-phase with
the alkane, because the onset of these non-catalytic reactions
is at much lower temperatures than that of EOC, POC, or
BOC.[28,29,32,37] This route, however, is not desired as it promotes
unselective pathways, including polyhalogenation and coking
(Figure 7) as well as cracking and combustion, as demonstrated
in ethane oxybromination over FePO4 and observed in propane
oxybromination over europium oxybromide (EuOBr).[28,32] Still,
regardless of the pathway to generate the alkyl chloride, the cata-
lyst surface needs to evolve chlorine in the form of alkyl chloride
and/or Cl2 for the reaction to proceed. Consequently, we evalu-
ated the catalysts in the oxidation of HCl to Cl2 to assess the cat-
alyst ability to evolve chlorine (Figure 8a). The activity in this
reaction was ranked
in the order CeO2 > (VO)2P2O7 >>
TiO2 > EuOCl > FePO4  Mn3(PO4)2. Furthermore, the temper-
ature at which 10% of HCl is converted in HCl oxidation,
T10(HCl), was taken as a quantitative measure of the propensity
of the catalyst to evolve chlorine, which is high if the value of this
extracted parameter is low. This temperature was found to

ways. The former ones involve the surface-catalyzed alkyl chloride genera-
tion (black arrow) and its consequent dehydrochlorination to the
corresponding oleﬁn (light blue arrow), alkane cracking (blue arrow)
and combustion (red arrow), as well as the oxidation of HCl to Cl2 (green
arrow). The latter can react with the alkane in the gas phase (dark red
arrow) during alkane oxychlorination, leading to the formation of chloro-
carbons and coke.
Figure 8. a) Yield of Cl2 in HCl oxidation as a function of temperature over the catalysts. From this analysis, a kinetic parameter, corresponding to the
temperature at which 10% of HCl is converted into Cl2, T10(HCl), is extracted as a descriptor of the ability of the catalysts to evolve chlorine. This
parameter was correlated to the rate of alkane consumption at 673 K in the catalytic oxychlorination of b) EOC, c) POC, and d) BOC. Reaction conditions:
a) HCl:O2:Ar:He ¼ 6:3:4.5:86.5, T ¼ 653–953 K; b–d) alkane:HCl:O2:Ar:He ¼ 6:6:3:4.5:80.5, T ¼ 623 K; In all cases, FT:Wcat ¼ 6000 cm3 h1 gcat

correlate linearly with the rate of alkane consumption in EOC,
POC, and BOC at 673 K (Figure 8b–d), indicating that the evolu-
tion of chlorine from the catalyst surface is a pivotal aspect in the
mechanism of alkane oxychlorination, and in agreement with
previous studies on the importance of halogen evolution in oxy-
halogenation reactions.[28,29,34] Still, differences were observed as
a function of the alkane substrate. In particular, the slope of the
linear correlation was found to decrease from the one obtained in
EOC until that in BOC (Figure 8b–d), indicating that the catalyst
reactivity in oxychlorination becomes less dependent on its abil-
ity to evolve chlorine when going from two until four carbon
atoms. Interestingly, the coefﬁcient of determination (R2) was
found high in the correlation obtained for EOC (0.98) and for
POC (0.97), whereas it was lower for that of BOC (0.90). This
might suggest that while in the former reactions the generation
of the oleﬁn via alkyl chloride production and consecutive
dehydrogenation is likely the dominant mechanism over all
investigated catalysts, in BOC, other pathways that comprise
the direct production of the oleﬁn might start to gain signiﬁcance
in the complex oxychlorination reaction network. Furthermore,
since the oxidation of HCl to Cl2 proceeds over a redox couple,[2]
these observed differences might also be related to the distinct
redox properties of the catalysts. As a matter of fact, systems with
the strongest oxidizing character, as in the case of CeO2 and
(VO)2P2O7, resulted in the highest reactivity in all oxychlorina-
tion reactions, whereas mild oxidizers such as FePO4 and
Mn3(PO4)2 exhibited the lowest. However, if a material exhibits
too strong redox properties, as in the case of CeO2, it can favor
the evolution of Cl2 in the oxychlorination reaction medium. The
latter can react with the alkane in the gas phase, and the reaction
will be at least partially no longer surface-controlled. Moreover,
a too strong oxidizing potential is also not desired as it might sup-
port the combustion of the alkane (vide infra). Accordingly, an
optimally active oxychlorination catalyst should exhibit moderate
redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not
favor evolution of Cl2 as well as alkane over-oxidation.
2.2.2. Rationalization of the Selectivity Patterns in Alkane
Oxychlorination
To rationalize the selectivity patterns observed in EOC, POC,
and BOC, all the catalysts were investigated in the dehydrochlo-
rination of C2H5Cl (Figure 9a,d, and S5, Supporting Informa-
tion), C3H7Cl (Figure 9b,e, and S6, Supporting Information),
and C4H9Cl (Figure 9 and S7, Supporting Information)
in the presence of HCl and O2 as well as in the oxidation of
C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10. The former reactions show the
ability of the catalytic systems to produce the oleﬁn as soon
as alkyl chloride is present in a reaction medium containing
HCl and O2. The reactivity of the systems was ranked in
C2H5Cl dehydrochlorination as: EuOCl  TiO2 >> FePO4 

chlorination as: CeO2 > EuOCl  FePO4 > Mn3(PO4)2 > TiO2 >
(VO)2P2O7; and in C4H9Cl dehydrochlorination as: EuOCl 
FePO4  Mn3(PO4)2  (VO)2P2O7  CeO2 > TiO2. Notably, sig-
niﬁcant activity differences were observed among the catalysts
when C2H5Cl was reacted, which decreased when switching
to C3H7Cl substrate until reaching almost no performance
distinctions in C4H9Cl dehydrochlorination. Furthermore, we
have compared the product distribution obtained in the dehydro-
chlorination of C2H5Cl (Figure 9d), C3H7Cl (Figure 9e), and
C4H9Cl (Figure 9f) in the presence of HCl and O2 and at
90% alkyl chloride conversion. Similar to the trends observed
in the reactivity, the most differences in selectivity patterns
among the catalysts were detected in C2H5Cl dehydrochlorina-
tion, in which the substrate was also converted to other chloro-
carbons (e.g., C2H4Cl2, C2H3Cl), cracking products (CH4), or
COx, whereas in C3H7Cl, and particularly C4H9Cl dehydrochlo-
rination, the alkyl chloride was transformed almost exclusively
into the corresponding oleﬁn over all systems investigated.
Therefore, to quantitatively assess these trends, the temperature
at which 20% yield of oleﬁn is obtained, T20(DeHCl), was taken
as a measure of the catalyst propensity to generate the alkene via
alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination when HCl and O2 are present
in the reaction medium, which is high if the value of this
extracted parameter is low (Figure 9a–c). Furthermore, it is note-
worthy to mention that C4H9Cl dehydrochlorination mainly
resulted in the formation of 2-C4H8 (80–95% selectivity) with
minor amounts of 1-C4H8 over all investigated systems, in agree-
ment with the product distribution observed in BOC over EuOCl
and FePO4 that favored 2–C4H8 formation (molar 2-C4H8:
1-C4H8 of 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) (Figure 4 and 9, S3, S7,
Supporting Information). Still, over the other catalysts, and par-
ticularly over Mn3(PO4)2, the formation of these two oleﬁns was
roughly comparable in BOC (molar 2-C4H8:1-C4H8 ¼ 1.1–1.5)
(Figure S3, Supporting Information) in contrast to the high
molar 2-C4H8:1-C4H8 ratios obtained in butyl chloride dehydro-
chlorination (Figure S7, Supporting Information) (≤21.7), sug-
gesting that direct oleﬁn-generation pathways might be of
relevance in the overall reaction network over these systems,
as speculated in the previous section, rationalizing the reactivity
trends. To summarize these results and correlate them to alkane
oxychlorination, we have plotted the selectivity to COx and crack-
ing products obtained at 20% alkane conversion over all sys-
tems in EOC, POC, and BOC as a function of the catalyst
ability to dehydrochlorinate the intermediate alkyl halide in
the
presence
of
HCl
and
O2,
T20(DeHCl)
(Figure
10).
Accordingly, each reaction describes a distinct area, and their
position along the x and y axes indicates the propensity to form
the oleﬁn via alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination and the ten-
dency toward cracking (bottom) and combustion (top), respec-
tively. In particular, EOC is represented by a ﬂat and wide
region on the middle-right of the plot, indicating that while crack-
ing and combustion pathways are limited, the catalysts can be
mainly differentiated based on their ability to form ethylene
via ethyl chloride dehydrochlorination, representing the selectiv-
ity-determining pathway in EOC. Previous studies on dehydro-
chlorination of dichloroethane over EuOCl have shown that
surface acidity of the catalyst might be a relevant descriptor
for this reaction pathway.[38] However, this was not demonstrated
for a series of catalysts with very distinct nature as well as prop-
erties. In contrast, POC describes a taller and thinner area than
that of EOC around the center of the plot, whereas BOC is rep-
resented by an even taller and thinner region on the very left of
the panel. This indicates that the catalysts cannot longer be dif-
ferentiated based on their dehydrochlorination ability but rather
on their tendency to crack and combust the alkane in POC and

especially BOC, which is likely related to the materials redox
properties as previously anticipated. Accordingly, this shift in
the selectivity-determining pathway can be attributed to the
higher reactivity of the alkanes and their corresponding alkyl
chlorides when increasing the carbon number, which tend more
toward cracking and combustion and to dehydrochlorination
pathways, respectively.
Consequently, ethane (Figure 11a,d, S8, Supporting Informa-

was used to probe the tendency of the catalytic systems toward
alkane cracking and combustion in an oxidative environment.
The reactivity of the systems was ranked in C2H6 oxidation
as:
CeO2  (VO)2P2O7 > EuOCl  TiO2 > Mn3(PO4)2 > FePO4;
in C3H8 oxidation as: CeO2  (VO)2P2O7 > EuOCl  TiO2 >
Mn3(PO4)2 > FePO4; and in C4H10 oxidation as: CeO2 
(VO)2P2O7  TiO2 > FePO4  EuOCl  Mn3(PO4)2. Interestingly,
these rankings counter-correlate on average the order of catalysts
in EOC, POC, and BOC based on the oleﬁn selectivity (Figure 4),
with the only exception of EuOCl that showed an intermediate
activity, indicating that a mild oxidizing potential is preferred
to attain a high oleﬁn selectivity in oxychlorination. Similar to
alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination, stronger differences in reac-
tivity were observed in C2H6 oxidation that decreased in C3H8
and particularly in C4H10 oxidation. Additionally, also mild oxi-
dizers as EuOCl, Mn3(PO4)2, and FePO4 showed relatively high
activity in C4H10 oxidation, especially at high temperatures
(≥850 K). This might suggest that to selectively activate C4H10
in strong oxidative environments, the use of even milder oxidiz-
ing systems, which does not contain oxygen within their crystal
structure, is likely a more effective strategy, as recently demon-
strated by the discovery of carbon nanotubes, a Ti3AlC2 MAX
phase, and boron nitrides as efﬁcient catalytic materials.[39–41]
In addition, we have compared the product distribution obtained
at 10% alkane conversion in the oxidation of C2H6 (Figure 11d),
C3H8 (Figure 11e), and C4H10 (Figure 11f). Interestingly, the
majority of the catalysts showed moderate formation (30–60%
selectivity) of COx in C2H6 oxidation, which increased in the
case of C3H8, and particularly C4H10 oxidation, where COx were
virtually the only product observed (95–100% selectivity) over
FePO4, TiO2, (VO)2P2O7, and CeO2. In contrast, no cracking
was observed under these conditions in C2H6 oxidation, whereas
in C3H8 oxidation, only Mn3(PO4)2 showed the formation of
lower
hydrocarbons
(C2H4 þ CH4;
38%
selectivity),
which
increased in C4H10 oxidation (C3H6 þ C2H4 þ CH4; 83% selec-
tivity),
followed
by
the
performance
of
EuOCl
(C3H6 þ
C2H4 þ CH4; 38% selectivity). Interestingly, these observations
correlate with the selectivity patterns observed in EOC, POC,
and BOC (Figure 4), indicating that a high oleﬁn selectivity in
oxychlorination might be a function of the ability of the catalyst
to disfavor alkane cracking and combustion. Therefore, to quan-
tify this property, the selectivity toward the sum of cracking prod-
ucts, Scrack(ODH), and the selectivity to COx, SCOx(ODH), in
alkane oxidation, were taken as a relative measure of the catalyst
propensity toward alkane cracking and combustion under oxi-
dative conditions, respectively. The sum of these two parame-
ters was summarized in a contour plot together with the catalyst
propensity to generate the alkene via alkyl chloride dehydro-
chlorination when HCl and O2 are present in the reaction
medium, T20(DeHCl), to correlate these properties with the
oleﬁn selectivity in alkane oxychlorination (Figure 12). Three
distinct areas were identiﬁed: 1) one wide and positioned in
the top part of the panel (EOC); 2) one narrower and positioned
in the middle right (POC); and 3) one very narrow and
positioned in the bottom right (BOC). The position of the area,
and speciﬁcally its y coordinate, indicates the ability of the cata-
lysts to generate the oleﬁn via alkyl chloride dehydrochlorina-
tion when HCl and O2 are present in the reaction medium
(higher toward the bottom of the panel), while its x coordinate
shows the propensity of the catalytic systems to crack and com-
bust the alkane (higher toward the right of the panel).
Furthermore, the width of a certain area deﬁnes the variability
among different catalytic systems at constant carbon number.
Consequently, the area of EOC was found to lay at the top of the
panel, indicating that the oleﬁn formation from C2H5Cl is the
most
kinetically
challenging
dehydrochlorination
reaction
among that of C3H7Cl and particularly of C4H9Cl, as shown
by the middle and low positions of the POC and BOC areas,
respectively. In contrast, all the catalysts denoting the EOC area,
with the only exception of CeO2, were generally found at equal
or lower x coordinates, compared with the area of POC and at
signiﬁcantly lower ones to that of BOC, showing that these sys-
tems have a much milder tendency to combust and/or crack
propane
and
particularly
ethane
compared
with
butane.
Finally, EOC depicted a much wider area to that of POC and
especially of BOC, showing that the catalytic performance in
alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination and alkane combustion
and cracking varies signiﬁcantly among different catalysts with
ethane and ethyl chloride. In contrast, the differences among
distinct systems decreased with C3-derived substrates until
becoming almost negligible in the butane-based chemistry,
indicating that, within these investigated catalysts, altering
the nature of the catalytic material has a limited effect on the
performance, especially in BOC. Accordingly, it can be con-
cluded that while in EOC a high (≥90%) oleﬁn selectivity
can be achieved if the catalysts show a high rate of C2H5Cl
dehydrochlorination, as for EuOCl, FePO4, and TiO2, in POC

extracted from Figure 9.

the selectivity-determining pathway becomes the ability of the
material to crack and/or combust propane, which is low with
mild oxidizers as EuOCl and FePO4. Finally, in BOC, the high
propensity toward butane cracking and combustion of the cata-
lysts limits the selective oleﬁn generation via oxychlorination,
suggesting that efﬁcient butylene production would necessitate
either alternative catalytic materials with much milder oxidizing
potential or a different chemistry.
3. Conclusions
We performed the ﬁrst comprehensive assessment of the
EOC, POC, and BOC over phosphates of iron (FePO4), manga-
nese (Mn3(PO4)2), and vanadium ((VO)2P2O7), oxychloride of
europium (EuOCl), and oxides of titanium (TiO2) and cerium
(CeO2), revealing stark differences in the catalytic performance
as a function of the carbon number. In terms of reactivity, the

catalysts could be distinguished into three categories: systems
showing the highest activity in the oxychlorination of: 1) ethane
(CeO2, (VO)2P2O7); 2) propane (EuOCl, FePO4, TiO2); or
3) butane (Mn3(PO4)2). In contrast, the product distribution
was mainly centered toward ethylene in EOC (70–95% selectivity),
whereas oleﬁn selectivity decreased on average in POC (40–95%)
and especially BOC (0–65%) in favor of combustion and cracking
products. XRD of the systems prior to and after reaction revealed
that virtually all materials retained their crystal structure upon
exposure to EOC and POC, whereas catalyst restructuring
or reduction was observed over CeO2, Mn3(PO4)2, TiO2, and
FePO4 after BOC. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive
kinetic analysis of the dehydrochlorination of ethyl, propyl, and
butyl chloride as well as of the oxidation of HCl, ethane, propane,
and butane over all systems investigated to rationalize the cata-
lytic performance as a function of the alkane. This revealed a
linear correlation between the reactivity of the catalysts and
the ability of the material to evolve chlorine, which was found
to be the strongest in EOC and decreased in POC and particularly
BOC. Furthermore, the oleﬁn selectivity in alkane oxychlorina-
tion was shown to be a function of both the rate of alkyl chloride
dehydrochlorination and the propensity toward alkane cracking
and combustion over the catalysts—both increasing with the car-
bon number. In essence, while in EOC, the ethylene selectivity
was mainly driven by the catalytic ethyl chloride dehydrochlori-
nation because the catalysts were little active in ethane oxidation,
the oleﬁn production in POC and especially BOC was primarily
determined by the tendency of the catalysts to combust and/or
crack the alkane, which was found on average moderate for
propane and particularly enhanced in the case of butane.
4. Experimental Section
Catalyst Preparation and Characterization: Commercial CeO2 (Sigma–
Aldrich, nanopowder, 99.9%) and TiO2 (Sigma–Aldrich, rutile nano-
powder, 99.5%) were calcined in static air at 1173 and 873 K, respectively,
prior to their use in the catalytic tests. EuOCl was prepared via a two-step
synthesis. First, the Eu2O3 precursor was obtained by dissolving
Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (ABCR, 99.9%) in de-ionised water, and by adding
H2O2 (Acros Organics, 35 wt%) to attain a molar H2O2:Eu ratio of 3.
The obtained solution was precipitated by drop-wise addition of aqueous
NH4OH (Sigma–Aldrich, 25 vol%) until a pH of 10.5. The slurry was
stirred for 4 h. The precipitate was separated by ﬁltration, washed with
de-ionised water, dried at 373 K for 12 h, and calcined in static air. In
the second step, the obtained Eu2O3 was transformed into EuOCl by
treatment in a concentrated HCl-containing stream (25 ml standard
temperature and pressure (STP) min1 comprising HCl:O2:Ar:He ¼
30:15:22.7:32.5 molar ratio) at 773 K for 4 h. Manganese phosphate
(Mn3(PO4)2) was synthesized by mixing an aqueous solution of
MnCl2·4H2O (Merck, ≥97%) with H3PO4 at a molar P:Mn ratio of 2,
and stirred for 4 h. The obtained solution was precipitated by drop-wise
addition of aqueous NH4OH (Sigma–Aldrich, 25 vol%) until neutral
pH. The precipitate were separated by ﬁltration, washed with de-ionized
water, dried at 373 K in vacuum (50 mbar) for 12 h, and calcined in static
air. Vanadium phosphate ((VO)2P2O7) was prepared by reﬂuxing a
suspension of V2O5 (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.5%) in isobutanol (Acros
Organics, 99%) and benzyl alcohol (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) for 3 h. After
cooling down to room temperature, H3PO4 (Sigma–Aldrich, 85%) was
added to attain a molar P:V ratio of 1.2, and the mixture was then reﬂuxed
for another 16 h. The resulting solid was recovered by ﬁltration, washed
with isobutanol and methanol (Fluka, 99.9%), dried in vacuum (50 mbar)
at 373 K for 12 h, and thermally activated in ﬂowing N2. FePO4 was syn-
thesized by mixing an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma–
Aldrich, 99%) and NH4H2PO4 (Acros Organics, 99%) in a molar P:Fe ratio
of 1 for 2 h, followed by drying in vacuum (50 mbar) at 373 K for 12 h and
calcination in ﬂowing air for 10 h. All thermal treatments were conducted
at 873 K for 5 h using a heating rate of 5 K min1, unless speciﬁed
otherwise.
N2 sorption at 77 K was performed in a Micromeritics TriStar II
analyzer. Samples (0.25 g) were evacuated to 50 mbar at 573 K for
12 h prior to the measurement. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method was applied to calculate the speciﬁc surface area, SBET. Powder
XRD was measured in a PANalytical X’Pert PRO–MPD diffractometer
with Bragg–Brentano geometry by applying Ni-ﬁltered Cu Kα radiation
(γ ¼ 1.54060 Å). The data were recorded in the 10–70 2θ range with
an angular step size of 0.017 and a counting time of 0.51 s step1.

ambient pressure in a continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed reactor setup described
elsewhere.[27] Brieﬂy, the gases: C2H6 (PanGas, purity 3.5), C3H8 (PanGas,

He (PanGas, purity 5.0; carrier gas) were fed using digital mass–ﬂow con-
trollers (Bronkhorst) to the mixing unit equipped with a pressure indicator,
whereas 1-C3H7Cl (Sigma–Aldrich, 98%) and 2-C4H9Cl (Fluka, >98%)
were dosed using a syringe pump (Nexus 6000, Chemyx) with a water-
cooled glass syringe (Hamilton, 1 cm3) coupled to a vaporizer operated
at 348 K. A quartz reactor (internal diameter, di ¼ 8 mm) was loaded with
the catalyst (weight, Wcat ¼ 1 g; particle size, dp ¼ 0.4–0.6 mm), and
placed in a homemade electrical oven. A K-type thermocouple ﬁxed
in a coaxial quartz thermowell with the tip positioned in the center of
the catalyst bed was used to monitor the temperature during the
reaction. Prior to testing, the bed was heated in a He ﬂow to the desired
