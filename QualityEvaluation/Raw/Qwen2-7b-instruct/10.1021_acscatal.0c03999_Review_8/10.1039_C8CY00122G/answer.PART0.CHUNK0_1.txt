[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The change in the alkane substrate also revealed an influence in both the activity and the product distribution (Fig. 1)."
[3] "Catalysts characterisation The porosity of the samples after catalytic evaluation was assessed by N2 sorption analysis (Table 2)."
[4] "In the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination (Figs. 7b, 7d),which explains the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of EOB and POB (Figs. 2, 3)."
[5] "Still, the isomer shift of Eu2+ (Table S1) was lower than that observed for EuBr2 (-12.97 mm s-1),27 indicating the higher iconicity of the Eu2+ species present in EuOBr after POB."
[6] "In the case of ethyl chloride, the yield of ethylene (60%) was much higher than that of dichloroethane (20%),indicating that the dehydrochlorination pathways are preferred to the polychlorination routes."
[7] "In the dehydrohalogenation of the propyl halides, propylene and carbon oxides were the only products detected (Figs. 9b, 9d)."
[8] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."
[9] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[10] "A detailed kinetic evaluation of the oxyhalogenation,halogenation,and oxidative dehydrogenation of the alkanes together with the dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides provided insights on the preferred reaction paths governing the different selectivity trends in alkane oxyhalogenation."

The document discusses the use of europium oxychloride (EuOCl) and europium oxybromide (EuOBr) in the oxyhalogenation of ethane and propane. It highlights the differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type. The N2 sorption analysis reveals the textural properties of the catalysts post-catalytic evaluation. It also mentions the formation of bromine in the oxybromination process at lower temperatures compared to oxychlorination, which influences the product distribution. The document further explores the role of europium species (Eu2+ and Eu3+) in the catalytic activity. It analyzes the preference for dehydrochlorination over polychlorination in ethyl chloride and the exclusive detection of propylene and carbon oxides in the dehydrohalogenation of propyl halides. It emphasizes the formation of olefins in oxychlorination and bromocarbons in oxybromination. The study provides insights into the preferred reaction pathways governing the different selectivity trends in alkane oxyhalogenation.
