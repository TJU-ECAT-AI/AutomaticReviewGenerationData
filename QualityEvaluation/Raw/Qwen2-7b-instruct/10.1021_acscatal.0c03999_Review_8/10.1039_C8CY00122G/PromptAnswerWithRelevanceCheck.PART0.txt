[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "In contrast, the catalysts were virtually inactive in ODH reactions in the temperature window of oxyhalogenation, and the products detected were mainly carbon oxides with selectivity values ranging from 60% to 100%."
[3] "On the other hand, EuOCl was inactive in HCl oxidation, and, therefore, no Cl2 can be generated under oxychlorination conditions."
[4] "Once the alkyl halide is formed,it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form the corresponding olefin or further halogenation to polyhalocarbons along with the possible occurrence of cracking and combustion reactions."
[5] "In the case of ethyl chloride, the yield of ethylene (60%) was much higher than that of dichloroethane (20%),indicating that the dehydrochlorination pathways are preferred to the polychlorination routes."
[6] "In the dehydrohalogenation of the propyl halides, propylene and carbon oxides were the only products detected."
[7] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) faces several challenges, including catalyst deactivation and stability issues. The document does not specifically discuss N2O-ODHP, but provides insights into the process of alkane oxyhalogenation over europium oxyhalide catalysts, which might offer parallels to the challenges encountered in N2O-ODHP. Key points include:

1. The investigation of ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over europium oxychloride (EuOCl) and europium oxybromide (EuOBr) reveals significant differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type. For instance, oxychlorination tends to lead to olefin generation, while oxybromination favors the formation of bromocarbons.

2. The catalysts are largely inactive in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions within the oxyhalogenation temperature window. The products detected are predominantly carbon oxides with selectivity ranging from 60% to 100%.

3. EuOCl is unresponsive to hydrogen chloride (HCl) oxidation, preventing Cl2 generation under oxychlorination conditions. This highlights the importance of the halide type in determining the reaction pathway.

4. Once an alkyl halide is formed, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to produce the corresponding olefin or undergo further halogenation leading to polyhalocarbons, along with possible cracking and combustion reactions.

5. For ethyl chloride, dehydrochlorination pathways are favored over polychlorination routes, resulting in a higher yield of ethylene compared to dichloroethane.

6. In the case of propyl halides, only propylene and carbon oxides are detected, indicating that propylene is the primary product.

7. Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination predominantly leads to olefin generation, while oxybromination favors the formation of bromocarbons.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more practical option, researchers could focus on developing more stable and active catalysts capable of maintaining efficiency over longer periods. They might also investigate the effects of modifying reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, or the presence of co-catalysts, to optimize propylene selectivity and reduce the formation of unwanted byproducts. Further research could explore the integration of advanced catalyst recycling or regeneration techniques to mitigate deactivation and extend catalyst life. Additionally, the development of more robust and selective dehydrogenation pathways could enhance the overall efficiency and economic viability of N2O-ODHP processes.

在使用硝酸氧化剂（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂时，面临催化剂失活和稳定性问题。文档并未专门讨论N2O-ODHP，而是提供了对使用铕氧卤化物催化剂进行烷烃氧卤化反应的研究，这可能为N2O-ODHP过程中遇到的挑战提供一些相似点。关键点包括：

1. 对于乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化反应，分别使用铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）和铕氧溴化物（EuOBr）进行了研究，发现卤素类型对活性和产物分布有显著影响。例如，氧氯化反应倾向于产生烯烃，而氧溴化反应更倾向于形成溴代化合物。

2. 催化剂在氧卤化反应的温度窗口内的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中基本无效。检测到的主要产物是碳氧化物，其选择性范围从60%到100%。

3. EuOCl对于氢氯（HCl）氧化反应无响应，因此无法在氧氯化条件下生成Cl2。这强调了卤素类型在确定反应途径方面的重要性。

4. 一旦形成烷基卤化物，它就可以经历脱卤化反应形成相应的烯烃或进一步卤化生成多卤化物，同时可能发生裂解和燃烧反应。

5. 对于乙基氯化物，脱氯化路径优先于多氯化路径，导致乙烯的产量远高于二氯乙烷。

6. 在丙基卤化物的情况下，只有丙烯和碳氧化物被检测到，表明丙烯是主要产物。

7. 不论烷基的结构如何，氧氯化反应倾向于优先生成烯烃，而氧溴化反应倾向于形成溴代化合物。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为可行的选择，研究人员可以专注于开发更稳定、活性更高的催化剂，以维持更长时间的效率。他们还可以探讨调整反应条件，如温度、压力或共催化剂的存在，以优化丙烯选择性和减少不希望产生的副产品的形成。进一步的研究可以探索集成先进的催化剂回收或再生技术来缓解失活并延长催化剂寿命的可能性。此外，开发更稳定和选择性的脱氢路径可以提高N2O-ODHP过程的整体效率和经济可行性。

[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The observed selectivity differences primarily originate from (i) the halide-dependent alkane activation path, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it mostly occurs via gas-phase halogenation in oxybromination, along with (ii) the preferred tendency of alkyl chlorides towards catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways opposing alkyl bromides that undergo further bromination routes in the gas phase."
[3] "The catalysts were virtually inactive for these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during the alkane oxyhalogenation tests."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages and challenges. N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its unique chemical properties. However, the process faces significant limitations in terms of catalyst deactivation and stability, which hinder practical implementation. Various catalysts have been explored for ODHP, including metals like iron, copper, and nickel, as well as mixed-metal oxides. The critical challenge lies in maintaining the catalyst's activity and stability over multiple reaction cycles. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more robust catalyst materials with enhanced resistance to deactivation, improving the process conditions to optimize catalyst efficiency, and implementing advanced catalyst regeneration techniques. Research directions could focus on exploring novel catalyst compositions, modifying existing catalyst structures, and enhancing reaction mechanisms to improve propylene selectivity and catalyst longevity. These advancements could make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial application.
