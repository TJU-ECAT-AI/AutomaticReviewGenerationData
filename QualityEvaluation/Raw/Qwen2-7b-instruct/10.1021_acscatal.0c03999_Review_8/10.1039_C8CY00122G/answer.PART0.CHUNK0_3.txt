[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The observed selectivity differences primarily originate from (i) the halide-dependent alkane activation path, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it mostly occurs via gas-phase halogenation in oxybromination, along with (ii) the preferred tendency of alkyl chlorides towards catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways opposing alkyl bromides that undergo further bromination routes in the gas phase."
[3] "The catalysts were virtually inactive for these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during the alkane oxyhalogenation tests."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages and challenges. N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its unique chemical properties. However, the process faces significant limitations in terms of catalyst deactivation and stability, which hinder practical implementation. Various catalysts have been explored for ODHP, including metals like iron, copper, and nickel, as well as mixed-metal oxides. The critical challenge lies in maintaining the catalyst's activity and stability over multiple reaction cycles. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing more robust catalyst materials with enhanced resistance to deactivation, improving the process conditions to optimize catalyst efficiency, and implementing advanced catalyst regeneration techniques. Research directions could focus on exploring novel catalyst compositions, modifying existing catalyst structures, and enhancing reaction mechanisms to improve propylene selectivity and catalyst longevity. These advancements could make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial application.
