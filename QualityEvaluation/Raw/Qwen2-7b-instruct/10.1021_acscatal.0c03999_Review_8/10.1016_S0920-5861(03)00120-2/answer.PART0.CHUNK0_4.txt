[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
[2] "The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts."
[3] "In absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%)."
[4] "A crucial implication of our results is that, contrary to what it is believed, CO2 is not inert in the reaction. It is not only a non-selective product but it also modifies, via O(a),the selectivity of the catalyst."
[5] "In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It inhibits the adsorption of O2, leading to a reduction in the formation of non-selective oxygen species and a decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in increased propylene yield and selectivity.

2. The use of N2O in ODHP involves employing catalysts like nickel molybdate (NiMoO4), which exhibit interesting catalytic performances and good selectivity. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability. Strategies for addressing these limitations could involve optimizing the reaction conditions, modifying the catalyst composition, or incorporating additives that stabilize the catalysts.

3. Research directions to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation might focus on improving catalyst stability and selectivity, developing more efficient catalyst materials, and optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize non-selective reactions. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of using N2O in combination with other gases or additives could enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，提高了丙烯的选择性，与其它氧化剂相比具有优势。它抑制了氧气的吸附，减少了非选择性氧物种的生成和催化剂的氧化速率，从而增加了丙烯的产率和选择性。

2. 在使用N2O进行ODHP时，镍钼酸盐（NiMoO4）等催化剂被采用，它们显示出良好的催化性能和选择性。挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性维持。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化反应条件、修改催化剂组成或引入稳定催化剂的添加剂。

3. 为了使N2O-ODHP成为可行的工业应用，研究方向可能集中在提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性、开发更高效的催化剂材料以及优化反应条件以减少非选择性反应上。此外，探索N2O与其他气体或添加剂的协同作用，可以增强过程的效率和选择性。
