<p>The addition of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts is reported.</p>
<p>CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion.</p>
<p>N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>Both dopes can oxidise the propane to propene.</p>
<p>The strategy followed in this work is to carry out the reaction in presence and absence of CO2 and N2O and to characterise the catalysts before and after reaction in order to correlate the catalytic activity with any change occurring on the catalysts during the reaction and to determine the effect of the addition of dopes on such changes.</p>
<p>CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4.</p>
<p>N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction.</p>

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature highlights that N2O's ability to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen (O2) and thus limit the formation of non-selective oxygen species, contributes significantly to increased propylene selectivity and reduced oxygen consumption. 

The research employs nickel molybdate (-NiMoO4) as the catalyst, known for its robust catalytic performance and selectivity in alkane oxidation processes. The study aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which N2O modifies the catalyst's active sites, leading to enhanced propylene yield and selectivity.

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and instability are acknowledged, particularly concerning the need to maintain N2O in the feed for sustained selectivity. Strategies to address these limitations might include optimizing the N2O concentration, exploring synergies with other dopants, or developing more stable catalyst formulations that can retain their activity even in the absence of N2O.

Future research directions could focus on refining the understanding of the interaction between N2O and catalyst surfaces, identifying the precise oxygen species formed upon N2O dissociation, and developing methods to predict and control the catalyst's oxidation state dynamically. Such advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical applications, offering enhanced efficiency and selectivity in propylene production.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势明显。文献表明，N2O通过抑制氧（O2）的吸附，限制非选择性氧物种的形成，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和降低了氧的消耗。

研究采用镍钼酸盐（-NiMoO4）作为催化剂，该催化剂在烷烃氧化过程中表现出出色的催化性能和选择性。研究旨在揭示N2O如何改变催化剂的活性位点，导致丙烯产量和选择性的提高。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战被承认，特别是维持N2O在流体中的必要性以保持选择性。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化N2O的浓度、探索与其他添加剂的协同作用或开发更稳定的催化剂配方，即使在没有N2O的情况下也能保持其活性。

未来的研究方向可以集中在深化对N2O与催化剂表面相互作用的理解，确定N2O分解后形成的精确氧物种，并开发预测和控制催化剂氧化状态的方法。这些进展可能使N2O-ODHP成为更具可行性的实际应用选项，提供更高的效率和选择性丙烯生产。
