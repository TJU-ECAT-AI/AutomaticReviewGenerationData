<p>Our work is based on the well established fact that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface of oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions could modify strongly the surface properties of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The strategy followed in this work is to carry out the reaction in presence and absence of CO2 and N2O and to characterise the catalysts before and after reaction in order to correlate the catalytic activity with any change occurring on the catalysts during the reaction and to determine the effect of the addition of dopes on such changes.</p>
<p>Results from the ammonia TPD showed that desorption profiles are essentially similar for fresh and used samples, in presence or absence of N2O (as in the case of the presence of CO2).</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2.</p>
<p>The presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts.</p>

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) allows for improved propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen, leading to reduced formation of non-selective oxygen species and a slower oxidation rate of the catalysts.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is typically carried out using a variety of catalysts, such as NiMoO4, known for their interesting catalytic properties and good selectivity.

3. One of the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP processes involves maintaining the performance and longevity of the catalysts over time, particularly when dealing with the complex interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces.

4. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation could involve developing more robust and selective catalysts, improving the design of the reaction conditions to minimize catalyst poisoning or deactivation, and optimizing the feedstock composition to enhance catalyst efficiency.

5. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O's interaction with catalyst surfaces, identifying the precise conditions under which N2O can maximize propylene selectivity while minimizing unwanted reactions, and exploring the potential for using N2O in conjunction with other additives or promoters to further enhance the performance of the ODHP process.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O has been shown to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen, thus limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in increased yield and selectivity for propene production. N2O can also participate directly as an oxidant, potentially contributing to the formation of oxygenated products. Strategies to address limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP include further investigation into the dissociation of N2O and its role in catalytic site modification, optimization of reaction conditions, and development of more stable and selective catalysts capable of maintaining the desired oxidation state. Research directions might focus on improving catalyst stability in the presence of N2O, understanding the dynamics of site creation and reversibility, and exploring the potential direct oxidant role of N2O in the reaction.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature highlights that N2O's ability to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen (O2) and thus limit the formation of non-selective oxygen species, contributes significantly to increased propylene selectivity and reduced oxygen consumption. 

The research employs nickel molybdate (-NiMoO4) as the catalyst, known for its robust catalytic performance and selectivity in alkane oxidation processes. The study aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which N2O modifies the catalyst's active sites, leading to enhanced propylene yield and selectivity.

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and instability are acknowledged, particularly concerning the need to maintain N2O in the feed for sustained selectivity. Strategies to address these limitations might include optimizing the N2O concentration, exploring synergies with other dopants, or developing more stable catalyst formulations that can retain their activity even in the absence of N2O.

Future research directions could focus on refining the understanding of the interaction between N2O and catalyst surfaces, identifying the precise oxygen species formed upon N2O dissociation, and developing methods to predict and control the catalyst's oxidation state dynamically. Such advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical applications, offering enhanced efficiency and selectivity in propylene production.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势明显。文献表明，N2O通过抑制氧（O2）的吸附，限制非选择性氧物种的形成，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和降低了氧的消耗。

研究采用镍钼酸盐（-NiMoO4）作为催化剂，该催化剂在烷烃氧化过程中表现出出色的催化性能和选择性。研究旨在揭示N2O如何改变催化剂的活性位点，导致丙烯产量和选择性的提高。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战被承认，特别是维持N2O在流体中的必要性以保持选择性。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化N2O的浓度、探索与其他添加剂的协同作用或开发更稳定的催化剂配方，即使在没有N2O的情况下也能保持其活性。

未来的研究方向可以集中在深化对N2O与催化剂表面相互作用的理解，确定N2O分解后形成的精确氧物种，并开发预测和控制催化剂氧化状态的方法。这些进展可能使N2O-ODHP成为更具可行性的实际应用选项，提供更高的效率和选择性丙烯生产。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O is particularly advantageous because it inhibits the adsorption of O2, thereby limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This leads to an increase in propylene yield and selectivity. Moreover, N2O can directly participate as an oxidant, contributing to the conversion of propane into propene. 

Various catalysts, such as nickel molybdate (NiMoO4), have been employed in the ODHP process. These catalysts exhibit interesting catalytic properties and good selectivity.
