<p>Our work is based on the well established fact that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface of oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions could modify strongly the surface properties of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The strategy followed in this work is to carry out the reaction in presence and absence of CO2 and N2O and to characterise the catalysts before and after reaction in order to correlate the catalytic activity with any change occurring on the catalysts during the reaction and to determine the effect of the addition of dopes on such changes.</p>
<p>Results from the ammonia TPD showed that desorption profiles are essentially similar for fresh and used samples, in presence or absence of N2O (as in the case of the presence of CO2).</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the formation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant than O2.</p>
<p>The presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts.</p>

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) allows for improved propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen, leading to reduced formation of non-selective oxygen species and a slower oxidation rate of the catalysts.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is typically carried out using a variety of catalysts, such as NiMoO4, known for their interesting catalytic properties and good selectivity.

3. One of the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP processes involves maintaining the performance and longevity of the catalysts over time, particularly when dealing with the complex interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces.

4. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation could involve developing more robust and selective catalysts, improving the design of the reaction conditions to minimize catalyst poisoning or deactivation, and optimizing the feedstock composition to enhance catalyst efficiency.

5. Research directions could focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of N2O's interaction with catalyst surfaces, identifying the precise conditions under which N2O can maximize propylene selectivity while minimizing unwanted reactions, and exploring the potential for using N2O in conjunction with other additives or promoters to further enhance the performance of the ODHP process.
