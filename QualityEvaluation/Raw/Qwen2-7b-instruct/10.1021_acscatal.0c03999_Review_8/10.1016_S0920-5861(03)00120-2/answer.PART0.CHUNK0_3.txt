[1] "The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O is particularly advantageous because it inhibits the adsorption of O2, thereby limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This leads to an increase in propylene yield and selectivity. Moreover, N2O can directly participate as an oxidant, contributing to the conversion of propane into propene. 

Various catalysts, such as nickel molybdate (NiMoO4), have been employed in the ODHP process. These catalysts exhibit interesting catalytic properties and good selectivity. However, a major challenge lies in catalyst deactivation and instability, which can significantly impact the efficiency and practicality of the process. Strategies to address these limitations might include optimizing the catalyst composition, enhancing the stability of the active sites, and improving the reaction conditions to reduce deactivation rates. Research directions could focus on developing more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction environments, as well as exploring alternative reaction mechanisms that might mitigate deactivation and enhance selectivity.

分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，它在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势与其它氧化剂相比。N2O特别有优势，因为它抑制了氧气的吸附，从而限制了非选择性氧物种的形成和催化剂的氧化速率。这导致了丙烯产率和选择性的增加。此外，N2O可以直接作为氧化剂参与反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯。

各种催化剂，如镍钼酸盐（NiMoO4），已在ODHP过程中被应用。这些催化剂表现出有趣且良好的催化性能和选择性。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性问题是一个主要挑战，这可以显著影响过程的效率和实用性。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成，增强活性位点的稳定性，以及改善反应条件以减少失活率。研究方向可以集中在开发更坚固的催化剂，使其能承受苛刻的反应环境，以及探索可能减轻失活并提高选择性的替代反应机制。
