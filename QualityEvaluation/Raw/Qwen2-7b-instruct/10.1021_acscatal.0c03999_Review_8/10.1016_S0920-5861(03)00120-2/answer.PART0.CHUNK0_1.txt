[1] "N2O has been used as pure ox- idant: in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane [8] or formaldehyde [9,10], in the transformation of benzene to phenol [11] or in the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide [12,13]."
[2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
[3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[4] "The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [10]."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O has been shown to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen, thus limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in increased yield and selectivity for propene production. N2O can also participate directly as an oxidant, potentially contributing to the formation of oxygenated products. Strategies to address limitations and enhance the feasibility of N2O-ODHP include further investigation into the dissociation of N2O and its role in catalytic site modification, optimization of reaction conditions, and development of more stable and selective catalysts capable of maintaining the desired oxidation state. Research directions might focus on improving catalyst stability in the presence of N2O, understanding the dynamics of site creation and reversibility, and exploring the potential direct oxidant role of N2O in the reaction.

在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用纯氧（N2O）作为氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。具体而言，N2O已被证明可以抑制氧气的吸附，从而限制催化剂上非选择性氧物种的形成和氧化速率。这导致丙烯产率和选择性的增加。N2O还可以直接作为氧化剂参与反应，可能有助于形成氧化合物。解决局限性和提高N2O-ODHP可行性的策略包括进一步研究N2O的分解及其对催化位点的影响、优化反应条件以及开发能够保持所需氧化状态的更稳定和选择性催化剂。研究方向可能集中在改善N2O存在下的催化剂稳定性、理解位点创建和可逆性动态，以及探索N2O直接作为氧化剂在反应中的作用。
