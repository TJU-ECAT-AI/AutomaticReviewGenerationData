[1] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of alkane to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[2] "On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."
[3] "Some studies have also been performed on the effect of H2S or other sulfur species on the ODH reactions of light alkanes. (13, 14)"
[4] "Therefore, the present work aims at acquiring a better understanding of the effect of H2S in the alkane ODH reaction. In particular, emphasis will be placed on how H2S dictates the product selectivity, that is, the ratio of olefin to other products, in the gas-phase propane ODH reaction."
[5] "It was revealed from the experimental product distributions that solid carbon is the most dominant carbon product of the propane ODH reaction at 923 K (Table 1) when a 4:1 C3H8/O2 feed was used."
[6] "Meanwhile, the overall conversion of propane was boosted from 19% to 50%."
[7] "Doubling the O2 content in the feed further increased the propane conversion up to 72% at 1023 K at the expense of lower olefin selectivity, possibly because of the overoxidation of the olefin products."
[8] "When H2S was added to the feed, remarkable enhancement on propane conversion and product selectivity favoring olefins was observed."
[9] "With the feed composed of 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S, the maximum propylene selectivity achieved was 51% with the propane conversion of 50% at 923 K."
[10] "Increasing the temperature to 1023 K slightly reduced the propylene selectivity to 49% but the propane conversion was enhanced to 68%."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP):

1. N2O enhances propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It boosts the selectivity by 25% in vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, achievable only at low propane conversion (110%).

2. Catalysts used in this process include vanadia and mixed-metal oxides, known for their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity that promote ODH activity and selectivity.

3. Challenges faced include catalyst deactivation and instability, often resulting from the overoxidation of alkane to CO and CO2, and the possibility of reaction runaway.

4. Strategies to address these limitations include the development of more stable catalysts, optimization of operating conditions to reduce overoxidation, and the incorporation of additives like sulfur species to improve selectivity without compromising conversion.

5. Incorporating H2S into the feed mixture significantly improves propane conversion and product selectivity, favoring olefin formation over other products.

6. At 923 K, solid carbon is the most dominant carbon product with 4:1 C3H8/O2 feed. Conversion is boosted to 50% and selectivity to propylene increases to 56.5%.

7. Doubling the O2 content in the feed further increases conversion to 72% at 1023 K, but at the cost of lower olefin selectivity.

8. Adding H2S to the feed mixture leads to remarkable enhancement in propane conversion and selectivity favoring olefins over other products.

9. With a 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S feed at 923 K, the maximum propylene selectivity reaches 51% with a propane conversion of 50%.

10. Increasing the temperature to 1023 K slightly reduces the propylene selectivity to 49% but enhances the propane conversion to 68%.

In conclusion, while N2O-ODHP shows promise, improvements in catalyst stability, reduction of overoxidation, and optimization of operating conditions are needed to make this process more practical for industrial implementation.

分析硝酸盐（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）氧化剂的使用：

1.N2O在氧基催化丙烷ODHP反应中增强了丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂，其选择性提高25%，仅在低丙烷转化率（110%）下可实现。

2.在该过程中使用的催化剂包括范德瓦尔和混合金属氧化物，它们以其高热稳定性、大的表面积以及有利的还原性和碱性而闻名，这些特性促进了ODHP的活性和选择性。

3.面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和不稳定性，通常会导致烷烃过度氧化为CO和CO2，并且存在反应失控的可能性。

4.解决这些限制的方法包括开发更稳定的催化剂、优化操作条件以减少过度氧化、并在配方中加入如硫化物等添加剂以提高选择性而不损害转化率。

5.引入H2S到配方中显著提高了丙烷转化率和产品选择性，有利于烯烃形成超过其他产物。

6.在923 K时，当使用4:1 C3H8/O2配方时，固体碳是最主要的碳产物。转化率提升至50%，丙烯选择性增加至56.5%。

7.将氧气含量加倍在1023 K下进一步提高了转化率至72%，但代价是降低了烯烃选择性。

8.向配方中添加H2S导致丙烷转化率和产品选择性的显著增强，有利于烯烃形成超过其他产物。

9.使用4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S配方，在923 K时，最大丙烯选择率达到51%，丙烷转化率为50%。

10.将温度提高至1023 K使丙烯选择性略微降至49%，但丙烷转化率提升至68%。

综上所述，虽然N2O-ODHP显示出潜力，但仍需要改进催化剂稳定性、降低过度氧化以及优化操作条件，以便使这一过程更具工业实用性。
