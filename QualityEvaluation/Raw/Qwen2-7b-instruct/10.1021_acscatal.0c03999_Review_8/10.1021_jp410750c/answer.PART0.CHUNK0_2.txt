[1] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of alkane to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[2] "On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."
[3] "It was postulated in these studies that the enhanced olefin selectivity is attributed to the S2 intermediate, formed from reacting H2S with O2, that participates in the hydrogen abstraction of alkane, producing the olefin product and H2S, which is recycled in the reaction."
[4] "In particular, emphasis will be placed on how H2S dictates the product selectivity, that is, the ratio of olefin to other products, in the gas-phase propane ODH reaction."
[5] "It was revealed according to the CBS-QB3 calculations that S2 was indeed the oxidant responsible for the propane oxidation when H2S was present in the feed, and it was formed from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2 at around 1000 K."
[6] "Meanwhile, because S2 is a more reactive hydrogen abstraction agent than O2, the conversion of C3H8 would also be promoted due to the in situ formation of S2."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been tested as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to other oxidants, N2O can enhance propylene selectivity, reaching up to 25% increase in selectivity for vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions. This is attributed to the formation of an intermediate, S2, which is produced from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2. The S2 intermediate facilitates the hydrogen abstraction of alkane, leading to olefin production and recycling of H2S. However, the challenge with N2O-ODHP lies in the low propane conversion achievable with high propylene selectivity. This limitation can be addressed by incorporating catalysts that enhance the reaction rate and selectivity. Strategies could involve the development of more stable and selective catalysts, optimization of reaction conditions, and exploring alternative oxidants that maintain high propylene selectivity across a broader range of conversion. Research directions might include the study of multi-functional catalysts, the use of dual oxidants, and the development of novel reaction mechanisms that could potentially mitigate the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的氧化剂，讨论其与其它氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面的优势、所采用的催化剂及其面临的催化剂失活和稳定性问题的关键挑战。此外，提出策略或研究方向以解决这些限制，并可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。

N2O已被测试用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O可以提高丙烯选择性，最高可达vanadia催化丙烷ODHP反应中25%的选择性增加。这归因于从H2S与O2快速部分氧化产生的中间体S2。S2中间体促进烷烃的氢解离，产生烯烃并循环利用H2S。然而，N2O-ODHP的挑战在于难以实现高丙烯选择性下的高丙烷转化率。可以通过引入增强反应速率和选择性的催化剂来解决这一限制。策略可能包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂、优化反应条件以及探索保持高丙烯选择性的同时能覆盖更宽转化率范围的其他氧化剂。研究方向可能涉及多功能催化剂的开发、双氧化剂的应用以及新型反应机制的研究，这些都可以潜在地缓解催化剂失活和稳定性问题，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
