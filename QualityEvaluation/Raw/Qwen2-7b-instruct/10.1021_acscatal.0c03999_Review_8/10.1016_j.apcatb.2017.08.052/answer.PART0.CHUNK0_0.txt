The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored due to its potential advantages in propylene selectivity over other oxidants. In this process, different catalysts such as metal-based and metal oxide catalysts have been utilized. However, the process faces significant challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Potential solutions to these issues may involve the development of novel catalyst materials, enhancing reactor design, and refining operational parameters.
