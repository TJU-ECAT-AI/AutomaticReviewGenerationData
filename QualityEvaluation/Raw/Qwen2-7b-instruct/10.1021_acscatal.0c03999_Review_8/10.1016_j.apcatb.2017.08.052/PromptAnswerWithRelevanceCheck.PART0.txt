Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), one significant advantage highlighted is its high selectivity towards propylene production, as mentioned in quote [1]. The variety of catalysts employed in this process includes noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru), along with mixed metal oxides, as detailed in quote [2]. However, a critical challenge associated with this process is catalyst deactivation, specifically carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, as noted in quote [3]. Strategies to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more practical option might include the development of new materials or modifications to existing catalysts to improve their resistance against carbon deposition, as suggested in quote [4].
