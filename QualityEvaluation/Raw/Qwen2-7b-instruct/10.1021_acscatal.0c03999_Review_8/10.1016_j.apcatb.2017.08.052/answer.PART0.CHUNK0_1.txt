The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts such as zeolites, metal oxides, and mixed metal oxides have been employed in this process. However, critical challenges exist related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to address these limitations might include optimizing the catalyst composition, improving reactor design, and developing more stable catalyst materials.
