The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages compared to molecular oxygen (O2). These include lower costs and reduced environmental impact. In this study, N2O was found to effectively perform the ODHP reaction, yielding propylene with high selectivity. Various catalysts, such as metal oxides, metal carbides, and metal sulfides, were employed in the N2O-ODHP process, each affecting the reaction efficiency and product distribution differently. However, the process faces significant challenges, primarily catalyst deactivation over time due to factors like sintering, poisoning, or structural degradation. Maintaining stable operation conditions, including pressure, temperature, and gas flow rates, is also crucial to achieving consistent yields and selectivities.

在氧化脱氢反应中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂与使用分子氧（O2）相比具有几个优势。这些包括成本更低和对环境的影响更小。在这项研究中，N2O被发现可以有效地执行丙烷氧化脱氢反应，产生高选择性的丙烯。各种催化剂，如金属氧化物、金属碳化物和金属硫化物，在N2O-ODHP过程中被应用，它们各自影响着反应效率和产物分布。然而，该过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂随时间的失效，这可能归因于烧结、中毒或结构降解。保持稳定的运行条件，包括压力、温度和气体流速，对于实现一致的产率和选择性也是至关重要的。
