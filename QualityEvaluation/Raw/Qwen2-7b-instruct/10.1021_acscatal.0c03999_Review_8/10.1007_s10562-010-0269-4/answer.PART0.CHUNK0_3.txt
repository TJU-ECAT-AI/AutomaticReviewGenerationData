The literature indicates that the addition of potassium (K) to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst system significantly enhances the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, the highest propylene yield and selectivity were achieved when the K content was 0.8%. This suggests that an optimal amount of K improves the balance between the acidic properties of the catalyst and the dispersion of metals, thereby increasing activity and stability. Conversely, the study also reveals that excessive K addition leads to a reduction in strong acid sites, decreases Pt dispersion, and disrupts the ideal balance between acidic sites and active sites, negatively impacting both activity and stability. Thus, managing the amount of K is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

文献表明，向PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂体系中添加钾（K）显著提高了丙烷脱氢的催化性能。具体来说，在K含量为0.8%时，丙烯产率和选择性最高。这表明适量的K可以改善催化剂的酸性和金属分散之间的平衡，从而增加活性和稳定性。相反，研究还揭示了过量的K添加导致强酸位点减少、Pt分散度降低，并破坏了理想的酸位与活性位点之间的平衡，从而显著影响活性和稳定性。因此，管理K的含量对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。
