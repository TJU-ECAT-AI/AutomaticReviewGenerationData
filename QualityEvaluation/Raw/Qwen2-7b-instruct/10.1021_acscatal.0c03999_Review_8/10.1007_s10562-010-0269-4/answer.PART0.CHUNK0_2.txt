<p>The addition of K had an obvious impact on the catalytic performance of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst.</p>
<p>A suitable amount of K could not only change the acid of the catalysts but also improve the relation between metals and the support, thus reduce the deactivation rate and increase the selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>It was found that the propylene selectivity and yield could reach the maximum when the content of K was 0.8%.</p>
<p>The effect of different amount of potassium added on the acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, pore structure and catalytic performance for PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst was studied in the paper. After the addition of K, the propylene yield increased obviously and the stability of catalysts also improved.</p>

The document discusses the impact of potassium (K) addition on the catalytic performance of a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst used for propane dehydrogenation. The results show that an appropriate amount of K can alter the acidity of the catalyst, enhance the relationship between metals and the support, and minimize deactivation rates. This leads to an increase in propylene selectivity and yield. Specifically, the optimal K content was determined to be 0.8%, achieving the highest propylene selectivity and yield. The addition of K also improves the stability of the catalysts, enhancing their performance in the dehydrogenation process.

文献讨论了钾（K）添加对用于丙烷脱氢的PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂的催化性能的影响。结果表明，适当的K含量可以改变催化剂的酸性，增强金属与载体之间的关系，并减少失活率。这导致丙烯选择性和产率的增加。特别是，确定最佳K含量为0.8%，实现最高丙烯选择性和产率。K的添加也提高了催化剂的稳定性，增强了其在脱氢过程中的性能。
