The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages. N2O allows for propylene yields in the range of 10-30% using oxygen as the oxidant, compared to the higher yields achievable with N2O. The study highlights that iron zeolites, specifically Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, are effective catalysts for this process. Iron zeolites prepared through post-synthesis methods such as liquid-ion exchange or chemical vapor deposition have propylene yields ranging from 9 to 25%. However, steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit the highest propylene yields, reaching up to 22%. The presence of iron impurities in commercial zeolites can lead to low propene and N2O conversions but high propylene selectivity and low COx formation. The correlation between the turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production and the Fe/Al ratio in the zeolites indicates that steamed H-ZSM-5 zeolites with Fe/Al = 0.007 have the highest TOF, decreasing by three orders of magnitude in catalysts prepared by chemical vapor deposition with Fe/Al = 1. This study suggests that the isolated nature of iron species in commercial zeolites, especially after steam treatment, is critical for high-quality performance in ODHP reactions. The research also points out the importance of understanding the role of acidity in the ODHP process to address catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Future studies could focus on optimizing catalyst formulations to maintain high activity and selectivity, potentially making N2O-ODHP a more practical industrial option.

在氧化脱氢过程中使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）具有几个优势。N2O允许使用氧气作为氧化剂时丙烯产量在10到30％之间，与使用N2O时获得的更高产量相比。研究表明，铁沸石（特别是Fe-ZSM-5沸石）是这种过程的有效催化剂。通过后合成方法制备的铁沸石，如液体离子交换或化学气相沉积，具有从9到25％的丙烯产量。然而，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5沸石显示出最高的丙烯产量，达到22％。商业沸石中的铁杂质可能导致低丙烯和N2O转化率，但高丙烯选择性和低COx形成。对于丙烷氧化脱氢反应，铁/铝比在0.007（在名义上无铁的st-H-Z中）到1（在cvd-Fe-Z中）的TOF（周转频率）之间的关系表明，蒸馏H-ZSM-5沸石的TOF最高，当Fe/Al = 0.007时，cvd-Fe-Z催化剂的TOF下降三个数量级。Fe/Al = 1。研究结果表明，商业沸石中经过蒸汽处理后的孤立铁物种的质量对ODHP反应至关重要。未来的研究可以集中在优化催化剂配方以维持高活性和选择性上，从而有可能使N2O-ODHP成为更实用的工业选项。
