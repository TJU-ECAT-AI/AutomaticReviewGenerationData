The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants. Firstly, N2O provides a higher propylene selectivity compared to using oxygen (O2). This is evident from the propylene yields reported in the literature, ranging from 10% to 30% when using O2, whereas N2O enables yields up to 20% over Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange. The presence of iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites leads to relatively low conversions of propene and N2O, yet achieves a high propylene selectivity of 90%, minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx). This is attributed to the isolated nature of iron species in the commercial zeolite, which is a result of the high dilution of iron in the matrix. Moreover, the correlation between the turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production and the Fe/Al ratio in the zeolites highlights the importance of the iron form in the zeolite structure for efficient catalysis. The steam treatment of H-ZSM-5 zeolites facilitates the generation of highly dispersed isolated iron sites, enhancing the propylene yield through the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP could involve optimizing the preparation methods of iron-containing zeolites, focusing on the isolation of iron species and minimizing iron clustering to prevent deep oxidation of reaction intermediates. This approach could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

在氧化脱氢反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂具有几个优势。首先，与使用氧气（O2）相比，N2O提供了更高的丙烯选择性。文献中报告的使用O2时的丙烯产率范围为10％至30％，而使用N2O时，Fe-ZSM-5沸石通过液态离子交换制备的催化剂可以达到高达20％的丙烯产率。在蒸煮后的商业H-ZSM-5沸石中，铁杂质的存在导致丙烯和N2O的转化率较低，但能实现高达90％的丙烯选择性，从而大大减少了碳氧化物（COx）的形成。这是由于商业沸石中的铁物种高度分散的结果，这归因于铁在矩阵中的高稀释度。此外，通过蒸汽处理H-ZSM-5沸石，能够促进生成高度分散的孤立铁位点，通过丙烷的氧化脱氢过程有效提高丙烯产率。为了克服N2O-ODHP催化过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性问题，策略可能包括优化铁基沸石的制备方法，重点是分离铁物种并减少铁簇化，以防止反应中间体的深氧化。这种策略可能会使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
