Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it exhibits several advantages compared to other oxidants. N2O serves as an effective monooxygen donor, specifically tailored for ODHP over iron zeolites, resulting in high propene yields reaching up to 25% at 723-773 K. This process contrasts with others that use oxygen (O2), which typically result in lower propene yields. 

Several catalysts are employed in this process, notably iron zeolites, which are known for their exceptional performance in ODHP with N2O. However, a significant challenge arises due to the catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation, affecting the efficiency of the process. Despite this, the initial activity of the catalyst is recoverable through air-regeneration, providing a pathway for continuous propylene production.

The N2O-ODHP process offers a viable solution for on-site C3H6 production, especially in localized sites with access to a low-cost source of N2O. The use of N2O in tail-gas from chemical production plants, where it is produced in high concentration, presents an attractive opportunity. However, the presence of other gases such as oxygen (O2) or nitrogen oxides (NO) negatively impacts the process, highlighting the need for a purification/separation step before the cyclic reactor. This adds a substantial cost to the process.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, strategies could focus on developing cheaper and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature ammonia (NH3) oxidation to N2O. This could reduce the cost of the oxidant, making the process more economically viable. Additionally, research could explore modifying the zeolite catalyst or operating conditions to maintain the remarkable stability of the fresh FeZSM-5 zeolite in the first period of the ODHP reaction, thereby prolonging the duration of the reaction step in the cyclic process. These advancements would enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the N2O-ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸盐（N2O）作为氧化剂，具有与其它氧化剂相比的一些优势。N2O作为单氧供体的特定性以及在沸石中确定的铁形式协调活性原子氧物种的能力，使其能够有效地脱氢丙烷，导致高丙烯产率高达723-773 K时的25%。相比之下，使用氧气（O2）的其他过程通常导致较低的丙烯产率。

在这一过程中使用的催化剂包括铁沸石等，它们在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出卓越的性能。然而，一个主要的挑战是由于焦炭形成导致催化剂失活，影响了过程效率。尽管如此，催化剂的初始活性可以通过空气再生恢复，为连续丙烯生产提供了途径。

N2O-ODHP过程特别适用于现场C3H6生产，尤其是在有低成本N2O可用的局部地点。从化学生产工厂排放气体中高浓度产生的N2O，为该过程提供了一个吸引人的机会。但是，其他气体如氧气（O2）或氮氧化物（NO）对过程有负面影响，强调了在循环反应器之前进行净化/分离步骤的必要性。这将增加过程的成本。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项，可以探索开发更便宜和选择性的催化剂系统来降低氨（NH3）低温氧化到N2O的温度。这将降低氧化剂的成本，使过程更具经济性。此外，研究可以探索修改沸石催化剂或操作条件，以保持新鲜FeZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应初期的非凡稳定性，从而延长循环过程中的反应步骤持续时间。这些进展将增强N2O-ODHP过程的效率和成本效益。
