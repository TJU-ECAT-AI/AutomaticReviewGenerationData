Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O plays a crucial role in the ODHP process over iron zeolites, enabling higher propene yields and selectivity than those achieved with oxygen (O2) or other oxidants. This is due to the specific functionality of N2O as a monooxygen donor, which facilitates the efficient dehydrogenation of propane, while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, with iron zeolites, particularly steam-activated FeZSM-5, emerging as the most promising system. These catalysts display superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at temperatures ranging from 723 to 773 K. This performance is on par with the best results reported for V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as an oxidant.

However, the ODHP process faces significant challenges, primarily associated with catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This deactivation necessitates an effective regeneration method, which, in this case, involves air-regeneration. The ability to recover the catalyst's initial activity upon regeneration highlights the potential of this process for practical implementation.

Despite these advantages, the ODHP process using N2O faces limitations, including the detrimental effects of oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NO) on propylene yield. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, several strategies can be pursued. These might include:

1. **Development of Selective Catalyst Systems:** Research could focus on developing catalyst systems that selectively utilize N2O without being negatively impacted by other gases in the process stream, such as O2 or NO. This could involve modifying existing catalyst materials or discovering new ones that are more tolerant to these contaminants.

2. **Efficient Gas Purification:** Implementing efficient purification methods to remove O2 and NO from the process gas stream before it enters the reactor. This could involve advanced filtration, adsorption, or other separation techniques to ensure that the N2O stream is sufficiently pure and free from inhibitors.

3. **Process Optimization:** Optimizing the process parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, to minimize the impact of impurities like O2 and NO on propylene yield. This might involve conducting detailed kinetic studies to understand the interactions between reactants and catalysts under various conditions.

4. **Catalyst Durability and Stability:** Enhancing the durability and stability of the catalyst to withstand the effects of impurities over multiple cycles of operation. This could involve developing new catalyst formulations that incorporate protective layers or additives that mitigate the detrimental effects of O2 and NO.

5. **Integration with Waste Streams:** Exploiting the potential of utilizing N2O from industrial waste streams as a sustainable oxidant source. This could include the development of processes that effectively capture and purify N2O from waste gases, making the overall process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

By addressing these limitations through targeted research and innovation, the N2O-ODHP process could become a more feasible and practical option for the production of propylene, particularly in localized sites with access to low-cost N2O sources.

在氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，可以明显看出N2O在铁沸石上进行ODHP时提供了独特的优势，特别是在丙烷转化为丙烯的产物选择性方面。与氧气（O2）或其他氧化剂相比，N2O在铁沸石上的作用更为关键，能够实现更高的丙烯产率和选择性。这是由于N2O作为单氧供体的独特功能，它能够有效地促进丙烷的脱氢反应，同时最小化副产品的形成。

已经使用了各种催化剂来实施ODHP过程，其中蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石被认为是最有前景的系统。这些催化剂在723至773 K的温度范围内表现出优异性能，初始丙烯产率达到25%。这一结果与使用O2为氧化剂的V-和Mo基催化剂的最高报告值相当。

然而，ODHP过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂因焦炭形成而失活。这种失活需要有效的再生方法，这里采用的是空气再生法。催化剂初始活性的恢复证明了这一过程在实际应用中的潜在可行性。

尽管如此，使用N2O的ODHP过程仍存在局限性，特别是氧气（O2）和氮氧化物（NO）对丙烯产率的负面影响。为了克服这些限制，并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际实施选项，可以采取几种策略：

1. **开发选择性催化剂系统**：研究可以专注于开发选择性利用N2O而不受其他过程流体中气体（如O2或NO）影响的催化剂系统。这可能涉及到修改现有催化剂材料或发现新的催化剂，它们对于这些抑制剂更加容忍。

2. **高效气体净化**：实施高效的净化方法来去除进入反应器前过程气流中的O2和NO。这可能包括先进的过滤、吸附或其他分离技术，以确保N2O流足够纯净且不含抑制剂。

3. **过程优化**：优化过程参数，如温度、压力和反应物比，以最大限度地减少O2和NO等杂质对丙烯产率的影响。这可能涉及进行详细的动力学研究，以了解反应物和催化剂在不同条件下的相互作用。

4. **催化剂耐用性和稳定性**：通过研发新型催化剂配方，增强催化剂的耐用性和稳定性，使其能够承受O2和NO等杂质的影响，从而在多次操作周期中保持稳定。这可能涉及开发包含保护层或添加剂的新催化剂，这些添加剂能够减轻O2和NO对催化剂的负面影响。

5. **集成废物流**：利用工业废物流作为可持续氧化剂来源的可能性。这可能包括开发过程，有效捕获并纯化废气体中的N2O，从而使整个过程更具经济性和环境友好性。

通过针对上述限制进行针对性的研究和创新，N2O-ODHP过程可以成为更可行且实际的丙烯生产方式，尤其是在具有低成本N2O来源的局部站点。
