[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at 723-773 K."
[2] "Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."
[3] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration."
[4] "On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated. Propene yields >20% were achieved during a period of 1500 min (12 cycles), in a configuration of five fixed-bed reactors in parallel with alternation of reaction, purging, and regeneration cycles at 723 K."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers several advantages over other oxidants. N2O acts as a monooxygen donor, which is crucial for the ODHP process over iron zeolites. It provides a high propene selectivity due to its specific role in the functionalization of propane. However, the process faces significant challenges, primarily catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This deactivation can be mitigated through air-regeneration, recovering the initial activity of the catalyst.

Several catalysts have been employed in this process, including steam-activated FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta. These catalysts show similar initial activity and resistance to deactivation, with FeZSM-5 exhibiting a slight advantage. The use of small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture negatively impacts the propene selectivity, highlighting the critical role of N2O as the preferred oxidant.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, strategies could include:
1. Developing more stable catalyst formulations that resist deactivation more effectively.
2. Enhancing regeneration methods to improve catalyst recovery and longevity.
3. Optimizing process conditions, such as temperature and feed gas composition, to minimize coke formation.
4. Exploring alternative oxidants that might offer better compatibility with iron zeolites while maintaining high propene selectivity.

These research directions aim to enhance the efficiency, stability, and economic viability of N2O-ODHP, making it a more attractive option for on-site propylene production in localized sites with a low-cost source of N2O.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，它提供了相对于其他氧化剂的优势。N2O作为单氧供体，在铁沸石催化剂上进行ODHP时起着关键作用。它提供了高丙烯选择性，因为其特定作用于丙烷的功能化。然而，该过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂由于焦炭形成而失效。通过空气再生，可以恢复催化剂的初始活性。

已使用多种催化剂进行此过程，包括蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5、Fe硅铝酸盐和Fe-β。这些催化剂在初始活性和抗失活方面表现相似，FeZSM-5略占优势。在C3H8+N2O混合物中使用少量O2会降低丙烯选择性，这进一步强调了N2O作为铁沸石上ODHP优选氧化剂的关键作用。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项，可以采取以下策略：
1. 开发更稳定的催化剂配方，以更有效地抵抗失活。
2. 改进再生方法，以提高催化剂的恢复性和使用寿命。
3. 优化工艺条件，如温度和进气组分，以减少焦炭形成。
4. 探索可能提供更好的与铁沸石兼容性同时保持高丙烯选择性的替代氧化剂。

这些研究方向旨在增强效率、稳定性和经济可行性N2O-ODHP，使其成为具有低成本N2O来源的局部站点上现场丙烯生产更具吸引力的选择。
