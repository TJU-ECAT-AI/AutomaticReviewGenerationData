1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers high propene yields, typically ranging from 20% to 25% at temperatures between 723 and 773 K, making it a highly efficient catalyst compared to other oxidants. Its role in ODHP over iron zeolites is crucial for achieving high propene selectivity, especially when small amounts of oxygen (O2) are present in the reactant mixture. The catalyst's initial performance is notably enhanced by air-regeneration, recovering its activity after deactivation due to coke formation. This property makes it a viable option for continuous propylene production through a cyclic process.

2. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites, such as FeZSM-5, provides a significant advantage due to its high propene yield and selectivity. Unlike other oxidants, N2O does not degrade the catalyst's efficiency as much as oxygen (O2), which can negatively impact propene yield and selectivity. This is because N2O acts as a monooxygen donor, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane without the detrimental effects of oxygen.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, which leads to a decrease in propene yield. The deactivation process can be reversed through air-regeneration, allowing the catalyst to regain its initial performance. Strategies to address these limitations might involve modifying the catalyst's structure or operating conditions to enhance its stability, developing a more efficient coke removal process, or exploring alternative oxidants that do not cause the same level of deactivation. Research directions could focus on improving the catalyst's resistance to coke formation or finding methods to recycle the coke, thereby prolonging the catalyst's life and reducing operational costs.

4. The proposed cyclic process for continuous propylene production demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing steam-activated FeZSM-5 in a reactor system consisting of five fixed-bed reactors arranged in parallel. This configuration allows for the alternation of reaction, purging, and regeneration cycles at a temperature of 723 K, enabling the production of propene yields greater than 20% over a period of 1500 minutes (12 cycles). This innovative approach not only addresses the issue of catalyst deactivation but also provides a scalable solution for on-site propylene production, particularly in locations with a low-cost source of N2O.

1.Nitrous oxide（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，能够在723至773 K的温度范围内提供高达20%到25%的丙烯产率，使其成为与其他氧化剂相比非常高效的催化剂。在铁沸石类催化剂上使用N2O作为氧化剂对于实现高丙烯选择性至关重要，特别是在反应混合物中存在少量氧气（O2）时。通过空气再生，可以恢复催化剂由于焦炭形成导致的活性，从而使其成为连续生产丙烯的循环过程的可行选项。

2.N2O作为铁沸石类催化剂（如FeZSM-5）上的ODHP氧化剂的优点在于其高丙烯产率和选择性。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O不会像氧气（O2）那样对催化剂效率产生如此大的负面影响，因为N2O作为一种单氧供体，能够促进丙烷的脱氢作用，而不会对丙烯产率和选择性造成不利影响。

3.N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的问题主要表现为催化剂表面形成焦炭，导致丙烯产率下降。通过空气再生，可以逆转这一过程，使催化剂恢复其初始性能。解决这些限制的策略可能包括修改催化剂结构或操作条件以增强其稳定性、开发更有效的焦炭去除方法，或者探索不产生同样水平失活的其他氧化剂。研究方向可以集中在改进催化剂对抗焦炭形成的抵抗力，或者找到回收焦炭的方法，从而延长催化剂寿命并降低运营成本。

4.所提出的循环过程为连续丙烯生产的可行性提供了证明，该过程基于由五个串联的固定床反应器组成的系统。在723 K的温度下交替进行反应、净化和再生周期，这种配置允许在1500分钟（12个周期）内连续生产丙烯产率大于20%。这种创新方法不仅解决了催化剂失活的问题，还提供了一种在具有低成本N2O来源的现场生产丙烯的解决方案，特别是在需要在低成本来源的情况下。
