[1] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity is improved in the presence of N2O."
[2] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."
[3] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction."
[4] "High- surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3."
[5] "TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."
[6] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material at similar vanadium surface densities."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) improves propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It reduces catalyst reoxidation, decreasing the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, thus favoring selective oxidation to propene over carbon oxides. 

2. In the ODHP process, various catalysts such as vanadia-based materials on supports like amorphous SiO2, MCM-41, and gamma-alumina (g-Al2O3) are employed. High surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loadings compared to g-Al2O3.

3. The performance of the catalysts in ODHP is affected by the oxidizing agent used. With N2O, the apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) are lower due to its lesser ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This leads to a decrease in the concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, enhancing propene selectivity.

4. The selectivity of propylene in ODHP depends on the support material, even when the vanadium surface densities are similar. Strongly acidic supports like gamma-alumina require full coverage by small VOx aggregates for achieving high selectivity in ODHP.

5. Strategies to address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible might include optimizing the support material to enhance dispersion of VOx species, developing more efficient reduction and reoxidation mechanisms, or exploring synergistic effects with other catalysts to improve stability and selectivity.

1.Nitrous氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的氧化剂，可以提高丙烯选择性，相较于其他氧化剂。它降低了催化剂的再氧化作用，减少了活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度，从而有利于选择性氧化为丙烯而不是碳氧化物。

2. 在ODHP过程中，使用多种催化剂，如含钒材料在硅氧烷、MCM-41和γ-氧化铝（g-Al2O3）等支持物上的负载。高表面积的非结晶硅氧烷和MCM-41能够稳定较高载量的分散表面VOx物种，而γ-Al2O3仅能稳定至较低载量。

3. 催化剂在ODHP过程中的性能受到氧化剂的影响。使用N2O时，显着的转化频率（TOFs）较低，因为N2O的再氧化能力较弱，与O2相比。这导致活性表面晶格氧浓度的减少，从而增强了丙烯选择性。

4. 丙烯的选择性在ODHP中依赖于支撑材料，即使当钒表面密度相似时也是如此。对丙烷具有较强酸性的支撑材料需要完全覆盖小的VOx聚合体，以实现高选择性丙烷转化为丙烯。

5. 为了使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，可能的策略包括优化支撑材料以增强VOx物种的分散，开发更高效的还原和再氧化机制，或探索与其他催化剂的协同作用，以改善稳定性和选择性。
