[1] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[2] "This improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[3] "The effect of the oxidising agent on the catalytic performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O."
[4] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, leading to increased spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in the surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation of propane to propylene over carbon oxides formation. The critical challenges associated with this process include catalyst deactivation and stability. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, strategies could focus on optimizing catalyst design to better withstand N2O-induced reoxidation and improve stability. Research could also explore alternative oxidizing agents or modifying the catalyst-support interaction to enhance selectivity and efficiency under N2O conditions.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂显示了一些优势，特别是在提高丙烯选择性方面比其他氧化剂有明显提升。这种改进归因于N2O较低的催化剂再氧化能力，导致表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的增加空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化丙烷为丙烯而不是碳氧化物形成。与这一过程相关的关键挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题。为了应对这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更可行，可以关注优化催化剂设计以更好地抵抗N2O引起的再氧化和提高稳定性。研究还可以探索替代氧化剂或修改催化剂支持相互作用，以增强在N2O条件下的选择性和效率。
