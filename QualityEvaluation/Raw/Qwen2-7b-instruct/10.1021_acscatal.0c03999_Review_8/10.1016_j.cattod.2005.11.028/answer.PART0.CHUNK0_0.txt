[1] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity is improved in the presence of N2O."
[2] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]."
[3] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction."
[4] "High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3."
[5] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities,supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O)."
[6] "TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."
[7] "However, C3H6 selectivity is improved in the presence of N2O."
[8] "Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 ought to be fully covered by small VOx aggregates in order to achieve a high selectivity in ODP."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) improves propylene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, primarily because it reduces the reoxidation of catalysts, allowing for better spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation of propane to propene over carbon oxides formation.

2. In the ODHP process, various catalysts like vanadia-based materials on supports such as amorphous silica (SiO2), well-ordered MCM-41, and gamma-alumina (g-Al2O3) are employed. 

3. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, especially when using N2O as an oxidant, due to its lesser ability to reoxidize catalysts compared to oxygen. Strategies might involve optimizing the support material to ensure complete coverage of small vanadia aggregates on strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3, enhancing selectivity.

4. Research directions could focus on developing new catalyst compositions or modifying existing ones to better utilize N2O as an oxidant, improving catalyst stability, and increasing propylene selectivity. This could involve studying the interaction between N2O and catalyst surfaces, optimizing the catalyst structure, and exploring synergistic effects with other gases or additives.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中，与其它氧化剂相比，使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，主要原因是N2O降低了催化剂的再氧化能力，使得表面VOx物种中的活性氧位点实现更好的空间分离，从而有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯而非碳氧化物。

2. 在ODHP过程中，使用的催化剂包括以不同载体如无定形二氧化硅（SiO2）、有序MCM-41、和γ氧化铝（g-Al2O3）为基础的钒基材料。

3. 需要应对的挑战包括催化剂的失活和稳定性问题，尤其是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时，由于N2O的再氧化能力较弱。策略可能包括优化支持材料，确保在强酸性支持物如g-Al2O3上完全覆盖小的钒化物团簇，以提高选择性。

4. 研究方向可以集中在开发新的催化剂组成或改进现有组成，以更好地利用N2O作为氧化剂，提高催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这可能涉及研究N2O与催化剂表面的相互作用，优化催化剂结构，并探索与其他气体或添加剂协同效应的可能性。
