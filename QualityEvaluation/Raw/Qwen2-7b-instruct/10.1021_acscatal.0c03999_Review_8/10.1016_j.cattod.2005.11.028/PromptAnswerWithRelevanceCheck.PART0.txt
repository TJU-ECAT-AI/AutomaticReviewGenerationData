[2] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]."
[3] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction."

[5] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities,supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O)."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) improves propylene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, primarily because it reduces the reoxidation of catalysts, allowing for better spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation of propane to propene over carbon oxides formation.

2. In the ODHP process, various catalysts like vanadia-based materials on supports such as amorphous silica (SiO2), well-ordered MCM-41, and gamma-alumina (g-Al2O3) are employed. 

3. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability, especially when using N2O as an oxidant, due to its lesser ability to reoxidize catalysts compared to oxygen. Strategies might involve optimizing the support material to ensure complete coverage of small vanadia aggregates on strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3, enhancing selectivity.

4. Research directions could focus on developing new catalyst compositions or modifying existing ones to better utilize N2O as an oxidant, improving catalyst stability, and increasing propylene selectivity. This could involve studying the interaction between N2O and catalyst surfaces, optimizing the catalyst structure, and exploring synergistic effects with other gases or additives.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中，与其它氧化剂相比，使用硝酸氧化氮（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，主要原因是N2O降低了催化剂的再氧化能力，使得表面VOx物种中的活性氧位点实现更好的空间分离，从而有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯而非碳氧化物。

2. 在ODHP过程中，使用的催化剂包括以不同载体如无定形二氧化硅（SiO2）、有序MCM-41、和γ氧化铝（g-Al2O3）为基础的钒基材料。

3. 需要应对的挑战包括催化剂的失活和稳定性问题，尤其是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时，由于N2O的再氧化能力较弱。策略可能包括优化支持材料，确保在强酸性支持物如g-Al2O3上完全覆盖小的钒化物团簇，以提高选择性。

4. 研究方向可以集中在开发新的催化剂组成或改进现有组成，以更好地利用N2O作为氧化剂，提高催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这可能涉及研究N2O与催化剂表面的相互作用，优化催化剂结构，并探索与其他气体或添加剂协同效应的可能性。

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) improves propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It reduces catalyst reoxidation, decreasing the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, thus favoring selective oxidation to propene over carbon oxides. 

2. In the ODHP process, various catalysts such as vanadia-based materials on supports like amorphous SiO2, MCM-41, and gamma-alumina (g-Al2O3) are employed. High surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loadings compared to g-Al2O3.

3. The performance of the catalysts in ODHP is affected by the oxidizing agent used. With N2O, the apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) are lower due to its lesser ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This leads to a decrease in the concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, enhancing propene selectivity.

4. The selectivity of propylene in ODHP depends on the support material, even when the vanadium surface densities are similar. Strongly acidic supports like gamma-alumina require full coverage by small VOx aggregates for achieving high selectivity in ODHP.

5. Strategies to address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible might include optimizing the support material to enhance dispersion of VOx species, developing more efficient reduction and reoxidation mechanisms, or exploring synergistic effects with other catalysts to improve stability and selectivity.

1.Nitrous氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的氧化剂，可以提高丙烯选择性，相较于其他氧化剂。它降低了催化剂的再氧化作用，减少了活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度，从而有利于选择性氧化为丙烯而不是碳氧化物。

2. 在ODHP过程中，使用多种催化剂，如含钒材料在硅氧烷、MCM-41和γ-氧化铝（g-Al2O3）等支持物上的负载。高表面积的非结晶硅氧烷和MCM-41能够稳定较高载量的分散表面VOx物种，而γ-Al2O3仅能稳定至较低载量。

3. 催化剂在ODHP过程中的性能受到氧化剂的影响。使用N2O时，显着的转化频率（TOFs）较低，因为N2O的再氧化能力较弱，与O2相比。这导致活性表面晶格氧浓度的减少，从而增强了丙烯选择性。

4. 丙烯的选择性在ODHP中依赖于支撑材料，即使当钒表面密度相似时也是如此。对丙烷具有较强酸性的支撑材料需要完全覆盖小的VOx聚合体，以实现高选择性丙烷转化为丙烯。

5. 为了使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，可能的策略包括优化支撑材料以增强VOx物种的分散，开发更高效的还原和再氧化机制，或探索与其他催化剂的协同作用，以改善稳定性和选择性。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages. It improves propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, allowing for more efficient production of propylene. The study involved various catalysts, including vanadia-based materials supported on amorphous silica, well-ordered MCM-41 silica, and gamma-alumina. The nature and distribution of vanadium oxides (VOx) species play a crucial role in the catalytic performance. N2O enables tuning of propylene selectivity and achieves spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species, leading to increased selectivity. Strongly acidic supports like gamma-alumina require full coverage by small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity in ODHP.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more practical, strategies could involve optimizing the catalyst design for better dispersion and stability, improving support materials to enhance selectivity, and developing methods to efficiently recycle N2O and manage its potential environmental impact. Research could focus on understanding the precise mechanisms of N2O reoxidation and its effects on catalyst activity and selectivity, aiming to optimize these parameters for enhanced performance.

在氧化脱氢反应中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优势。它提高了丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比，使得丙烯生产更加高效。研究涉及各种催化剂，包括范德华材料，支撑在非晶二氧化硅、有序MCM-41二氧化硅和γ-氧化铝上。VOx物种的性质及其分布对催化性能至关重要。N2O允许调整丙烯选择性和实现表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离，从而提高选择性。强酸性支持如γ-氧化铝需要完全覆盖由小的VOx团簇组成的表面以实现高选择性。

为了使N2O-ODHP更实际，可以采用策略优化催化剂设计以提高分散性和稳定性，改进支持材料以增强选择性，并开发方法有效地回收N2O并管理其可能的环境影响。研究可以集中在理解N2O重新氧化的精确机制及其对催化剂活性和选择性的影响，旨在优化这些参数以提高性能。

研究方向可关注于优化催化剂结构、改善支持材料、开发N2O回收技术以及环境影响评估等方面，以期实现N2O-ODHP过程的高效、可持续发展。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, leading to increased spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in the surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation of propane to propylene over carbon oxides formation. The critical challenges associated with this process include catalyst deactivation and stability. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, strategies could focus on optimizing catalyst design to better withstand N2O-induced reoxidation and improve stability. Research could also explore alternative oxidizing agents or modifying the catalyst-support interaction to enhance selectivity and efficiency under N2O conditions.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O reduces the reoxidation of the catalyst, leading to an increase in the concentration of active lattice oxygen in the surface VOx species. This results in a decrease in the surface density of oxidizing sites, which in turn favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the formation of COx products. The key catalysts employed in this process include vanadia-based materials supported on amorphous silica, MCM-41, and gamma-alumina. The critical challenge is the potential for catalyst deactivation and loss of stability, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the catalyst composition, modifying the support material, or developing more robust catalyst structures that maintain high selectivity even under the less favorable reoxidation conditions of N2O. Research directions could focus on enhancing the stability of the catalysts against reoxidation, improving the selectivity of propene production, and developing more efficient methods for the regeneration of the catalysts after periods of use.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几种优势，在丙烯选择性方面。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O降低了催化剂的重新氧化，导致表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧浓度的增加。这导致了氧化位点表面密度的降低，从而有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯而不是形成COx产物。所使用的关键催化剂包括以非晶态二氧化硅、MCM-41和γ-氧化铝为支撑的范德华材料。关键挑战是催化剂失活和稳定性丧失，尤其是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成、修改支撑材料或开发更耐用的催化剂结构，以维持高选择性丙烯生产，即使在N2O不那么有利的重新氧化条件下也是如此。研究方向可以集中在提高催化剂抵抗重新氧化的能力上，改善丙烯生成的选择性，并开发更有效的催化剂再生方法。
