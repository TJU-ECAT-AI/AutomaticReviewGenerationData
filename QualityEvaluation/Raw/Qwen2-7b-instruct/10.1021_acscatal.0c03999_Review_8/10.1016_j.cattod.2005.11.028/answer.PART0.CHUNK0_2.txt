[1] "The effect of the nature and distribution of VOx species over amorphous and well-ordered (MCM-41) SiO2 as well as over g-Al2O3 on their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 and N2O was studied."
[2] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[3] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[4] "Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 ought to be fully covered by small VOx aggregates in order to achieve a high selectivity in ODP."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages. It improves propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, allowing for more efficient production of propylene. The study involved various catalysts, including vanadia-based materials supported on amorphous silica, well-ordered MCM-41 silica, and gamma-alumina. The nature and distribution of vanadium oxides (VOx) species play a crucial role in the catalytic performance. N2O enables tuning of propylene selectivity and achieves spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species, leading to increased selectivity. Strongly acidic supports like gamma-alumina require full coverage by small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity in ODHP.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more practical, strategies could involve optimizing the catalyst design for better dispersion and stability, improving support materials to enhance selectivity, and developing methods to efficiently recycle N2O and manage its potential environmental impact. Research could focus on understanding the precise mechanisms of N2O reoxidation and its effects on catalyst activity and selectivity, aiming to optimize these parameters for enhanced performance.

在氧化脱氢反应中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优势。它提高了丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比，使得丙烯生产更加高效。研究涉及各种催化剂，包括范德华材料，支撑在非晶二氧化硅、有序MCM-41二氧化硅和γ-氧化铝上。VOx物种的性质及其分布对催化性能至关重要。N2O允许调整丙烯选择性和实现表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离，从而提高选择性。强酸性支持如γ-氧化铝需要完全覆盖由小的VOx团簇组成的表面以实现高选择性。

为了使N2O-ODHP更实际，可以采用策略优化催化剂设计以提高分散性和稳定性，改进支持材料以增强选择性，并开发方法有效地回收N2O并管理其可能的环境影响。研究可以集中在理解N2O重新氧化的精确机制及其对催化剂活性和选择性的影响，旨在优化这些参数以提高性能。

研究方向可关注于优化催化剂结构、改善支持材料、开发N2O回收技术以及环境影响评估等方面，以期实现N2O-ODHP过程的高效、可持续发展。
