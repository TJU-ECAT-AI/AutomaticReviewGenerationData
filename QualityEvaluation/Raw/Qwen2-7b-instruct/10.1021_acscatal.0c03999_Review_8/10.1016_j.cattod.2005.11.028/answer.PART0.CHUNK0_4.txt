[1] "As compared to the alumina support, differently structured SiO2 supports stabilise highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading."
[2] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[3] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[4] "Catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."
[5] "Such a decrease favours selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active site for the former reaction."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O reduces the reoxidation of the catalyst, leading to an increase in the concentration of active lattice oxygen in the surface VOx species. This results in a decrease in the surface density of oxidizing sites, which in turn favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the formation of COx products. The key catalysts employed in this process include vanadia-based materials supported on amorphous silica, MCM-41, and gamma-alumina. The critical challenge is the potential for catalyst deactivation and loss of stability, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the catalyst composition, modifying the support material, or developing more robust catalyst structures that maintain high selectivity even under the less favorable reoxidation conditions of N2O. Research directions could focus on enhancing the stability of the catalysts against reoxidation, improving the selectivity of propene production, and developing more efficient methods for the regeneration of the catalysts after periods of use.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几种优势，在丙烯选择性方面。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O降低了催化剂的重新氧化，导致表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧浓度的增加。这导致了氧化位点表面密度的降低，从而有利于选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯而不是形成COx产物。所使用的关键催化剂包括以非晶态二氧化硅、MCM-41和γ-氧化铝为支撑的范德华材料。关键挑战是催化剂失活和稳定性丧失，尤其是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成、修改支撑材料或开发更耐用的催化剂结构，以维持高选择性丙烯生产，即使在N2O不那么有利的重新氧化条件下也是如此。研究方向可以集中在提高催化剂抵抗重新氧化的能力上，改善丙烯生成的选择性，并开发更有效的催化剂再生方法。
