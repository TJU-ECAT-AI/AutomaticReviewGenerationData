[1] "In the field of hydrosilylation reactions, gold was ignored until 2000 when Hosomi and co-workers [19] described the first example of silane addition to aldehydes using a catalytic amount of AuCl(PPh3)."
[2] "The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was then evaluated in the hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH; the reactions were performed without solvent, at 90 C, with a molar ratio substrate/Au = 2000 mmol/mmol."
[3] "The morphological features of these catalytic systems were investigated by HRTEM."
[4] "Analogously to the results of the HRTEM analysis on the LC samples (Fig. 1), the histograms of the size distribution of metal particles of the three catalysts appeared quite narrow (2 12 nm) with the mean diameter slightly increasing from 4.4 to 5.3 nm, when the metal loading was increased from 0.05% to 2.00% (w/w)."
[5] "In this last case, general, HRTEM micrographs revealed a hemispheric/polyhedral shape for the gold nanoparticles deposited on the metal oxides, with a quite wide area of interaction with the support (see inset in Fig. 3)."
[6] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."

1. The first example of using gold in hydrosilylation reactions was described by Hosomi and colleagues in 2000, utilizing AuCl(PPh3) as a catalyst for the addition of silanes to aldehydes.

2. The hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH was conducted under conditions of 90°C and a substrate-to-gold molar ratio of 2000 mmol/mmol, without solvent.

3. The structural characteristics of the catalyst systems were examined through HRTEM.

4. The size distribution of metal particles in the catalysts prepared with different metal loadings showed narrow distributions, with the mean particle size increasing slightly from 4.4 nm to 5.3 nm as the metal loading increased from 0.05% to 2.00%.

5. The HRTEM micrographs of the gold nanoparticles deposited on metal oxides exhibited hemispheric or polyhedral shapes, with a broad interaction area between the nanoparticles and the support.

6. Contrary to the general trend observed with other supports, the catalysts based on ZrO2 and TiO2 did not maintain the expected behavior. An increased contact between gold and the metal oxide led to a decrease in the number of active sites, yet a higher gold loading improved the catalytic efficiency of these catalysts.

1. 2000年，Hosomi和同事们首次描述了使用AuCl(PPh3)作为催化剂将硅烷添加到醛中的例子，这是在hydrosilylation反应领域的第一个例子。

2. 在90°C条件下，采用2000 mmol/mmol的底物与金的摩尔比，没有溶剂的情况下，进行了1-hexyne与Et3SiH的hydrosilylation反应。

3. 对催化剂系统的结构特征进行了HRTEM研究。

4. 准备的不同金属负载量的催化剂中，金属颗粒的尺寸分布较窄，随着金属负载量从0.05%增加到2.00%，平均颗粒大小略微增加，从4.4 nm到5.3 nm。

5. HRTEM微图显示，金属氧化物上沉积的金纳米粒子具有半球形或多面体形状，与支持物之间有广泛的相互作用区域。

6. 与其它支持物相反，基于ZrO2和TiO2的催化剂没有遵循预期的趋势。金与金属氧化物之间的增强接触导致活性位点数量减少，但更高的金负载提高了这些催化剂的催化效率。
