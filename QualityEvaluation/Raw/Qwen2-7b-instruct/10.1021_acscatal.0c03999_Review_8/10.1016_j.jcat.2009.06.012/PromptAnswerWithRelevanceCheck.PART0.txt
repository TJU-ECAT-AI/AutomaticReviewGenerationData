[1] "We have found that solvated gold atoms prepared according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselectivity (>90%) for the E isomer."
[2] "Two main factors seem to play an important role in the catalytic performance of the supported species: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support."
[3] "Starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with different metal loadings on the matrices can be prepared without loss of reactivity."
[4] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing the synthesis process to control the size and distribution of gold particles, enhancing the stability of the catalyst through modifications of the support, or exploring alternative materials for the support that minimize the impact of the interfacial contact. Research directions might include developing novel catalyst designs that incorporate unique gold particle morphology or employing advanced characterization techniques to better understand the role of particle size, shape, and support interaction in determining catalytic activity and stability.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，我们发现它在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与其它氧化剂相比。影响催化性能的关键因素是金颗粒的大小及其与支持物的相互作用。通过稀释的金属蒸汽合成溶液，可以制备高度分散的小金颗粒，这些颗粒表现出极高的特定活性。相比之下，浓度较高的溶化金属原子导致支持纳米簇的较大尺寸分布和直径，使它们完全无效。此外，从稀释的Au/CH3COCH3共凝聚开始，可以通过不牺牲活性来合成具有不同金属负载的受支持催化剂。然而，对于ZrO2-和TiO2支持的催化剂而言，Au与金属氧化物之间的界面接触减少了活性位点的数量，增加金含量后提高了这些物种的催化效率。

为了应对这些局限性，策略可能包括优化合成过程以控制金颗粒的大小和分布、通过修改支撑材料提高催化剂稳定性，或探索减少界面接触影响的替代支撑材料。研究方向可能包括开发集成了独特金颗粒形态的新催化剂设计，或者利用高级表征技术更好地理解颗粒大小、形状和支撑相互作用在确定催化活性和稳定性中的作用。

[1] "In the field of hydrosilylation reactions, gold was ignored until 2000 when Hosomi and co-workers [19] described the first example of silane addition to aldehydes using a catalytic amount of AuCl(PPh3)."
[2] "The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was then evaluated in the hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH; the reactions were performed without solvent, at 90 C, with a molar ratio substrate/Au = 2000 mmol/mmol."
[3] "The morphological features of these catalytic systems were investigated by HRTEM."
[4] "Analogously to the results of the HRTEM analysis on the LC samples (Fig. 1), the histograms of the size distribution of metal particles of the three catalysts appeared quite narrow (2 12 nm) with the mean diameter slightly increasing from 4.4 to 5.3 nm, when the metal loading was increased from 0.05% to 2.00% (w/w)."
[5] "In this last case, general, HRTEM micrographs revealed a hemispheric/polyhedral shape for the gold nanoparticles deposited on the metal oxides, with a quite wide area of interaction with the support (see inset in Fig. 3)."
[6] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."

1. The first example of using gold in hydrosilylation reactions was described by Hosomi and colleagues in 2000, utilizing AuCl(PPh3) as a catalyst for the addition of silanes to aldehydes.

2. The hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne with Et3SiH was conducted under conditions of 90°C and a substrate-to-gold molar ratio of 2000 mmol/mmol, without solvent.

3. The structural characteristics of the catalyst systems were examined through HRTEM.

4. The size distribution of metal particles in the catalysts prepared with different metal loadings showed narrow distributions, with the mean particle size increasing slightly from 4.4 nm to 5.3 nm as the metal loading increased from 0.05% to 2.00%.

5. The HRTEM micrographs of the gold nanoparticles deposited on metal oxides exhibited hemispheric or polyhedral shapes, with a broad interaction area between the nanoparticles and the support.

6. Contrary to the general trend observed with other supports, the catalysts based on ZrO2 and TiO2 did not maintain the expected behavior. An increased contact between gold and the metal oxide led to a decrease in the number of active sites, yet a higher gold loading improved the catalytic efficiency of these catalysts.

5. HRTEM微图显示，金属氧化物上沉积的金纳米粒子具有半球形或多面体形状，与支持物之间有广泛的相互作用区域。

6. 与其它支持物相反，基于ZrO2和TiO2的催化剂没有遵循预期的趋势。金与金属氧化物之间的增强接触导致活性位点数量减少，但更高的金负载提高了这些催化剂的催化效率。

[1] "The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support."
[2] "The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[3] "Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals."
[4] "The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts."
[5] "In contrast, when the hydrosilylation process was performed in the presence of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 with a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the value of the specific activity was about half of that of the 0.10% (w/w) sample."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Nitrous oxide provides high propylene yields due to its unique chemical properties, which enable more efficient and selective reactions. The process typically employs various catalysts, including precious metals like palladium, platinum, and rhodium, as well as supported catalysts on materials such as silica, alumina, and titania. These catalysts facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene through a series of complex redox reactions.

However, the process faces significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and instability. Over time, catalysts can lose activity due to poisoning, sintering, and agglomeration of the active sites. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, researchers are exploring strategies such as developing new catalyst compositions with improved stability and selectivity, enhancing reactor design to optimize gas flow and temperature control, and implementing advanced monitoring and control systems to detect and mitigate deactivation mechanisms in real-time. Additionally, studies are focusing on understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms involved in ODHP, aiming to tailor catalyst properties to maximize propylene production while minimizing byproduct formation and energy consumption.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势明显。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提供了更高的丙烯产率，这得益于其独特的化学性质，能够更高效、更选择性地进行反应。该过程通常采用多种催化剂，包括钯、铂、铑等贵金属，以及在硅、氧化铝和二氧化钛等材料上的负载催化剂。这些催化剂通过一系列复杂的还原氧化反应促进丙烷转化为丙烯。

然而，该过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂失活和不稳定性。随着时间的推移，催化剂可能会因中毒、活性中心聚集和烧结而失去活性。为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究人员正在探索策略，如开发具有更好稳定性和选择性的新型催化剂组成，优化反应器设计以优化气体流动和温度控制，并实施先进的监控和控制系统以实时检测和缓解失活机制。此外，研究正在专注于深入了解ODHP涉及的详细反应机理，旨在根据最大化丙烯生产同时减少副产品形成和能量消耗来定制催化剂属性。
