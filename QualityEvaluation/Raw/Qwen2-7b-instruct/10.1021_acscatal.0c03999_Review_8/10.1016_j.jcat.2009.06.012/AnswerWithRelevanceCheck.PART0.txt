          [1] "The use of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity."
          [2] "Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including metal oxides, transition metal complexes, and mixed metal oxide systems."
          [3] "Critical challenges in the N2O-ODHP process include catalyst deactivation and stability, which limit its practical implementation."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，我们发现它在丙烯选择性方面与其他氧化剂相比具有几个优势。影响催化性能的关键因素是金颗粒的大小及其与支撑物的相互作用。稀释的金属蒸汽合成溶液允许制备高度分散的小金颗粒，显示出优异的特定活性。相比之下，浓度过高的溶剂化金属原子导致在支撑物上的纳米簇具有较大的尺寸分布和直径，使其无效。此外，从稀释的Au/CH3COCH3共凝聚开始，可以合成具有不同金属负载的受支撑催化剂而不牺牲活性。然而，对于ZrO2-和TiO2支撑的催化剂而言，Au与金属氧化物之间的界面接触减少了活性位点的数量，当金含量增加时，提高了催化效率。

          [1] "The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support."
          [2] "The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
          [3] "Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals."
          [4] "The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts."

          金的催化性能由两个主要因素定义：颗粒大小和支持物的选择。在1-hexyne与三乙基硅烷反应中得到的结果，表明在Au/c-Al2O3（0.05 mol％）存在的情况下，这些金催化剂的高选择性和出色的特定活性。确实，金与三键配位的能力与其他过渡金属无平行可比。金纳米粒子的尺寸严格取决于共凝聚前体中的金属浓度，但仅轻微受到用于制备支持催化剂的无机矩阵性质的影响。

          [1] "We have found that solvated gold atoms prepared according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselectivity (>90%) for the E isomer."
          [2] "Two main factors seem to play an important role in the catalytic performance of the supported species: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support."
          [3] "Starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with different metal loadings on the matrices can be prepared without loss of reactivity."
          [4] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."
