[1] "The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support."
[2] "The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[3] "Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals."
[4] "The dimensions of the gold nanoparticles depended strictly on the metal concentration of the co-condensate precursors, but were only slightly affected by the nature of the inorganic matrices chosen for the preparation of the supported catalysts."
[5] "In contrast, when the hydrosilylation process was performed in the presence of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 with a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the value of the specific activity was about half of that of the 0.10% (w/w) sample."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Nitrous oxide provides high propylene yields due to its unique chemical properties, which enable more efficient and selective reactions. The process typically employs various catalysts, including precious metals like palladium, platinum, and rhodium, as well as supported catalysts on materials such as silica, alumina, and titania. These catalysts facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene through a series of complex redox reactions.

However, the process faces significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and instability. Over time, catalysts can lose activity due to poisoning, sintering, and agglomeration of the active sites. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, researchers are exploring strategies such as developing new catalyst compositions with improved stability and selectivity, enhancing reactor design to optimize gas flow and temperature control, and implementing advanced monitoring and control systems to detect and mitigate deactivation mechanisms in real-time. Additionally, studies are focusing on understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms involved in ODHP, aiming to tailor catalyst properties to maximize propylene production while minimizing byproduct formation and energy consumption.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势明显。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O提供了更高的丙烯产率，这得益于其独特的化学性质，能够更高效、更选择性地进行反应。该过程通常采用多种催化剂，包括钯、铂、铑等贵金属，以及在硅、氧化铝和二氧化钛等材料上的负载催化剂。这些催化剂通过一系列复杂的还原氧化反应促进丙烷转化为丙烯。

然而，该过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂失活和不稳定性。随着时间的推移，催化剂可能会因中毒、活性中心聚集和烧结而失去活性。为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究人员正在探索策略，如开发具有更好稳定性和选择性的新型催化剂组成，优化反应器设计以优化气体流动和温度控制，并实施先进的监控和控制系统以实时检测和缓解失活机制。此外，研究正在专注于深入了解ODHP涉及的详细反应机理，旨在根据最大化丙烯生产同时减少副产品形成和能量消耗来定制催化剂属性。
