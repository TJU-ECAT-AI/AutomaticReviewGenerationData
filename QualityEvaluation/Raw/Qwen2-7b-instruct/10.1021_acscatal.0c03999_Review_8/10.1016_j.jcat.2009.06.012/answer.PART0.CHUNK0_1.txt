[1] "We have found that solvated gold atoms prepared according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselectivity (>90%) for the E isomer."
[2] "Two main factors seem to play an important role in the catalytic performance of the supported species: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support."
[3] "Starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with different metal loadings on the matrices can be prepared without loss of reactivity."
[4] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that it offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis solutions enable the preparation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display excellent specific activity. In contrast, concentrated solvated metal atoms lead to supported nanoclusters with larger size distributions and diameters, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, starting from a diluted Au/CH3COCH3 co-condensation, supported catalysts with varying metal loadings can be synthesized without sacrificing reactivity. However, for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide diminishes the number of active sites, improving catalytic efficiency when the gold content increases.

Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing the synthesis process to control the size and distribution of gold particles, enhancing the stability of the catalyst through modifications of the support, or exploring alternative materials for the support that minimize the impact of the interfacial contact. Research directions might include developing novel catalyst designs that incorporate unique gold particle morphology or employing advanced characterization techniques to better understand the role of particle size, shape, and support interaction in determining catalytic activity and stability.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，我们发现它在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与其它氧化剂相比。影响催化性能的关键因素是金颗粒的大小及其与支持物的相互作用。通过稀释的金属蒸汽合成溶液，可以制备高度分散的小金颗粒，这些颗粒表现出极高的特定活性。相比之下，浓度较高的溶化金属原子导致支持纳米簇的较大尺寸分布和直径，使它们完全无效。此外，从稀释的Au/CH3COCH3共凝聚开始，可以通过不牺牲活性来合成具有不同金属负载的受支持催化剂。然而，对于ZrO2-和TiO2支持的催化剂而言，Au与金属氧化物之间的界面接触减少了活性位点的数量，增加金含量后提高了这些物种的催化效率。

为了应对这些局限性，策略可能包括优化合成过程以控制金颗粒的大小和分布、通过修改支撑材料提高催化剂稳定性，或探索减少界面接触影响的替代支撑材料。研究方向可能包括开发集成了独特金颗粒形态的新催化剂设计，或者利用高级表征技术更好地理解颗粒大小、形状和支撑相互作用在确定催化活性和稳定性中的作用。
