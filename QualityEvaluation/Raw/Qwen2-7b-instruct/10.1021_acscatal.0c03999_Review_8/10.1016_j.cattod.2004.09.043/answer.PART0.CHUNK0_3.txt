[1] "In the presence of CO2: (i) catalytic activity is higher, (ii) selectivity to propylene decreases, (iii) catalysts work in a fully oxidized state, (iv) the formation of carbonaceous products is inhibited, and (v) some oxygenated product is formed."
[2] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."
[3] "The addition of 3 vol.% CO2 in the gaseous mixture on a Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst induces a detrimental effect on the activity of such a catalyst (T50 = 703 versus 683 K)."
[4] "The injection of controlled amounts of H2 into the feed can dramatically improve the efficiency in the combustion process."
[5] "CO2 and N2O play an important role in reactions in the presence of oxygen in ODP and CCM. CO2 promotes oxidation whereas N2O promotes reduction of catalytic sites during the ODP reaction."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), leading to higher activity of the catalysts and improved selectivity towards propylene compared to other oxidants. Its ability to inhibit the formation of carbonaceous products enhances the efficiency of the process. The catalysts used typically consist of NiMoO4 and CeO2, or NiMoO4 supported on vanadium-containing MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts. Challenges include deactivation and instability of the catalysts. Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing the use of N2O as a promoter, developing more stable catalyst compositions, and conducting further research on the interaction mechanisms between N2O and the catalysts.

2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) significantly improves the selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process, particularly in the use of selective mesoporous catalysts. This enhancement offers broad prospects for practical applications in refining industries.

3. The addition of 3% CO2 in the gas mixture reduces the activity of a Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst in the combustion of methane (CCM), while it improves the activity of Pd/CeZrO catalysts in the same process.

4. Introducing controlled amounts of hydrogen (H2) into the feed can dramatically enhance the efficiency of the combustion process, leading to catalysts with higher performance and still very high selectivity.

5. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) play crucial roles in reactions involving oxygen, affecting the selectivity in both oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and catalytic combustion of methane (CCM). CO2 promotes oxidation, while N2O facilitates reduction of catalytic sites during ODHP, impacting the overall selectivity of the catalysts.

1.N2O在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中作为氧化剂，能够提高催化剂活性和丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂具有优势。其抑制碳质产物生成的能力增强了过程效率。通常使用的催化剂包括NiMoO4和CeO2，或者NiMoO4支持在范德华MCM-41微孔催化剂上。挑战包括催化剂的失活和稳定性问题。策略可能包括优化N2O作为促进剂的使用、开发更稳定的催化剂组成，并对N2O与催化剂的相互作用机制进行进一步研究。

2. N2O显著提高了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的选择性，尤其是在使用选择性微孔催化剂的情况下，这为实际应用提供了广阔前景。

3. 在甲烷燃烧（CCM）中，将3% CO2加入气体混合物会降低Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂的活性，而对Pd/CeZrO催化剂的活性产生积极影响。

4. 将一定量的氢气（H2）注入流体中可以大幅提高燃烧过程的效率，导致催化剂性能更高，选择性仍然很高。

5. 硝酸盐氧化氮（N2O）和二氧化碳（CO2）在涉及氧气的反应中扮演关键角色，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）和甲烷催化燃烧（CCM）中影响催化剂的选择性。CO2促进氧化，而N2O有助于催化剂位点的还原，影响整体选择性。
