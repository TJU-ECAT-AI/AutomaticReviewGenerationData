[1] "With respect to the results obtained in the absence of CO2, the main consequences of the addition of CO2 in the gas feed were: (i) an increase in the conversion of propane, (ii) a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propylene, and (iii) an increase of the CO2 yield."
[2] "However, if CO2 is added to the feed, coke formation is inhibited and the catalyst does not deactivate."
[3] "During the catalytic reaction, CO2 succeeds in maintaining the structure of the catalysts in a rather higher oxidized state, even when a relatively high hydrocarbon to oxygen ratio is applied, thus giving quite a reductive atmosphere."
[4] "It was also previously demonstrated that the addition of 300 ppm N2O modifies the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the same reaction by, principally: (i) decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, (ii) increasing the yield and the selectivity to propylene, and (iii) decreasing the yield and the selectivity to CO2."
[5] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way."
[6] "However, these were preliminary results which need to be confirmed further."
[7] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non- selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."
[8] "In order to explain the activating effect of CO2 noticed on Pd/CeZrO catalysts during the CCM, we have previously suggested that enrichment in low BE O 1s species, as determined by XPS, could be invoked."
[9] "Obviously, the presence of CO2 in the feed does not induce the development of adsorbed carbonate species on Pd/CeZrO based catalysts whereas it does on Pd/alumina catalysts."
[10] "Moreover, there is no variation of the Ce/Zr ratio between the tests made with and without CO2 in the flux, indicating that no migration of ceria and/or zirconia can be invoked in order to explain the activating effect of CO2 on Pd/ Ce1xZrxO2 catalysts."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key insights emerge. Firstly, N2O plays a crucial role in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It increases the conversion of propane, decreases the yield and selectivity of propylene, and increases CO2 yield. Importantly, N2O inhibits coke formation and maintains catalyst stability, preventing deactivation. It achieves this by maintaining the catalysts in a higher oxidized state, even under a reductive atmosphere. 

In contrast to oxygen, N2O has a unique ability to inhibit the formation of non-selective sites on catalysts, increasing propylene selectivity. However, preliminary findings suggest that the full potential of N2O's selectivity-enhancing capabilities needs further investigation. The presence of both oxygen and N2O together can fully explain the enhanced selectivity of catalysts in ODHP, attributing it to the modulation of their oxidation states during the reaction.

Regarding challenges, deactivation and stability issues remain significant obstacles. While N2O inhibits coke formation, its impact on catalyst longevity requires further exploration. Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing the dosage of N2O, developing more stable catalysts, and conducting in-depth research into the interaction between N2O and different catalyst materials. The potential for N2O-ODHP to become a viable industrial option hinges on overcoming these challenges, particularly in enhancing catalyst stability and efficiency.

To summarize, N2O exhibits promise as an oxidant in ODHP, offering selectivity enhancements and stability benefits. However, further research is needed to refine its application, particularly in addressing catalyst longevity and optimizing its integration into existing industrial processes. The key lies in fine-tuning the use of N2O and understanding its complex interactions with various catalyst materials to realize its full potential in practical applications.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，揭示了一些关键见解。首先，N2O在提高丙烯选择性方面表现出独特优势，相较于其他氧化剂。它能增加丙烷转化率，降低丙烯产率和选择性，并增加二氧化碳产率。重要的是，N2O能够抑制焦炭形成并维持催化剂稳定性，防止其失活。通过保持催化剂处于较高氧化状态，即使在还原气氛下也能实现这一目标。

与氧气相比，N2O具有独特的能力，能够抑制催化剂上非选择性位点的形成，从而提高丙烯选择性。然而，初步研究发现，N2O全潜力的选择性增强能力需要进一步探讨。氧气和N2O的共存能够完全解释催化剂在ODHP中的高选择性，归因于反应过程中对它们氧化状态的调节。

面临的挑战主要集中在催化剂的失效和稳定性问题。尽管N2O能够抑制焦炭形成，但其对催化剂寿命的影响仍需深入研究。应对这些挑战的策略可能包括优化N2O的剂量、开发更稳定的催化剂以及深入了解N2O与不同催化剂材料之间的相互作用。N2O-ODHP成为工业可行选项的关键在于克服这些挑战，特别是在增强催化剂稳定性和效率方面。

总结而言，N2O在ODHP中显示出作为氧化剂的潜力，提供选择性和稳定性的提升。然而，为了实现其在实际应用中的全潜力，需要进一步研究如何精确使用N2O以及理解其与各种催化剂材料之间复杂相互作用的方式。关键在于精细调整N2O的使用和深入理解其特性，以实现在现有工业流程中的有效集成。
