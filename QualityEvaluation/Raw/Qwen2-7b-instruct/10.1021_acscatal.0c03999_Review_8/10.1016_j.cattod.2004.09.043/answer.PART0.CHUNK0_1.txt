[1] "Previously [47], we reported the effects brought about by the introduction of CO2 or N2O as gaseous additives during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propylene using NiMoO4 alone or in mixture with a-Sb2O4 as catalysts. With respect to the results obtained in the absence of CO2, the main consequences of the addition of CO2 in the gas feed were: (i) an increase in the conversion of propane, (ii) a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propylene, and (iii) an increase of the CO2 yield."
[2] "In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state and, consequently, in a more selective way. We have suggested that N2O could inhibit the adsorption of O2, thus limiting the formation of the non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[3] "However, the injection of controlled amounts of H2 into the feed can dramatically improve the efficiency in the combustion process. Catalysts with higher performances and still very high selectivity can be obtained in this way."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process, showing advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It works by reducing the catalytic sites to a more selective state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen, thus limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and decreasing the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This results in enhanced propylene selectivity.

2. Challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. Deactivation can occur due to the rapid consumption of oxygen species on the catalyst surface, leading to a decrease in activity. Stability is also a concern as the reaction conditions need to be finely tuned to maintain optimal catalyst performance.

3. Strategies to address these limitations include the simultaneous injection of N2O and CO2 during the reaction, which can help maintain the oxidation state of active sites in a controlled manner. This can potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. The addition of hydrogen (H2) to the feed can also dramatically improve combustion efficiency, yielding catalysts with higher performance and selectivity.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）的氧化脱氢过程中表现出优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。它通过将催化位点还原到更选择性的状态来工作。N2O抑制氧的吸附，从而限制了非选择性氧物种的形成或催化剂的氧化速率，这导致了丙烯选择性的增强。

2.N2O-ODHP面临的主要挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题。由于催化剂表面快速消耗氧物种，活性会降低，导致失活。稳定性也是一个问题，因为反应条件需要精确调整以维持最佳的催化剂性能。

3.解决这些限制的策略包括在反应期间同时注入N2O和CO2，这有助于控制活性位点的氧化状态。这可能使N2O-ODHP成为实用实施的可行选项。向流体中添加氢（H2）也可以极大地提高燃烧效率，产生具有更高性能和选择性的催化剂。
