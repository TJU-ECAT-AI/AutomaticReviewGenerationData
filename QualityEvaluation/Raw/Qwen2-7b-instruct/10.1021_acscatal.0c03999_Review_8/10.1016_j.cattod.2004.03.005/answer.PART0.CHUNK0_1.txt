Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it shows distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. In the presence of N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of propane and oxygen decreases. This indicates that N2O modifies the selective sites on the catalyst, leading to an increased production of propylene. Moreover, the dissociation of CO2 plays a crucial role in this promotion, as it reduces the consumption of oxygen. The selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4 in the mixture, highlighting the effectiveness of N2O in enhancing propylene yield. However, there is a scarcity of fundamental studies explaining the role of N2O in oxidation reactions, indicating potential areas for further research. The last observation supports the interpretation that N2O facilitates the reduction of the catalyst surface, contributing to increased selectivity.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中，作为氧化剂使用氮氧化物（N2O）显示出在丙烯选择性方面的明显优势，与其它氧化剂相比。在N2O的存在下，丙烯的选择性增加，而丙烷和氧气的转化率降低。这表明N2O改变了催化剂上的选择性位点，导致丙烯产量增加。此外，二氧化碳的分解在这一促进作用中扮演着关键角色，因为它减少了氧气的消耗。选择性已经在混合物中被-Sb2O4显著调节，强调了N2O增强丙烯产率的有效性。然而，缺乏关于N2O在氧化反应中的作用的基本研究，指出有潜力进行进一步的研究领域。最后的观察结果支持了这样一个解释：N2O促进了催化剂表面的还原，从而增加了选择性。
