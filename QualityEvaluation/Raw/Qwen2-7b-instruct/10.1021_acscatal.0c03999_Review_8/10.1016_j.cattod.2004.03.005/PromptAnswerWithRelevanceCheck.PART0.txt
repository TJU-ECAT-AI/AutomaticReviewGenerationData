[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
[5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promise in enhancing propylene selectivity. Its use modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, leading to increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as reduced CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the feed stream is particularly effective in combination with antimony oxide (-Sb2O4), which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction.

2. The use of N2O in ODHP has several advantages over other oxidants. Firstly, it promotes a reduction in the oxidation state of molybdenum in NiMoO4 catalysts, which enhances selectivity towards propylene. Secondly, N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen, reducing the consumption of oxygen and promoting the reduction of the catalyst's surface. These properties lead to improved selectivity and yield in propylene, making N2O a potentially advantageous oxidant in ODHP processes.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP using N2O are primarily related to maintaining the desired oxidation state of the catalysts under varying reaction conditions. This requires careful management of the reaction parameters, including the concentration of N2O and CO2 in the feed, to prevent excessive reduction or oxidation of the catalyst surface. Additionally, the interaction between N2O and other components in the reaction mixture may lead to unexpected side reactions or catalyst poisoning, necessitating the development of robust catalyst formulations and process optimization strategies.

4. Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more feasible option for practical implementation include:
   a. Developing advanced catalyst formulations that can maintain optimal activity and selectivity across a wide range of reaction conditions, including the presence of N2O and CO2.
   b. Implementing sophisticated process control systems to dynamically adjust the concentrations of N2O and CO2 based on real-time monitoring of the reaction progress and catalyst performance.
   c. Conducting in-depth studies on the mechanisms of N2O interaction with the catalyst surface and the effects of N2O on the oxidative state of the catalyst, to identify potential inhibitors or modifiers that could enhance stability.
   d. Investigating alternative oxidants or dual-oxidant systems that combine the benefits of multiple oxidants to achieve better control over the oxidative state of the catalyst and improve selectivity and yield in propylene.

5. The potential use of CO2 as an activator in catalytic combustion of methane (CMC) offers a novel avenue for improving the efficiency of the process. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the reaction to start at lower temperatures, facilitating a more energy-efficient combustion process. This is attributed to the formation of activated oxygen species upon dissociation of CO2 at the catalyst surface, which can either directly oxidize methane or modify the catalyst's oxidation state, thereby enhancing its overall activity. Further research is needed to validate this mechanism and optimize the conditions for maximum efficiency gains in CMC applications.

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Its primary advantage lies in enhancing propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O demonstrates a notable improvement in propylene yield. This is attributed to its ability to reduce molybdenum in the catalyst, thereby modifying the oxidation state of the active sites. This results in a selective conversion of propane to propylene, with a decrease in the conversion of oxygen and yield in CO2.

2. In the ODHP process, a variety of catalysts are employed, including mixtures of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, as well as palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The use of these catalysts in combination with N2O or CO2 enables the tuning of the oxidation state of the catalysts. This is crucial for adjusting the number of selective sites, improving the selectivity of partial oxidation products, and enhancing the combustion of methane.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are inherent in the ODHP process. The deactivation of catalysts can occur due to various factors, such as poisoning, sintering, and agglomeration. Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of more robust catalyst materials, the optimization of operating conditions, and the implementation of innovative regeneration techniques. Research directions could focus on understanding the precise mechanisms of catalyst deactivation, identifying novel catalyst compositions, and exploring the synergistic effects of gas additives like N2O and CO2 on catalyst performance.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP):

1. N2O has been shown to increase propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It reduces the conversion of propane and oxygen, and decreases the yield in CO2. This indicates that N2O modifies the oxidation state of the catalysts, facilitating a more selective reaction pathway for propylene production.

2. The process involves using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, as well as a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The -Sb2O4 component helps control the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases, while N2O and CO2 are used as gas dopes to adjust the oxidation state of the catalysts and influence selectivity and efficiency.

3. Challenges in the process include maintaining the catalyst's selectivity and stability over multiple reaction cycles. Deactivation and stability issues arise due to the dynamic nature of the catalytic sites, which change under the conditions of the reaction. The consumption of oxygen and the yield in CO2 also decrease with the use of N2O.

Strategies to address these limitations:

1. Optimizing the concentration of N2O and CO2 in the feed can help improve selectivity and energetic efficiency. By fine-tuning these parameters, it may be possible to achieve a more stable and selective reaction without excessive consumption of oxygen or yield reduction.

2. Developing more robust catalyst materials that can withstand the dynamic changes in the oxidation state of the catalysts during the reaction. This could involve the creation of catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation.

3. Further research into the mechanisms by which N2O and CO2 affect the oxidation state of the catalysts. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to the development of more efficient catalysts or the creation of novel gas dopes with even better performance characteristics.

In conclusion, while N2O-ODHP shows promise as a method for producing propylene selectively, improvements in catalyst stability, optimization of feedstock composition, and a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms are needed to make it a more practical industrial option. 

The presence of CO2 in the feed enhances the catalytic combustion of methane, leading to increased activity at lower temperatures compared to the absence of CO2. This is attributed to the enrichment of low BE oxygen species on the ceria-zirconia compound, suggesting that CO2 dissociates at the surface of the catalyst, providing activated oxygen species that facilitate the oxidation of methane.

分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂：

1.N2O在提高丙烯选择性方面显示出优势，与其它氧化剂相比。它减少了丙烷和氧气的转化率，并降低了二氧化碳的产率。这表明N2O通过改变催化剂的氧化状态，促进了更选择性的丙烯生成路径。

2. 这个过程涉及使用NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物，以及钯负载在Zr-Ce-O氧化物混合氧化物上。-Sb2O4成分有助于控制活性氧化物相上的选择性位点数量，而N2O和CO2作为气态掺杂物被用于调整催化剂的氧化状态，影响选择性和效率。

3. 在这个过程中面临的挑战包括维持催化剂的选择性和稳定性。由于催化位点在反应条件下的动态变化，催化剂容易发生失活和稳定性问题。氧气消耗和二氧化碳产率的降低也是使用N2O的副作用。

解决这些限制的策略：

1. 精确调整N2O和CO2在进料中的浓度可以改善选择性和能效。通过优化这些参数，可能能够实现更稳定、更选择性的反应，而不会过度消耗氧气或降低产率。

2. 开发更耐用的催化剂材料，能够承受催化剂氧化状态在反应过程中的动态变化。这可能涉及创建具有增强稳定性和抗失活能力的催化剂。

3. 对N2O和CO2如何影响催化剂的氧化状态进行进一步研究。理解这些机制可能会导致开发更高效的催化剂或创造性能更好的新型气态掺杂物。

综上所述，虽然N2O-ODHP显示出作为选择性生产丙烯的潜在方法的潜力，但提高催化剂稳定性、优化原料组成和对反应机制有更深的理解是使它成为更实用工业选项所必需的改进。

甲烷的催化燃烧在CO2的存在下表现出增加的活性，这发生在较低的温度下，与没有CO2的情况相比。这归因于铈锆混合氧化物上的低结合能氧物种的富集，表明CO2在催化剂表面分解，提供激活氧物种，促进甲烷的氧化。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature indicates several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O enhances propylene selectivity by facilitating the reduction of molybdenum, leading to a slight decrease in propane conversion, oxygen consumption, and CO2 yield. This behavior contrasts with CO2, which promotes total oxidation of methane, suggesting that the dissociation of CO2 is responsible for its promotional effect.

The literature also highlights the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly when using N2O. Challenges include maintaining the surface in a desired oxidation state without altering operating conditions. The addition of gaseous dopants, such as N2O and CO2, can potentially mitigate these issues by adjusting the catalyst's performance.

Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more practical include:
1. Developing methods to control the oxidation state of the catalysts effectively, ensuring consistent performance under varying operating conditions.
2. Investigating the interaction between N2O and other dopants, such as -Sb2O4, to optimize the catalyst's selectivity and stability.
3. Enhancing the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the promotion effects of N2O and CO2, particularly focusing on how they adjust the catalyst's reduction process.
4. Conducting further experiments to validate the observed effects of CO2 on the catalytic combustion of methane, especially in comparison to previous findings suggesting CO2's inertness in such reactions.

In summary, while N2O offers potential advantages in ODHP, addressing the challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability remains crucial for its practical implementation. Further research into optimizing dopant usage and understanding their interactions with catalysts could pave the way for more efficient and stable N2O-based processes.

在氧化脱氢反应中，使用N2O作为氧化剂对丙烷（ODHP）进行分析，文献表明与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。N2O通过促进钼的还原来提高丙烯选择性，导致丙烷转化率、氧气消耗和二氧化碳产率的轻微下降。这种行为与CO2形成对比，CO2促进甲烷的完全氧化，暗示CO2的解离是其促进作用的原因。

文献还指出了与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战，特别是当使用N2O时。挑战包括在不改变操作条件的情况下维持表面在所需氧化状态。通过向反应气体中添加诸如N2O和CO2等气态掺杂剂，有可能通过调整催化剂性能来缓解这些问题。

应对这些局限性和使N2O-ODHP更实际的策略包括：
1. 开发控制催化剂氧化状态的方法，确保在不同操作条件下保持一致性能。
2. 研究N2O与其他掺杂剂（如-Sb2O4）之间的相互作用，以优化催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
3. 深入了解N2O和CO2在催化燃烧甲烷过程中促进效果的机制，特别是关注它们如何调节催化剂的还原过程。
4. 对于CO2在甲烷催化燃烧中观察到的效果进行进一步实验验证，特别是在与以往认为CO2在此类反应中无活性的发现进行比较时。

总之，尽管N2O在ODHP中提供潜在优势，但解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战对于其实际应用至关重要。进一步研究优化掺杂剂使用以及它们与催化剂的相互作用，可以为更高效和稳定的N2O基过程铺平道路。
