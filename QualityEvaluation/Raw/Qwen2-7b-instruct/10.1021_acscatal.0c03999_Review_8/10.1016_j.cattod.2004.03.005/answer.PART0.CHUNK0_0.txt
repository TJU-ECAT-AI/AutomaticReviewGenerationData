[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
[5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promise in enhancing propylene selectivity. Its use modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, leading to increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as reduced CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the feed stream is particularly effective in combination with antimony oxide (-Sb2O4), which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction.

2. The use of N2O in ODHP has several advantages over other oxidants. Firstly, it promotes a reduction in the oxidation state of molybdenum in NiMoO4 catalysts, which enhances selectivity towards propylene. Secondly, N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen, reducing the consumption of oxygen and promoting the reduction of the catalyst's surface. These properties lead to improved selectivity and yield in propylene, making N2O a potentially advantageous oxidant in ODHP processes.

3. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP using N2O are primarily related to maintaining the desired oxidation state of the catalysts under varying reaction conditions. This requires careful management of the reaction parameters, including the concentration of N2O and CO2 in the feed, to prevent excessive reduction or oxidation of the catalyst surface. Additionally, the interaction between N2O and other components in the reaction mixture may lead to unexpected side reactions or catalyst poisoning, necessitating the development of robust catalyst formulations and process optimization strategies.

4. Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more feasible option for practical implementation include:
   a. Developing advanced catalyst formulations that can maintain optimal activity and selectivity across a wide range of reaction conditions, including the presence of N2O and CO2.
   b. Implementing sophisticated process control systems to dynamically adjust the concentrations of N2O and CO2 based on real-time monitoring of the reaction progress and catalyst performance.
   c. Conducting in-depth studies on the mechanisms of N2O interaction with the catalyst surface and the effects of N2O on the oxidative state of the catalyst, to identify potential inhibitors or modifiers that could enhance stability.
   d. Investigating alternative oxidants or dual-oxidant systems that combine the benefits of multiple oxidants to achieve better control over the oxidative state of the catalyst and improve selectivity and yield in propylene.

5. The potential use of CO2 as an activator in catalytic combustion of methane (CMC) offers a novel avenue for improving the efficiency of the process. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the reaction to start at lower temperatures, facilitating a more energy-efficient combustion process. This is attributed to the formation of activated oxygen species upon dissociation of CO2 at the catalyst surface, which can either directly oxidize methane or modify the catalyst's oxidation state, thereby enhancing its overall activity. Further research is needed to validate this mechanism and optimize the conditions for maximum efficiency gains in CMC applications.

1.N2O作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，在提高丙烯选择性方面显示出潜力。其使用能够修改催化剂上的选择性位点，导致丙烯产量增加和丙烷、氧气转化率降低，以及二氧化碳产率减少。在与抗锑氧化物（-Sb2O4）混合使用时，N2O尤其有效，这有助于控制氧化反应中活性氧化物相的选择性位点数量。

2.N2O在ODHP过程中的优势主要体现在以下几个方面：
   a. 它促进了钼在NiMoO4催化剂中的轻微还原状态，这增强了丙烯的选择性。
   b. N2O抑制了氧的吸附，减少了氧气的消耗并促进了催化剂表面的还原。这些特性使得N2O成为ODHP过程中具有潜在优势的氧化剂。

3. 在使用N2O进行ODHP时面临的挑战主要包括维持催化剂在不同反应条件下的活性和稳定性。这需要精确管理反应参数，包括N2O和CO2在气流中的浓度，以防止催化剂表面过度还原或氧化。此外，N2O与其他反应组分的相互作用可能会导致意外副反应或催化剂中毒，因此需要开发出更耐用的催化剂配方和优化工艺策略。
