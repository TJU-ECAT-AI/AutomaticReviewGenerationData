[8] "The fact that there is no significant increase in the selectivity to propylene when N2O is fed in the mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4 is coherent with this picture."
[9] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[10] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
[11] "According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature indicates several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O enhances propylene selectivity by facilitating the reduction of molybdenum, leading to a slight decrease in propane conversion, oxygen consumption, and CO2 yield. This behavior contrasts with CO2, which promotes total oxidation of methane, suggesting that the dissociation of CO2 is responsible for its promotional effect.

The literature also highlights the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly when using N2O. Challenges include maintaining the surface in a desired oxidation state without altering operating conditions. The addition of gaseous dopants, such as N2O and CO2, can potentially mitigate these issues by adjusting the catalyst's performance.

Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more practical include:
1. Developing methods to control the oxidation state of the catalysts effectively, ensuring consistent performance under varying operating conditions.
2. Investigating the interaction between N2O and other dopants, such as -Sb2O4, to optimize the catalyst's selectivity and stability.
3. Enhancing the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the promotion effects of N2O and CO2, particularly focusing on how they adjust the catalyst's reduction process.
4. Conducting further experiments to validate the observed effects of CO2 on the catalytic combustion of methane, especially in comparison to previous findings suggesting CO2's inertness in such reactions.

In summary, while N2O offers potential advantages in ODHP, addressing the challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability remains crucial for its practical implementation. Further research into optimizing dopant usage and understanding their interactions with catalysts could pave the way for more efficient and stable N2O-based processes.

在氧化脱氢反应中，使用N2O作为氧化剂对丙烷（ODHP）进行分析，文献表明与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。N2O通过促进钼的还原来提高丙烯选择性，导致丙烷转化率、氧气消耗和二氧化碳产率的轻微下降。这种行为与CO2形成对比，CO2促进甲烷的完全氧化，暗示CO2的解离是其促进作用的原因。

文献还指出了与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战，特别是当使用N2O时。挑战包括在不改变操作条件的情况下维持表面在所需氧化状态。通过向反应气体中添加诸如N2O和CO2等气态掺杂剂，有可能通过调整催化剂性能来缓解这些问题。

应对这些局限性和使N2O-ODHP更实际的策略包括：
1. 开发控制催化剂氧化状态的方法，确保在不同操作条件下保持一致性能。
2. 研究N2O与其他掺杂剂（如-Sb2O4）之间的相互作用，以优化催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
3. 深入了解N2O和CO2在催化燃烧甲烷过程中促进效果的机制，特别是关注它们如何调节催化剂的还原过程。
4. 对于CO2在甲烷催化燃烧中观察到的效果进行进一步实验验证，特别是在与以往认为CO2在此类反应中无活性的发现进行比较时。

总之，尽管N2O在ODHP中提供潜在优势，但解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战对于其实际应用至关重要。进一步研究优化掺杂剂使用以及它们与催化剂的相互作用，可以为更高效和稳定的N2O基过程铺平道路。
