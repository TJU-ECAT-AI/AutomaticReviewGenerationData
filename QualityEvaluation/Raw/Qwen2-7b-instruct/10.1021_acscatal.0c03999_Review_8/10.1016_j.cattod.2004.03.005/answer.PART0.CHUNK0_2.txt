[1] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane. The dissociation of CO2 seems to be responsible for this promotion."
[5] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[6] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
[7] "According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Its primary advantage lies in enhancing propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O demonstrates a notable improvement in propylene yield. This is attributed to its ability to reduce molybdenum in the catalyst, thereby modifying the oxidation state of the active sites. This results in a selective conversion of propane to propylene, with a decrease in the conversion of oxygen and yield in CO2.

2. In the ODHP process, a variety of catalysts are employed, including mixtures of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, as well as palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The use of these catalysts in combination with N2O or CO2 enables the tuning of the oxidation state of the catalysts. This is crucial for adjusting the number of selective sites, improving the selectivity of partial oxidation products, and enhancing the combustion of methane.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are inherent in the ODHP process. The deactivation of catalysts can occur due to various factors, such as poisoning, sintering, and agglomeration. Strategies to address these limitations might involve the development of more robust catalyst materials, the optimization of operating conditions, and the implementation of innovative regeneration techniques. Research directions could focus on understanding the precise mechanisms of catalyst deactivation, identifying novel catalyst compositions, and exploring the synergistic effects of gas additives like N2O and CO2 on catalyst performance.

1.N2O在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中用作氧化剂。其主要优势在于提高丙烯的选择性。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯产率上表现出显著的提升。这归因于其能够降低钼的氧化状态，从而改变活性位点的状态。这导致了丙烷向丙烯的有选择性的转化，同时降低了氧气的转化率和二氧化碳的产率。

2. 在ODHP过程中，使用了多种催化剂，包括NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合物以及钯负载在混合Zr-Ce-O氧化物上的催化剂。通过这些催化剂与N2O或CO2的结合，可以调整催化剂的氧化状态。这对于调整选择性位点的数量、提高部分氧化产物的选择性和增强甲烷的燃烧具有关键作用。

3. 催化剂的失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的固有问题。催化剂的失活可能由于中毒、烧结和团聚等多种因素引起。解决这些限制的方法可能涉及开发更耐久的催化剂材料、优化操作条件以及实施创新的再生技术。研究方向可以集中在理解催化剂失活的精确机制、识别新型催化剂成分并探索N2O和CO2等气体添加剂对催化剂性能的协同效应上。
