          [1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [5] "As a preliminary explanation, it could be suggested that these oxygen species would come from the dissociation of some CO2 molecules at the surface of the catalyst, which furnishes some activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) which, in turn, could either help to oxidise the CH4 molecules or improve the oxidation rate of catalysts by modifying its oxidation state and increasing the overall activity of the catalyst."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promising improvements in propylene selectivity. It modifies the selective sites on the catalysts, resulting in increased propylene production and decreased conversion of propane, oxygen, and CO2 yield. The addition of N2O to the mixture is significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controls the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases during the oxidation reaction. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enables the catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. This process is attributed to the dissociation of CO2 molecules at the catalyst surface, yielding activated monoatomic oxygen species (O) that can either oxidize methane molecules or improve catalyst activity by altering its oxidation state and increasing overall catalytic efficiency.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂显示出提高丙烯选择性的前景。它修改了催化剂上的选择性位点，导致丙烯产量增加和丙烷、氧气及二氧化碳产率的降低。N2O的加入受到-Sb2O4的影响，后者控制了氧化反应中活性氧化物相上的选择性位点数量。CO2在进料流中的存在允许在钯负载在铈锆混合氧化物催化剂上的催化燃烧甲烷反应在较低温度下进行。这一过程归因于催化剂表面CO2分子的解离，产生激活的单原子氧物种（O），这些物种既可以氧化甲烷分子，也可以通过改变催化剂的氧化状态和提高整体催化效率来改善催化剂活性。

          [1] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane was studied using a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, respectively."
          [2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
          [3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
          [4] "CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane. The dissociation of CO2 seems to be responsible for this promotion."
          [5] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
          [6] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
          [7] "According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present."

          The study of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) revealed that the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed and 3% of CO2 during the oxidation of methane led to a significant increase in propylene selectivity. The use of catalysts such as a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst, demonstrated that N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, enhancing propylene production. CO2 was found to promote the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the key factor behind this promotion. In the mixture, the selectivity was significantly influenced by -Sb2O4, which controlled the number of selective sites on the active oxide phases. The presence of CO2 in the feed stream enabled catalytic combustion of methane at lower temperatures, facilitated by palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts. XPS results indicated that the presence of CO2 led to an enrichment in low binding energy oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound.

          对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的研究显示，进料中添加300 ppm的N2O和甲烷氧化过程中添加3%的CO2均能显著提高丙烯选择性。使用NiMoO4和-Sb2O4的混合催化剂以及钯负载在铈锆混合氧化物催化剂上，证明了N2O能够促进钼的还原，从而增强丙烯的生成。CO2被发现促进甲烷的完全氧化，其解离是这一促进作用的关键因素。在混合物中，选择性受到了-Sb2O4的显著影响，后者控制了活性氧化物相上的选择性位点数量。CO2在进料流中的存在允许在钯负载在铈锆混合氧化物催化剂上的催化燃烧甲烷反应在较低温度下进行。XPS结果显示，CO2的存在导致铈锆复合物中低结合能氧物种的富集。
