Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的优势，其在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比具有几个优势。根据文献，N2O稳定了钒物种的五价和四价氧化态，其中五价为主要状态。这有利于减少直接丙烷氧化至COx和连续丙烯氧化至COx的趋势，增强丙烯选择性。此外，文献表明，在使用N2O时，那些在氧气下表现不佳的个别钒氧化物成为ODHP反应的选择性催化剂。这种改进归因于N2O比氧气更低的还原性，难以重新氧化还原的VOx物种。要解决催化剂失活和稳定性问题的策略可能包括开发能够在N2O条件下保持高活性和选择性的催化剂，优化反应条件以最小化催化剂失活，并设计能够增强N2O存在下稳定性和活性的催化剂支撑材料。研究方向可以集中在理解N2O激活机制及其对ODHP反应途径的影响，以及探索生成自N2O的氧物种对其反应动力学的影响。
