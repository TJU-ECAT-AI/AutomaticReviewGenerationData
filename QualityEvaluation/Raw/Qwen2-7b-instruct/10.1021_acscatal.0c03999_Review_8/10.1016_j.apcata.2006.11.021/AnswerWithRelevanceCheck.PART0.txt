          [1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
          [2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
          [3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction over different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出显著优势，相较于其他氧化剂。研究表明，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，催化剂的还原度相比于使用氧气（O2）更高。这导致丙烯选择性的显著提高，部分报告显示高达三倍的选择性提升。当使用N2O时，丙烯对于产物的选择性明显高于使用O2，这与之前对不同负载的VOx/MCM-41和VOx/g-Al2O3催化材料的ODHP反应分析是一致的。这种优于其他氧化剂的性能原因在于N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较低，这增强了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. According to the literature, N2O stabilizes vanadium species in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with pentavalent being predominant. This is advantageous because it reduces the tendency for direct propane oxidation to COx and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, enhancing propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the literature suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with oxygen become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and instability could involve developing catalysts that maintain high reactivity and selectivity under N2O conditions, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize catalyst deactivation, and designing catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity in the presence of N2O. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of N2O activation and its impact on the ODHP reaction pathways, as well as exploring the role of oxygen species generated from N2O and their influence on the reaction dynamics.

          分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面与其它氧化剂相比具有几个优势。根据文献，N2O稳定了钒物种的五价和四价氧化态，其中五价为主要状态。这有利于减少直接丙烷氧化至COx和连续丙烯氧化至COx的趋势，增强丙烯选择性。此外，文献表明，在使用N2O时，那些在氧气下表现不佳的个别钒氧化物成为ODHP反应的选择性催化剂。这种改进归因于N2O比氧气更低的还原性，难以重新氧化还原的VOx物种。解决催化剂失活和稳定性问题的策略可能包括开发能够在N2O条件下保持高活性和选择性的催化剂，优化反应条件以最小化催化剂失活，并设计能够增强N2O存在下稳定性和活性的催化剂支撑材料。研究方向可以集中在理解N2O激活机制及其对ODHP反应途径的影响，以及探索生成自N2O的氧物种对其反应动力学的影响。

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of reaction conditions on catalyst performance and composition. The study shows that the composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) under steady-state conditions is dependent on the oxidizing agent used, whether it is O2 or N2O. When considering a mixture containing oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) with low concentrations of propane (X(C3H8) < 5%) and oxidant (X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are primarily stabilized in the penta- and tetravalent oxidation states. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled conversion of propane and oxidant (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%). The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium between O2 and N2O is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium species compared to O2. This finding suggests that individual vanadium oxides that perform poorly with O2 can become selective in the ODHP reaction when using N2O. The improvement in catalytic performance of vanadium oxides due to N2O is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of oxygen species produced by both O2 and N2O. This knowledge can be eventually helpful in designing improved catalysts for the ODHP process. To establish proper structure-reactivity relationships in the ODHP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed should be minimized. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined solely by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide but rather by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under ODHP conditions.

          在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时，可以得出关于反应条件对催化剂性能和组成的几个结论。研究表明，单个钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）在稳态条件下的组成依赖于所使用的氧化剂，无论是O2还是N2O。考虑含氧混合物（C3H8/O2 = 2），其中丙烷和氧化剂的浓度都很低（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(O2) < 10%），钒物种主要稳定在五价和四价氧化态。在N2O存在下，当控制丙烷和氧化剂的转化率（X(C3H8) < 5%，X(N2O) < 10%）时，钒的氧化态较低。钒在O2和N2O之间的氧化态差异归因于N2O比O2更低的还原性，难以重新氧化还原的VOx物种。这一发现表明，那些在使用O2时表现不佳的个别钒氧化物在使用N2O时可以成为ODHP反应的选择性催化剂。由于N2O的存在，钒氧化物的催化性能得到改善，这与反应条件下催化剂的还原程度和由O2和N2O产生的氧物种的性质有关。这些知识最终有助于设计改进的ODHP过程催化剂。为了在容易还原/氧化的氧化物上建立适当的结构-活性关系，应在控制的丙烷和氧化剂转化率下对催化剂进行表征，并应尽量减小催化剂床中成分浓度的梯度。在773 K下，个体钒氧化物的稳态产品选择性并不完全取决于新鲜钒氧化物的性质，而是由ODHP条件下氧化物的内部和表面状态的反应诱导变化所决定。
