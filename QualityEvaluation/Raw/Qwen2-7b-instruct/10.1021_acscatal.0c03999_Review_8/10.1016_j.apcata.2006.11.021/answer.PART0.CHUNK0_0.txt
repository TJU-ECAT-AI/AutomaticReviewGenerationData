[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
[2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[3] "The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(a) evidences that the selectivity of propylene is higher with N2O than with O2. This coincides with our previous analysis of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/MCM-41 [6] and VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] catalytic materials."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. The study indicates that when N2O is used as an oxidant, the degree of catalyst reduction is higher compared to using oxygen (O2). This leads to a significant improvement in propene selectivity, with some reports showing up to three times higher selectivity. The selectivity of propylene towards the product is notably higher when N2O is employed, aligning with previous analyses of the ODP reaction using different catalyst materials loaded with VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/g-Al2O3. The reason behind this superior performance lies in the lower re-oxidation ability of N2O towards reduced VOx species, which enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. However, the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant obstacles in making N2O-ODHP a practical option. Strategies to address these limitations could involve optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, to minimize catalyst deactivation. Research could also focus on developing more stable catalyst materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the ODHP process while maintaining high selectivity. Additionally, exploring the differences in the nature of oxygen species generated from O2 and N2O might lead to a better understanding of the selective and non-selective pathways involved in the ODHP reaction, thus providing a more nuanced approach to enhancing propene selectivity.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面表现出显著优势。研究表明，与氧气（O2）相比，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，催化剂的还原度更高。这导致了丙烯选择性的显著提高，有些报告甚至达到了三倍的提高。图2(a)的产物选择性图证明了使用N2O时丙烯的选择性高于使用O2。这与之前对使用不同负载的VOx/MCM-41和VOx/g-Al2O3催化材料的ODHP反应分析是一致的。这种优越性能的原因在于N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较低，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题仍然是实现N2O-ODHP实用化的主要挑战。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化反应条件，如温度和压力，以减少催化剂失活。研究还可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂材料上，这些材料能够在ODHP过程的苛刻条件下保持高选择性。此外，探索O2和N2O产生的氧物种的差异可能会对ODHP反应中的选择性和非选择性途径有更深入的理解，从而提供一种更精细的方法来增强丙烯选择性。
