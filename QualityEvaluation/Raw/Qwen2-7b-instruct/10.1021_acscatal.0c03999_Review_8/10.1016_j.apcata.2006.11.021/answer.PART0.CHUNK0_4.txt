[1] "At this stage it is important to note that the individual vanadium oxides were strongly restructured under reaction conditions (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). This means that their specific surface areas may be changed."
[2] "The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species. It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."
[3] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O. This improving effect of N2O on the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O exhibits advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O leads to a higher degree of catalyst reduction, enhancing propylene selectivity by suppressing direct propane oxidation and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx. This is evidenced by improved initial propylene selectivity and decreased COx production when using N2O instead of oxygen (O2).

Various catalysts such as V2O3, VO2, and V2O5 are employed in this process, with their performance being significantly influenced by the oxidant type. The use of N2O results in better catalyst performance, particularly for the V2O5 species, due to its reduced tendency to re-oxidize reduced VOx species. This leads to a higher proportion of penta- and tetravalent vanadium species, which are more effective in ODHP over N2O compared to O2.

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include maintaining consistent catalyst performance across different reaction conditions and minimizing concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed. Strategies to address these limitations involve optimizing reaction conditions, refining catalyst characterization methods, and developing more stable catalyst materials. Research directions could focus on understanding the differences in oxygen species origin from O2 and N2O and their impact on catalytic performance, as well as exploring the role of catalyst reduction degree in ODHP.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂时，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，与其它氧化剂相比。具体来说，N2O导致催化剂更高的还原度，通过抑制直接丙烷氧化和连续丙烯氧化到COx，提高了丙烯选择性。这体现在使用N2O代替氧气（O2）时，初始丙烯选择性提高且COx产量减少。

不同催化剂如V2O3、VO2和V2O5被应用于这一过程，它们的性能受到氧化剂类型的影响。使用N2O时，V2O5物种表现出更好的催化性能，这是由于其较低的还原Ox物种的能力，即在N2O存在下催化剂的还原度高于O2。这导致更多的五价和四价钒物种，这些物种在N2O条件下对ODHP更为有效。

催化剂失活和稳定性挑战包括在不同反应条件下保持一致的催化剂性能以及沿催化剂床降低组分浓度梯度。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化反应条件、改进催化剂表征方法以及开发更稳定的催化剂材料。研究方向可以集中在理解O2和N2O来源的氧物种差异及其对催化性能的影响，以及探索催化剂还原度在ODHP中的作用。
