[1] "The effect of reaction conditions on catalytic performance and composition of individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) at 773 K was investigated by means of steady-state catalytic experiments with 16O2, 18O2 and N2O in combination with in situ XRD, in situ UVvis, and ex situ XPS analysis."
[2] "At similar degrees of propane conversion, this steady-state composition depends on the oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O)."
[3] "For an oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) containing mixture (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(O2) < 10%), vanadium species are stabilized in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with the former being the main one."
[4] "In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion (X(C3H8) < 5%, X(N2O) < 10%)."
[5] "It is suggested that the difference in the oxidation state of vanadium with O2 and N2O is related to the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species as compared to O2."
[6] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O."
[7] "This improving effect of N2O on the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O."
[8] "The obtained knowledge may be eventual helpful to design improved catalysts."
[9] "The main conclusions are: In order to adequately establish structurereactivity relationships in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidisable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion;concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed are to be minimized."
[10] "Steady-state ODP product selectivities over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of fresh vanadium oxide. This is governed by reaction-induced changes of the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP conditions."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several advantages emerge in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Firstly, N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity because it reduces the tendency of vanadium species to oxidize to higher oxidation states, thus facilitating direct propane oxidation to CO2 and consecutive propane oxidation to COx. This is evident from the lower oxidation state of vanadium in the presence of N2O compared to oxygen (O2), which results in a lower rate of consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Consequently, the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides is tuned such that direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) and consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O.

Various catalysts employed in this process include vanadium oxides such as V2O3, VO2, and V2O5, which undergo significant structural changes under reaction conditions. These changes are controlled by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O), affecting the catalytic performance. The bulk and near-surface composition of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the oxidizing agent, leading to improved initial propylene selectivity. The improved selectivity can be attributed to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites, with higher selectivity observed with higher reduction degree. 

Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and instability are addressed through the use of controlled reaction conditions, minimizing concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed to establish better structurereactivity relationships. The research highlights the potential of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation, with strategies focusing on optimizing catalyst conditions and composition to enhance stability and efficiency.

Proposed research directions to address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible could involve developing new catalysts with improved resistance to deactivation and enhanced stability under reaction conditions. Additionally, refining the understanding of the mechanisms involved in N2O oxidation and its impact on the selectivity of the ODHP process could lead to more efficient and stable catalyst designs. These efforts could include in-depth mechanistic studies of the reaction pathways, optimization of reaction parameters, and the development of advanced characterization techniques to monitor catalyst behavior in real-time.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，具有提高丙烯选择性的几个优势。首先，N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性，因为它降低了钒物种氧化到更高氧化状态的趋势，从而促进了直接丙烷氧化到CO2和连续丙烷氧化到COx。这从N2O存在的情况下，与氧气（O2）相比，钒的较低氧化状态中可以看出，这导致连续丙烯氧化到COx的速率降低。因此，研究了所使用的各种催化剂的性能，这些催化剂包括如V2O3、VO2和V2O5等钒氧化物，在反应条件下会发生显著的结构变化。这些变化受所应用的氧化剂（O2或N2O）的控制，影响催化性能。催化剂的基体和表面组成受氧化剂的性质的影响，导致改善的初始丙烯选择性。较高的选择性可以归因于钒位的还原程度，随着还原度的增加，选择性也提高。
