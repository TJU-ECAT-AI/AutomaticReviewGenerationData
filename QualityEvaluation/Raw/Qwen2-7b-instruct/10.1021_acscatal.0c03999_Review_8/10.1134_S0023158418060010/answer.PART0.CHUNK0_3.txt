[1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation, which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
[3] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[4] "In the case of the gallium catalysts, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over a negative effect."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Chromium and platinum-based catalysts are commonly used in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins.
2. Chromium oxide/aluminum oxide (CrOx/Al2O3) catalysts often experience high coke deposition, leading to reduced activity and the need for cyclic regeneration.
3. The acidity of catalyst supports plays a crucial role in the formation of coke and catalyst deactivation through olefin polymerization.
4. Carbon dioxide (CO2) negatively impacts propylene yield in gallium catalyst systems.
5. In chromium systems, CO2 can enhance propylene yield and operational stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing potential drawbacks.
