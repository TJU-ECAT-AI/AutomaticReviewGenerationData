[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propyl- ene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Analyzing the relaxation upon CO2 introduction during propane dehydrogenation, it was found that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke. It also competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. This prevents olefin polymerization and reduces propane conversion by inhibiting its adsorption. In gallium systems, CO2 significantly hinders propylene formation, leading to a decrease in yield. This is likely due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by CO2, which are essential for propane dehydrogenation. In contrast, in chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to coke and hydrogen oxidation upon CO2 introduction outweighs the negative effects.

分析CO2引入期间丙烷脱氢的松弛情况，发现CO2不仅是氢和焦炭的氧化剂，还会与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面。这阻止了烯烃聚合并降低了丙烷转化率，因为它抑制了其吸附。在镓系统中，CO2显著阻碍了丙烯形成，导致产率下降。这可能是因为CO2氧化了必需用于丙烷脱氢的还原镓氧化物种。相比之下，在铬系统中，由于CO2引入导致焦炭和氢氧化物的氧化，丙烯产量的增加和操作稳定性超过负面影响。
