[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[2] "The introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."
[4] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems. At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[5] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights several advantages of N2O in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O does not require oxygen, which makes it a safer and more environmentally friendly choice. Moreover, N2O is selective towards propylene production, leading to higher yields of this valuable product. 

The document also discusses various catalysts employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including chromium oxide (CrOx) and gallium oxide (GaOx) supported onto silica gels. These catalysts enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing coke formation, thanks to the low acidity of the silica supports. 

However, the document identifies several critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The formation of reduced gallium oxide species during the dehydrogenation process can hinder propylene formation when N2O is present. This suggests that the oxidation state of gallium plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of N2O-ODHP. 

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, the document recommends strategies such as optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the fixation of active phase particles on the surface of silicate supports. This would improve the stability and activity of the catalysts. Additionally, research directions could focus on developing new catalyst compositions that maintain high selectivity towards propylene while being robust against deactivation by N2O. 

In summary, while N2O offers potential benefits in the ODHP process, particularly in terms of safety and propylene selectivity, addressing catalyst deactivation issues remains a key challenge for its practical application.

分析使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，文献强调了N2O在与其它氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面的优势。具体来说，N2O不需要氧气，因此它在安全性和环境友好性方面具有明显优势。此外，N2O对于丙烯的生产具有较高的选择性，从而能产生更高的产率。

文献还讨论了在N2O-ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂，包括铬氧化物（CrOx）和镓氧化物（GaOx），这些催化剂均支持在硅胶上。这些催化剂能够有效地促进脱氢反应，同时通过硅胶的低酸性减少焦炭形成。

然而，文献也指出了催化剂失活和稳定性问题的关键挑战。在脱氢过程中形成的还原镓氧化物种可能会阻碍丙烯的生成，当存在N2O时尤其如此。这表明镓的氧化状态在N2O-ODHP的有效性中扮演着重要角色。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项，文献建议采取策略来优化催化剂设计，以增强活性相颗粒在硅酸盐支持上的固定。这将提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。此外，研究方向可以集中在开发新的催化剂组成，既能保持高丙烯选择性，又能抵抗N2O引起的失活。

简而言之，尽管N2O在ODHP过程中可能提供潜在的好处，特别是安全性与丙烯选择性方面，但解决催化剂失活问题是其实际应用的关键挑战。
