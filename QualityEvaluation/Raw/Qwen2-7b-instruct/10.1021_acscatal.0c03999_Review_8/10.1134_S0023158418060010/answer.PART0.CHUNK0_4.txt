1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is considered as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its advantages in propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. 

2. Different catalysts, including metal oxide catalysts, are utilized in the ODHP process. Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are crucial issues in this field.

3. Strategies to address these limitations might involve developing new catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, improving the reaction conditions, or finding ways to recycle the deactivated catalysts. Research directions could focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms in detail, exploring alternative oxidants, or modifying the catalyst support to improve its performance.
