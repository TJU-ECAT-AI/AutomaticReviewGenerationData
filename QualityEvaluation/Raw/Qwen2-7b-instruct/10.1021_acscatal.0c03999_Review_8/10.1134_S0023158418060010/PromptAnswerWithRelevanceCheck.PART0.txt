[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."
[4] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[5] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[6] "The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."

1. The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propylene showed that not only CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the surface of the catalysts. 

2. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly hinders the formation of propylene due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species, leading to a decrease in its yield. This is because these species are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. For chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases the yield of propylene and enhances the stability of the operation. This is because CO2 oxidizes coke and hydrogen, which prevails over its negative effects.

4. The acid hydroxyls of the silicate supports play a vital role in forming a dispersed active surface. However, to boost the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is essential to provide both dispersed application and strong fixation of the active phase particles on the silicate support's surface.

5. The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts reduces coke formation and prolongs the effective operational times of chromium- and gallium-containing systems.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights several advantages of N2O in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O does not require oxygen, which makes it a safer and more environmentally friendly choice. Moreover, N2O is selective towards propylene production, leading to higher yields of this valuable product. 

The document also discusses various catalysts employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including chromium oxide (CrOx) and gallium oxide (GaOx) supported onto silica gels. These catalysts enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing coke formation, thanks to the low acidity of the silica supports. 

However, the document identifies several critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The formation of reduced gallium oxide species during the dehydrogenation process can hinder propylene formation when N2O is present. This suggests that the oxidation state of gallium plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of N2O-ODHP. 

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, the document recommends strategies such as optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the fixation of active phase particles on the surface of silicate supports. This would improve the stability and activity of the catalysts. Additionally, research directions could focus on developing new catalyst compositions that maintain high selectivity towards propylene while being robust against deactivation by N2O. 

In summary, while N2O offers potential benefits in the ODHP process, particularly in terms of safety and propylene selectivity, addressing catalyst deactivation issues remains a key challenge for its practical application.

分析使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，文献强调了N2O在与其它氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面的优势。具体来说，N2O不需要氧气，因此它在安全性和环境友好性方面具有明显优势。此外，N2O对于丙烯的生产具有较高的选择性，从而能产生更高的产率。

文献还讨论了在N2O-ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂，包括铬氧化物（CrOx）和镓氧化物（GaOx），这些催化剂均支持在硅胶上。这些催化剂能够有效地促进脱氢反应，同时通过硅胶的低酸性减少焦炭形成。

然而，文献也指出了催化剂失活和稳定性问题的关键挑战。在脱氢过程中形成的还原镓氧化物种可能会阻碍丙烯的生成，当存在N2O时尤其如此。这表明镓的氧化状态在N2O-ODHP的有效性中扮演着重要角色。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项，文献建议采取策略来优化催化剂设计，以增强活性相颗粒在硅酸盐支持上的固定。这将提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。此外，研究方向可以集中在开发新的催化剂组成，既能保持高丙烯选择性，又能抵抗N2O引起的失活。

简而言之，尽管N2O在ODHP过程中可能提供潜在的好处，特别是安全性与丙烯选择性方面，但解决催化剂失活问题是其实际应用的关键挑战。

Analyzing the relaxation upon CO2 introduction during propane dehydrogenation, it was found that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke. It also competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. This prevents olefin polymerization and reduces propane conversion by inhibiting its adsorption. In gallium systems, CO2 significantly hinders propylene formation, leading to a decrease in yield. This is likely due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by CO2, which are essential for propane dehydrogenation. In contrast, in chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to coke and hydrogen oxidation upon CO2 introduction outweighs the negative effects.

分析CO2引入期间丙烷脱氢的松弛情况，发现CO2不仅是氢和焦炭的氧化剂，还会与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面。这阻止了烯烃聚合并降低了丙烷转化率，因为它抑制了其吸附。在镓系统中，CO2显著阻碍了丙烯形成，导致产率下降。这可能是因为CO2氧化了必需用于丙烷脱氢的还原镓氧化物种。相比之下，在铬系统中，由于CO2引入导致焦炭和氢氧化物的氧化，丙烯产量的增加和操作稳定性超过负面影响。
