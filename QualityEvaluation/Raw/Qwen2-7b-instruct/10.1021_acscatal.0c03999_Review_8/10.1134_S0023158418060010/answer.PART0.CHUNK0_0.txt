[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."
[4] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[5] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[6] "The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."

1. The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propylene showed that not only CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the surface of the catalysts. 

2. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly hinders the formation of propylene due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species, leading to a decrease in its yield. This is because these species are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. For chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 increases the yield of propylene and enhances the stability of the operation. This is because CO2 oxidizes coke and hydrogen, which prevails over its negative effects.

4. The acid hydroxyls of the silicate supports play a vital role in forming a dispersed active surface. However, to boost the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is essential to provide both dispersed application and strong fixation of the active phase particles on the silicate support's surface.

5. The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts reduces coke formation and prolongs the effective operational times of chromium- and gallium-containing systems.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳引入后对丙烯和丙烷的竞争吸附表明，二氧化碳不仅是氢和焦炭的氧化剂，而且它与碳氢化合物在催化剂表面竞争吸附。

2. 对于镓系统，二氧化碳的引入显著阻碍了丙烯的形成，这是由于二氧化碳氧化了减少的镓氧化物物种，导致其产量下降。这是因为这些物种对于丙烷脱氢是必要的。

3. 对于铬系统，二氧化碳的引入增加了丙烯的产量并提高了操作稳定性。这是因为在焦炭和氢气氧化的情况下，二氧化碳的正面影响超过了其负面影响。

4. 这些支持体上的酸羟基在形成分散活性表面中起着重要作用。然而，为了提高催化剂的特定活性和稳定性，不仅需要分散应用，还需要在硅酸盐支持体的表面上牢固固定活性相颗粒，这在使用沉积方法时很难实现。

5. 使用低酸度的硅酸盐支持体在脱氢催化剂的制备中减少了焦炭形成并延长了铬和镓包含系统的有效运行时间。
