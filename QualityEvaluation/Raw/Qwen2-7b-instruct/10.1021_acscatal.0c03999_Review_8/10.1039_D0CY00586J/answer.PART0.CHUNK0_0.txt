Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed.

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O offers the potential to i) prevent deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) minimize coke formation, and iii) facilitate propane conversion by utilizing the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). This makes N2O-ODHP a more favorable option in terms of reducing unwanted side reactions and improving product selectivity.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including Fe-doped ceria materials, which leverage the well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts. The use of Fe dopants in these ceria materials enhances stability and catalytic performance, allowing for stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity over extended periods. However, significant challenges exist, particularly in the rapid and severe deactivation of catalysts within a short timeframe, irrespective of preparation methods, reaction conditions, and reactor designs. 

Deactivation mechanisms identified in the literature include coke deposition on the surface of low Fe loading catalysts and CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals in high Fe loading catalysts. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing catalyst composition and structure to mitigate deactivation and improve stability.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more practical implementation, strategies and research directions could focus on:
1. Improving catalyst stability by modifying the catalyst's structure or composition to better withstand the harsh reaction conditions.
2. Enhancing propylene selectivity through the development of more efficient catalysts or by optimizing reaction parameters.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions to achieve a balance between effective propane conversion and minimal side reactions, ensuring consistent performance over time.
4. Investigating alternative catalyst materials or compositions that might offer superior stability and selectivity compared to current options.
5. Developing innovative reactor designs that can accommodate dynamic changes in reaction conditions and enhance heat and mass transfer efficiency.

By pursuing these avenues, the field could overcome the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, making N2O-ODHP a viable and efficient method for producing propylene on a commercial scale.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂时，文献中强调了与其它氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的几个优势。具体而言，N2O具有以下潜力：i) 避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃，ii) 减少焦炭形成，iii) 利用产生的氢气参与逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS），从而促进丙烷转化。这使得N2O-ODHP成为在减少不希望的副反应和提高产品选择性方面更优的选择。

在该过程中已使用多种催化剂，包括含铁铈氧化物材料，这些材料利用了铈基催化剂的优良氧移动性和氧存储能力(OSC)特性。含铁铈材料的使用增强了稳定性及催化性能，实现了稳定的丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性，且在长时间内保持稳定。然而，存在显著挑战，特别是催化剂在短时间内出现严重快速失活，无论其制备方法、反应条件还是反应器设计如何。

已识别的失活机制包括低铁负载催化剂表面的焦炭沉积以及高铁负载催化剂中铈氧化物聚集和铁迁移形成纳米晶体。这些发现强调了优化催化剂组成和结构以减轻失活并提高稳定性的关键性。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为可行的商业化实施选项，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：
1. 通过修改催化剂结构或组成来改进催化剂稳定性。
2. 通过开发更高效的催化剂或优化反应参数来增强丙烯选择性。
3. 优化反应条件，实现有效的丙烷转化和最小化副反应，确保长期性能稳定。
4. 探索替代的催化剂材料或组成，可能提供优于当前选项的稳定性和选择性。
5. 开发创新的反应器设计，能够适应反应条件的变化，并提高热和质量传输效率。

通过追求这些途径，领域可以克服与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战，使N2O-ODHP成为大规模商业生产丙烯的可行且高效的方法。
