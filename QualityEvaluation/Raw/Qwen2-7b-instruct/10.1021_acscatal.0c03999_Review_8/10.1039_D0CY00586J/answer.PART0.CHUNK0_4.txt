[1] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[2] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."
[3] "Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading."
[4] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this process exhibits several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O allows for a reduction in the risk of deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes and a decrease in coke formation, which facilitates better conversion rates of propane. Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including Fe-doped ceria materials, which have shown enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance when using CO2 as a soft oxidant.

However, critical challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant obstacles to the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. Low Fe catalysts often experience deactivation due to surface coke deposition, whereas high Fe loading catalysts are prone to deactivation from CeO2 sintering and Fe migration leading to the formation of nanocrystals.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, researchers could explore modifying the catalyst composition to enhance stability, possibly through the introduction of additional metallic components that improve resistance to deactivation. Additionally, optimizing the synthesis process and reaction conditions might lead to the development of more robust catalysts capable of maintaining high activity and selectivity over extended periods. Investigating the effects of different support materials or modifying the support-catalyst interface could also contribute to improved catalyst longevity and performance.

Furthermore, studying the dynamic interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products could provide insights into the mechanisms of deactivation, allowing for the development of strategies to mitigate these issues. This includes understanding how the presence of N2O affects the reactivity and stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, as well as identifying ways to prevent coke formation and minimize sintering.

In summary, while the use of N2O in ODHP holds promise for improving propylene selectivity and reducing the environmental impact, overcoming catalyst deactivation and stability challenges requires further research and optimization of catalyst design and synthesis techniques.

在使用N2O作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，该过程在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O能够避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃的风险，并减少焦炭形成，从而促进丙烷的转化率。已有多类催化剂被用于这一过程，包括Fe掺杂的铈氧化物材料，这些材料在使用CO2作为软氧化剂时表现出增强的稳定性及出色的催化性能。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战仍然是实施N2O-ODHP的主要障碍。低Fe催化剂经常因表面焦炭沉积而发生失活，而高Fe负载催化剂则倾向于由于CeO2烧结和Fe迁移导致纳米晶体形成而发生失活。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究人员可以探索修改催化剂组成以提高稳定性，可能通过引入额外的金属成分来增强对失活的抵抗力。此外，优化合成过程和反应条件可能会导致开发出更耐用的催化剂，能够维持高活性和选择性长达数小时。

进一步研究催化剂、反应物和产物之间的动态相互作用将提供有关失活机制的见解，这将有助于制定策略来缓解这些问题。这包括理解N2O的存在如何影响催化剂在反应条件下的活性和稳定性，以及识别防止焦炭形成和减少烧结的方法。

总之，尽管使用N2O在ODHP中具有提高丙烯选择性和降低环境影响的潜力，但克服催化剂失活和稳定性挑战需要进一步的研究和催化剂设计与合成技术的优化。
