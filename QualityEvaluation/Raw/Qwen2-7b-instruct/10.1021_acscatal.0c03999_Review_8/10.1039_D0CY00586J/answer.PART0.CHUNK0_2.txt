<rsc.li/catalysis>The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>The iron-cerium oxide solid solution catalysts with Fe dopant content from 1% up to 15% were successfully synthesized via co-precipitation method and calcined at 873K.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>Calcination at 600°C is beneficial in the following aspects: higher specific surface area and formation of Fe-Ce solid solution rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases is achieved.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process include severe deactivation, coke formation, catalyst mesoporous structure collapse, and agglomeration of reduced Cr to Cr2O3.</rsc.li/catalysis>
<rsc.li/catalysis>The proposed strategies or research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation involve improving catalyst stability, enhancing propylene selectivity, and exploring alternative catalysts and reaction conditions.</rsc.li/catalysis>
