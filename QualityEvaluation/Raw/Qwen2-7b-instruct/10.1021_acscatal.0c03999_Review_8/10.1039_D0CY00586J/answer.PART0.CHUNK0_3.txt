1. Research efforts have been directed towards developing technologies that enhance propylene production while mitigating the significant disparity between supply and demand. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with carbon dioxide as the oxidant has been studied as a promising alternative.
2. Iron-doped ceria (Fe-doped CeO2) catalysts have been employed in the investigation of propane ODH.
3. Utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant offers several advantages, including avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and promoting propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).
4. Work by the research team of JG Chen has contributed to the understanding of light alkane CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) catalysts on ceria surfaces.
5. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts form the basis for the hypothesis that these catalysts can lead to the creation of stable surface active sites.
6. The synthesis and calcination of Fe-doped ceria catalysts were carried out in a controlled manner.
7. Calcining the catalysts at 600°C resulted in improved characteristics, including a higher specific surface area and the formation of a solid solution between iron and ceria, rather than separate cerianite and hematite phases.
8. The catalytic activity of the developed catalysts was assessed using a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor equipped with quartz sand as a diluent.
