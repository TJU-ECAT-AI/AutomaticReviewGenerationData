[1] "Although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[2] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[3] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."
[4] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."
[5] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key aspects emerge in comparison to other oxidants, the catalysts employed, and the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. N2O offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity due to its role in avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and facilitating propane conversion via the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This makes N2O a potentially more favorable oxidant for ODHP processes.

Various catalysts are used in this process, including Fe-doped ceria materials. These catalysts are designed to enhance the stability and performance of the ODHP reaction. The structural implications of Fe doping in ceria materials are significant, as confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization. The presence of cerianite as the main crystalline phase with Fe ions substituting for Ce ions demonstrates the successful synthesis of Fe-doped ceria catalysts.

Critical challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability are identified, including coke deposition on the surface of low Fe catalysts, CeO2 sintering, and Fe migration leading to the formation of nanocrystals. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the synthesis process to prevent coke formation, enhancing the stability of CeO2 through improved support materials, and developing methods to mitigate Fe migration. Research directions could focus on modifying catalyst compositions, improving catalyst preparation techniques, or exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple catalyst components to enhance both activity and stability.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在丙烯选择性、避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃、减少焦炭形成以及通过逆水煤气变换反应促进丙烷转化等方面具有优势。这使得N2O成为ODHP过程的潜在更优选择。

ODHP过程中使用了多种催化剂，包括含铁铈氧化物材料。这些催化剂旨在提高ODHP反应的稳定性和性能。Fe掺杂在铈基材料中的结构影响显著，通过X射线衍射（XRD）和拉曼光谱的确认，证实了Fe掺杂铈氧化物催化剂的成功合成，主要结晶相为铈亚铁石相，Fe离子取代了Ce离子的位置，没有发现赤铁矿相的存在。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题被识别出来，包括表面焦炭沉积导致低Fe催化剂失活，CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶粒导致高Fe负载催化剂失活。解决这些限制的策略可能包括优化合成过程以防止焦炭形成，增强CeO2稳定性通过改进支持材料，以及开发方法来减少Fe迁移。研究方向可以集中在催化剂成分的修改、合成技术的改进或探索多种催化剂组分协同效应的开发，以同时提升活性和稳定性。
