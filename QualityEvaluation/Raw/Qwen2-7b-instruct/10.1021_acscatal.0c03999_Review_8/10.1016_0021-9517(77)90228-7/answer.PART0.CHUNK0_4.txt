The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) aims to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. Palladium on aluminum oxide (Pd/Al2O3) catalysts, both in their reduced and sulfided states, were utilized in the study. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity to propylene compared to the sulfided catalyst. The addition of SO2 to the feed increased the conversion of propane, but the selectivity to propylene remained significantly lower than when using pure propane feed. This suggests that SO2 may abstract hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water, which were detected through gas chromatography analysis. However, the sulfiding process did not improve the activity or selectivity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst compared to its reduced state. The study concluded that while oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers an alternative approach, Pd/Al2O3 catalysts hold promise in this context. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability could involve improving catalyst design, enhancing regeneration processes, or exploring the use of alternative oxidants that might offer better propylene selectivity.

氧化脱氢化过程使用硫化氧（SO2）旨在克服反应的平衡限制。铝氧化物上的钯（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂，无论是还原状态还是硫化状态，都在研究中被使用。还原状态的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷转化为丙烯的活性和选择性方面明显优于硫化催化剂。向原料中添加SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性仍然远低于仅使用纯丙烷原料的情况。这表明SO2可能从烷烃中提取氢，导致形成氢硫酸和水，这些通过气相色谱分析检测到。然而，硫化过程并未提高Pd/Al2O3催化剂与还原状态相比的活性或选择性。研究得出结论，虽然使用SO2进行氧化脱氢化提供了一种替代方法，但在这一领域，Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示出希望。为解决催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，可以采取的策略包括改进催化剂设计、增强再生过程或探索可能提供更好丙烯选择性的其他氧化剂。
