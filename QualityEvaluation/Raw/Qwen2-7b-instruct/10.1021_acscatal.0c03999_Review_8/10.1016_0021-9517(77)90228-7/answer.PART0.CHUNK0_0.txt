[1] "The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3C3H8 + so2 → 3C3H6 + H2 + 2H2O."
[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/AL2O3 catalysts."
[4] "Results given in Table 1 show the performance of both catalysts at different temperatures using propane feed at 1 atm pressure and space velocity of 600 hr-1."
[5] "Sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[6] "The reduced Pd/AL2O3 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is analyzed in the context of its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The document employs Pd/AL2O3 as a catalyst, which offers some advantages over conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly in high temperature operations where a notable increase in selectivity per pass is observed. However, the sulfiding of palladium catalyst does not improve activity or selectivity. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include the deposition of coke, which averages 2-4% of the propane converted, compared to less than 1% for Pd/AL2O3 catalysts. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible could involve optimizing the catalyst composition, improving the deactivation process, or developing new catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation and offer higher selectivity for propylene production.

The document highlights that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports the view that propylene might be oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide, affecting the selectivity of the Pd/AL2O3 catalyst towards propylene.

在氧化脱氢作用下丙烷（ODHP）中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其优点在于与其它氧化剂相比，其丙烯选择性。文献中使用了Pd/AL2O3作为催化剂，该催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂提供了优势，尤其是在每次通过时显著提高了选择性。然而，钯催化剂的硫化并未提高活性或选择性。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括焦炭沉积，其平均占转化丙烷的2-4%，而Pd/AL2O3催化剂则少于1%。为了使N2O-ODHP更可行，可能的策略包括优化催化剂组成、改进失活过程或开发对失活更抗性的催化剂，以提供更高的丙烯生成选择性。

文献指出，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢可以克服反应的平衡限制。丙酮的存在支持了丙烯可能被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳的观点，这影响了Pd/AL2O3催化剂对丙烯的选择性。
