The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several challenges and advantages. In this study, the catalysts used for ODHP included palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) in both reduced and sulfided forms, chromium oxide on alumina (Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O), and conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O catalysts. 

Advantages of N2O in ODHP include higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated superior performance, showing moderate activity and high selectivity to propylene even at high temperatures. This indicates that the reduced catalyst offers some advantages over conventional chromium-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations where selectivity per pass can significantly increase.

However, the sulfided Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed poor activity despite maintaining high selectivity. Sulfiding the catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The study also revealed that coke deposition was a critical challenge, averaging 2-4% of the propane converted on the chroma-alumina catalyst compared to less than 1% for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports the view that propylene might be oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide, affecting selectivity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, potential strategies could involve improving catalyst stability and activity, developing more efficient regeneration methods, and exploring ways to minimize coke formation. Research directions might focus on optimizing catalyst composition and structure, enhancing reaction conditions, and investigating alternative methods to mitigate the effects of SO2 on propylene selectivity.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有优势和挑战。本研究中使用的催化剂包括钯负载于氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）的还原态和硫化态，以及铬氧化物负载于氧化铝（Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O）和常规Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O催化剂。

N2O在ODHP中的优势在于与其它氧化剂相比，具有更高的丙烯选择性。还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂表现出优越性能，显示出了适度的活性和高丙烯选择性，甚至在高温下也是如此。这表明还原态催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规铬基催化剂具有一些优势，特别是在每次通过过程中可以显著提高选择性。

然而，硫化态Pd/Al2O3催化剂虽然保持了较高的选择性，但活性较差。硫化催化剂没有改善活性或选择性与还原催化剂相比。研究还揭示了焦炭沉积是关键挑战之一，其平均焦炭沉积量为2-4%的丙烷转换量，而Pd/Al2O3催化剂仅为不到1%。反应产物中的CO2的存在支持了这一观点，即丙烯可能被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳，影响选择性。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选项，可能的策略包括改进催化剂稳定性和活性、开发更有效的再生方法，并探索减少SO2对丙烯选择性影响的方法。研究方向可能集中在优化催化剂组成和结构、增强反应条件以及调查减轻SO2对丙烯选择性影响的替代方法上。
