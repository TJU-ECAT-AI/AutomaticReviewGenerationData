The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is analyzed in the context of its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The document employs Pd/AL2O3 as a catalyst, which offers some advantages over conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly in high temperature operations where a notable increase in selectivity per pass is observed. However, the sulfiding of palladium catalyst does not improve activity or selectivity. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include the deposition of coke, which averages 2-4% of the propane converted, compared to less than 1% for Pd/AL2O3 catalysts. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible could involve optimizing the catalyst composition, improving the deactivation process, or developing new catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation and offer higher selectivity for propylene production.

The document highlights that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports the view that propylene might be oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide, affecting the selectivity of the Pd/AL2O3 catalyst towards propylene.

在氧化脱氢作用下丙烷（ODHP）中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其优点在于与其它氧化剂相比，其丙烯选择性。文献中使用了Pd/AL2O3作为催化剂，该催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂提供了优势，尤其是在每次通过时显著提高了选择性。然而，钯催化剂的硫化并未提高活性或选择性。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题包括焦炭沉积，其平均占转化丙烷的2-4%，而Pd/AL2O3催化剂则少于1%。为了使N2O-ODHP更可行，可能的策略包括优化催化剂组成、改进失活过程或开发对失活更抗性的催化剂，以提供更高的丙烯生成选择性。

文献指出，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢可以克服反应的平衡限制。丙酮的存在支持了丙烯可能被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳的观点，这影响了Pd/AL2O3催化剂对丙烯的选择性。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reveals several key points. Firstly, the study found that the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst outperforms the sulfided catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity for propylene formation. The use of N2O as an oxidant does not enhance the activity or selectivity of the palladium catalyst over the reduced state. Instead, it provides an alternative approach to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. However, this method also faces challenges such as catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition and the relatively low selectivity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst to propylene, possibly due to the oxidation of propylene by sulfur dioxide to water and carbon dioxide.

Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option might include improving the catalyst design to resist carbon deposition, optimizing the reaction conditions to maximize propylene selectivity, and developing methods to efficiently remove or mitigate the effects of sulfur dioxide. Research directions could focus on exploring the mechanisms of propylene formation and oxidation, identifying more stable catalyst materials, and enhancing the catalytic efficiency through advanced synthesis techniques or surface modifications. 

In summary, while N2O-ODHP presents a viable alternative, addressing catalyst deactivation and achieving higher propylene selectivity remains crucial for its practical implementation.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，揭示了几点关键信息。首先，研究发现，还原态钯/Al2O3催化剂在丙烯形成方面的活性和选择性优于硫化的催化剂。使用N2O作为氧化剂并未增强钯催化剂相对于还原状态的活性或选择性。相反，这种方法提供了克服反应平衡限制的另一种替代方案。然而，这种方法也面临着催化剂活性降低的问题，这是由于表面沉积碳导致的，与钯/Al2O3催化剂相比，其丙烯选择性较低，这可能是因为丙烯被二氧化硫氧化为水和二氧化碳。

为了应对这些局限性并使N2O-ODHP成为可行的选择，可以采取的策略包括改进催化剂设计以抵抗碳沉积、优化反应条件以最大化丙烯选择性，并开发方法以有效地去除或缓解二氧化硫的影响。研究方向可以集中在探索丙烯形成和氧化的机制、识别更稳定的催化剂材料以及通过高级合成技术或表面改性增强催化效率上。

综上所述，尽管N2O-ODHP提供了一种可行的替代方案，但解决催化剂失活问题并实现更高的丙烯选择性仍然是其实际应用的关键。

1. The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) allows for the conversion of propane to propylene through an endothermic reaction, where the equilibrium constant (Kp) increases with temperature. This process is advantageous for achieving high propylene selectivity, particularly when employing a reduced palladium (Pd)/alumina (Al2O3) catalyst, which demonstrates superior activity and high selectivity to propylene at elevated temperatures. However, sulfiding the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst does not enhance its activity or selectivity, and the conventional chromium (Cr)-zirconia-alumina (Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O) catalyst shows higher conversion rates but lower selectivity to propylene.

2. The choice of oxidant in ODHP is crucial for achieving desired propylene selectivity. Nitrous oxide (N2O) could potentially offer an alternative oxidant, as it might abstract hydrogen from the alkane, resulting in hydrogen sulfide and water formation, which aligns with the observed reaction outcomes. The relative low selectivity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst to propylene might stem from the subsequent oxidation of propylene by SO2, leading to the formation of water and carbon dioxide, thereby impacting the efficiency of propylene production.

3. Challenges associated with the oxidative dehydrogenation process, including catalyst deactivation and stability, are significant obstacles to practical implementation. Catalyst deactivation often occurs due to the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface, reducing its activity. Strategies to address these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst materials, the design of improved reactor systems that facilitate efficient heat and mass transfer, and the implementation of effective regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity. Research directions could focus on understanding the underlying reaction mechanisms, optimizing process conditions, and exploring alternative oxidants or catalyst systems that minimize coke formation and enhance selectivity to propylene.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用二氧化硫（SO2）作为氧化剂，允许通过一个吸热反应将丙烷转化为丙烯，其中平衡常数（Kp）随温度升高而增加。该过程在使用还原态钯（Pd）/氧化铝（Al2O3）催化剂时具有优势，表现出较高的活性和高丙烯选择性，尤其是在较高温度下。然而，硫化Pd/Al2O3催化剂并未提高其活性或选择性。常规的铬（Cr）-锆-氧化铝（Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O）脱氢催化剂显示出更高的转化率但较低的丙烯选择性。

2. ODHP中选择氧化剂对于实现所需的丙烯选择性至关重要。氮氧化物（N2O）可能提供一种替代氧化剂，因为它可能会从烷烃中提取氢，导致形成氢硫酸和水，这与观察到的反应结果相吻合。Pd/Al2O3催化剂相对较低的丙烯选择性可能源自丙烯随后被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳，从而影响丙烯生产效率。

3. 与氧化脱氢过程相关的挑战，包括催化剂失活和稳定性，是实施的障碍。催化剂失活通常由于催化剂表面沉积焦炭而导致活性降低。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂材料、设计促进高效热量和质量传递的改进反应器系统以及实施有效再生技术以恢复催化剂活性。研究方向可以集中在理解基本反应机制、优化工艺条件和探索减少焦炭形成并提高丙烯选择性的替代氧化剂或催化剂系统。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several challenges and advantages. In this study, the catalysts used for ODHP included palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) in both reduced and sulfided forms, chromium oxide on alumina (Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O), and conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O catalysts. 

Advantages of N2O in ODHP include higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated superior performance, showing moderate activity and high selectivity to propylene even at high temperatures. This indicates that the reduced catalyst offers some advantages over conventional chromium-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations where selectivity per pass can significantly increase.

However, the sulfided Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed poor activity despite maintaining high selectivity. Sulfiding the catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The study also revealed that coke deposition was a critical challenge, averaging 2-4% of the propane converted on the chroma-alumina catalyst compared to less than 1% for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of CO2 among the reaction products supports the view that propylene might be oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide, affecting selectivity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, potential strategies could involve improving catalyst stability and activity, developing more efficient regeneration methods, and exploring ways to minimize coke formation. Research directions might focus on optimizing catalyst composition and structure, enhancing reaction conditions, and investigating alternative methods to mitigate the effects of SO2 on propylene selectivity.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有优势和挑战。本研究中使用的催化剂包括钯负载于氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）的还原态和硫化态，以及铬氧化物负载于氧化铝（Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O）和常规Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O催化剂。

N2O在ODHP中的优势在于与其它氧化剂相比，具有更高的丙烯选择性。还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂表现出优越性能，显示出了适度的活性和高丙烯选择性，甚至在高温下也是如此。这表明还原态催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规铬基催化剂具有一些优势，特别是在每次通过过程中可以显著提高选择性。

然而，硫化态Pd/Al2O3催化剂虽然保持了较高的选择性，但活性较差。硫化催化剂没有改善活性或选择性与还原催化剂相比。研究还揭示了焦炭沉积是关键挑战之一，其平均焦炭沉积量为2-4%的丙烷转换量，而Pd/Al2O3催化剂仅为不到1%。反应产物中的CO2的存在支持了这一观点，即丙烯可能被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳，影响选择性。

为了克服这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选项，可能的策略包括改进催化剂稳定性和活性、开发更有效的再生方法，并探索减少SO2对丙烯选择性影响的方法。研究方向可能集中在优化催化剂组成和结构、增强反应条件以及调查减轻SO2对丙烯选择性影响的替代方法上。

The use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) aims to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. Palladium on aluminum oxide (Pd/Al2O3) catalysts, both in their reduced and sulfided states, were utilized in the study. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity to propylene compared to the sulfided catalyst. The addition of SO2 to the feed increased the conversion of propane, but the selectivity to propylene remained significantly lower than when using pure propane feed. This suggests that SO2 may abstract hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water, which were detected through gas chromatography analysis. However, the sulfiding process did not improve the activity or selectivity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst compared to its reduced state. The study concluded that while oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers an alternative approach, Pd/Al2O3 catalysts hold promise in this context. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability could involve improving catalyst design, enhancing regeneration processes, or exploring the use of alternative oxidants that might offer better propylene selectivity.

氧化脱氢化过程使用硫化氧（SO2）旨在克服反应的平衡限制。铝氧化物上的钯（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂，无论是还原状态还是硫化状态，都在研究中被使用。还原状态的Pd/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷转化为丙烯的活性和选择性方面明显优于硫化催化剂。向原料中添加SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性仍然远低于仅使用纯丙烷原料的情况。这表明SO2可能从烷烃中提取氢，导致形成氢硫酸和水，这些通过气相色谱分析检测到。然而，硫化过程并未提高Pd/Al2O3催化剂与还原状态相比的活性或选择性。研究得出结论，虽然使用SO2进行氧化脱氢化提供了一种替代方法，但在这一领域，Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示出希望。为解决催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，可以采取的策略包括改进催化剂设计、增强再生过程或探索可能提供更好丙烯选择性的其他氧化剂。
