[1] "A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) MSR and (iii) TSR."
[2] "For TSR, it was shown that steady state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system."
[3] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
[4] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
[5] "New experiments have been reported here, where aqueous SDS degradation was followed with the addition of various salts to increase the ionic strength."
[6] "These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants."
[7] "Indications of neutral reactants further support a mechanism where S is oxidizing an organic species."
[8] "Alternatively, the measurements of He et al.32 for n-C16H34 at T = 360C also have been re-interpreted using an ionic strength plot (Livingston plot)."
[9] "The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates."
[10] "Similar to studies on aquathermolysis and thermolysis, the dominant control for reactions at T > 300C, seems to be thermolysis versus S oxidation in classical TSR."
[11] "Our studies on TSR in shale type fluids are continuing, with the eventual goal of developing a kinetic model to aid producers in estimating H2S production profiles."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants. Specifically, N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity due to its unique chemical properties and reaction mechanisms. The process involves the use of various catalysts, such as noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are known for their high efficiency in promoting the desired reaction pathways. The document also discusses the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, noting that these factors can significantly impact the efficiency and longevity of the ODHP process.

Strategies or research directions that could potentially address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation include:
1. Developing more robust and stable catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions and resist deactivation over time.
2. Optimizing reactor design and operating parameters to enhance the performance and selectivity of the N2O-ODHP process.
3. Conducting extensive kinetic studies to better understand the reaction mechanisms and identify the most efficient reaction pathways.
4. Investigating the use of synergistic catalyst systems that combine the benefits of multiple catalysts to improve the overall process efficiency.
5. Exploring the integration of advanced monitoring and control technologies to ensure optimal process conditions and minimize operational issues.

In summary, the document emphasizes the importance of addressing catalyst deactivation and stability challenges to make the N2O-ODHP process more practical and efficient for commercial applications. By focusing on catalyst development, process optimization, and advanced technology integration, it is possible to overcome existing limitations and harness the potential of N2O as an effective oxidant in the ODHP process.
