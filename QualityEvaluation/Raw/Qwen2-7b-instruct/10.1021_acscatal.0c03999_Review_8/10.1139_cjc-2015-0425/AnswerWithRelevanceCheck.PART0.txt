          [1] "A brief review of the potential sources of H2S in oil and gas production has been provided with summaries of the understanding of (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) MSR and (iii) TSR."
          [2] "For TSR, it was shown that steady state S would increase under very acidic conditions by shifting the disproportionation of the S-H2O system."
          [3] "Recent research shows that oxidation of native H2S, followed by slow oxidation of organic species by elemental sulfur, can lead to the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production."
          [4] "In some cases, chemical additives to hydraulic fracture fluids can act as both oxidant and reductant during the H2S delay through TSR reactions, e.g., recent research with SDS degradation."
          [5] "These results show no significant change in reaction rate at increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral reactants."
          [6] "The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates."

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document highlights several advantages of N2O over other oxidants. Specifically, N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity due to its unique chemical properties and reaction mechanisms. The process involves the use of various catalysts, such as noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are known for their high efficiency in promoting the desired reaction pathways. The document also discusses the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, noting that these factors can significantly impact the efficiency and longevity of the ODHP process.

          [5] "Indications of neutral reactants further support a mechanism where S is oxidizing an organic species."
          [6] "Alternatively, the measurements of He et al.32 for n-C16H34 at T = 360C also have been re-interpreted using an ionic strength plot (Livingston plot)."
          [7] "The higher-temperature experiments suggest that (i) catalytic activity is not specific to certain cations and (ii) ionic strength (through concentration increase and high-valence ions) does increase reaction rates."
