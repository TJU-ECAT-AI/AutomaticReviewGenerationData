[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
[2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
[3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
[4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
[5] "N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."
[6] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
[7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
[8] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
[9] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably.

2.Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It can help to reduce the catalysts, leading to improvements in propylene selectivity. By adjusting the amount of N2O, the optimal oxidation state of the catalyst surface can be modulated to enhance performance. However, higher concentrations of N2O may lead to excessive reduction of the catalyst, which can deactivate the catalyst over time.

3.To address the limitations associated with N2O-ODHP, researchers can explore ways to optimize the concentration of N2O and other promoters to achieve the best balance between catalyst reduction and propylene selectivity. They could also investigate the development of more stable catalysts that are less susceptible to deactivation when exposed to N2O. Additionally, studying the mechanisms by which N2O affects catalysts and how it interacts with other oxidants like CO2 could lead to a better understanding of the process and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，可以使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂。它有助于降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原。N2O浓度越高，催化剂的还原程度越高。在ODHP中使用N2O可以显著提高丙烯选择性与其他氧化剂相比。但是，N2O需要分子氧的存在才能持久地产生丙烯。

2.在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，可以使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂。它可以帮助还原催化剂，从而改善丙烯选择性。通过调整N2O的量，可以调节催化剂表面的最佳氧化状态，以增强性能。然而，N2O的高浓度可能导致催化剂过度还原，随着时间的推移会逐渐失活。

3.为了克服与N2O-ODHP相关的限制，研究人员可以探索优化N2O和其他促进剂的浓度的方法，以实现催化剂还原和丙烯选择性之间的最佳平衡。他们还可以研究开发更稳定的催化剂，这些催化剂对N2O的暴露不太容易失活。此外，研究N2O如何影响催化剂以及它与CO2等其他氧化剂的相互作用机制，可以更好地理解这一过程，并可能使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选择。
