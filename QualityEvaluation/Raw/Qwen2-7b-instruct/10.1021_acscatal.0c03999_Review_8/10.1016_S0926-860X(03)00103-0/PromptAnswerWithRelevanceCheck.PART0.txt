1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably.

2.Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It can help to reduce the catalysts, leading to improvements in propylene selectivity. By adjusting the amount of N2O, the optimal oxidation state of the catalyst surface can be modulated to enhance performance. However, higher concentrations of N2O may lead to excessive reduction of the catalyst, which can deactivate the catalyst over time.

3.To address the limitations associated with N2O-ODHP, researchers can explore ways to optimize the concentration of N2O and other promoters to achieve the best balance between catalyst reduction and propylene selectivity. They could also investigate the development of more stable catalysts that are less susceptible to deactivation when exposed to N2O. Additionally, studying the mechanisms by which N2O affects catalysts and how it interacts with other oxidants like CO2 could lead to a better understanding of the process and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation.

[N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen.]
[N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity.]

[In presence of a small amount of N2O, the catalyst is more selective than in its absence.]
[Adding 300 ppm of N2O, the conversion of propane and of oxygen decrease, the yield in propylene is a little higher (+11%) and the selectivity in propylene increases significantly (+32%).]

[In presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively).]

[When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower.]

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantage lies in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Nitrous oxide facilitates a reduction in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Lower N2O concentrations lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, yield, and selectivity in propylene, and a further decrease in the selectivity to CO2. At high concentrations of N2O, propylene is produced from propane, but this might happen only under transient conditions as N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently. 

To address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and instability, strategies could involve optimizing the concentration of N2O and CO2 to modulate the oxidation state of the catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction. This could improve selectivity by inhibiting the origin of non-selectivity, limiting oxygen adsorption, and preventing the formation of active oxygen species. Further research could explore the mechanisms by which N2O and other dopes act during the reaction, aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding that could make N2O-ODHP a more practical and viable option for implementation.

分析在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的优势在于提高丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比。N2O能够促进催化剂的还原，降低氧化速率。N2O浓度的增加导致催化剂深度还原，丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和丙烯选择性下降，CO2形成减少，氧消耗降低。当N2O浓度较高时，仅在短暂条件下，N2O能诱导丙烷转化为丙烯，并可能以可接受的选择性进行。针对催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，策略可以包括优化N2O和CO2的浓度，调节催化剂表面原子的氧化状态，在催化反应过程中提高选择性。这可以通过抑制非选择性的起源、限制氧吸附和阻止活性氧物种的形成来实现。进一步研究可以探索N2O和其他助剂在反应过程中的作用机制，以期获得全面的理解，使N2O-ODHP成为可行且实用的实施选项。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantage lies in its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O enables a reduction in the oxidation rate of catalysts, promoting a decrease in the conversion of propane while increasing the yield and selectivity in propylene. This makes it particularly useful in processes employing very active and non-selective catalysts, where adjusting the amount of N2O can inhibit non-desirable reactions and improve selectivity by limiting oxygen adsorption and the formation of active oxygen species. Despite these benefits, N2O faces challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, especially at high concentrations where it can lead to the formation of carbonaceous products. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the N2O concentration to achieve the optimal oxidation state of catalyst surface atoms, thereby enhancing selectivity and stability over time. Further research could focus on developing more robust catalysts and understanding the underlying mechanisms by which N2O influences the catalytic performance in ODHP, potentially making this approach more viable for practical implementation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，将氮氧化物（N2O）用作氧化剂具有提高丙烯选择性的优势。N2O能够降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原，这一效果依赖于气体混合物中N2O的浓度。随着N2O浓度的增加，催化剂的还原程度加深，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，氧气消耗量和CO2选择性进一步减少。在高浓度N2O条件下，丙烷可直接转化为丙烯，但这种情况下丙烯的产生通常只持续短暂的时间，因为N2O需要分子氧的持续存在才能持久地产生丙烯。对于活性极高且选择性较低的催化剂而言，通过调整N2O的量可以抑制非期望反应，通过限制氧气吸附和活性氧物种的形成等方式来提高选择性。然而，N2O面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题，尤其是在高浓度下会导致碳质产物的生成。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化N2O浓度以实现催化剂表面原子的最佳氧化状态，从而增强选择性和长期稳定性。未来的研究方向应集中在开发更稳定的催化剂以及深入了解N2O如何影响催化性能的机制上，这可能使N2O-ODHP方法更适合实际应用。

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), influencing propylene selectivity positively compared to other oxidants. It reduces the oxidation rate of the catalyst, leading to enhanced selectivity towards propylene. This is achieved by inhibiting oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations and combining this effect with direct reduction of the catalyst surface at higher concentrations. 

2. The use of nickel molybdate catalysts in ODHP processes has been explored, alongside mixtures involving other materials like antimony oxide (-Sb2O4), ceria (CeO2), and combinations thereof. These catalysts demonstrate similar trends to those observed with N2O, sometimes with even more pronounced effects, validating the findings on N2O's impact.

3. Challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability over time. The deep reduction of catalysts at high N2O concentrations can lead to increased formation of carbonaceous products, which might deactivate the catalysts over time, despite the initial enhancement in propylene selectivity.

4. Strategies to address these limitations include fine-tuning the N2O concentration to optimize the catalyst's oxidation state, thereby improving selectivity without causing excessive deactivation. Research could also focus on developing more robust catalyst formulations that are less susceptible to deactivation under high N2O concentrations. Further studies aiming to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of dopants' effects during the reaction could lead to more effective optimization of ODHP processes.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中影响丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比，它能够提高丙烯选择性。通过在低N2O浓度下抑制氧吸附或在高浓度下直接减少催化剂表面，N2O可以降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原，达到提高丙烯选择性的目的。

2. 探讨了镍钼酸盐催化剂以及与抗坏血酸（-Sb2O4）、氧化铈（CeO2）和其他材料的混合物在ODHP过程中的应用。这些催化剂显示出与N2O类似的趋势，有时甚至更显著的效果，验证了N2O对催化性能的影响。

3. ODHP面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和维持稳定性的问题。高N2O浓度下催化剂的深度还原会导致碳化副产品的增加，这可能会导致催化剂随着时间的推移而逐渐失效，尽管初期可能有较高的丙烯选择性。

4. 可以通过精确调整N2O浓度来优化催化剂的氧化状态，从而提高选择性而不造成过度失活的策略。研究还可以集中在开发更加耐久的催化剂配方上，这些配方对高N2O浓度下的失活不那么敏感。进一步研究旨在全面理解反应过程中掺杂物的作用机制，有望引导ODHP过程的更有效优化。
