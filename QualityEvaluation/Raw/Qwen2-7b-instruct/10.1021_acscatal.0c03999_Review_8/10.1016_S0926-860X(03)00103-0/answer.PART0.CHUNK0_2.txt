[N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen.]
[N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity.]

[In presence of a small amount of N2O, the catalyst is more selective than in its absence.]
[Adding 300 ppm of N2O, the conversion of propane and of oxygen decrease, the yield in propylene is a little higher (+11%) and the selectivity in propylene increases significantly (+32%).]

[In presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively).]

[When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower.]

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantage lies in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Nitrous oxide facilitates a reduction in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Lower N2O concentrations lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, yield, and selectivity in propylene, and a further decrease in the selectivity to CO2. At high concentrations of N2O, propylene is produced from propane, but this might happen only under transient conditions as N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently. 

To address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and instability, strategies could involve optimizing the concentration of N2O and CO2 to modulate the oxidation state of the catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction. This could improve selectivity by inhibiting the origin of non-selectivity, limiting oxygen adsorption, and preventing the formation of active oxygen species. Further research could explore the mechanisms by which N2O and other dopes act during the reaction, aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding that could make N2O-ODHP a more practical and viable option for implementation.

分析在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂的优势在于提高丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比。N2O能够促进催化剂的还原，降低氧化速率。N2O浓度的增加导致催化剂深度还原，丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和丙烯选择性下降，CO2形成减少，氧消耗降低。当N2O浓度较高时，仅在短暂条件下，N2O能诱导丙烷转化为丙烯，并可能以可接受的选择性进行。针对催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，策略可以包括优化N2O和CO2的浓度，调节催化剂表面原子的氧化状态，在催化反应过程中提高选择性。这可以通过抑制非选择性的起源、限制氧吸附和阻止活性氧物种的形成来实现。进一步研究可以探索N2O和其他助剂在反应过程中的作用机制，以期获得全面的理解，使N2O-ODHP成为可行且实用的实施选项。
