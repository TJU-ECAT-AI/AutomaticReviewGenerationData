[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."

[2] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."

[3] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[4] "The most common case comes from processes using very active and non selective catalysts. Modulating the amount of N2O, it should be possible to inhibit the origin of the non selectivity (limiting adsorption of oxygen, the formation of active oxygen species, etc.)."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), its advantage lies in its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O enables a reduction in the oxidation rate of catalysts, promoting a decrease in the conversion of propane while increasing the yield and selectivity in propylene. This makes it particularly useful in processes employing very active and non-selective catalysts, where adjusting the amount of N2O can inhibit non-desirable reactions and improve selectivity by limiting oxygen adsorption and the formation of active oxygen species. Despite these benefits, N2O faces challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability, especially at high concentrations where it can lead to the formation of carbonaceous products. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the N2O concentration to achieve the optimal oxidation state of catalyst surface atoms, thereby enhancing selectivity and stability over time. Further research could focus on developing more robust catalysts and understanding the underlying mechanisms by which N2O influences the catalytic performance in ODHP, potentially making this approach more viable for practical implementation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，将氮氧化物（N2O）用作氧化剂具有提高丙烯选择性的优势。N2O能够降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原，这一效果依赖于气体混合物中N2O的浓度。随着N2O浓度的增加，催化剂的还原程度加深，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性提高，氧气消耗量和CO2选择性进一步减少。在高浓度N2O条件下，丙烷可直接转化为丙烯，但这种情况下丙烯的产生通常只持续短暂的时间，因为N2O需要分子氧的持续存在才能持久地产生丙烯。对于活性极高且选择性较低的催化剂而言，通过调整N2O的量可以抑制非期望反应，通过限制氧气吸附和活性氧物种的形成等方式来提高选择性。然而，N2O面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题，尤其是在高浓度下会导致碳质产物的生成。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化N2O浓度以实现催化剂表面原子的最佳氧化状态，从而增强选择性和长期稳定性。未来的研究方向应集中在开发更稳定的催化剂以及深入了解N2O如何影响催化性能的机制上，这可能使N2O-ODHP方法更适合实际应用。
