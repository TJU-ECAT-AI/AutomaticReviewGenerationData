[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."
[2] "When the amount of N2O increases to 1%, a decrease in the yield and in the selectivity in propylene, a lower O2 consumption and a significantly lower yield and selectivity in CO2 is observed."
[3] "Interestingly, when the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower."
[4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), influencing propylene selectivity positively compared to other oxidants. It reduces the oxidation rate of the catalyst, leading to enhanced selectivity towards propylene. This is achieved by inhibiting oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations and combining this effect with direct reduction of the catalyst surface at higher concentrations. 

2. The use of nickel molybdate catalysts in ODHP processes has been explored, alongside mixtures involving other materials like antimony oxide (-Sb2O4), ceria (CeO2), and combinations thereof. These catalysts demonstrate similar trends to those observed with N2O, sometimes with even more pronounced effects, validating the findings on N2O's impact.

3. Challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability over time. The deep reduction of catalysts at high N2O concentrations can lead to increased formation of carbonaceous products, which might deactivate the catalysts over time, despite the initial enhancement in propylene selectivity.

4. Strategies to address these limitations include fine-tuning the N2O concentration to optimize the catalyst's oxidation state, thereby improving selectivity without causing excessive deactivation. Research could also focus on developing more robust catalyst formulations that are less susceptible to deactivation under high N2O concentrations. Further studies aiming to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of dopants' effects during the reaction could lead to more effective optimization of ODHP processes.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中影响丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比，它能够提高丙烯选择性。通过在低N2O浓度下抑制氧吸附或在高浓度下直接减少催化剂表面，N2O可以降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原，达到提高丙烯选择性的目的。

2. 探讨了镍钼酸盐催化剂以及与抗坏血酸（-Sb2O4）、氧化铈（CeO2）和其他材料的混合物在ODHP过程中的应用。这些催化剂显示出与N2O类似的趋势，有时甚至更显著的效果，验证了N2O对催化性能的影响。

3. ODHP面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和维持稳定性的问题。高N2O浓度下催化剂的深度还原会导致碳化副产品的增加，这可能会导致催化剂随着时间的推移而逐渐失效，尽管初期可能有较高的丙烯选择性。

4. 可以通过精确调整N2O浓度来优化催化剂的氧化状态，从而提高选择性而不造成过度失活的策略。研究还可以集中在开发更加耐久的催化剂配方上，这些配方对高N2O浓度下的失活不那么敏感。进一步研究旨在全面理解反应过程中掺杂物的作用机制，有望引导ODHP过程的更有效优化。
