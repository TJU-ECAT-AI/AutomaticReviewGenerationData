[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."

[2] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[3] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."

[4] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[5] "The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances. At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

### Analysis of Nitrous Oxide (N2O) as an Oxidant in Propane Dehydrogenation

1. **Advantages of N2O**: N2O acts as a powerful reducing agent for catalysts, promoting a decrease in the oxidation rate and thus facilitating a reduction in catalysts. This reduction can lead to improved propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants.

2. **Catalysts Employed**: Nickel molybdate catalysts are used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These catalysts are effective under certain conditions but can become deactivated over time.

3. **Challenges**: The main challenge is the potential for deep reduction of the catalyst at high concentrations of N2O, leading to decreased activity. This reduction can also promote the formation of carbonaceous products, further deactivating the catalyst.

4. **Strategies for Improvement**:
   - **Optimization of N2O Concentration**: Adjusting the amount of N2O can help modulate the oxidation state of the catalyst surface, improving selectivity.
   - **Research Directions**: Further investigation into the mechanisms by which N2O affects catalysts, including its direct reduction effect, could lead to more stable and selective catalysts.
   - **Development of New Catalysts**: Research could focus on developing new catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation when exposed to high concentrations of N2O.
