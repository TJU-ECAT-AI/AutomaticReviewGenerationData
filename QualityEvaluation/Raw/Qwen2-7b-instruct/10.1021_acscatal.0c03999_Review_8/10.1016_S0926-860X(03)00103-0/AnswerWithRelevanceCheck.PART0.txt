          [1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

          [3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
          [4] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

          [7] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which helps to reduce the rate of oxidation of the catalysts, thereby promoting their reduction. The degree of reduction increases with the concentration of N2O. The use of N2O in ODHP can have significant implications for improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. However, N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst becomes deeper, leading to a decrease in the conversion of propane, an increase in the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease in the formation of CO2, and a reduction in oxygen consumption. In certain conditions, propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, but this likely occurs only temporarily since N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene consistently.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，可以使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，它有助于降低催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进其还原。N2O浓度越高，催化剂的还原程度越高。在ODHP中使用N2O可以显著提高丙烯选择性，与其它氧化剂相比。然而，N2O需要分子氧的存在才能持久地产生丙烯。当N2O的量增加时，催化剂的还原程度更深，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，CO2形成减少，氧消耗降低。在某些条件下，纯N2O可以诱导丙烷转化为丙烯，但这很可能只是暂时现象，因为N2O需要分子氧的存在才能持续产生丙烯。
