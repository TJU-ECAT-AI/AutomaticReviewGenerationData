Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O is effective because it acts as a monooxygen donor, facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene with high selectivity. This is particularly advantageous as it allows for the simultaneous valorization of propane, a cheap and abundant feedstock, and N2O, an environmentally harmful gas, leading to enhanced sustainability and efficiency in chemical production processes.

The various catalysts employed in this process include Fe-zeolites, such as FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and FeBEA, which demonstrate high activity and selectivity under N2O-mediated conditions. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highlighted as especially effective, capable of achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. This demonstrates their exceptional catalytic performance and suitability for practical applications.

However, the process faces significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Coke formation is identified as the main cause of deactivation, leading to a decrease in propene yield. The critical nature of coke formation is underscored by the fact that it physically blocks active reaction sites within the zeolite pore system, thereby reducing the overall catalytic activity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions are proposed. Firstly, enhancing the stability of catalysts through the optimization of iron species and their distribution within the zeolite matrix is crucial. It is suggested that the presence of extraframework iron species plays a pivotal role in the activity of catalysts, and the development of more stable forms of these species could mitigate deactivation.

Secondly, improving the porous structure of the catalysts might offer a solution. For instance, the presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, as a result of dealumination upon steam treatment, is highlighted as advantageous for reducing pore blocking by coke and improving the transport of reactants and products, which in turn slows down deactivation.

Lastly, investigating the mechanism behind the high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O could provide insights into how highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition might have increased resistance towards coke deactivation. Understanding this mechanism could lead to the development of new catalysts or modification of existing ones to enhance their stability and efficiency in N2O-ODHP processes.

In conclusion, while N2O-ODHP presents promising opportunities for chemical production, addressing the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability remains essential. Ongoing research aimed at optimizing catalyst design, improving porous structures, and elucidating the underlying mechanisms of deactivation could pave the way for more sustainable and efficient industrial applications of this process.

在使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，它在丙烯选择性方面显示出与其它氧化剂相比的一些优势。N2O作为单氧供体，有效地促进了丙烷向丙烯的转化，并且具有高度的选择性。这特别有利，因为它允许同时对廉价且丰富的原料丙烷和有害环境的气体N2O进行价值化，从而提高了化学生产过程的可持续性和效率。

用于这一过程的各种催化剂包括Fe-沸石，如FeZSM-5、Fe硅铝酸盐和FeBEA，它们在N2O介导的条件下表现出高活性和选择性。经过蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石被认为是尤其有效的，能够在723 K的温度和400,000 ml/h/g催化剂的空速下达到高达25%的丙烯产量，显示出其出色的催化性能和适用性。

然而，该过程面临的主要挑战是催化剂失活和稳定性问题。焦炭形成被确认为导致失活的主要原因，导致丙烯产率下降。焦炭形成的关键性质在于它物理上阻塞了多孔系统中的活性反应位点，从而减少了整体催化活性。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为可行的工业应用，提出了一些策略和研究方向来解决这些限制。首先，通过优化铁物种及其在沸石基质中的分布来提高催化剂的稳定性至关重要。研究表明，额外框架铁物种的存在对于催化剂的活性起着关键作用，发展更稳定的这些物种形式可以减少失活。

其次，改进催化剂的多孔结构可能提供解决方案。例如，FeZSM-5中由于蒸汽处理引起的微孔的存在被强调为减少焦炭堵塞多孔系统并改善反应物和产物运输的关键因素，这反过来减缓了失活速度。

最后，研究FeZSM-5在N2O-ODHP过程中高失活抵抗力背后的机制，可能为直接N2O分解中高度活跃的Fe沸石催化剂具有增加的焦炭失活抵抗力提供见解。理解这种机制可能会导致新催化剂的发展或现有催化剂的修改，以增强N2O-ODHP过程的稳定性和效率。

总之，虽然N2O-ODHP提供了有前景的化学生产机会，但解决催化剂失活和稳定性的挑战仍然是必要的。旨在优化催化剂设计、改善多孔结构以及揭示失活机制的持续研究，可以为这一过程的更可持续和高效的工业应用铺平道路。
