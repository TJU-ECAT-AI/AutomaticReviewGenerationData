[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[2] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K."
[3] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[4] "In other words, the iron species present in the commercial samples as impurities are considered as highly efficient sites for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O."
[5] "One could expect the presence of acidic groups in ex-FeZSM-5 to accelerate the deactivation process due to coke formation during ODHP compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, while the opposite was observed in our experiments."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It achieves high initial propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operates under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. However, a major challenge is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, though this can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron in the reaction is evident from the significantly higher conversion rates observed with steam-activated Fe-zeolites such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, compared to commercial zeolites. Iron species in commercial samples act as efficient sites for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O, despite the presence of acidic groups that might otherwise accelerate deactivation. Contrary to expectations, acidic groups in FeZSM-5 did not accelerate deactivation in ODHP with N2O. Strategies to address these limitations could include optimizing iron species and their distribution within the zeolite, enhancing zeolite structure to reduce pore blocking by coke, and improving transport properties to slow down deactivation. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance, aiming to make N2O-ODHP a more practical and viable option for industrial implementation.

在使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，能够实现高达25％的初始丙烯产率，在723 K下达到这一水平，并且在每克催化剂的每小时空间速度为400,000毫升。然而，一个主要挑战是催化剂由于焦炭形成而失活，但可以通过在773 K下的氧气再生来恢复活性。铁在反应中的关键作用从使用蒸汽活化的Fe沸石中观察到，例如FeZSM-5和FeBEA，与商业沸石相比，这些催化剂的转化率显著更高。商业样品中的铁物种作为高效催化剂，用于N2O与丙烷的氧化脱氢。尽管存在可能加速失活的酸性基团，但出乎意料的是，在使用N2O进行ODHP时，FeZSM-5中的酸性基团并没有加速失活。策略可以包括优化铁物种及其在沸石中的分布、增强沸石结构以减少焦炭堵塞孔隙、以及改善传输性质以减缓失活。需要进一步的研究来理解焦炭形成机制及其对催化剂性能的影响，以使N2O-ODHP成为工业实施的更可行和可操作的选择。
