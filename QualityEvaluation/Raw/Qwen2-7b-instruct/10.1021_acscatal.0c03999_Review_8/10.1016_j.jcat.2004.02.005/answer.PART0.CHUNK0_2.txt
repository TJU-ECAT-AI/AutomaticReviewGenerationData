Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's unique ability to serve as a monooxygen donor contributes to high selectivity towards propylene production. The process involves steam-activated Fe-zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, as highly effective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and high space velocities. However, a significant challenge lies in catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation, which blocks active reaction sites. FeZSM-5 demonstrates remarkable resistance against deactivation compared to FeBEA, showcasing its potential for practical implementation.

Strategies to address these limitations and enhance N2O-ODHP feasibility include:
1. Enhancing catalyst stability through modifications such as mesopore development in FeZSM-5, which could improve transport properties and active site accessibility.
2. Investigating the role of iron constitution and zeolite structure in coke formation and deactivation rates, aiming to optimize these factors for better performance.
3. Developing advanced analytical techniques, like the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), to monitor reaction and coking simultaneously, providing insights into deactivation mechanisms.
4. Exploring the potential for catalyst regeneration, especially focusing on the regeneration of highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition, which might offer improved resistance towards coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

These research directions could pave the way for more practical and efficient N2O-ODHP processes, harnessing the benefits of N2O while mitigating its environmental impact and enhancing catalyst longevity.

分析在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势，与其他氧化剂相比。N2O的独特性质使其能够作为单氧供体，从而实现高丙烯选择性。该过程涉及蒸汽活化的铁沸石催化剂，特别是FeZSM-5和FeBEA，这些催化剂表现出高度活性，在723 K下达到高达25%的丙烯产率和高空速。然而，催化剂降解的主要挑战在于焦炭形成，这会阻塞活性反应位点。与FeBEA相比，FeZSM-5显示出对降解的出色抵抗性，这表明其在实际应用中的潜力。

为解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的可行性，可以采取以下策略：
1. 通过在FeZSM-5中开发介孔来增强催化剂稳定性，以改善传质特性和活性位点可接近性。
2. 探索铁构成和沸石结构在焦炭形成和降解速率中的作用，旨在优化这些因素以提高性能。
3. 开发先进的分析技术，如锥形元件振动微天平（TEOM），同时监测反应和结焦，提供有关降解机制的见解。
4. 探讨直接N2O分解中高度活性Fe-沸石催化剂的再生可能性，这可能有助于提高N2O-ODHP过程中对焦炭降解的抵抗力。

这些研究方向有望为更实用和高效的N2O-ODHP流程铺平道路，利用N2O的优点同时减少其环境影响，并延长催化剂寿命。
