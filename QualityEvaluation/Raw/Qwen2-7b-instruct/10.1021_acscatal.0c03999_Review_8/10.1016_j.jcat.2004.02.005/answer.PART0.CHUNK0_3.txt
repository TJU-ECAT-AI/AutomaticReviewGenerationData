[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[2] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."
[3] "The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation behavior too."
[4] "The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites, expressed as mole C3H8 converted per unit of time and catalyst mass is 23 higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants because it specifically donates oxygen atoms, enabling selective dehydrogenation processes. In this context, various catalysts such as FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and FeBEA are employed, demonstrating high initial propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, a significant challenge arises from catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, particularly in FeBEA, which experiences rapid and complete deactivation. The deactivation behavior is influenced by the nature and location of active extraframework iron species, which are crucial for the N2O-mediated ODHP. Despite the high initial performance, the deactivation rate varies among the catalysts, with FeZSM-5 showing remarkable resistance against deactivation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve modifying catalyst compositions, optimizing operating conditions, or developing new catalyst architectures that enhance stability and selectivity. Further research into the role of iron species and their impact on deactivation could also contribute to improving the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical applications.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，N2O在丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性方面具有优势，因为它能够特异性地提供氧原子，实现选择性的脱氢过程。在这种情况下，使用各种催化剂如FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和FeBEA，可达到高达25%的丙烯产率，在723 K下空间速度为400,000毫升每克催化剂每小时。然而，催化剂的活性会因为焦炭的形成而降低，尤其是在FeBEA中，其表现为快速且完全的失活。催化剂失活行为受到活性额外框架铁物种的性质和位置的影响。尽管初始性能很高，但不同催化剂的失活速率存在差异，FeZSM-5表现出对失活的显著抵抗性。为了应对这些限制，可以采取策略调整催化剂组成、优化操作条件或开发新的催化剂结构以增强稳定性和选择性。进一步研究铁物种的作用及其对失活的影响也可能有助于提高N2O-ODHP在实际应用中的可行性。
