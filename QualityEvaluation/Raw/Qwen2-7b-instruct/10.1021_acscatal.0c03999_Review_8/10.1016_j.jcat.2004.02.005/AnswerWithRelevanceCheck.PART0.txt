          [1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
          [2] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "The interaction of C3H8 with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead to propene production, indicating the essential role of the oxidant for propane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances."
          [7] "The essential role of iron in the reaction can be clearly concluded from the significantly higher C3H8 and N2O conversions over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA, as compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
          [8] "In general terms, the coking rate in zeolites depends on the acidic sites (number and strength), the zeolite structure, and the reaction conditions."
          [9] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, thanks to its ability to selectively donate oxygen atoms. High-performance catalysts such as FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are used, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, although it can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The role of iron is critical, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites demonstrating remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with the rapid and complete deactivation seen in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times less iron content), yet residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O highlights the essential role of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to differences in iron constitution and/or the unique porous structure associated with the original zeolite framework containing aluminum.

          在使用N2O作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程中，N2O在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，相较于其他氧化剂，这是因为N2O能够选择性地提供氧原子。高性能催化剂如FeZSM-5和FeBEA被采用，能够实现高达25%的丙烯产率，在723 K下工作，并在每克催化剂的每小时空间速度为400,000毫升。催化剂失活的主要挑战来自于焦炭的形成，但这可以通过在773 K下的氧气再生来缓解。铁的作用至关重要，蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石催化剂表现出对失活的显著抵抗性，与FeBEA的快速且完全失活形成对比。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率明显高于商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低30至40倍），但400分钟后操作的残留活性相似。当C3H8与没有N2O存在的铁沸石相互作用时不产生丙烯，这强调了氧化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的关键作用。蒸汽活化对于实现优越的催化性能至关重要。蒸汽活化FeZSM-5表现出的高失活抵抗性可以部分归因于铁构成的差异和/或原始沸石骨架中含铝的特殊多孔结构。

          Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O provides advantages in terms of propylene selectivity over other oxidants due to its unique ability to act as a monooxygen donor. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5 and FeBEA, are highly active and selective catalysts, capable of achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and operating under high space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-catalyst. A significant challenge is the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which can be mitigated through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K. The critical role of iron is evident in the significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA compared to ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher, even with 30 to 40 times less iron content, and residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are comparable. The absence of propene production when C3H8 interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O underscores the importance of the oxidant in propane dehydrogenation. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. The high deactivation resistance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 can be tentatively attributed to the distinct iron compositions and/or the unique porous structure related to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

          分析使用N2O作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的过程，N2O在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂具有优势，这是由于N2O能够作为单氧供体的独特性质。蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石，包括FeZSM-5和FeBEA，是高度活性和选择性的催化剂，能够在723 K下达到高达25%的丙烯产率，并在每克催化剂的每小时空间速度为400,000毫升。催化剂失活的主要挑战来自于焦炭的形成，但这可以通过在773 K下的氧气再生来缓解。铁在反应中的关键作用从FeZSM-5和FeBEA与ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA之间的显著更高的C3H8和N2O转换率中得到清晰的结论。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率明显更高，即使铁含量低30至40倍，操作400分钟后残留活性也相似。当C3H8与没有N2O存在的铁沸石相互作用时不产生丙烯，这强调了氧化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的关键作用。蒸汽活化对于实现优越的催化性能至关重要。蒸汽活化FeZSM-5表现出的高失活抵抗性可以部分归因于铁成分的差异和/或原始沸石骨架中含铝的特殊多孔结构。
