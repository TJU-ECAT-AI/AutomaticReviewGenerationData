[1] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
[2] "Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."
[4] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to minimize over-oxidation of alkanes, leading to higher olefin yields. The process utilizes iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, as catalysts. Challenges include understanding the reaction mechanism, designing effective catalysts, and addressing catalyst deactivation mechanisms. Strategies to address these limitations might involve improving catalyst stability, developing new catalyst materials, or optimizing operating conditions to enhance selectivity and longevity. Potential research directions could focus on elucidating the precise pathways for the formation of propylene and by-products, as well as the origin and prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface.
