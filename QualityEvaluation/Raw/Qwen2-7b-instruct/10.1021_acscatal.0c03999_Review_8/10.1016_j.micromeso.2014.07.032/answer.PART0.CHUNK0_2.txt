Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants due to its ability to reduce coke formation on the catalyst surface. Various catalysts, such as iron-zeolites, have been developed for this process. However, significant challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability remain. The specific nature of coke and its origin are not fully understood, contributing to the difficulty in preventing its deposition and increasing catalyst longevity. In the case of ODHP with N2O, the presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites. Remarkably, a high and stable propane conversion rate of around 13 mmol/gcat/h and a propylene production rate of approximately 6 mmol/gcat/h can be maintained for over 40 hours with an N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

在氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中使用N2O作为氧化剂，它在与其它氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，由于它可以减少催化剂表面的焦炭形成。已开发出多种催化剂，如铁沸石，用于此过程。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题仍然存在。焦炭的具体性质及其来源尚不完全清楚，这增加了防止其沉积并提高催化剂寿命的难度。在使用N2O进行ODHP的情况下，丙烷作为还原剂的存在使氮氧化物在铁沸石上的转化变得更加复杂。值得注意的是，通过调整N2O/C3H8的比例为1:2，可以保持约13mmol/gcat/h的高且稳定的丙烷转化率和约6mmol/gcat/h的丙烯产率超过40小时。
