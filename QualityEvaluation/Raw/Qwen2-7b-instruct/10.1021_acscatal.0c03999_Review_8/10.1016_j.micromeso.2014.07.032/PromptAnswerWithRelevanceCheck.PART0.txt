1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O reduces the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) which are produced by over-oxidation, leading to higher olefin selectivity and yield. Iron-zeolites, particularly those prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, are considered unique catalysts for this process. However, there are unresolved issues regarding the reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts involved in this reaction.

2. The main challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the lack of clarity in the reaction mechanism. Understanding how nitrous oxide reacts with iron-zeolites, especially in the presence of propane, is crucial for designing efficient catalysts. Another significant challenge is the deactivation of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are known causes of catalyst deactivation, but the specifics of coke formation and its origin remain unclear.

3. Strategies to address these limitations could involve further research to elucidate the detailed reaction pathways and mechanisms, including the interaction of nitrous oxide with iron-zeolites and propane. This understanding would aid in the design of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity. Additionally, developing methods to prevent the deposition of coke or to easily remove it from the catalyst surface could extend the catalyst's lifetime, making N2O-ODHP a more practical option for industrial implementation.

1.Nitrous oxide（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中用作氧化剂，因为它能够提高丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂而言。这是因为N2O减少了由过氧化产生的碳氧化物（CO和CO2），导致更高的烯烃选择性和产率。特别是通过固体状态交换方法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的铁沸石被认为是这种过程的独特催化剂。然而，在N2O与ODHP反应中仍然存在一些未解决的问题，包括反应机制不清楚以及催化剂的失活机制。

2. 使用N2O进行ODHP的主要挑战在于反应机制的不确定性。理解硝酸盐与铁沸石及其存在下的丙烷的反应途径对于设计高效催化剂至关重要。另一个关键挑战是催化剂在N2O-ODHP中的失活机制。已知焦炭在催化剂表面的形成是催化剂失活的原因之一，但焦炭的形成及其来源的具体细节仍不清楚。

3. 解决这些限制的策略可能包括进一步研究以阐明详细的反应路径和机制，包括硝酸盐与铁沸石和丙烷的相互作用。这种理解将有助于设计具有更好稳定性和选择性的催化剂。此外，开发防止焦炭沉积或从催化剂表面容易去除的方法可以延长催化剂的寿命，使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用的更可行的选择。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Research efforts have been directed towards developing iron-zeolite catalysts that can efficiently convert propane into propylene using N2O. The ODHP mechanism, however, remains unclear, posing a significant challenge in optimizing the process. The deactivation mechanisms of catalysts in this reaction also require further investigation to ensure stable and efficient operation.

Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, has demonstrated superior performance for ODHP with N2O, achieving a high initial propylene yield and conversion rate. The study suggests that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species generates stable mono-oxygen species, which effectively react with propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Notably, with a specific N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2, a remarkable stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol/g-catalyst/hour and a propylene production rate of around 6 mmol/g-catalyst/hour can be maintained for over 40 hours.

Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP could include refining the catalyst preparation methods to enhance the activity and stability of FeOAl species. Additionally, developing a clearer understanding of the reaction mechanism and deactivation processes would enable the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. The utilization of advanced in situ monitoring techniques, such as in situ DRIFT spectroscopy, can provide insights into the dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, aiding in the optimization of operating conditions and catalyst design.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，N2O在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有独特优势。研究工作已集中在开发能够利用N2O高效转化丙烷为丙烯的铁沸石催化剂。然而，ODHP机制仍然不够清晰，这是进一步发展这一反应过程中需要解决的关键问题之一。催化剂在N2O-ODHP过程中的失活机制也需要深入研究，以确保稳定和高效的运行。

通过固体状态交换方法，使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5，在与N2O进行ODHP时表现出优异性能，实现了高初始丙烯产率和转化率。研究表明，N2O在FeOAl物种上的化学吸附产生稳定的单氧物种，这些物种能有效与丙烷反应生成丙烯，并且具有高度的选择性。值得注意的是，当N2O/C3H8比例为1:2时，可以保持约13 mmol/g-catalyst/hour的稳定丙烷转化率和约6 mmol/g-catalyst/hour的丙烯生产速率超过40小时。

针对N2O-ODHP的局限性，策略可能包括改进催化剂制备方法以增强FeOAl物种的活性和稳定性。此外，对反应机制和失活过程的深入了解将有助于设计更高效和耐用的催化剂。先进的原位监测技术，如原位DRIFT光谱法，可以提供催化剂和反应物之间动态相互作用的见解，有助于优化操作条件和催化剂设计。

在氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中使用N2O作为氧化剂，它在与其它氧化剂相比时，在丙烯选择性方面具有优势，由于它可以减少催化剂表面的焦炭形成。已开发出多种催化剂，如铁沸石，用于此过程。然而，催化剂失活和稳定性的问题仍然存在。焦炭的具体性质及其来源尚不完全清楚，这增加了防止其沉积并提高催化剂寿命的难度。在使用N2O进行ODHP的情况下，丙烷作为还原剂的存在使氮氧化物在铁沸石上的转化变得更加复杂。值得注意的是，通过调整N2O/C3H8的比例为1:2，可以保持约13mmol/gcat/h的高且稳定的丙烷转化率和约6mmol/gcat/h的丙烯产率超过40小时。
