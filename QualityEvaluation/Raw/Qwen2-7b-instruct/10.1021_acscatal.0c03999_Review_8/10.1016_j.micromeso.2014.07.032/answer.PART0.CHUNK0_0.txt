1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O reduces the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) which are produced by over-oxidation, leading to higher olefin selectivity and yield. Iron-zeolites, particularly those prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, are considered unique catalysts for this process. However, there are unresolved issues regarding the reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts involved in this reaction.

2. The main challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the lack of clarity in the reaction mechanism. Understanding how nitrous oxide reacts with iron-zeolites, especially in the presence of propane, is crucial for designing efficient catalysts. Another significant challenge is the deactivation of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are known causes of catalyst deactivation, but the specifics of coke formation and its origin remain unclear.

3. Strategies to address these limitations could involve further research to elucidate the detailed reaction pathways and mechanisms, including the interaction of nitrous oxide with iron-zeolites and propane. This understanding would aid in the design of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity. Additionally, developing methods to prevent the deposition of coke or to easily remove it from the catalyst surface could extend the catalyst's lifetime, making N2O-ODHP a more practical option for industrial implementation.

1.Nitrous oxide（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中用作氧化剂，因为它能够提高丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂而言。这是因为N2O减少了由过氧化产生的碳氧化物（CO和CO2），导致更高的烯烃选择性和产率。特别是通过固体状态交换方法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的铁沸石被认为是这种过程的独特催化剂。然而，在N2O与ODHP反应中仍然存在一些未解决的问题，包括反应机制不清楚以及催化剂的失活机制。

2. 使用N2O进行ODHP的主要挑战在于反应机制的不确定性。理解硝酸盐与铁沸石及其存在下的丙烷的反应途径对于设计高效催化剂至关重要。另一个关键挑战是催化剂在N2O-ODHP中的失活机制。已知焦炭在催化剂表面的形成是催化剂失活的原因之一，但焦炭的形成及其来源的具体细节仍不清楚。

3. 解决这些限制的策略可能包括进一步研究以阐明详细的反应路径和机制，包括硝酸盐与铁沸石和丙烷的相互作用。这种理解将有助于设计具有更好稳定性和选择性的催化剂。此外，开发防止焦炭沉积或从催化剂表面容易去除的方法可以延长催化剂的寿命，使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用的更可行的选择。
