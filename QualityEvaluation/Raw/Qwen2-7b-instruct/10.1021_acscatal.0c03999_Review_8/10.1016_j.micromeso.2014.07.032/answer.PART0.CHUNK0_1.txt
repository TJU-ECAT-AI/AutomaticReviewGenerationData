Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Research efforts have been directed towards developing iron-zeolite catalysts that can efficiently convert propane into propylene using N2O. The ODHP mechanism, however, remains unclear, posing a significant challenge in optimizing the process. The deactivation mechanisms of catalysts in this reaction also require further investigation to ensure stable and efficient operation.

Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor, has demonstrated superior performance for ODHP with N2O, achieving a high initial propylene yield and conversion rate. The study suggests that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species generates stable mono-oxygen species, which effectively react with propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Notably, with a specific N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2, a remarkable stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol/g-catalyst/hour and a propylene production rate of around 6 mmol/g-catalyst/hour can be maintained for over 40 hours.

Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP could include refining the catalyst preparation methods to enhance the activity and stability of FeOAl species. Additionally, developing a clearer understanding of the reaction mechanism and deactivation processes would enable the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. The utilization of advanced in situ monitoring techniques, such as in situ DRIFT spectroscopy, can provide insights into the dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, aiding in the optimization of operating conditions and catalyst design.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，N2O在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有独特优势。研究工作已集中在开发能够利用N2O高效转化丙烷为丙烯的铁沸石催化剂。然而，ODHP机制仍然不够清晰，这是进一步发展这一反应过程中需要解决的关键问题之一。催化剂在N2O-ODHP过程中的失活机制也需要深入研究，以确保稳定和高效的运行。

通过固体状态交换方法，使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5，在与N2O进行ODHP时表现出优异性能，实现了高初始丙烯产率和转化率。研究表明，N2O在FeOAl物种上的化学吸附产生稳定的单氧物种，这些物种能有效与丙烷反应生成丙烯，并且具有高度的选择性。值得注意的是，当N2O/C3H8比例为1:2时，可以保持约13 mmol/g-catalyst/hour的稳定丙烷转化率和约6 mmol/g-catalyst/hour的丙烯生产速率超过40小时。

针对N2O-ODHP的局限性，策略可能包括改进催化剂制备方法以增强FeOAl物种的活性和稳定性。此外，对反应机制和失活过程的深入了解将有助于设计更高效和耐用的催化剂。先进的原位监测技术，如原位DRIFT光谱法，可以提供催化剂和反应物之间动态相互作用的见解，有助于优化操作条件和催化剂设计。
