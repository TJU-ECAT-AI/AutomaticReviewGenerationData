1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it can improve propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Its application in this process has attracted significant attention due to the unique properties of iron-zeolites as catalysts.

2. Challenges in using N2O-ODHP include the complexity of the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites due to the presence of propane reductant, which complicates the activation and conversion processes. Additionally, the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface cause catalyst deactivation, leading to a decrease in efficiency.

3. The use of Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method with ferrocene as the iron precursor shows superior performance for N2O-ODHP after severe calcination. This material features isolated FeOAl species as the active sites, which are advantageous for the reaction.

4. Research on the ODHP using N2O over iron-zeolites aims to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism and deactivation process. Understanding these aspects is crucial for designing effective catalysts and enhancing the stability and longevity of the catalysts in this reaction.
