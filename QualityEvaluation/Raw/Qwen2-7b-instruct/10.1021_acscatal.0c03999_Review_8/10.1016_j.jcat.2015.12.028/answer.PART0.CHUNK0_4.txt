[1] "Direct oxidation of propene to propene oxide was performed on various catalysts with oxygen [24], an oxygenhydrogen mixture [5,6], and nitrous oxide [7 9] as oxidants."
[2] "Depending on the applied catalyst as well as the oxidant used, propene conversion and selectivity to PO differed significantly."
[3] "Propene applied as a starting material for PO production is usually manufactured by steam cracking or fluid cracking of higher hydrocarbons. Both processes are energy-intensive, as they are performed at high temperature (usually at about 1000 K)."
[4] "Propene may also be obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane under much milder conditions on iron [11]- or vanadium [12]-containing catalysts with oxygen [1214] or nitrous oxide [11,13,14] as oxidants."
[5] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."
[6] "Considering the above, we applied vanadium catalysts comprising 17 wt.% of vanadium with a density in the range of 0.081.13 V/nm2 (near-monolayer coverage) as catalysts for direct oxidation of propane to propene oxide."
[7] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[8] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation."
[9] "The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[10] "As both iron and vanadium catalysts on different silica supports in the presence of N2O and under similar conditions (reaction temperature in the range of 573723 K), showed activity both for pro-pane ODH [11,14] and propene-to-PO oxidation [7,8,17], it seemed reasonable to perform the direct processing of propane to propene oxide."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it allows higher propylene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides compared to other oxidants such as oxygen or oxygen-hydrogen mixtures. 

2. Various catalysts, including iron, vanadium, and their modified versions on silica supports, are employed in ODHP. Vanadium catalysts on mesoporous silica supports, like SBA-3, are particularly highlighted for their activity in propene oxidation.

3. Challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation and instability. The rapid deactivation of catalysts in the presence of N2O is more due to the reduction of vanadium rather than carbonaceous deposit formation.

4. Strategies to address these limitations could involve modifying the catalyst surface to enhance stability, optimizing reaction conditions to reduce vanadium reduction, or developing new catalysts that can better withstand the effects of N2O. Research could focus on understanding the precise mechanisms of vanadium reduction and reoxidation in the presence of N2O to improve catalyst durability.

5. N2O-ODHP is a feasible option for practical implementation if these limitations can be effectively managed through optimized catalyst design, reaction conditions, and process engineering.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烯氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用，因为它能提供更高的丙烯选择性和较低的碳氧化物选择性，相比于氧气或氧-氢混合物等其他氧化剂。

2.用于ODHP的催化剂包括铁、钒及其在硅基支撑材料上的改性版本。特别指出的是，基于SBA-3结构的硅基支持物上的钒催化剂在丙烯氧化中表现出高活性。

3. ODHP面临的挑战包括催化剂的快速失活和稳定性问题。N2O存在下催化剂的快速失活主要归因于钒的还原，而不是碳沉积物的形成。

4. 应对这些限制的策略可能包括改进催化剂表面以增强稳定性、优化反应条件以减少钒的还原，或者开发能够更好地抵抗N2O影响的新催化剂。研究可以集中在理解N2O存在下钒还原和再氧化的精确机制，以提高催化剂的耐用性。

5.N2O-ODHP有潜力成为实际应用的可行选项，前提是通过优化催化剂设计、反应条件和过程工程有效管理这些限制。
