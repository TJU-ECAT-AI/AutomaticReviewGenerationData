[1] "Direct oxidation of propene to propene oxide was performed on various catalysts with oxygen [24], an oxygenhydrogen mixture [5,6], and nitrous oxide [7 9] as oxidants."
[2] "Depending on the applied catalyst as well as the oxidant used, propene conversion and selectivity to PO differed significantly."
[3] "Propene applied as a starting material for PO production is usually manufactured by steam cracking or fluid cracking of higher hydrocarbons. Both processes are energy-intensive, as they are performed at high temperature (usually at about 1000 K)."
[4] "Propene oxidation performed under an excess of N2O (propane:N2O = 1:15the reagent ratio usually applied for propene to PO oxidation [7,29]), when compared to the reagent ratio usually applied for the ODH reaction (N2O:propane = 1:1 [14] or 1.5:1 [26,30]) resulted not only in propene and COx formation, but also in a significant amount of oxygen-bearing compounds: propene oxide (PO), propionaldehyde (PA), acetone (ACT), and acrolein (ACR) (Fig. 6)."
[5] "On the basis of the presented results, one may conclude that V/SBA-3 catalysts after the exposure to propene and N2O reaction mixture are more susceptible to carbonaceous deposit formation,resulting in catalyst deactivation, when compared to propane/N2O mixture."
[6] "The decomposition of propan-2-ol to propene was studied at 493 and 523 K by the pulse method using helium as a carrier gas. A quantity of 0.2 g of the sample and 0.5 ll of propan-2-ol were applied and the total flow rate of helium amounted to 30 cm3/min."
[7] "Simultaneously with propane conversion decrease, selectivity to propene and COx (CO, CO2) diminishes."
[8] "Interestingly enough, selec- tivity toward COx was low throughout the whole range of applied temperatures."
[9] "According to Kon- dratenko et al. [34], the ODH process performed in the presence of N2O on a catalyst composed of fully oxidized V2O5 brings about a considerable reduction of the surface vanadium species, with V5+ presence at only ca. 18% after 1 h on stream."
[10] "Considering the lim- ited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species,one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."
[11] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxida- tion in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."
[12] "Propene formed from propane ODH undergoes further transfor- mation to oxygen-bearing products and its conversion increases with time on stream (Fig. 8)."
[13] "On the basis of the aforementioned facts, one may conclude that propane oxidation can result in propene and COx only, as indicated in Scheme 1 (COx was considered as the final product that can be formed from each reagent as a result of total oxidation)."
[14] "To establish whether propane and propene oxidation result in the formation of the same oxygen-bearing products, propene oxi- dation was performed under the same conditions."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it provides better propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants like oxygen or oxygen-hydrogen mixtures. 
2. Various catalysts such as iron-modified silica, vanadium-modified silica, and gold-titania catalysts are used in ODHP processes with N2O. 
3. Challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and instability, particularly due to the reduction of vanadium species rather than carbonaceous deposits. 
4. Strategies to address these limitations might include developing more stable vanadium-based catalysts, optimizing the N2O concentration, or incorporating additional components to enhance stability and selectivity.
5. The use of N2O in ODHP leads to the formation of propene, COx, propionaldehyde, acetone, and acrolein as oxygen-bearing products. 
6. The presence of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface reduces propene selectivity and overall efficiency. 
7. Regeneration techniques under N2O atmosphere can restore some of the catalyst's activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation with oxygen.
8. The conversion of propene to oxygen-bearing products increases over time, indicating a gradual transformation of the propene molecules.
9. The selectivity towards COx is low, suggesting that direct oxidation of propene is the primary source of COx, while consecutive oxidation of oxygenates plays a minor role.
10. The limited reoxidation capability of N2O to reduce vanadium species could contribute to catalyst deactivation, highlighting the importance of developing catalysts capable of resisting reduction under N2O conditions.
11. Further research could focus on improving catalyst stability, enhancing N2O reoxidation mechanisms, and optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve higher propene selectivity and efficiency.
