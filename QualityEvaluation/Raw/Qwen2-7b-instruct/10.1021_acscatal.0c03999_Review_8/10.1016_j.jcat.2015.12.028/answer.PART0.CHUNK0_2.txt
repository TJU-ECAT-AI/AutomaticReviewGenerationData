[1] "Direct oxidation of propene to propene oxide was performed on various catalysts with oxygen [24], an oxygenhydrogen mixture [5,6], and nitrous oxide [7 9] as oxidants."
[2] "Depending on the applied catalyst as well as the oxidant used, propene conversion and selectivity to PO differed significantly."
[3] "Reoxidation of the catalyst restored the initial activity."
[4] "Considering the cost of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide and also some risk of uncontrolled H2O2 decomposition, the search for a new and more effective technology for PO production still continues."
[5] "Propene applied as a starting material for PO production is usually manufactured by steam cracking or fluid cracking of higher hydrocarbons. Both processes are energy-intensive, as they are performed at high temperature (usually at about 1000 K)."
[6] "Propene may also be obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane under much milder conditions on iron [11]- or vanadium [12]-containing catalysts with oxygen [1214] or nitrous oxide [11,13,14] as oxidants."
[7] "When iron-modified silica was applied, a decrease in propene conversion with time on stream was observed [7],while selectivity to PO remained stable."
[8] "Considering the alteration of selectivity toward oxygen-bearing products with propane/propene conversion influenced by reaction temperature and contact time, some tentative reaction paths for the selective oxidation of propane have been proposed."
[9] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation."
[10] "The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), several key insights emerge:

1. **Advantages in terms of propylene selectivity**: Compared to other oxidants, N2O enables higher propylene selectivity in ODHP. This makes N2O a promising oxidant for propylene production as it allows for efficient conversion of propane into propylene with minimal side reactions, enhancing the purity and efficiency of the propylene output.

2. **Various catalysts employed**: Different catalysts are utilized in ODHP processes, including iron-modified silica, vanadium-based catalysts, and others. The choice of catalyst significantly impacts propene conversion and selectivity, with N2O often facilitating better performance in certain conditions.

3. **Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability**: Catalysts used in ODHP, particularly those based on vanadium, experience deactivation over time. Factors such as increased reaction temperature accelerate this process. The formation of coke on the catalyst surface is noted as a minor contributor to deactivation, indicating that the primary cause lies in the reduction of active vanadium species.

4. **Strategies or research directions**: To address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for practical implementation, researchers could focus on:

   - **Improving catalyst design**: Developing catalysts with enhanced stability and activity specifically tailored for N2O-based ODHP processes could mitigate deactivation issues.
   
   - **Optimizing operating conditions**: Fine-tuning parameters such as reaction temperature, contact time, and catalyst loading might optimize the process for better efficiency and selectivity.
   
   - **Enhancing deactivation prevention mechanisms**: Investigating methods to prevent or reduce vanadium reduction, possibly through catalyst modifications or process adjustments, could extend catalyst life.
   
   - **Exploring alternative oxidants**: Considering the specific challenges posed by N2O, researching other oxidants that offer improved stability and selectivity could broaden the scope of ODHP technologies.
   
   - **Incorporating recycling systems**: Implementing advanced recycling techniques to manage the buildup of coke and other byproducts could maintain catalyst performance over longer operational periods.
   
These strategies aim to enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of N2O-ODHP, making it a more attractive option for industrial-scale propylene production.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯脱氢氧化（ODHP）过程中的应用，可以得出几个关键见解：

1. **在选择性方面的好处**：与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在ODHP过程中能实现更高的丙烯选择性。这使得N2O成为生产纯度和效率较高的丙烯的理想氧化剂，因为它能有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副反应。

2. **所使用的催化剂**：在ODHP过程中使用的催化剂包括铁改性的硅胶、基于钒的催化剂以及其他类型。催化剂的选择显著影响丙烯转化率和选择性，而N2O往往在特定条件下促进更好的性能。

3. **催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战**：用于ODHP的催化剂，尤其是基于钒的催化剂，在长时间运行后会经历失活。提高反应温度是加速这一过程的因素之一。表面沉积的焦炭被指出是次要的失活原因，表明主要的原因在于活性钒物种的还原。

4. **策略或研究方向**：为了克服N2O-ODHP的局限性并使其成为更可行的工业应用选项，研究人员可以关注以下几点：

   - **改进催化剂设计**：开发专门针对N2O基ODHP过程的具有增强稳定性和活性的催化剂，可减轻失活问题。
   
   - **优化操作条件**：微调反应温度、接触时间和催化剂负载等参数，可能优化过程以获得更好的效率和选择性。
   
   - **增强失活预防机制**：研究防止或减少钒还原的方法，可能通过催化剂改进或过程调整来延长催化剂寿命。
   
   - **探索替代氧化剂**：考虑到N2O所带来的具体挑战，研究其他提供更好稳定性和选择性的氧化剂，可以拓宽ODHP技术的范围。
   
   - **整合回收系统**：实施先进的回收技术来管理沉积的焦炭和其他副产品的累积，可以维持催化剂性能的长期稳定性。

这些策略旨在增强N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境可持续性，使其成为更具吸引力的丙烯生产选项。
