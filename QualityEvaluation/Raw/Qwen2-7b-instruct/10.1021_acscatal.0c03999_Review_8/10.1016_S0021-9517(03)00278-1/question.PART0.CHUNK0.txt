1. Introduction
Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2].
Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were in- dustrially used for the production of polyethylene (Phillips catalyst) [3,4] and lower alkenes such as propylene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the correspond- ing alkanes [5,6], respectively. Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane [7] or ethane [8,9] over silica-supported chromium oxide. Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehy- drogenation of lower alkanes [1013] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [14,15]. The redox prop- erty and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [13]. * Corresponding author.

Studies of chromium species introduced into MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, would thus be useful in developing Cr-containing catalysts with desirable cat- alytic properties. There exist several studies on the syntheses and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 [1621]. For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide [21] or hydrogen per- oxide [22], but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials [2325]. Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr-HMS) were reported to exhibit high photocatalytic reactivity in ethylene polymer- ization [26]. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]. Recently, a SBA- 15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2003 Elsevier Inc.

dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic per- formance [27].
The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium ox- ides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been inves- tigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chrom- ium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples.
It can be expected that different synthetic methods would result in different chromium species and the different chromium species may behave differently in catalytic reac- tions. Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides [33], such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions. Recently, we applied two different methods, i.e.,direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion ex- change (TIE), to the syntheses of V- [34], Fe- [35], and Mn-MCM-41 [36]. The two methods resulted in different locations and coordination environments of the incorporated metal cations; the TIE method provided highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface of MCM-41 inside the meso- pores and the DHT method had the tendency to incorporate metal ions inside the framework of MCM-41. It has been clarified that the two different methods for introducing metal ions bring about remarkably different catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions.
In the present paper, we report the synthesis of Cr-MCM- 41 using the TIE and the DHT methods. The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain information about the structures of the introduced chromium species.
Two kinds of catalytic reactions, viz., the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen are investigated and compared to elu- cidate the structure-property relationships for the two types of Cr-MCM-41.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Chromium was introduced into MCM-41 by following two different methods. The Cr-MCM-41-DHT was prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Chromium nitrate, sodium silicate, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were used as the sources of chromium, silicon, and the template,respectively. The molar ratio of the template to the silicon source was kept at 0.5 in the synthesis gel for each syn- thesis. The synthesis gel was stirred for 1 h at room tem- perature and was then transferred to a Teflon bottle, which was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave after the adjustment of the pH value of the mixed gel to 10.5 with 4 M HCl.
The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 150 C for 48 h, and then the resultant solid was recovered by filtra- tion, washed with deionized water thoroughly, and dried at 40 C in vacuum for ca. 24 h. After calcination at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of dry air, the Cr-MCM-41-DHT was ob- tained. The Cr-MCM-41-TIE was synthesized by the tem- plate ion-exchange method. It is known that the cationic surfactants in the as-synthesized MCM-41 after hydrother- mal synthesis are mainly organized in the form of a cylin- drical micellar structure with hydrophilic positive ends in- teracting with silica pore surfaces via Coulombic interac- tion, and can be replaced through the ion-exchange by other cations such as VO2+ [34,37], Fe3+ [35,38], Mn2+ [36,39,40], Ti [40], [Co(en)2Cl2]+ [41], and other positively charged complexes. In our experiments, typically the as- synthesized MCM-41 (2 g) containing ca. 50 wt% template was added to an ethanolic solution of chromium nitrate and stirred vigorously at 60 C for 6 h for ion exchanging be- tween the cationic template and the Cr3+ ion. After the ion exchange, the as-synthesized Cr-MCM-41-TIE was recov- ered by filtration, washing thoroughly with deionized water,and drying at 40 C in vacuum. The remained organic tem- plate was removed by calcination at 550 C for 6 h to gain the Cr-MCM-41-TIE sample.
2.2. Characterizations
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spec- trometry was used for the determination of the chromium content in each sample synthesized above. The measure- ments were performed with a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000,and the sample was dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3 acids before the measurement.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous properties of each sample. The measurements were carried out on Belsorp 18SP equipment (volumetric), and all the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 200 C for 12 h before the measurement. The pore-size distribution was evaluated from the adsorption isotherm by the Dollimore and Heal (DH) method [42].
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a SRA M18XHF diffractometer (MAC Science Co., Ltd., Japan) with Cu-KÎ± radiation (40 kV, 300 mA). Small diver- gent and scattering slits (0.05 mm) were selected to avoid a high background at low diffraction angles.
Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. The powdery sample was loaded into a quartz cell, and the spec- tra were collected at 200700 nm referenced to BaSO4.
X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were per- formed with synchrotron radiation at a beam line BL7C station of the photon factory, at the High Energy Acceler- ator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at
2.5 GeV with about 350380 mA of ring current. The data
were recorded in X-ray fluorescence mode at room tempera- ture using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator. Energy

349 was calibrated with CuK-edge absorption (8981.0 eV), and the energy step of measurement in the XANES region was
0.3 eV. The absorption was normalized to 1.0 at an energy
position of 30 eV higher than the absorption edge.
UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements were carried out with a Renishaw UVvis Raman System 1000R using the UV line at 325 nm from a Kimmon IK 3201R-F He-Cd laser as the exciting source. The sample was loaded in an in situ cell and was treated in pure N2 gas flow at 200 C for de- hydration before the measurement. A laser output of 30 mW was used and the maximum incident power at the sample was approximately 6 mW.
2.3. Catalytic properties
The dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 and the partial oxidation of CH4 with O2 were investigated, respectively,to study the catalytic properties of the materials synthesized above. Both kinds of reactions were carried out using a fixed- bed flow reactor (U-type quartz tube with inner diameter of 4 mm) operated at atmospheric pressure.
In the dehydrogenation reactions, typically 0.4 g of sam- ple, which had been pelletized and sieved to 250417 m,was loaded into the reactor and treated in a gas flow contain- ing N2 (10 ml min1) and O2 (10 ml min1) at 550 C for 1 h and then purged with He (purity, 99.99%). The reaction was started by introducing a gas mixture of CO2, C3H8, He, and N2 to the reactor. N2 was used as the internal standard for the calculations of the conversions of CO2 and C3H8, while He was used for dilution to control the partial pressures of the reactants.
For partial oxidation of CH4, typically 0.05 g of sample was used. After pretreatment at 550 C in a flow of mix- ture of He (50 ml min1) and O2 (10 ml min1) for 1 h,the reactants of CH4 and O2 diluted with He were fed to the reactor to start the reaction. The products in each reac- tion were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. All the lines and valves between the exit of the reactor and the gas chromatographs were heated to 120 C to prevent the con- densation of the partial oxidation products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Porous properties of materials
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns at low diffraction angles for the calcined Cr-MCM-41 samples with Si/Cr atomic ratios of 100 and 50 prepared by both the DHT and the TIE methods. Four diffraction lines at 2Î¸ degrees of 26 indexed to (100), (110), (200), and (210) of the regular- ity of hexagonal array of mesopores of MCM-41 were ob- served for all these samples. The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly low- ered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM- 41, suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal Fig. 1.

(a) MCM-41; (b) DHT, Si/Cr = 100; (c) TIE, Si/Cr = 100; (d) DHT, Si/Cr =50; (e) TIE, Si/Cr = 50. arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the in- troduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr = 50) by both methods. However, as Si/Cr ratio decreased to 25, in other words, as the chromium content increased to
3.4 wt%, these diffraction peaks decreased largely for the
samples prepared by both methods, indicating a decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure at higher chromium content. XRD results at high diffraction angles for the calcined Cr-MCM-41 samples with a Si/Cr ratio of 25 are shown in Fig. 2. Only a broad peak due to amorphous feature of the framework of MCM-41 appeared.
Any peak assignable to the crystalline Cr2O3 phase was not observed for the Cr-MCM-41 samples prepared by both methods.
The porous properties obtained from N2 adsorption at 77 K are shown in Table 1. For both series of materials, the surface area and pore volume gradually decreased with an increase in chromium content up to 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr = 50),and became remarkably low as the chromium content was increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr = 25). The drop in the surface area and the pore volume at such high chromium content was consistent with the decrease in structural regularity observed by XRD. No significant difference between the TIE and the DHT samples was observed.

K2Cr2O7, and CrO3 are all in tetrahedral coordination whereas those in Cr2O3 are octahedrally coordinated with oxygen. The preedge peak at ca. 5991 eV is attributed to the so-called 1s3d dipole forbidden transition, and this for- bidden transition principally gains additional intensity when the chromium center is in a noncentral symmetric environ- ment or through mixing of 3d and 4p orbitals caused by the breakdown of inversion symmetry due to structure distor- tion. Since the local symmetry around the metal center is lowered from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination, the in- tensity of the preedge peak tends to increase simultaneously,i.e., Ioctahedral < Isquare pyramidal < Itetrahedral [43]. Fig. 3A clearly shows that the compounds with tetrahedrally coor- dinated chromium exhibit remarkably higher intensity of the preedge peak. Fig. 3A also reveals that the edge position shifts with the change in oxidation state; the edge position for Cr2O3 with Cr(III) is at 5997.6 eV, while those for CrO3, K2Cr2O7, and Na2CrO4 with Cr(VI) shift to 6006.0, 6006.3,and 6004.6 eV.
