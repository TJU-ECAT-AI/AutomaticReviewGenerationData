[1] "The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been investigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]."
[2] "Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[3] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides [33], such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."
[4] "In the present paper, we report the synthesis of Cr-MCM-41 using the TIE and the DHT methods. The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain information about the structures of the introduced chromium species."
[5] "Two kinds of catalytic reactions, viz., the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen are investigated and compared to elu- cidate the structure-property relationships for the two types of Cr-MCM-41."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we find that N2O offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, such as chromium-based catalysts, are employed in this process. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability over time. Strategies to address these limitations might involve optimizing the catalyst composition, enhancing support material properties, or developing more stable catalyst precursors. Research directions could focus on understanding the precise coordination structures of chromium species on the catalysts and how they influence reaction outcomes, aiming to improve selectivity and efficiency in ODHP processes using N2O as an oxidant.
