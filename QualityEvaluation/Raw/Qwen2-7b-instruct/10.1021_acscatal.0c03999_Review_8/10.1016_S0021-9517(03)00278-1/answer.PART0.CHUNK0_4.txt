[1] "The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been investigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromium species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
[3] "The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

1. The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored. N2O provides several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. One key advantage is its ability to selectively produce propylene with high efficiency, especially when combined with chromium-based catalysts. This is due to the unique coordination structure and oxidation state of chromium species, which are better preserved during the reaction when using the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method, leading to improved selectivity towards propylene.

2. Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including chromium-based catalysts supported on various supports such as silica and alumina. These catalysts are effective in converting propane into propylene and other valuable products. However, one of the main challenges associated with these catalysts is their potential for deactivation and instability over time, particularly due to the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase, which can affect the overall performance and economic viability of the process.

3. To address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability, several strategies and research directions could be pursued. These include developing more stable support materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the ODHP process without causing significant leaching of the active metal. Additionally, exploring the use of immobilization techniques or modifying the catalyst composition to enhance stability while maintaining high selectivity could be beneficial. Another promising approach involves the development of in situ regeneration methods to recover the active site of the catalyst, thereby extending its operational life.

4. Research into alternative oxidants that offer improved stability and selectivity profiles could also lead to advancements in the ODHP process. For instance, investigating the use of alternative oxidants that are less prone to causing catalyst deactivation or that can be more efficiently recycled could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. This might involve optimizing reaction conditions, catalyst design, or the integration of post-reaction treatments to facilitate the recovery and reuse of the oxidant.

In summary, while the use of N2O in the ODHP process presents opportunities for enhanced propylene selectivity, addressing the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability remains crucial. Continued research and innovation in catalyst design, support materials, and process optimization could pave the way for more efficient and sustainable industrial applications of N2O-ODHP.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其在丙烯选择性方面的优势明显。N2O能够高效地选择性生产丙烯，特别是与基于铬的催化剂结合时。这是由于铬物种的独特配位结构和氧化状态，在直接水热合成（DHT）方法中得到较好的保留，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。

2. 在ODHP过程中已经采用了多种催化剂，包括硅酸盐、铝酸盐等支持材料上的基于铬的催化剂。这些催化剂在将丙烷转化为丙烯和其他有价值产品方面非常有效。然而，这些催化剂的主要挑战之一是其可能的活性丧失和稳定性问题，尤其是由于铬从液体相泄漏导致的问题，这会影响过程的整体性能和经济可行性。

3. 针对催化剂活性丧失和稳定性的问题，可以采取几种策略或研究方向来解决。这些包括开发更稳定的支撑材料，它们能够在苛刻条件下使用而不引起活性金属的重大泄漏。此外，探索使用固定化技术或修改催化剂组成以提高稳定性的同时保持高选择性可能是有益的。另一种有前景的方法是开发原位再生方法，以恢复催化剂的活性中心，从而延长其使用寿命。

4. 探索替代氧化剂，它们在稳定性、选择性等方面提供改进，也可能推动ODHP过程的发展。例如，研究其他氧化剂，它们不易导致催化剂活性丧失或能更有效地循环利用，可以使N2O-ODHP成为可行的工业应用。这可能涉及优化反应条件、催化剂设计或后反应处理集成，以促进氧化剂的回收和再利用。

综上所述，虽然使用N2O在ODHP过程中的应用提供了增强丙烯选择性的机会，但解决催化剂活性丧失和稳定性的挑战仍然是关键。继续在催化剂设计、支撑材料、过程优化等方面的研究创新，有望为更高效、可持续的N2O-ODHP工业应用铺平道路。
