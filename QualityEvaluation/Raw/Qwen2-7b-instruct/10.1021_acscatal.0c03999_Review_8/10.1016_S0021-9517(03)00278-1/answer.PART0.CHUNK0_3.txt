[1] "Several types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample by the TIE method."
[2] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
[3] "The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
[4] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."
[6] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

1. In the template-ion exchange (TIE) method, multiple types of chromium species, including monochromates and polychromates, coexist on the sample.
2. The two synthesized chromium-mesostructured molecular sieves demonstrate comparable catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide.
3. Carbon dioxide boosts the propane conversion in both types of samples.
4. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both samples transform into aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.
5. The partial oxidation of methane with oxygen yields a notably higher selectivity towards formaldehyde over the sample prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method compared to the TIE method.
6. The chromate species maintain their structure during methane oxidation, and the superior dispersion of monochromate species likely contributes to the enhanced selectivity observed in the DHT method.

1. 在模板离子交换(TIE)方法中，多种类型的铬物种，包括单重铬酸盐和多重铬酸盐，在样品上共存。
2. 两种合成的铬-微孔分子筛在丙烷脱氢与二氧化碳反应中的催化性能相似。
3. 碳酸二甲酯增强了丙烷转化。
4. 在脱氢反应期间，两种样品上的铬酸盐物种转化为聚集的Cr(III)并具有八面体配位。
5. 使用直接水热合成(DHT)方法制备的样品在甲烷部分氧化与氧气反应中对甲醛的选择性明显高于通过TIE方法制备的样品。
6. 在甲烷氧化过程中，铬酸盐物种保持其结构，而DHT方法中单重铬酸盐的高分散可能解释了更高的选择性。
