[1] "In the case of impregnated Crx/SBA-1,reduction with hydrogen leads to the formation of Cr3+ and partially of Cr2+ species. The presence of the strongly reduced Cr2+ species depends critically on chromium dispersion. A high dispersion allows for a deep reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+ species, while at a lower dispersion (higher concentration) Cr3+ species are the primary species formed during the reduction with H2."
[2] "In the RWGS reaction the CO formation rate rises together with the concentration of Cr redox species in CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts similar as in the case of DHPCO2. This conclusion is in agreement with previously reported results [18,23]."
[3] "During the process carried out in the presence of CO2 the band maximum is shifted to a lower wavelength (about 50 nm) that may indicate the higher Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio in the dehydrogenation of propane as compared to the CO2-free reaction."
[4] "The primary reason of deactivation during the propane dehydrogenation reaction is indeed coke formation. Irreversible deactivation of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst caused by either pore structure destruction and/or inactive species formation has a smaller impact."

1. The reduction with hydrogen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane leads to the formation of Cr3+ and partially Cr2+ species. The formation of strongly reduced Cr2+ species depends significantly on the dispersion of chromium. High dispersion enables a deep reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+, while lower dispersion results in the primary formation of Cr3+ species during hydrogen reduction.

2. In the reversible water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, the carbon monoxide (CO) formation rate increases with the concentration of redox chromium species in the CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts, similar to the case of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. This finding aligns with previous reports.

3. When propane is dehydrogenated in the presence of CO2, the maximum of the UVvis DR band shifts to a lower wavelength (approximately 50 nm), suggesting a higher Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio compared to dehydrogenation in CO2-free conditions.

4. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is coke formation. Irreversible deactivation due to pore structure destruction or the formation of inactive species has a lesser impact.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，氢还原导致形成Cr3+和部分Cr2+物种。强烈还原的Cr2+物种的形成在很大程度上依赖于铬的分散度。高分散度允许深度还原Cr6+到Cr2+物种，而较低的分散度（较高浓度）会导致主要形成Cr3+物种。

2. 在可逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应中，随着CrOx/SBA-1催化剂中可还原物种浓度的增加，CO生成速率上升，与丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢反应情况相似。这一发现与之前的报道一致。

3. 当在CO2存在的条件下进行丙烷脱氢时，UVvis DR谱带的最大值向较低波长（大约50 nm）偏移，这可能表示与无CO2反应相比，丙烷脱氢过程中的Cr3+/Cr2+比率更高。

4. 烷基化催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的主要失效原因是焦炭沉积。不可逆失效由于孔结构破坏或形成不活性物种的影响较小。
