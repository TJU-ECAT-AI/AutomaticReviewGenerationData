[1] "The catalytic performance of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts was investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHPCO2). The initial specific activity, conversions of propane and carbon dioxide, selectivity to propene, ethane, ethene, methane as well as the ratio of the byproducts (CO/H2) are summarized in Table 3."
[2] "In both cases the yield rises sharply at a low Cr content and remains almost constant for the catalysts obtained by impregnation,whereas in the case of the catalysts obtained by the direct method the yield of propene drops rapidly above 3.5 wt.% of Cr."
[3] "The primary product, propene, is produced over all examined Crx/SBA-1 materials with high selectivity in the range between 85 and 93%."
[4] "The results of the in situ UVvis DR measurements obtained during the first 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [29,37,38]."
[5] "In the case of the Cr5/SBA-1 sample an additional small maximum appeared at about 310 C. The location of this maximum coincided with the low-temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined a- Cr2O3, which is assigned to the reduction of surface Cr6+ to Cr3+ or Cr2+ species [29]."
[6] "Taking similar observations into ac- count, several researches successively applied UVvis DR spectros- copy for tracking/controlling coke formation and burning over chromium oxide-based catalysts during dehydrogenation and regeneration steps, respectively [4043]."
[7] "In all of these cases, larger amounts of coke are produced in the CO2-assisted processes."
[8] "The observed changes can be explained by a higher reactivity of pro- pene than that of propane. Therefore, the higher conversion of pro- pane to more reactive propene results in a larger amount of coke."
[9] "Ancillary TG-DTA analysis indicates that in the case of used Cr5/ SBA-1 catalyst coke reacts with oxygen in the temperature range between 320 and 450 C."
[10] "During this step the coke is removed and the reduced Cr species are oxidized (regeneration of the precursors of the active sites)."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several key points. Firstly, the catalytic performance of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts is notably enhanced when using N2O as the oxidant. This results in higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The initial specific activity, conversions of propane, selectivity to propene, and the ratio of byproducts (CO/H2) are optimized in the presence of N2O.

However, the literature also acknowledges the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability when using N2O in ODHP. The deactivation is primarily attributed to excessive coke formation, which affects the catalyst's activity over time. The coke formation is influenced by the higher reactivity of propane compared to propene, leading to a larger amount of coke production during the reaction.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies can be pursued. Research directions might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coke formation. This could involve modifying the catalyst composition, structure, or the preparation process to improve its stability under N2O-ODHP conditions. Additionally, improving the regeneration protocols to effectively remove coke while preserving the catalyst's active sites could be another avenue for enhancing the catalyst's lifetime and efficiency.

In summary, while N2O-ODHP offers advantages in terms of propene selectivity, the challenges of coke formation and catalyst deactivation necessitate further research and development to optimize its practical application.

在氧化脱氢反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂时，文献中提到了几个关键点。首先，Crx/SBA-1催化剂的催化性能在使用N2O作为氧化剂时得到显著提升，这导致丙烯选择性相对于其他氧化剂更高。初始活性、丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和副产物（CO/H2）的比例在N2O存在下优化。

然而，文献也指出，在使用N2O进行ODHP时催化剂失活和稳定性面临的挑战。催化剂失活主要归因于过度结焦，这影响了催化剂的活性随时间的变化。结焦形成受到丙烷比丙烯更高的活性影响，导致反应过程中产生更多的结焦。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更具可行性，可以采取几种策略。研究方向可能集中在开发能够增强抵抗结焦能力的催化剂上。这可能涉及修改催化剂的组成、结构或制备过程，以提高其在N2O-ODHP条件下的稳定性。此外，改进再生程序以有效去除结焦同时保留催化剂的活性位点可能是延长催化剂寿命和效率的另一途径。

简而言之，尽管N2O-ODHP在丙烯选择性方面提供了优势，但结焦形成和催化剂失活的挑战需要进一步的研究和发展以优化其实用应用。

[1] "In the case of impregnated Crx/SBA-1,reduction with hydrogen leads to the formation of Cr3+ and partially of Cr2+ species. The presence of the strongly reduced Cr2+ species depends critically on chromium dispersion. A high dispersion allows for a deep reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+ species, while at a lower dispersion (higher concentration) Cr3+ species are the primary species formed during the reduction with H2."
[2] "In the RWGS reaction the CO formation rate rises together with the concentration of Cr redox species in CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts similar as in the case of DHPCO2. This conclusion is in agreement with previously reported results [18,23]."
[3] "During the process carried out in the presence of CO2 the band maximum is shifted to a lower wavelength (about 50 nm) that may indicate the higher Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio in the dehydrogenation of propane as compared to the CO2-free reaction."
[4] "The primary reason of deactivation during the propane dehydrogenation reaction is indeed coke formation. Irreversible deactivation of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst caused by either pore structure destruction and/or inactive species formation has a smaller impact."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The reduction with hydrogen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane leads to the formation of Cr3+ and partially Cr2+ species. The formation of strongly reduced Cr2+ species depends significantly on the dispersion of chromium. High dispersion enables a deep reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+, while lower dispersion results in the primary formation of Cr3+ species during hydrogen reduction.

2. In the reversible water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, the carbon monoxide (CO) formation rate increases with the concentration of redox chromium species in the CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts, similar to the case of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. This finding aligns with previous reports.

3. When propane is dehydrogenated in the presence of CO2, the maximum of the UVvis DR band shifts to a lower wavelength (approximately 50 nm), suggesting a higher Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio compared to dehydrogenation in CO2-free conditions.

4. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is coke formation. Irreversible deactivation due to pore structure destruction or the formation of inactive species has a lesser impact.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，氢还原导致形成Cr3+和部分Cr2+物种。强烈还原的Cr2+物种的形成在很大程度上依赖于铬的分散度。高分散度允许深度还原Cr6+到Cr2+物种，而较低的分散度（较高浓度）会导致主要形成Cr3+物种。

2. 在可逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应中，随着CrOx/SBA-1催化剂中可还原物种浓度的增加，CO生成速率上升，与丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢反应情况相似。这一发现与之前的报道一致。

3. 当在CO2存在的条件下进行丙烷脱氢时，UVvis DR谱带的最大值向较低波长（大约50 nm）偏移，这可能表示与无CO2反应相比，丙烷脱氢过程中的Cr3+/Cr2+比率更高。

4. 烷基化催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的主要失效原因是焦炭沉积。不可逆失效由于孔结构破坏或形成不活性物种的影响较小。
