The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has not been extensively studied. However, the literature indicates that chromium oxide supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2) catalysts are effective for ODHP when using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant. The study highlights the importance of optimizing reaction conditions to achieve high conversions, akin to industrial processes. The highest activity, selectivity, and stability were observed with a catalyst containing 5.0 wt% Cr loading. The research focuses on the catalytic performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions. These catalysts are tested using both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants. The study also employs diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to evaluate the structure-function relationships of the supported chromium species.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP include maintaining high selectivity and efficiency under various operational conditions. Strategies to address these limitations could involve refining the catalyst preparation process, optimizing the reaction parameters, and exploring the use of different catalyst supports or additives. Research directions might focus on developing novel catalyst compositions or modifying existing ones to enhance stability and selectivity, especially in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures. Additionally, understanding the detailed mechanisms of deactivation could lead to the design of more durable catalysts capable of operating over longer periods without significant loss of activity or selectivity.

氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的氧化剂的研究尚未广泛进行。然而，文献表明，含有氧化铬（CrOx）的硅酸盐（SiO2）催化剂在使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂时，对于ODHP是有效的。研究强调了优化反应条件以达到与工业过程相似的高转化率的重要性。具有5.0 wt% Cr负载量的催化剂显示出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。该研究聚焦于在高转化率下，CrOx/SiO2催化剂对丙烷和异丁烷的ODHP性能。这些催化剂在纯CO2和CO2/O2混合物作为氧化剂的情况下进行了测试。研究还通过扩散反射紫外可见光谱（DR UVvis）评估了支持的铬物种的结构-功能关系。

ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战包括在各种操作条件下保持高选择性和效率。解决这些限制的策略可能包括改进催化剂制备过程、优化反应参数，并探索不同催化剂支撑或添加剂的使用。研究方向可能集中在开发新型催化剂组成或修改现有组成以增强稳定性和选择性，尤其是在存在CO2或CO2/O2混合物时。此外，深入了解脱活机制可以导致设计更耐用的催化剂，这些催化剂可以在较长时间内无显著活性或选择性损失的情况下运行。
