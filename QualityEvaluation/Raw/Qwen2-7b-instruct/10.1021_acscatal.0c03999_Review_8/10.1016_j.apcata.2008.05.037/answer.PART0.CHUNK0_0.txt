[1] "Because of such composition natural gas is one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the production of energy and the production of other valuable molecules, like olefins."
[2] "Unfortu- nately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required."
[3] "Additionally, higher reaction temperatures favour the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, resulting into the production of lighter alkanes and coke."
[4] "A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant."
[5] "Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process."
[6] "Never- theless, the industrial application of this process has been till now prevented by the low selectivity due to the over-oxidation of alkanes and alkenes to carbon oxides, and explosion hazards of hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures."
[7] "As a possible improvement, the addition of CO2 to the feed has been considered, also on the basis of the successful examples of other partial oxidation reactions, such as dry reforming [3,4] and oxidative coupling of methane [5,6]."
[8] "However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand."
[9] "Furthermore, coke formation is decreased also, resulting in an increased catalyst stability."
[10] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."
[11] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there are no advantages or disadvantages presented regarding the use of N2O compared to other oxidants, nor are any specific catalysts employed in this process mentioned. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not addressed in the context of N2O-ODHP. Potential strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation are not outlined within the document.

Answer: There are no relevant quotes addressing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), including its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Potential strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation are not provided in the document.
