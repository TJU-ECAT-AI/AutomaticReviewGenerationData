Analysis of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) indicates that its adoption offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are mainly related to the optimization of operational conditions to match industrial standards, which typically require conversions of at least 50% and total olefin selectivities of at least 90%.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, strategies or research directions could focus on:
1. Fine-tuning the catalyst preparation process to achieve more stable and dispersed chromates, enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Optimizing the reaction conditions to closely match industrial requirements, ensuring high conversions and selectivities.
3. Investigating the interaction mechanisms between the oxidant (N2O) and the catalyst surface to improve the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.
4. Developing advanced analytical techniques to monitor the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction, aiding in the understanding of deactivation mechanisms and proposing countermeasures.
5. Exploring the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other gases or additives that might enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalysts in ODHP reactions.

使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）中的氧化脱氢分析表明，与其它氧化剂相比，其在丙烯选择性方面具有优势。所使用的催化剂包括铬支持在各种氧化物、沸石、活性碳和钻石上。催化剂失活和稳定性的问题主要与优化操作条件以匹配工业标准有关，这些标准通常要求转化率至少为50%，总烯烃选择性至少为90%。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：
1. 精细调整催化剂制备过程以实现更稳定的铬分散，增强催化活性和选择性。
2. 优化反应条件，使其尽可能接近工业需求，确保高转化率和选择性。
3. 探究氧化剂（N2O）与催化剂表面之间的相互作用机制，以提高脱氢过程的效率。
4. 开发先进的分析技术来监测催化剂在反应过程中的动态行为，有助于理解失活机制并提出对策。
5. 探索结合N2O与其他气体或添加剂的协同效应，这可能增强催化剂在ODHP反应中的选择性和稳定性。
