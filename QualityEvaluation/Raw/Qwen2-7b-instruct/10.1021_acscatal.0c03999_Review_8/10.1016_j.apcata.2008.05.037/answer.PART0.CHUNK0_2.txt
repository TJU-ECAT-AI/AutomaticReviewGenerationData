[1] "Unfortunately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required."
[2] "Additionally, higher reaction temperatures favour the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, resulting into the production of lighter alkanes and coke."
[3] "A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant."
[4] "Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process."
[5] "However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand."
[6] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."
[7] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability."
[8] "Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."
[9] "As an aspect of novelty, herein we report a study of the catalytic performance of a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts,tested in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions."
[10] "The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not extensively discussed in the provided literature. However, the document does highlight the importance of using suitable oxidants to overcome thermodynamic restrictions in dehydrogenation processes. For propane, direct dehydrogenation is endothermic, and thus, the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand when using CO2 as an oxidant. The study focuses on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, testing their performance in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions, using both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures. The catalyst activity seems correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. This suggests that improving catalyst stability and enhancing propene and isobutene selectivity could be potential strategies to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The Chinese version of the answer is as follows:

文献中没有详细讨论使用笑气(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应(ODHP)中的应用。然而，文献确实强调了在脱氢过程中使用合适氧化剂的重要性。对于丙烷而言，直接脱氢是吸热过程，因此通过添加少量氧气，可以降低使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时的能量需求。研究重点考察了CrOx/SiO2催化剂在高转化率下对丙烷和异丁烷的ODH性能，使用了纯二氧化碳和二氧化碳/氧气混合物两种氧化剂。催化剂活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐有关，向反应混合物中引入氧气至5.0体积%可显著提高催化剂活性和稳定性。这表明，通过改善催化剂稳定性并增强丙烯和异丁烯的选择性，可能有助于使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选项。
