[1] "Because of such composition natural gas is one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the production of energy and the production of other valuable molecules, like olefins."
[2] "Unfortu- nately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required."
[3] "Additionally, higher reaction temperatures favour the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, resulting into the production of lighter alkanes and coke."
[4] "A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant."
[5] "Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process."
[6] "Never- theless, the industrial application of this process has been till now prevented by the low selectivity due to the over-oxidation of alkanes and alkenes to carbon oxides, and explosion hazards of hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures."
[7] "As a possible improvement, the addition of CO2 to the feed has been considered, also on the basis of the successful examples of other partial oxidation reactions, such as dry reforming [3,4] and oxidative coupling of methane [5,6]."
[8] "However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand."
[9] "Furthermore, coke formation is decreased also, resulting in an increased catalyst stability."
[10] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."
[11] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has not been extensively studied. However, the literature indicates that chromium oxide supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2) catalysts are effective for ODHP when using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant. The study highlights the importance of optimizing reaction conditions to achieve high conversions, akin to industrial processes. The highest activity, selectivity, and stability were observed with a catalyst containing 5.0 wt% Cr loading. The research focuses on the catalytic performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions. These catalysts are tested using both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants. The study also employs diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to evaluate the structure-function relationships of the supported chromium species.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP include maintaining high selectivity and efficiency under various operational conditions. Strategies to address these limitations could involve refining the catalyst preparation process, optimizing the reaction parameters, and exploring the use of different catalyst supports or additives. Research directions might focus on developing novel catalyst compositions or modifying existing ones to enhance stability and selectivity, especially in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures. Additionally, understanding the detailed mechanisms of deactivation could lead to the design of more durable catalysts capable of operating over longer periods without significant loss of activity or selectivity.

氮氧化物（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的氧化剂的研究尚未广泛进行。然而，文献表明，含有氧化铬（CrOx）的硅酸盐（SiO2）催化剂在使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂时，对于ODHP是有效的。研究强调了优化反应条件以达到与工业过程相似的高转化率的重要性。具有5.0 wt% Cr负载量的催化剂显示出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。该研究聚焦于在高转化率下，CrOx/SiO2催化剂对丙烷和异丁烷的ODHP性能。这些催化剂在纯CO2和CO2/O2混合物作为氧化剂的情况下进行了测试。研究还通过扩散反射紫外可见光谱（DR UVvis）评估了支持的铬物种的结构-功能关系。

ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战包括在各种操作条件下保持高选择性和效率。解决这些限制的策略可能包括改进催化剂制备过程、优化反应参数，并探索不同催化剂支撑或添加剂的使用。研究方向可能集中在开发新型催化剂组成或修改现有组成以增强稳定性和选择性，尤其是在存在CO2或CO2/O2混合物时。此外，深入了解脱活机制可以导致设计更耐用的催化剂，这些催化剂可以在较长时间内无显著活性或选择性损失的情况下运行。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not extensively discussed in the provided literature. However, the document does highlight the importance of using suitable oxidants to overcome thermodynamic restrictions in dehydrogenation processes. For propane, direct dehydrogenation is endothermic, and thus, the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand when using CO2 as an oxidant. The study focuses on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, testing their performance in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions, using both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures. The catalyst activity seems correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. This suggests that improving catalyst stability and enhancing propene and isobutene selectivity could be potential strategies to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

文献中没有详细讨论使用笑气(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应(ODHP)中的应用。然而，文献确实强调了在脱氢过程中使用合适氧化剂的重要性。对于丙烷而言，直接脱氢是吸热过程，因此通过添加少量氧气，可以降低使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时的能量需求。研究重点考察了CrOx/SiO2催化剂在高转化率下对丙烷和异丁烷的ODH性能，使用了纯二氧化碳和二氧化碳/氧气混合物两种氧化剂。催化剂活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐有关，向反应混合物中引入氧气至5.0体积%可显著提高催化剂活性和稳定性。这表明，通过改善催化剂稳定性并增强丙烯和异丁烯的选择性，可能有助于使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用的可行选项。

Analysis of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) indicates that its adoption offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are mainly related to the optimization of operational conditions to match industrial standards, which typically require conversions of at least 50% and total olefin selectivities of at least 90%.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, strategies or research directions could focus on:
1. Fine-tuning the catalyst preparation process to achieve more stable and dispersed chromates, enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Optimizing the reaction conditions to closely match industrial requirements, ensuring high conversions and selectivities.
3. Investigating the interaction mechanisms between the oxidant (N2O) and the catalyst surface to improve the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.
4. Developing advanced analytical techniques to monitor the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction, aiding in the understanding of deactivation mechanisms and proposing countermeasures.
5. Exploring the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other gases or additives that might enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalysts in ODHP reactions.
