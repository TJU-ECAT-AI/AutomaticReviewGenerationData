[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins."
[4] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[5] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[6] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is analyzed in the context of its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This process is discussed within the framework of employing various catalysts, with a focus on H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are also highlighted. Strategies or research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation are proposed.

Advantages of using N2O as an oxidant include its environmental benefits due to lower nitrogen emissions compared to traditional oxidants like air or oxygen. It offers higher propylene selectivity, which is crucial for efficient propylene production. The use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, is emphasized as being particularly effective due to its high resistance to deactivation and superior propylene yield.

Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are significant concerns. These issues can limit the efficiency and longevity of the process, affecting the economic viability of N2O-ODHP. Addressing these challenges may involve developing new catalyst formulations, improving synthesis techniques, or exploring operational conditions that enhance catalyst performance.

Potential strategies to overcome these limitations might include:
1. **Catalyst Design**: Developing novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity tailored for N2O-ODHP reactions.
2. **Process Optimization**: Fine-tuning reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and flow rates, to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions.
3. **Catalyst Recycling**: Implementing systems for efficient catalyst regeneration to prolong the life cycle and reduce costs.
4. **Material Science Advances**: Utilizing advanced materials science to create catalysts with improved properties, such as increased surface area, better porosity, or enhanced thermal stability.
5. **Research Directions**: Conducting fundamental research to understand the underlying mechanisms of N2O interaction with catalysts and the role of different parameters in influencing reaction kinetics and product distribution.

By focusing on these areas, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a viable and environmentally friendly method for propylene production could be significantly enhanced.
