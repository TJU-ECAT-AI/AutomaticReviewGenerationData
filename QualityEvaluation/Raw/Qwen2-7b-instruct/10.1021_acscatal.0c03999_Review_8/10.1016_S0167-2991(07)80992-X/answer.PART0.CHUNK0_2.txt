[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite; and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
[3] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[4] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[5] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The document discusses the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, in catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. The study found that the acid strength of these catalysts follows the order H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite, while their stability follows the opposite order. H-ZSM-5 was determined to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking due to its high propylene yield and resistance to deactivation. Zeolites are chosen for their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, which are beneficial for industrial processes.

文献讨论了在C4烯烃裂化中使用沸石（特别是H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）制备丙烯的可能性。研究发现，这些催化剂的酸强度顺序为H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite，而稳定性顺序则相反。H-ZSM-5被证明是C4烯烃裂化生成丙烯的最佳催化剂，因为它具有较高的丙烯产率和抗失活能力。选择沸石是因为它们具有热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，这些特性对工业过程有益。
