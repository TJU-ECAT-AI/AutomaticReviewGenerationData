[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focused on the use of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 in catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins. These zeolites were synthesized using different directing agents. In terms of catalytic performance for C4-olefin cracking, the order of acid strength followed H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite. Stability was highest for H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite showed the best performance in producing propylene, especially when used in its crystalline form with smaller particle sizes, which demonstrated higher stability over prolonged operation.

研究集中在对C4-烯烃进行催化裂解的沸石ZSM-5、莫登石和SAPO-34的使用。这些沸石分别使用不同的定向剂合成。在C4-烯烃裂解的催化性能方面，酸性强度的顺序为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite。稳定性最高的是H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。H-ZSM-5沸石显示出最佳的丙烯生成性能，尤其是在其结晶形式下使用较小颗粒尺寸时，表现出更高的长期稳定性。
