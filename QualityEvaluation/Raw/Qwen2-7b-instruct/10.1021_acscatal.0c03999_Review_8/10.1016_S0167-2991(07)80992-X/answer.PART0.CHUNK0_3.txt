[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[4] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[5] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

In the context of producing propylene, the use of zeolites as catalysts in the catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins is explored. Zeolites, due to their exceptional thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, are widely utilized in industrial processes. Specifically, among the samples tested, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite stands out as the most effective catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefins, offering both high resistance to deactivation and high propylene yields. This makes it a superior choice compared to other catalysts in terms of efficiency and longevity in propylene production processes.
