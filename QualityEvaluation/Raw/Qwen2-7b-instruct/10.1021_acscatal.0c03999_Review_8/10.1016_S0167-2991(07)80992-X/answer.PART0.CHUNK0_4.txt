[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[7] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,"
[8] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The development of processes with high propylene yield is desirable due to the growing demand for propylene derivatives and the limitations of traditional methods. Zeolites, with their unique properties, are widely used in industrial processes for propylene production. In this study, the authors investigated the use of H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34 as catalysts for the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. Among these, H-ZSM-5 was found to be the most suitable catalyst, offering high stability and propylene yield.

对于丙烯衍生物需求的增长以及传统方法的局限性，开发高丙烯产率的过程是必要的。由于其独特的性质，沸石在工业过程中被广泛用于丙烯生产。在这项研究中，作者探讨了使用H-莫来石、H-ZSM-5和H-SAPO-34作为C4-烯烃催化裂解制取丙烯的催化剂的可能性。其中，H-ZSM-5被认为是最佳的沸石催化剂，既具有良好的稳定性又能够产生较高的丙烯产量。
