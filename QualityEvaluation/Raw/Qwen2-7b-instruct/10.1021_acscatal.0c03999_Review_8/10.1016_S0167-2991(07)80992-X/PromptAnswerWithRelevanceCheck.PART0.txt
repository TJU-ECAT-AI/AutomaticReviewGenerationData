[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins."
[4] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[5] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[6] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is analyzed in the context of its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This process is discussed within the framework of employing various catalysts, with a focus on H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are also highlighted. Strategies or research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation are proposed.

Advantages of using N2O as an oxidant include its environmental benefits due to lower nitrogen emissions compared to traditional oxidants like air or oxygen. It offers higher propylene selectivity, which is crucial for efficient propylene production. The use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, is emphasized as being particularly effective due to its high resistance to deactivation and superior propylene yield.

Challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability are significant concerns. These issues can limit the efficiency and longevity of the process, affecting the economic viability of N2O-ODHP. Addressing these challenges may involve developing new catalyst formulations, improving synthesis techniques, or exploring operational conditions that enhance catalyst performance.

Potential strategies to overcome these limitations might include:
1. **Catalyst Design**: Developing novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity tailored for N2O-ODHP reactions.
2. **Process Optimization**: Fine-tuning reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and flow rates, to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions.
3. **Catalyst Recycling**: Implementing systems for efficient catalyst regeneration to prolong the life cycle and reduce costs.
4. **Material Science Advances**: Utilizing advanced materials science to create catalysts with improved properties, such as increased surface area, better porosity, or enhanced thermal stability.
5. **Research Directions**: Conducting fundamental research to understand the underlying mechanisms of N2O interaction with catalysts and the role of different parameters in influencing reaction kinetics and product distribution.

By focusing on these areas, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a viable and environmentally friendly method for propylene production could be significantly enhanced.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，分析了与使用其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面的优势。在此背景下讨论了采用不同催化剂的方法，重点是H-mordenite、H-ZSM-5和H-SAPO-34。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战也得到了突出强调。提出了策略或研究方向，以解决这些限制，并可能使N2O-ODHP成为实际实施的可行选项。

使用N2O作为氧化剂的优点包括其环境效益，由于氮排放较低，与传统氧化剂（如空气或氧气）相比。它提供了更高的丙烯选择性，这对于有效丙烯生产至关重要。特别强调H-ZSM-5作为具有高失活抵抗力和优越丙烯产量的沸石的使用。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战是重大问题。这些问题可以限制过程的效率和寿命，影响N2O-ODHP过程的经济可行性。通过解决这些挑战，可能涉及开发新型催化剂，改进合成技术，或探索提高催化剂性能的操作条件。

克服这些限制的潜在策略可能包括：
1. **催化剂设计**：开发专门针对N2O-ODHP反应的新催化剂，具有增强的稳定性和选择性。
2. **工艺优化**：精确调整反应条件，包括温度、压力和流速，以最大化丙烯产量同时减少副反应。
3. **催化剂回收**：实施有效的催化剂再生系统，延长使用寿命并降低成本。
4. **材料科学进步**：利用先进材料科学创建具有改善特性的催化剂，如增加表面积、更好的孔隙率或增强热稳定性。
5. **研究方向**：开展基础研究，以理解N2O与催化剂相互作用的底层机制及其不同参数在影响反应动力学和产品分布方面的作用。

通过关注这些领域，N2O-ODHP作为可行且环保的丙烯生产方法的潜力可以显著提高。

The study focused on the use of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 in catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins. These zeolites were synthesized using different directing agents. In terms of catalytic performance for C4-olefin cracking, the order of acid strength followed H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite. Stability was highest for H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite showed the best performance in producing propylene, especially when used in its crystalline form with smaller particle sizes, which demonstrated higher stability over prolonged operation.

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
