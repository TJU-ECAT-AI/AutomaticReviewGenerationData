[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6- 14]."
[2] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2,measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."
[3] "In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed. The molar ratio of H2/CO drops with increase of the reaction temperature, indicating that CO2 is activated at higher temperatures."
[4] "Such redox behaviour of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous observations [6,8], which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content."
[5] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

1. Chromium-containing catalysts exhibit activity in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2. Studies have indicated that the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield depends on the chromium loading, increasing with decreasing Cr content.
2. In the absence of CO2, the primary product is hydrogen. However, in the presence of CO2, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide decreases with an increase in reaction temperature, suggesting that CO2 becomes more active at higher temperatures.
3. The redox behavior of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts can explain why the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield decreases with increasing Cr content. At lower Cr contents, deeper reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ occurs, facilitating further reactions.
4. CO2 is identified as a weak oxidant in the regeneration of reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalysts. Oxygen demonstrates a significantly higher efficiency in reoxidation compared to CO2.

1. 含有铬的催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下表现出对烃类脱氢反应的活性。研究发现，二氧化碳促进丙烯产率的效果依赖于铬含量，随着铬含量的降低而增加。
2. 在没有二氧化碳的情况下，主要产物是氢气。然而，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，氢气和一氧化碳都形成。氢气与一氧化碳的比例随反应温度升高而降低，表明二氧化碳在较高温度下更活跃。
3. 硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物催化剂的还原行为可以解释为什么随着铬含量的增加，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果会降低。在较低的铬含量下，铬物种进一步还原为Cr2+，促进了后续反应。
4. 二氧化碳被确认为再生还原后的CrOx/SiO2催化剂的弱氧化剂。氧气在再氧化效率上比二氧化碳高得多。
