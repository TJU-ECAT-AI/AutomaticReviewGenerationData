[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]."
[2] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2,measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."
[3] "In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed."
[4] "The effect of contact time (W/F) on the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 is shown in Fig. 1."
[5] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."
[6] "This bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2."

An analysis of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The process typically involves a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, which demonstrates bi-functional characteristics, allowing for both dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the yield of propene, and its effectiveness is observed to depend on the chromium loading, particularly at lower concentrations where the reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. However, the regeneration of the catalyst using CO2 is inefficient, highlighting a critical challenge associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to address these limitations could include optimizing the catalyst composition to enhance stability, developing advanced regeneration techniques, or exploring alternative oxidants that might offer better reactivity or stability. These advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

对使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的分析显示，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面存在一些优势。该过程通常涉及一种由二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂，显示出双功能特性，允许同时进行脱氢和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应。在CO2的存在下，丙烯的产率得到提高，并且其有效性被发现取决于铬的负载量，尤其是在较低浓度时，铬物种可以进一步还原为Cr2+。然而，用CO2再生催化剂的效率低下，这表明催化剂失活和稳定性是关键挑战之一。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成以增强稳定性、开发先进的再生技术或探索其他可能提供更好反应性或稳定性的氧化剂。这些进步可能会使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
