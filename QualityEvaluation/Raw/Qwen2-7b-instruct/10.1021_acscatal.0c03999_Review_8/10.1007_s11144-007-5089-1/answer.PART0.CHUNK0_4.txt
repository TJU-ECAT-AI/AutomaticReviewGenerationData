[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support."
[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2,measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content."
[4] "In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed. The molar ratio of H2/CO drops with increase of the reaction temperature, indicating that CO2 is activated at higher temperatures."
[5] "As we found previously [21], the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions."
[6] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

The literature highlights the role of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It emphasizes the importance of catalyst choice, particularly silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, in achieving high propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages over other oxidants, including its ability to maintain a higher molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide at elevated temperatures, suggesting its potential for enhanced selectivity towards propylene production. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are discussed in relation to the chromium loading, with findings indicating that the promoting effect of N2O on propene yield increases with decreasing chromium content. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing reaction conditions, or exploring alternative catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity. Research directions might include the investigation of novel catalyst compositions, the development of advanced synthesis methods for improved dispersion of active sites, and the study of synergistic effects between different oxidants to optimize the ODHP process. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation in industrial settings.

文献强调了氮氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的作用，特别突出了催化剂选择的重要性，尤其是二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂，在实现高丙烯选择性方面的作用。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O作为ODHP过程中的氧化剂具有显著优势，特别是在提高氢气和一氧化碳摩尔比、促进丙烯生成方面表现出更高的选择性。催化剂失活和稳定性问题被讨论，发现随着铬含量的减少，N2O对丙烯产率的促进效果增加。为解决这些限制，可能的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂配方、优化反应条件或探索增强稳定性和活性的新型催化剂支撑材料。研究方向可能包括探索新型催化剂组成、改进合成方法以改善活性中心分散度以及研究不同氧化剂之间的协同效应，以优化ODHP过程。这些努力可能会使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用中一个更可行的选择。
