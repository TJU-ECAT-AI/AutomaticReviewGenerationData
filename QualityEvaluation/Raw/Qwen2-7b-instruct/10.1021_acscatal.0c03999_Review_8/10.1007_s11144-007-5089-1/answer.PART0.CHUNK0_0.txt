The study investigates the oxidative role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over CrOx/SiO2 catalysts with low chromium content. The total amount of chromium deposited on the silica surface is below the monolayer capacity. In the presence of CO2, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced, while in the absence of CO2, hydrogen is the primary product. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene increases with decreasing chromium content. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst shows bi-functional characteristics, being active in both dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reactions. The regeneration of the catalyst using pulses of oxygen leads to a significant decrease in the absorption band at 650 nm, suggesting that oxygen is a more effective oxidant than CO2 for catalyst reactivation. This indicates that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized to Cr6+, is not the effective pathway for propene formation.

该研究探讨了CO2在低铬含量CrOx/SiO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中的氧化作用。SiO2表面沉积的铬总量低于单层容量。在CO2存在下，生成氢和一氧化碳，而在无CO2条件下，主要生成氢。CO2对丙烯产率的促进效果随铬含量降低而增加。CrOx/SiO2催化剂表现出双功能特性，在脱氢和逆水煤气变换反应中均有效。通过氧脉冲处理还原的催化剂，吸收波长为650nm的谱带显著减少，表明氧是更有效的氧化剂用于催化剂再活化。这表明，由CO2直接氧化脱氢丙烷，使Cr3+离子氧化为Cr6+的过程不是形成丙烯的有效途径。
