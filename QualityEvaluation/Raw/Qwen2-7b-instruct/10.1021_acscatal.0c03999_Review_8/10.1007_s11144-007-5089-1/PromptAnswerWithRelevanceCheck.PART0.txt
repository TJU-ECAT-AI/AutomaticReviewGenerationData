The study investigates the oxidative role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over CrOx/SiO2 catalysts with low chromium content. The total amount of chromium deposited on the silica surface is below the monolayer capacity. In the presence of CO2, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced, while in the absence of CO2, hydrogen is the primary product. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene increases with decreasing chromium content. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst shows bi-functional characteristics, being active in both dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reactions. The regeneration of the catalyst using pulses of oxygen leads to a significant decrease in the absorption band at 650 nm, suggesting that oxygen is a more effective oxidant than CO2 for catalyst reactivation. This indicates that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized to Cr6+, is not the effective pathway for propene formation.

该研究探讨了CO2在低铬含量CrOx/SiO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中的氧化作用。SiO2表面沉积的铬总量低于单层容量。在CO2存在下，生成氢和一氧化碳，而在无CO2条件下，主要生成氢。CO2对丙烯产率的促进效果随铬含量降低而增加。CrOx/SiO2催化剂表现出双功能特性，在脱氢和逆水煤气变换反应中均有效。通过氧脉冲处理还原的催化剂，吸收波长为650nm的谱带显著减少，表明氧是更有效的氧化剂用于催化剂再活化。这表明，由CO2直接氧化脱氢丙烷，使Cr3+离子氧化为Cr6+的过程不是形成丙烯的有效途径。

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

N2O is considered as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because of its potential to enhance propylene selectivity. Compared to other oxidants, N2O shows a unique capability to improve propylene yield in the presence of chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the nature of the support material and the chromium loading, as the promoting effect of N2O on propene yield diminishes with increasing chromium content. The redox behavior of the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts plays a crucial role in this process, enabling a reversible conversion between chromium species that facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation.

Challenges in N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and stability issues. The reduced chromium species tend to be deactivated upon exposure to N2O, leading to decreased propene production over time. This is because N2O is a weak oxidant, and its reoxidation efficiency is significantly lower than that of oxygen, as demonstrated by in situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) studies. This suggests that direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by N2O, where chromium species are reoxidized to chromium hexoxides, is not an effective pathway for propene formation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable industrial option, several strategies could be pursued. Firstly, developing catalysts with improved stability against deactivation in the presence of N2O could involve optimizing the support material, adjusting the chromium loading, or incorporating additional stabilizing elements. Secondly, exploring the use of alternative oxidants or combinations of oxidants that might offer better reoxidation efficiency than N2O could enhance propene yield. Lastly, enhancing the understanding of the redox mechanisms involved in the ODHP process, particularly focusing on how N2O interacts with chromium species on the catalyst surface, could lead to the design of more efficient catalyst systems. Research efforts should aim to identify conditions that maximize propene selectivity while minimizing catalyst degradation, thereby facilitating the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP processes.

分析在氧化脱氢反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂的优缺点，与其它氧化剂相比，讨论其在丙烯选择性方面的优势，所使用的催化剂类型，以及催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战。此外，提出策略或研究方向，以解决这些限制，并有可能使N2O-ODHP成为实用实施的更可行选项。

N2O被认为是一种用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程的氧化剂，因为它能够提高丙烯的选择性。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O在以硅质材料（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x等）支持的铬氧化物催化剂存在的条件下，显示出增强丙烯产率的能力。然而，其有效性高度依赖于支撑材料的性质和铬的负载量，随着铬含量的增加，N2O对丙烯产率的促进效果会降低。SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂的这种氧化还原行为对于此过程至关重要，它允许铬物种之间的可逆转换，从而促进氧化脱氢过程。

N2O-ODHP过程面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性问题。还原的铬物种容易在暴露于N2O时被失活，导致丙烯产量随时间逐渐下降。这是因为N2O是一种弱氧化剂，其重新氧化效率远低于氧气，如通过原位漫反射光谱（DRS）研究表明。这表明直接通过N2O氧化丙烷形成丙烯，其中铬物种被氧化为铬六氧化物，不是一个有效的途径。

为了克服这些局限性并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业选择，可以采取几种策略。首先，开发具有改善稳定性的催化剂，使其在N2O存在下不易失活，可能涉及优化支撑材料、调整铬负载量或引入额外的稳定元素。其次，探索替代氧化剂或N2O与其他氧化剂的组合，可能提供比N2O更好的重新氧化效率，从而提高丙烯产率。最后，增强对ODHP过程中N2O与催化剂表面的铬物种之间相互作用机制的理解，可以帮助设计更高效的催化剂系统。研究工作应旨在识别最大化丙烯选择性同时减少催化剂降解的条件，从而促进N2O-ODHP过程的实用实施。

An analysis of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reveals several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The process typically involves a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, which demonstrates bi-functional characteristics, allowing for both dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. The presence of CO2 enhances the yield of propene, and its effectiveness is observed to depend on the chromium loading, particularly at lower concentrations where the reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. However, the regeneration of the catalyst using CO2 is inefficient, highlighting a critical challenge associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to address these limitations could include optimizing the catalyst composition to enhance stability, developing advanced regeneration techniques, or exploring alternative oxidants that might offer better reactivity or stability. These advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

对使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的分析显示，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面存在一些优势。该过程通常涉及一种由二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂，显示出双功能特性，允许同时进行脱氢和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应。在CO2的存在下，丙烯的产率得到提高，并且其有效性被发现取决于铬的负载量，尤其是在较低浓度时，铬物种可以进一步还原为Cr2+。然而，用CO2再生催化剂的效率低下，这表明催化剂失活和稳定性是关键挑战之一。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括优化催化剂组成以增强稳定性、开发先进的再生技术或探索其他可能提供更好反应性或稳定性的氧化剂。这些进步可能会使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。

1. Chromium-containing catalysts exhibit activity in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2. Studies have indicated that the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield depends on the chromium loading, increasing with decreasing Cr content.
2. In the absence of CO2, the primary product is hydrogen. However, in the presence of CO2, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide decreases with an increase in reaction temperature, suggesting that CO2 becomes more active at higher temperatures.
3. The redox behavior of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts can explain why the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield decreases with increasing Cr content. At lower Cr contents, deeper reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ occurs, facilitating further reactions.
4. CO2 is identified as a weak oxidant in the regeneration of reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalysts. Oxygen demonstrates a significantly higher efficiency in reoxidation compared to CO2.

The literature highlights the role of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It emphasizes the importance of catalyst choice, particularly silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, in achieving high propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages over other oxidants, including its ability to maintain a higher molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide at elevated temperatures, suggesting its potential for enhanced selectivity towards propylene production. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are discussed in relation to the chromium loading, with findings indicating that the promoting effect of N2O on propene yield increases with decreasing chromium content. Strategies to address these limitations could involve developing more robust catalyst formulations, optimizing reaction conditions, or exploring alternative catalyst supports that enhance stability and activity. Research directions might include the investigation of novel catalyst compositions, the development of advanced synthesis methods for improved dispersion of active sites, and the study of synergistic effects between different oxidants to optimize the ODHP process. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation in industrial settings.
