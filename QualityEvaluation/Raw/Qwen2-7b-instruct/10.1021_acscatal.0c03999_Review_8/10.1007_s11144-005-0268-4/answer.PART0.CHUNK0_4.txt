[1] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[2] "When the reaction was conducted in N2, 0% conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide."
[3] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."
[4] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."
[5] "The addition of K decreased the strength of the acid sites. The 5%Cr-0.2%K/SiO2 showed the initial heat of 75 kJ/mol and the saturation coverage of about 230 mol/g for NH3 adsorption. The number of acid sites was further decreased to 140 mol/g when the loading of K was increased to 0.4%. The acidic sites were almost disappeared when K loading was increased to 1%."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity. This is due to N2O's ability to increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by diluting the reactant, maintaining catalyst activity by preventing coke formation, and increasing propane conversion through the reversed water-gas shift reaction. In the absence of N2O, the conversion of propane is notably low, and the activity of catalysts like Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 deactivates within 120 minutes. However, when N2O is present, it significantly improves the conversion of propane and maintains the selectivity towards propylene. The presence of N2O also inhibits the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surfaces, which is beneficial for the long-term stability of the catalytic process.

Various catalysts have been employed in ODHP processes, including chromium oxide-based catalysts (Cr/SiO2), modified with alkali and alkaline-earth oxides such as potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and barium (Ba). These catalysts exhibit different performances based on their composition and loading. For instance, the addition of potassium (K) into Cr/SiO2 catalysts enhances the selectivity towards propylene, albeit at the cost of a slight decrease in the conversion of propane. The optimal loading of K seems to be around 0.2-0.4% for achieving the highest yield and selectivity to propylene.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP processes include the potential for carbon deposition, which can lead to a decrease in activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation may involve the development of more robust catalyst materials with enhanced resistance to carbon deposition and improved stability. Research directions could focus on the optimization of catalyst composition and preparation methods, the exploration of novel catalytic systems that are less susceptible to deactivation, and the integration of advanced monitoring and control technologies to maintain optimal operating conditions and prolong catalyst life.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有几个优势，特别是在提高丙烯选择性方面。这主要是由于N2O能够通过稀释丙烷来增加反应的平衡转化率，通过防止焦炭形成维持催化剂活性，并通过逆向水煤气变换反应增加丙烷转化率。没有N2O时，丙烷的转化率明显较低，Cr-Mg/SiO2和Cr-Ca/SiO2等催化剂在120分钟内完全失去活性。然而，当存在N2O时，它显著提高了丙烷的转化率并保持了丙烯的选择性。N2O的存在还抑制了催化剂表面碳的沉积，这对催化过程的长期稳定性有益。

在ODHP过程中使用了多种催化剂，包括基于氧化铬的催化剂（Cr/SiO2），与碱金属氧化物（如钾（K）、镁（Mg）、钙（Ca）和钡（Ba））和碱土金属氧化物改性。这些催化剂的性能根据其组成和负载不同。例如，在Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加钾（K）可以增强丙烯的选择性，尽管丙烷转化率略有下降。K的最优负载约为0.2-0.4%，以实现最高产率和丙烯选择性。

N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的关键挑战包括潜在的碳沉积，这可能导致活性随时间逐渐降低。解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为实际应用更可行的方法可能涉及开发更耐用的催化剂材料，这些材料具有增强的抗碳沉积能力和改善的稳定性。研究方向可能集中在催化剂组成的优化和制备方法的探索上，新型催化系统的开发，这些系统对失活的抵抗力较小，以及先进的监控和控制技术的集成，以保持最佳操作条件并延长催化剂寿命。
