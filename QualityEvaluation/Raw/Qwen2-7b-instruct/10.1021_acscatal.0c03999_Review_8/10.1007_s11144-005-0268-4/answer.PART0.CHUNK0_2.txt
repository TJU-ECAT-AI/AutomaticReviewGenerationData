[1] "In situ ESR and UV-Vis DRS measurements [9] indicated that the active centers in the CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species,which might be generated by the oxidation of Cr3+ species."
[2] "The addition of K decreased the strength of the acid sites."
[3] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[4] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[5] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages. Firstly, N2O provides higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is due to its ability to effectively inhibit the formation of coke and reduce hydrogen concentration, thereby promoting the desired propylene production. The study employed a variety of catalysts, including Cr/SiO2 modified with alkali and alkaline-earth oxides, which demonstrated improved selectivity towards propylene upon the addition of potassium (K).

However, the catalysts faced challenges such as deactivation and instability over time. To address these limitations, researchers can explore strategies like modifying the catalyst composition, optimizing the reaction conditions, or developing new catalyst materials that are more resistant to deactivation and maintain stability. Further investigation into the specific mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and the role of N2O in the reaction process could also lead to improvements in the efficiency and practicality of N2O-ODHP.

In conclusion, while N2O-ODHP shows promise due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity, ongoing research is required to overcome catalyst deactivation and instability issues, making the process more viable for commercial application.

使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用提供了一系列优势。首先，N2O提供了比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性。这是由于其能够有效抑制焦炭形成并减少氢浓度，从而促进所需丙烯生产的能力。研究采用了包括铬/二氧化硅改性的碱土金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂，发现钾的添加可以提高丙烯的选择性。

然而，催化剂面临着失活和不稳定的问题。为了解决这些限制，研究人员可以探索策略如修改催化剂组成、优化反应条件或开发更耐失活且稳定的新催化剂材料。进一步研究催化剂失活的具体机制以及N2O在反应过程中的作用，也可能导致效率和实用性的改进。

总之，尽管N2O-ODHP显示出通过提高丙烯选择性而有潜力，但需要持续研究以克服催化剂失活和稳定性问题，使其成为商业应用的可行选项。
