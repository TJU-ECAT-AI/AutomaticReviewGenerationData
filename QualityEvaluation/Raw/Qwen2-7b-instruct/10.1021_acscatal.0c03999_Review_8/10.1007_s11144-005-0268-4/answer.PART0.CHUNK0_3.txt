[1] "In situ ESR and UV-Vis DRS measurements [9] indicated that the active centers in the CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species,which might be generated by the oxidation of Cr3+ species."
[2] "One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction."
[3] "It was found that the surface acidity decreased with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward propylene."
[4] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K."
[5] "In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."
[6] "When the reaction was conducted in N2, 0% conversion of propane was observed, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min."
[7] "In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide."
[8] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."
[9] "The addition of K decreased the strength of the acid sites."
[10] "The acidic sites were almost disappeared when K loading was increased to 1%."
[11] "The modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts were found to be effective and selective for the dehydrogenation of propane in CO2."
[12] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[13] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
[14] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's ability to effectively oxidize Cr3+ ions to Cr5+ or Cr6+ species facilitates the formation of active catalyst sites essential for the ODHP process. This not only promotes the catalytic activity but also maintains the activity by reducing hydrogen concentration and inhibiting coke formation. 

Various catalysts, such as Cr/SiO2, Cr-TiO2, Cr-ZrO2, and Cr-MCM-41, have been employed in this process. The Cr/SiO2 catalysts, especially those modified with alkali and alkaline-earth oxides, exhibit enhanced selectivity towards propylene. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture increases the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene, making N2O-ODHP a promising approach.

However, the process faces critical challenges such as catalyst deactivation and instability. To address these limitations, researchers could focus on optimizing catalyst composition and structure. Strategies could include fine-tuning the loading of alkali and alkaline-earth metals to balance selectivity and conversion rates. Additionally, exploring alternative support materials or developing new catalyst designs that are more stable under reaction conditions could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂具有几个优势。N2O能够有效地将Cr3+离子氧化为Cr5+或Cr6+物种，这促进了催化剂活性点的形成，不仅促进了催化反应活性，还通过降低氢浓度和抑制焦炭形成维持了活性。

不同催化剂，如Cr/SiO2、Cr-TiO2、Cr-ZrO2和Cr-MCM-41，已被用于此过程。特别是经过碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂，显示出对丙烯的增强选择性。CO2的存在增加了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性，使N2O-ODHP成为有前景的方法。

然而，该过程面临催化剂失活和不稳定性等关键挑战。为了应对这些限制，研究人员可以集中优化催化剂组成和结构。策略可能包括精细调整碱金属和碱土金属的负载量，以平衡选择性和转化率。此外，探索替代支撑材料或开发在反应条件下更稳定的新型催化剂设计，可以使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项。
