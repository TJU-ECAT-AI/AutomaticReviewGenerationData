The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The document indicates that the presence of CO2 in the feed promotes the catalytic activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting coke formation. This suggests that N2O, when combined with CO2, could enhance the efficiency of ODHP due to its ability to maintain catalyst activity and improve propylene selectivity. 

A variety of catalysts, including Cr/SiO2 modified with alkali and alkaline-earth oxides, are employed in this process. The introduction of these metals into the catalyst modifies its surface properties, leading to a decrease in redox potential and surface acidity. This results in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity towards propylene. The optimized loading of K, around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, is particularly noted for significantly improving the selectivity to propylene.

However, the document highlights critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Without CO2, carbon deposition occurs on the catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane, which contrasts with the stable performance of the catalysts in the presence of CO2. This implies that maintaining catalyst activity requires the presence of CO2.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, strategies could focus on optimizing the loading of additives such as K to achieve the best balance between conversion and selectivity. Research could also explore the development of new catalysts or modification techniques that enhance stability and activity without relying on CO2. Additionally, studying the underlying mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition could lead to the design of more durable catalysts.

在氧化脱氢法（ODHP）中使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面与其他氧化剂相比，具有几个优势。文献表明，二氧化碳在原料中的存在可以促进Cr/SiO2催化剂的催化活性，并通过降低氢气浓度和抑制焦炭形成来维持活性。这表明，当结合二氧化碳使用时，N2O可能能够提高ODHP的效率，因为它可以保持催化剂活性并改善丙烯的选择性。

使用各种催化剂，包括添加碱金属或碱土金属氧化物的Cr/SiO2，进行此过程。这些金属的引入改变了催化剂的表面性质，导致还原电势和酸性表面的降低。这导致丙烷转化率的下降和丙烯选择性的增加。在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中，钾的最佳加载量约为0.2-0.4%，特别被注意到显著提高了丙烯选择性。

然而，文献指出了与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。没有二氧化碳，催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中会沉积碳。相比之下，在存在二氧化碳的情况下，催化剂表现出稳定的性能。这表明，保持催化剂活性需要二氧化碳的存在。

为了使N2O-ODHP更适用于实际应用，可以采取策略优化添加剂（如钾）的加载量，以实现最佳的转化率和选择性之间的平衡。研究还可以探索开发新催化剂或修改技术，以增强稳定性和活性，而无需依赖二氧化碳。此外，研究催化剂失活和碳沉积的机制可以引导设计更耐用的催化剂。
