The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows that the reactivity correlates with the strength of C-H bonds. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene under reaction conditions, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. In the conversion of CH2C6H6N2O4, N2O leads to the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane, with toluene having a notably higher yield. The main reaction pathway for the formation of toluene and xylenes involves oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring by methane.

在硝酸氧化下丙烷脱氢过程中，氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，其反应活性与C-H键强度相关。甲烷能够在苯环上进行烷基化反应，生成甲苯和二甲苯。通过动力学常数的比例，可以确定不同烃类的相对活性。在CH2C6H6N2O4的转化中，N2O导致生成甲苯、二甲苯、酚类以及二苯甲烷，其中甲苯的产率显著较高。甲苯和二甲苯的主要生成途径是通过甲烷的氧化甲基化反应对苯环进行修饰。
