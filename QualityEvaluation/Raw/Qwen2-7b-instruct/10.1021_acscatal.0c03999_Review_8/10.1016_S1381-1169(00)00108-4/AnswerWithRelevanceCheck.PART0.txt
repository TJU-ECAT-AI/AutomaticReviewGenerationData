          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) exhibits several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to its unique interaction with the catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock, which correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, yielding toluene and xylenes. This selective conversion is further supported by the ratio of kinetic constants, which can be used to gauge the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Notably, the use of N2O in this process leads to the absence of deep oxidation products like CO, CO, and instead increases the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CHCHN2 feed is utilized to elucidate the pathways of product formation. However, there are some discrepancies in the labeling patterns, such as less labeled carbon atoms in the molecules of Ind and Naph than expected, and the presence of non-labeled molecules contributing to their formation along with scrambled 13C labels.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂具有若干优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面优于其他氧化剂。这归功于它与催化剂和碳氢化合物原料的独特相互作用，与C-H键的强度相关联。甲烷能够使苯的芳环烷基化，产生对二甲苯和间二甲苯。这种选择性转化得到了动力学常数比例的支持，这可用于衡量碳氢化合物的相对活性。值得注意的是，在使用N2O的过程中，深氧化产物如CO、CO不存在，反而增加了对二甲苯、间二甲苯、酚类以及二苯甲烷的生成。通过标记13CHCHN2进料来阐明产物形成路径。然而，存在一些标记模式的差异，比如Ind和Naph分子中的标记碳原子数量少于预期，以及非标记分子在形成它们时贡献显著，并伴随着13C标签的剧烈混杂。

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, especially in terms of propylene selectivity. The reactivity of hydrocarbons during the conversion on HZSM-5 correlates with the strength of the C-H bond. Under specific reaction conditions, methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, resulting in the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions can be used to determine the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Remarkably, in the conversion of CH-C-H-N2O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO, CO, and an increased yield of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane. The conversion of labeled 13CH-C-H-N2O feed has been utilized to understand the pathways of product formation.
