[1] "N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·."
[2] "It has been observed in the OCM literature that monoatomic surface oxygen species (O*) are responsible for selective C2 formation, whereas molecular or gas phase oxygen species facilitate overoxidation."
[3] "The higher C2 selectivity with N2O as an oxidant in turn has afforded promising yields."
[4] "Several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems."
[5] "The addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the reactant mixture was observed to suppress total oxidation in N2O-OCM by replacing surface OH groups with Cl."
[6] "Chlorine has also been used as a dopant for perovskite catalysts."

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
