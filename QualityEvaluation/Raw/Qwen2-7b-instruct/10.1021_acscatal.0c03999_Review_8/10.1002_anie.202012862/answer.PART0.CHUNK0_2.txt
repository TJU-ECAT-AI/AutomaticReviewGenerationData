[1] "The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O2-OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources."
[2] "Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X-OCM) have not been overviewed in detail."
[3] "One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under reaction conditions. The replacement of O2 with other oxidants is one possible approach to achieve this goal."
[4] "Of course, catalyst- and reaction-dependent kinetic considerations relating to oxidant activation may also lead to mechanistic pathway differences when alternative oxidants are employed."
[5] "N2O is one possible alternative oxidant for OCM and related partial oxidation reactions."
[6] "It has been frequently investigated as an oxidant for methane partial oxidation to oxygenates such as methanol and formaldehyde over zeolite catalysts."
[7] "In particular, N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·."
[8] "Furthermore, N2O decomposes on the catalyst surface, leading to the release of N2 gas and the formation of surface oxygen sites."
[9] "Utilizing N2O as an oxidant could conceivably lead to enhanced C2 selectivity in OCM due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency compared to O2."
[10] "For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant."
[11] "The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O  sites,which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals."
[12] "The authors observed that N2O-OCM leads to decreased CO production and greater yields of C2 products."
[13] "In Pathway 1, the active centers for N2O decomposition are suggested to be coordinately unsaturated transition metal or redox active cations."
[14] "However, under excess N2O, the KIE increases to 1.9 and the reaction becomes first order in CH4,suggesting that C-H activation becomes rate-limiting."
[15] "In traditional O2-OCM, C-H activation is typically the rate-limiting step, even at low O2 concentrations."
[16] "Several reports using N2O as an oxidant also investigated the mechanism of N2O decomposition on the surface of metal oxide OCM catalysts."
[17] "Kinetic analyses over Pb/MgO revealed an N2O order that transitioned from 1 to 0 as the oxidant partial pressure was increased,although CH4 remained first order across all N2O/CH4 ratios."
[18] "Branco and coworkers studied a series of Ca/actinide oxide and Ca/lanthanide oxide catalysts for N2O-OCM in order to determine how basicity and reducibility affected the product distribution."
[19] "They found that catalyst basicity, as measured by CO2-TPD and probe reactions, correlated with high C2 yields over lanthanide and actinide oxides."
[20] "Interestingly, the authors observed that the catalysts are more active under N2O than under O2, contrary to most other systems."
[21] "In contrast, O2-OCM selectivity often falls significantly as more O2 is added due to overoxidation reactions in the gas phase."
[22] "Chlorine is also present in other effective N2O-OCM catalysts,such as KCl-LnCl3 molten salts."
[23] "The authors used O2-TPD to show that Cl-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.2Co0.8O3-δ can attain a greater density of adsorbed O* species than the undoped structure, leading to higher activity and C2 selectivity in N2O-OCM."
[24] "In fact, several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems."
[25] "Figure 5 depicts the conversion and C2 selectivity of the top-performing N2O-OCM catalysts. These high C2 yields highlight that N2O-OCM is an approach that merits further study during this shale gas age."
