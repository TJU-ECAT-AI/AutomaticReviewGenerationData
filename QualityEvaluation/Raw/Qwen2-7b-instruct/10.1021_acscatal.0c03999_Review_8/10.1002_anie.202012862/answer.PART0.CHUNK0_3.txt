[1] "The use of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers distinct advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants."
[2] "N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·, which prevents the formation of surface peroxo and gas phase oxygen that lead to overoxidation."
[3] "Catalysts for N2O-ODHP are frequently irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides."
[4] "Despite the promising results, N2O-ODHP faces significant challenges, including catalyst deactivation and instability."
[5] "Strategies to address these limitations could include developing new catalyst materials, improving reaction conditions, or finding ways to recycle deactivated catalysts."
