[1] "N2O is one possible alternative oxidant for OCM and related partial oxidation reactions."
[2] "Like CH4, N2O is a greenhouse gas, and its use in the production of value-added chemicals is desired."
[3] "It has been frequently investigated as an oxidant for methane partial oxidation to oxygenates such as methanol and formaldehyde over zeolite catalysts."
[4] "As such, N2O can also act as the oxidant for OCM (N2O-OCM) to form C2 products via equations 3-4."
[5] "Utilizing N2O as an oxidant could conceivably lead to enhanced C2 selectivity in OCM due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency compared to O2."

[7] "Furthermore, N2O decomposes on the catalyst surface, leading to the release of N2 gas and the formation of surface oxygen sites."
[8] "It has generally been observed in the OCM literature that monoatomic surface oxygen species (O*) are responsible for selective C2 formation, whereas molecular or gas phase oxygen species facilitate overoxidation."
[9] "Additionally, the range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider when using N2O, as there is no threat of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion as with O2."
[10] "The literature reports for each different alternative oxidant for X- OCM systems tend to highlight very different aspects of the catalytic reaction."

[15] "Even at approximately equal CH4 conversion levels, the C2 selectivity has been observed to be significantly higher using N2O than O2."
[16] "The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals."

[18] "Many of these studies attempted to differentiate between two possible N2O decomposition pathways."
[19] "In Pathway 1, N2O is activated at a coordination-unsaturated cation to form N2 gas and an O* species."

[26] "The authors used O2-TPD to show that Cl-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.2Co0.8O3-δ can attain a greater density of adsorbed O* species than the undoped structure, leading to higher activity and C2 selectivity in N2O-OCM."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a greenhouse gas, has the potential for enhanced C2 selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency. N2O provides only monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·, which prevents the formation of surface peroxo and gas-phase oxygen that lead to overoxidation. Moreover, N2O decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, contributing to the selective formation of C2 products. The range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider with N2O, reducing the risk of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion compared to oxygen. Catalysts for N2O-OCM are typically irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides, leading to reduced methane conversions but improved C2 selectivities compared to oxygen. The higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals. This results in significant C2 yields, often greater than 10%, surpassing many O2-OCM systems, making N2O-OCM a promising approach worth further exploration during the era of shale gas.

Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability in N2O-ODHP could include the development of more robust catalyst materials that maintain their activity and selectivity over longer periods. Research could focus on modifying catalyst structures to enhance stability while preserving or improving propylene selectivity. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and N2O concentration, could also play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and longevity of the N2O-ODHP process. Additionally, the integration of advanced catalytic materials and technologies, such as the use of supported catalysts or novel metal oxides, could provide a platform for overcoming catalyst deactivation and stability issues, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用笑气（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂时，文献表明了与其它氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面的优势。作为温室气体的N2O，在甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）过程中具有增强C2选择性的潜力，由于其相对温和的氧化性。N2O仅提供单原子氧物种，如O-·，这防止了表面过氧化物和气相氧的形成，从而导致过氧化。此外，N2O在催化剂表面的分解释放氮气气体，并形成表面氧位点，有助于选择性地形成C2产品。N2O的氧化剂/丙烷比例范围更宽，降低了与氧气相比爆炸或丙烷失控燃烧的风险。N2O-OCM催化剂通常为不可还原、碱土金属或稀土氧化物，导致甲烷转化率降低但C2选择性优于氧气。N2O更高的C2选择性归因于表面O或O*位点的优先形成，这些位点催化形成·CH3自由基。这导致显著的C2产率，往往超过10%，超过了众多O2-OCM系统，使N2O-OCM成为在页岩气时代值得进一步研究的方法。

为了克服N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性问题，可以采取的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料，以保持其活性和选择性更长时间。研究可以集中在修改催化剂结构，以增强稳定性同时保留或提高丙烯选择性。优化反应条件，如温度、压力和N2O浓度，也对提高效率和延长过程寿命至关重要。此外，集成先进的催化材料和技术，如支持型催化剂或新型金属氧化物的应用，可以为克服催化剂失活和稳定性问题提供平台，使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项。
