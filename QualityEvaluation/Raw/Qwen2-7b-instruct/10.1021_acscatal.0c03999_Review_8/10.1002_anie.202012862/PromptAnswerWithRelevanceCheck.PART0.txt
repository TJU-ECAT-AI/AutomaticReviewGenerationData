The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, particularly in enhancing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The ability of N2O to deliver monoatomic oxygen species, avoiding the formation of surface peroxo and gas phase oxygen that typically leads to overoxidation, contributes to the improved C2 selectivity observed in the literature. This is because monoatomic oxygen species are less likely to interact with CH4 radicals in the gas phase, thus reducing the formation of CO and CO2.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP processes, including basic, alkaline earth, and rare earth oxides. The reactivity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as surface basicity and oxygen content/lability. Catalysts with higher basicity, as measured by CO2-TPD, tend to display increased activity but may result in decreased C2 yields. On the other hand, catalysts with greater reducibility and more labile lattice oxygen species can exhibit higher activity, though with lower C2 yields.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the tendency of catalysts to lose activity over time and the requirement for careful management of the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst composition and support system to enhance stability, developing more robust catalyst structures, and exploring the use of additives or promoters that can improve the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Research directions to make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation might focus on:
1. Identifying new catalyst materials that are more resistant to deactivation and maintain high activity over longer periods.
2. Developing advanced synthesis methods that can tailor the catalyst's surface properties to optimize propylene selectivity.
3. Investigating the role of different reaction parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and N2O/CH4 ratio, to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.
4. Enhancing the understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved in N2O-ODHP to guide the design of more efficient catalysts and reactors.
5. Exploring the integration of N2O-ODHP processes with other hydrogen-rich gas streams to increase the overall efficiency and sustainability of the process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂，特别是提高丙烯选择性方面，具有若干优势。N2O能够提供单原子氧物种，避免表面过氧化物和气体相氧的形成，从而导致较高的C2选择性。这是因为单原子氧物种不太可能与CH4自由基在气体相中相互作用，因此减少CO和CO2的形成。

在N2O-ODHP过程中已经使用了各种催化剂，包括碱土金属、碱金属和稀土氧化物。这些催化剂的反应性和选择性受表面碱性、氧含量和活性的影响。测量CO2-TPD的高碱性催化剂倾向于显示增加的活性但C2产量降低。另一方面，具有更高还原性且晶格氧物种更易挥发的催化剂可以显示出更高的活性，尽管C2产量较低。

与N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战包括催化剂的失活和稳定性问题，以及需要仔细管理反应条件以防止不希望的副反应的要求。解决这些限制的策略包括优化催化剂组成和支持系统以增强稳定性，开发更耐用的催化剂结构，并探索可以改善催化活性和选择性的添加剂或促进剂。

为了使N2O-ODHP过程成为实际应用的可行选项，研究方向可能包括：
1. 确定新的催化剂材料，使其更加耐失活并保持长时间的高活性。
2. 开发先进的合成方法，可以根据优化丙烯选择性来定制催化剂的表面性质。
3. 探索不同的反应参数，如温度、压力和N2O/CH4比，以最大化丙烯产量同时最小化副产物生成。
4. 增强对N2O-ODHP过程的反应机制理解，以指导更高效的催化剂和反应器设计。
5. 探索将N2O-ODHP过程与其他富含氢气流体结合，以提高整体效率和可持续性。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the literature highlights several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a greenhouse gas, has the potential for enhanced C2 selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency. N2O provides only monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·, which prevents the formation of surface peroxo and gas-phase oxygen that lead to overoxidation. Moreover, N2O decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, contributing to the selective formation of C2 products. The range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider with N2O, reducing the risk of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion compared to oxygen. Catalysts for N2O-OCM are typically irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides, leading to reduced methane conversions but improved C2 selectivities compared to oxygen. The higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals. This results in significant C2 yields, often greater than 10%, surpassing many O2-OCM systems, making N2O-OCM a promising approach worth further exploration during the era of shale gas.

Strategies to address the limitations associated with catalyst deactivation and instability in N2O-ODHP could include the development of more robust catalyst materials that maintain their activity and selectivity over longer periods. Research could focus on modifying catalyst structures to enhance stability while preserving or improving propylene selectivity. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and N2O concentration, could also play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and longevity of the N2O-ODHP process. Additionally, the integration of advanced catalytic materials and technologies, such as the use of supported catalysts or novel metal oxides, could provide a platform for overcoming catalyst deactivation and stability issues, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation.

分析使用笑气（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂时，文献表明了与其它氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面的优势。作为温室气体的N2O，在甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）过程中具有增强C2选择性的潜力，由于其相对温和的氧化性。N2O仅提供单原子氧物种，如O-·，这防止了表面过氧化物和气相氧的形成，从而导致过氧化。此外，N2O在催化剂表面的分解释放氮气气体，并形成表面氧位点，有助于选择性地形成C2产品。N2O的氧化剂/丙烷比例范围更宽，降低了与氧气相比爆炸或丙烷失控燃烧的风险。N2O-OCM催化剂通常为不可还原、碱土金属或稀土氧化物，导致甲烷转化率降低但C2选择性优于氧气。N2O更高的C2选择性归因于表面O或O*位点的优先形成，这些位点催化形成·CH3自由基。这导致显著的C2产率，往往超过10%，超过了众多O2-OCM系统，使N2O-OCM成为在页岩气时代值得进一步研究的方法。

为了克服N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性问题，可以采取的策略包括开发更耐用的催化剂材料，以保持其活性和选择性更长时间。研究可以集中在修改催化剂结构，以增强稳定性同时保留或提高丙烯选择性。优化反应条件，如温度、压力和N2O浓度，也对提高效率和延长过程寿命至关重要。此外，集成先进的催化材料和技术，如支持型催化剂或新型金属氧化物的应用，可以为克服催化剂失活和稳定性问题提供平台，使N2O-ODHP成为可行的实用选项。
