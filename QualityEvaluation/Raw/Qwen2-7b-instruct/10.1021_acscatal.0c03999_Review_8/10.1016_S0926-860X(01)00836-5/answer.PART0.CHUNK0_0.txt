[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[2] "Replacing oxy- gen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[3] "However, the rates normalised with respect to the total vanadium content have a maximum for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 (Table 2)."
[4] "The most important differences observed between materials with predominantly isolated and materials with isolated and polymeric vanadia species are the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8)."
[5] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the decrease of catalytic activity on replac- ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material."
[7] "This suggestion is in agreement with our results on ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which claims that a statistically controlled number of ac- tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over combustion reaction."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides increased propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It causes a decrease in overall activity but an increase in propene formation for the same degree of propane conversion. This makes N2O a preferable oxidant for propene production.

2. The use of various catalysts, specifically vanadia-alumina materials, plays a crucial role in ODHP. The selectivity and performance are influenced by factors such as vanadia loading, reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and the catalyst's ability to reoxidise reduced active sites. 

3. Challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation and maintaining stability. Strategies to address these issues could involve designing catalyst surfaces fully covered by dispersed vanadia species to avoid strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. Using non-acidic supports can also suppress non-selective oxidation. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen can control selective oxidation versus combustion reactions.

4. N2O-ODHP shows promise for practical implementation if the challenges of deactivation and stability are addressed. Research could focus on improving catalyst formulations, optimizing reaction conditions, and developing more stable catalyst structures that maintain their activity over multiple cycles.

1. 硝酸氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用提供了提高丙烯选择性的优势，与其它氧化剂相比，在相同的丙烷转化度下，N2O导致整体活性降低但丙烯形成增加。这使得N2O成为生产丙烯的优选氧化剂。

2. 在ODHP中使用各种催化剂，尤其是含钒氧化铝材料，起着关键作用。选择性和性能受到诸如钒含量、可还原性、钒物种结构、电子性质以及催化剂还原活性位点的能力等因素的影响。

3. ODHP面临的挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性维持。解决这些问题的策略可能包括设计完全覆盖分散钒物种的催化剂表面，以避免支持表面强吸附丙烯。使用非酸性支持物也可以抑制非选择性氧化。优化活性晶格氧的稳态浓度可以控制选择性氧化与燃烧反应。

4. 如果解决了失活和稳定性的挑战，N2O-ODHP就有望实现实际应用。研究可以集中在改进催化剂配方、优化反应条件和开发保持活动性的更稳定的催化剂结构。
