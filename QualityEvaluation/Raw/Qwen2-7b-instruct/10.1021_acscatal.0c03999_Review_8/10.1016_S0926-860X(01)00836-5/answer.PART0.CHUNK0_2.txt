[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[3] "The specific rates related to the total catalyst surface area (C3H8 molecules s−1 m−2) are presented in Table 2. An increase of the vanadia concentration implies an increase in these specific rates and selectivity towards propene in the presence of both oxygen and nitrous oxide."
[4] "It should be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on the oxidant."
[5] "For low amounts of vanadia, i.e., 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivity-conversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that all the main products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) are of primary nature."
[6] "Increasing concentration of vanadia resulted in a decrease in direct propane oxidation to COx."
[7] "From the above, it became obvious that catalytic performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system depends on vanadia loading and the oxidant used."
[8] "The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vanadia (Table 1)."
[9] "Since these materials are predominantly n-conductors, the dependence of the conductivity on vanadia loading is attributed to an increase in the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band."
[10] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadia-alumina via a redox mechanism."
[11] "This suggests that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."
[12] "It appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."
[13] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions."

1. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O allows for an increase in propene selectivity while maintaining the same degree of propane conversion. The initial rates of product formation decrease when N2O replaces oxygen (O2), but this effect is more pronounced in catalysts with a higher vanadia content. This indicates that N2O can enhance propene selectivity through its unique properties and interactions with the catalyst.

2. Various catalysts were employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/-Al2O3 materials with different vanadia loadings (0.59.5 wt.%). These catalysts showed varying performances depending on the oxidant used, with N2O demonstrating enhanced propene selectivity. The effectiveness of N2O as an oxidant is influenced by the catalyst's ability to activate the oxidant and maintain a steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species that favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

3. Challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the risk of non-selective oxidation and the need to optimize the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species. Strategies to address these limitations might involve designing catalyst surfaces fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species, optimizing the catalyst composition to enhance N2O activation, and controlling the surface reduction to favor selective propene formation. Further research could focus on developing more efficient catalysts, improving the understanding of the redox mechanisms involved, and exploring alternative oxidants that offer a balance between selectivity and stability.

1. 将N2O用作ODHP的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面提供了与其它氧化剂相比的优势。具体而言，N2O能够提高丙烯的选择性，同时保持相同的丙烷转化率。当N2O替代氧气（O2）时，产品形成初始速率会降低，但这种效应在高钒含量催化剂中更为明显。这表明N2O可以通过其独特的特性和与催化剂的相互作用来增强丙烯选择性。

2. 在ODHP过程中使用了多种催化剂，包括0.59.5 wt.%不同钒含量的VOx/-Al2O3材料。这些催化剂的性能根据所使用的氧化剂有所不同，N2O能够提高丙烯选择性。N2O作为氧化剂的有效性受到催化剂激活氧化剂和维持参与丙烷和丙烯活化的活性氧物种的稳态浓度的影响。

3. N2O-ODHP过程中的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战包括非选择性氧化的风险以及优化活性氧物种稳态浓度以促进选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应的需要。解决这些局限性的策略可能包括设计完全覆盖有分散良好的钒物种的催化剂表面、优化催化剂组成以增强N2O激活，以及控制表面还原以有利于选择性丙烯形成。进一步的研究可以集中在开发更高效的催化剂、加深对氧化还原机制的理解以及探索提供选择性和稳定性的平衡的其他氧化剂上。
