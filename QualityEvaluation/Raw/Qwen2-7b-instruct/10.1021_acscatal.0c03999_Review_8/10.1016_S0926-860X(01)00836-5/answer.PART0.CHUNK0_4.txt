[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[2] "Replacing oxy- gen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[3] "An increase of the vanadia concentration implies an increase in these specific rates and selectivity towards propene in the presence of both oxygen and nitrous oxide."
[4] "From the above, it became obvious that cat- alytic performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system depends on vanadia loading and the oxidant used."
[5] "Replacing an oxidising mixture by nitrogen does not significantly change CPD during 1 h over VOx(4.6, 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalytic materials, while for VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 CPD decreases sharply."

1. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) allows for increased propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. It achieves this by decreasing the overall activity while increasing the selectivity towards propene formation, even at the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Replacing oxygen with N2O reduces the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures, yet it maintains comparable performance in terms of selectivity and activity.

3. An increase in vanadia concentration leads to higher specific rates and enhanced selectivity towards propene, both in the presence of oxygen and nitrous oxide.

4. The performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts in ODHP is significantly influenced by the vanadia loading and the oxidant utilized.

5. Exposure to an oxidizing mixture for prolonged periods does not notably affect the contact potential difference (CPD) over catalysts with higher vanadia loads (4.6 wt.% and 9.5 wt.%), whereas it causes a sharp decrease in CPD over catalysts with lower vanadia loads (0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.%).

1. 将氧化剂由氧气替换为氮氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，可以实现丙烯选择性的增加，相比其他氧化剂而言，N2O具有更高的丙烯选择性，即使在相同的丙烷转化率下也是如此。

2. 将氧气替换为N2O会降低所有研究温度下的初始产物形成速率，但同时保持相似的选择性和活性性能。

3. 钨含量的增加导致特定速率和丙烯形成的选择性提高，无论是在氧气还是氮氧化物存在的情况下。

4. 不同于其他催化剂系统，钨氧化铝催化剂在ODHP中的性能主要取决于钨含量和使用的氧化剂。

5. 在较长的时间内暴露于氧化混合物不会明显影响较高钨含量（4.6 wt.% 和 9.5 wt.%）的催化剂的接触电位差（CPD），相比之下，较低的钨含量（0.5 wt.% 和 1 wt.%）会导致CPD的急剧下降。
