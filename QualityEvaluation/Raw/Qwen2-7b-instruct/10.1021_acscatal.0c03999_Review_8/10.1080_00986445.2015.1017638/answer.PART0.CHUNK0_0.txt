Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O provides a milder oxidizing environment, leading to higher propylene selectivity compared to stronger oxidants like oxygen or water vapor. Various catalysts, such as metal oxides, supported catalysts, and mixed metal oxides, have been employed in this process. The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly due to coke formation. Strategies to address these limitations involve developing more efficient catalysts, improving catalyst support, and optimizing operating conditions.
