[1] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives."
[2] "CO2 has been called as nontraditional, unusual mild oxidant and oxygen transfer agent."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (two-step pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (one-step pathway)."
[4] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."
[5] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
[6] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle."
[7] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas and propane decomposition, which brings about coke formation."
[8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005)."
[9] "Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."
[10] "Any combination of reactions could be favored according to the catalyst formulation and operating conditions and, accordingly, different sets of equilibria could be approached. A suitable catalyst should favor only the desirable reaction(s)."
[11] "Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson, 1989)."
[12] "However, a detailed study incorporating the effect of different cofeeds and the effect of individual side reactions is scarce."
[13] "In this work, results are presented for a detailed computational study of the chemical equilibria that apply to the CO2PDH."
[14] "The results were compared with available experimental data in the literature."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we observe several advantages and challenges. Nitrous oxide is proposed as a mild oxidant due to its ability to facilitate the one-step pathway for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, enhancing selectivity over other oxidants. Various catalysts, including chromium, gallium, vanadium, and iron oxides, have been studied for their effectiveness in this process, with chromium and gallium showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The redox cycle involving these catalysts enables CO2 to act as an oxidizing agent, potentially improving propylene yield. However, significant challenges arise from the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which affects both selectivity and stability. Strategies to address these limitations might include developing catalysts that are less susceptible to coke formation, optimizing operating conditions to minimize coke production, or employing catalysts with higher activity and selectivity. Research directions could focus on understanding the kinetics of coke formation and developing inhibitors or additives to prevent coke buildup. Enhancing catalyst stability and reducing deactivation rates could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

分析使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，我们发现了一些优势和挑战。一氧化二氮被提议作为一种温和的氧化剂，因为它能够促进丙烷到丙烯的一步路径，提高与其它氧化剂相比的丙烯选择性。包括铬、镓、钒和铁氧化物在内的各种催化剂已经研究用于这一过程，其中铬和镓显示出特别高的活性和选择性。这些催化剂的红氧化循环使二氧化碳能够充当氧化剂，可能提高丙烯产率。然而，由于焦炭形成导致催化剂快速失活的问题，存在显著的挑战，这影响了选择性和稳定性。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发对焦炭形成不太敏感的催化剂，优化操作条件以减少焦炭生成，或使用活性更高、选择性更好的催化剂。研究方向可以集中在理解焦炭形成的动力学以及开发抑制剂或添加剂来防止焦炭沉积。增强催化剂稳定性并降低失活速率可以使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
