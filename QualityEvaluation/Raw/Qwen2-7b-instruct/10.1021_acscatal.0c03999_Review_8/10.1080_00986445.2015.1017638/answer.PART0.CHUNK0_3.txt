Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the process benefits from N2O's ability to offer higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Various catalysts, notably chromium-based materials, have been utilized in these processes. However, the significant challenge lies in the rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which limits the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP. To overcome this, research efforts are concentrated on enhancing catalyst efficiency. Strategies focus on improving catalyst formulations to better resist coke formation, optimizing operational conditions to minimize coke formation, developing effective coke removal mechanisms, and exploring the synergistic effects of multiple catalysts. These advancements aim to make N2O-ODHP a viable and environmentally favorable process for practical application.
