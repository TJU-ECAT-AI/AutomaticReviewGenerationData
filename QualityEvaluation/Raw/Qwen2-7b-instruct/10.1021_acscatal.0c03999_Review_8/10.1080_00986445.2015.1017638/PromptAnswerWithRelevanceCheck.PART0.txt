Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Unlike traditional oxidants such as oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), N2O has a unique property of being less reactive with hydrogen (H2), which leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene formation. This is particularly advantageous as it mitigates the formation of unwanted byproducts like coke, which is a common issue in other dehydrogenation processes. The selectivity of propylene is influenced by the ability of the oxidant to effectively oxidize propane while minimizing the formation of hydrogen, which can otherwise lead to coke formation.

Several catalysts have been employed in ODHP with N2O, including metal oxides, zeolites, and mixed metal oxides. These catalysts facilitate the reaction by providing active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The selection of catalysts plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The challenge lies in developing catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity over prolonged periods, especially in the presence of coke-forming side reactions.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in ODHP include rapid coke formation, which can cover and modify the active sites of the catalysts, leading to a decline in their performance. Additionally, the coke removing capability of diluents, such as steam or nitrogen, plays a significant role in maintaining catalyst stability. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a weaker coke removing agent compared to steam, which affects the overall stability of the process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, several strategies can be explored. Firstly, developing more efficient catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation and enhanced selectivity towards propylene is crucial. Research could focus on the development of acidic supports or oxides that are less prone to acid coking and can better control undesired side reactions.

Secondly, optimizing the operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and N2O/C3H8 ratio, can help in achieving better conversion rates while minimizing coke formation. High temperatures tend to enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, which is beneficial for propane dry reforming. However, finding the optimal conditions that balance propylene yield and coke formation prevention is key.

Thirdly, incorporating advanced process technologies, such as continuous catalyst regeneration or in-situ catalyst renewal, can help maintain catalyst activity and stability. These technologies aim to mitigate the effects of coke formation and extend the operational life of the catalysts.

Finally, the integration of computational modeling and simulation tools can aid in understanding the complex reaction mechanisms and predicting catalyst behavior under various operating conditions. This can guide the development of more effective catalyst designs and optimization strategies.

By addressing these challenges through targeted research and technological advancements, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable and environmentally favorable process for the commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes, offering benefits such as higher propylene selectivity and reduced coke formation.

在氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂，具有以下优势，尤其是丙烯选择性。与传统氧化剂如氧气（O2）和二氧化碳（CO2）相比，N2O具有独特的性质，能更有效地氧化丙烷并减少氢（H2）的生成，从而提高丙烯的选择性。这特别有利于避免其他脱氢过程中常见的副产物，如焦炭的形成。丙烯的选择性受到氧化剂有效氧化丙烷并最小化氢生成能力的影响。

在N2O-ODHP中，已经使用了几种催化剂，包括金属氧化物、沸石和混合金属氧化物。这些催化剂通过提供氧化脱氢过程中的活性位点来促进反应。催化剂的选择对确定过程的效率和选择性至关重要。

催化剂失活和稳定性的问题是N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战之一，尤其是由于焦炭形成导致催化剂活性和选择性下降。另外，稀释剂如蒸汽或氮气的焦炭去除能力对于维持催化剂稳定性起着重要作用。与蒸汽相比，CO2作为较弱的焦炭去除剂，影响整个过程的稳定性。

为了解决这些问题并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的商业应用选项，可以探索几种策略。首先，开发更高效的催化剂，具有增强的抗焦炭形成能力和更高的丙烯选择性是关键。研究可以集中在发展酸性支撑或氧化物上，这些氧化物不易发生酸焦化，并能更好地控制不利的副反应。

其次，优化操作条件，如温度、压力和N2O/C3H8比例，可以帮助实现更高的转化率，同时减少焦炭形成。高温倾向于增加CO和氢等产品的选择性，这对丙烷干重整有益。然而，在平衡丙烯产量和防止焦炭形成的条件下找到最佳条件是关键。

第三，集成先进的过程技术，如连续催化剂再生或原位催化剂更新，可以帮助维持催化剂活性和稳定性。这些技术旨在减轻焦炭形成的影响并延长催化剂的使用寿命。

最后，结合计算建模和仿真工具可以有助于理解复杂反应机制并预测催化剂行为下的各种运行条件。这可以指导开发更有效的催化剂设计和优化策略。

通过针对这些挑战进行有针对性的研究和技术进步，N2O-ODHP有可能成为轻烷烃商业脱氢的更可行和环境友好的过程，提供如更高丙烯选择性和减少焦炭形成等好处。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), we observe several advantages and challenges. Nitrous oxide is proposed as a mild oxidant due to its ability to facilitate the one-step pathway for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, enhancing selectivity over other oxidants. Various catalysts, including chromium, gallium, vanadium, and iron oxides, have been studied for their effectiveness in this process, with chromium and gallium showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The redox cycle involving these catalysts enables CO2 to act as an oxidizing agent, potentially improving propylene yield. However, significant challenges arise from the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which affects both selectivity and stability. Strategies to address these limitations might include developing catalysts that are less susceptible to coke formation, optimizing operating conditions to minimize coke production, or employing catalysts with higher activity and selectivity. Research directions could focus on understanding the kinetics of coke formation and developing inhibitors or additives to prevent coke buildup. Enhancing catalyst stability and reducing deactivation rates could make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.
