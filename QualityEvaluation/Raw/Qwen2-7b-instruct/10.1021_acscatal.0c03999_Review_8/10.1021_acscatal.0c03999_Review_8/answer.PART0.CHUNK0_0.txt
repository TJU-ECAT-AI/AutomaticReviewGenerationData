4. Using N2O as an oxidant results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts.

4.1. Metal Oxide Catalysts

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides

Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species.

Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2.

4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides

Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation.

Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O increases propylene selectivity significantly for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to oxidize reduced vanadium oxide species. Moreover, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate, leading to better selectivity for propylene production. However, the main challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is the rapid deactivation and instability of the catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. Strategies to address these limitations could include improving catalyst stability, understanding the deactivation mechanisms, and optimizing the co-feed ratio of N2O to maximize propylene selectivity without compromising catalyst performance. Research directions might focus on developing more stable catalysts, modifying catalyst support and loading, and exploring alternative oxidants that could balance efficiency and environmental impact.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面提供了优势。具体来说，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O显著提高了多种催化剂（包括铁基沸石和钒基催化剂）的丙烯选择性。增强的丙烯选择性归因于N2O对还原钒氧化物种的较弱氧化能力。此外，N2O能够稳定镍钼酸盐中的钼在更还原状态，导致更好的丙烯产率。然而，N2O-ODHP的主要挑战是催化剂快速失活和稳定性差，主要原因是焦炭的形成。可以采取的策略包括提高催化剂稳定性、理解失活机制以及优化N2O的共喂比例以最大化丙烯选择性而不损害催化剂性能。研究方向可能集中在开发更稳定的催化剂、修改催化剂支撑和负载上，以及探索平衡效率和环境影响的替代氧化剂。
