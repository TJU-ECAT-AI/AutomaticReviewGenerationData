4. Using N2O as an oxidant results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts.

4.1. Metal Oxide Catalysts

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides

Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species.

Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2.

4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides

Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation.

Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Specifically, N2O increases propylene selectivity significantly for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to oxidize reduced vanadium oxide species. Moreover, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate, leading to better selectivity for propylene production. However, the main challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is the rapid deactivation and instability of the catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. Strategies to address these limitations could include improving catalyst stability, understanding the deactivation mechanisms, and optimizing the co-feed ratio of N2O to maximize propylene selectivity without compromising catalyst performance. Research directions might focus on developing more stable catalysts, modifying catalyst support and loading, and exploring alternative oxidants that could balance efficiency and environmental impact.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面提供了优势。具体来说，与其它氧化剂相比，N2O显著提高了多种催化剂（包括铁基沸石和钒基催化剂）的丙烯选择性。增强的丙烯选择性归因于N2O对还原钒氧化物种的较弱氧化能力。此外，N2O能够稳定镍钼酸盐中的钼在更还原状态，导致更好的丙烯产率。然而，N2O-ODHP的主要挑战是催化剂快速失活和稳定性差，主要原因是焦炭的形成。可以采取的策略包括提高催化剂稳定性、理解失活机制以及优化N2O的共喂比例以最大化丙烯选择性而不损害催化剂性能。研究方向可能集中在开发更稳定的催化剂、修改催化剂支撑和负载上，以及探索平衡效率和环境影响的替代氧化剂。

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) can be effectively utilized as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to enhance propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants like oxygen. Catalysts such as iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts have been studied for their performance in this process. Despite the improved selectivity, the quick deactivation of N2O-based catalysts due to coke formation limits its practical application, making it less favorable than other soft oxidants like carbon dioxide.

2. In the process of ODHP, vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit increased selectivity towards propylene when using N2O instead of oxygen as an oxidant. This enhanced selectivity is attributed to the lesser oxidizing capability of N2O towards reduced vanadium oxide species. Peroxovanadate species, which are more prone to form under oxygen conditions and lead to decreased selectivity, are less likely to form under N2O, thus maintaining a higher selectivity for propylene.

3. Catalysts with optimized loading of vanadium oxide show increased selectivity towards propylene. However, beyond a certain loading, the selectivity starts to decrease. This suggests there is an optimal level of reduction for vanadium species that maximizes selectivity. Excessive reduction leads to the formation of COx products, which decreases propylene selectivity.

4. N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate catalysts compared to molecular oxygen. This reduction of molybdenum facilitates better interaction with surface hydroxyl groups and limits the oxidation rate, thereby reducing the formation of overoxidation products and enhancing propylene selectivity.

1. 在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以有效提高丙烯选择性，与氧气等其他氧化剂相比。铁基材料和以钒为基础的催化剂等催化剂已经在这一过程中进行了研究。尽管提高了选择性，但目前报道的N2OODHP催化剂由于焦炭形成而快速失活，这使得N2O比其他软氧化剂如二氧化碳更难实现应用。

2. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，使用N2O代替氧气作为氧化剂时，钒氧化物催化剂显示出增加的丙烯选择性。这种增强的选择性归因于N2O较弱的氧化能力，无法氧化还原的VOx物种。在氧气条件下容易形成的过氧钒酸盐物种，在N2O条件下较少形成，从而维持较高的丙烯选择性。

3. 具有优化负载的钒氧化物催化剂显示出对丙烯增加的选择性。然而，在超过一定负载后，选择性开始下降。这表明存在一种使钒物种最大化选择性的最佳还原状态。过度还原导致COx产品的形成，从而降低了丙烯选择性。

4. N2O在镍钼酸盐催化剂上以更还原的状态稳定钼，与分子氧相比。这种钼的还原促进了表面羟基团的更好相互作用，并限制了氧化速率，从而减少了过氧化产物的形成并增强了丙烯选择性。

4. Challenges
Despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
As reported by Kondratenko et al., when O2 is used for ODHP, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 75% to 50% is observed as C3H8 conversion increases from 2% to 10% using a 2.8% VOx/SiO2 catalyst.

Critical Challenges
While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
Interestingly, as shown in Table 9, C3H6 selectivity tends to be higher as the VOx species are more reduced.

Strategies
Improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O.

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is favored as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it significantly increases propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, such as oxygen. This is particularly true for vanadium-based catalysts, where N2O can lead to increased selectivity of C3H6. Molybdenum catalysts also show improved C3H6 selectivity with the addition of N2O.

2. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP processes results in better control over unwanted overoxidation reactions, which leads to higher propylene yields. The ability of N2O to stabilize catalysts in a more reduced state contributes to enhanced selectivity towards propylene.

3. Despite the benefits, N2O-ODHP faces significant challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Most N2O-based catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke formation, limiting their practical application. Catalysts based on vanadium and iron, which typically offer the highest propylene yields, still experience deactivation issues within hours of operation.

4. Strategies to address these limitations include developing catalysts with improved stability against coke formation and enhancing our understanding of the deactivation mechanisms involved. Research efforts should focus on identifying catalyst compositions and operating conditions that can mitigate coke buildup and extend catalyst life. Additionally, exploring alternative catalyst materials or modifying existing ones to operate more efficiently with N2O could lead to more feasible and practical N2O-ODHP processes.

1. 硝酸氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中作为氧化剂受到青睐，因为它能显著提高丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂如氧气。特别是对于以钒为基础的催化剂，N2O可以增加C3H6的选择性。钼基催化剂在添加N2O时也显示出更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 将N2O用作ODHP过程中的氧化剂能够更好地控制不必要的过氧化反应，从而提高丙烯产率。N2O稳定催化剂在还原状态的能力有助于提高丙烯选择性。

3. 尽管有这些好处，N2O-ODHP仍面临催化剂失活和稳定性问题的重大挑战。大多数基于N2O的催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失效，限制了其实际应用。基于钒和铁的催化剂通常提供最高的丙烯产率，但仍然存在几小时内操作期间的失活问题。

4. 应对这些限制的策略包括开发具有改善的抗焦炭形成稳定性的催化剂，并增强我们对失活机制的理解。研究努力应集中在识别能够减少焦炭积聚并延长催化剂寿命的催化剂组成和操作条件上。此外，探索替代催化剂材料或修改现有材料，使其在使用N2O时更高效地运行，可能会导致更可行且实用的N2O-ODHP过程。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it's evident that N2O can be effectively utilized to mitigate the environmental impact of strong greenhouse gases. Iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts are noted for their high propylene yield when N2O is used as an oxidant, demonstrating the potential of N2O in improving selectivity. However, the challenge lies in the quick deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which limits N2O's feasibility compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. Notably, N2O leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity, up to 75% for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3, attributed to its lesser ability to oxidize reduced vanadium species. This contrasts with oxygen, where peroxovanadate species formation reduces selectivity towards propylene. XPS analysis reveals that N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate, contributing to enhanced selectivity for propylene. 

To address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP, strategies could focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability against coke formation. Research could explore the optimization of catalyst loading, support types, and the synergistic effects of different metals to improve selectivity and longevity. Additionally, understanding the specific interactions between N2O and catalyst surfaces could guide the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes. These advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical applications.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂，可以有效地利用N2O，这是一种强温室气体。铁基材料和以钒为基础的催化剂在使用N2O时表现出较高的丙烯产量，这表明N2O在提高选择性方面具有潜力。然而，催化剂快速失活的问题，主要是由于焦炭形成，使得N2O在与其他软氧化剂如CO2相比时可行性较低。值得注意的是，与氧气相比，N2O能够显著提高丙烯选择性，达到75%，这是由于N2O更少地氧化还原化的钒物种。这与氧气导致丙烯选择性降低的情况形成对比，在氧气中，过氧钒酸盐物种的形成减少了丙烯的选择性。XPS分析表明，N2O能够稳定钼在镍钼酸盐上的还原状态，这有助于提高丙烯的选择性。 

为了应对N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，策略可能集中在开发能抵抗焦炭形成的催化剂上。研究可以探索催化剂负载、支持类型和不同金属之间协同作用的优化，以提高选择性和寿命。此外，了解N2O与催化剂表面的特定相互作用可以指导开发更高效稳定的催化剂，用于N2O-ODHP过程。这些进步有可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
