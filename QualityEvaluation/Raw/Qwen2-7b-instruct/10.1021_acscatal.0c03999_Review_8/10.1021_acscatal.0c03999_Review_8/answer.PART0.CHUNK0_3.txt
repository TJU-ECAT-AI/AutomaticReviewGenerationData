[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."
[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."
[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."
[6] "Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2."
[7] "In an effort to observe the surface species present after performing ODHP with different concentrations of N2O as a co-feed, XPS analysis has been performed on the catalysts, with the results shown in Table 10."
[8] "Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it's evident that N2O can be effectively utilized to mitigate the environmental impact of strong greenhouse gases. Iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts are noted for their high propylene yield when N2O is used as an oxidant, demonstrating the potential of N2O in improving selectivity. However, the challenge lies in the quick deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation, which limits N2O's feasibility compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. Notably, N2O leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity, up to 75% for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3, attributed to its lesser ability to oxidize reduced vanadium species. This contrasts with oxygen, where peroxovanadate species formation reduces selectivity towards propylene. XPS analysis reveals that N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate, contributing to enhanced selectivity for propylene. 

To address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP, strategies could focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability against coke formation. Research could explore the optimization of catalyst loading, support types, and the synergistic effects of different metals to improve selectivity and longevity. Additionally, understanding the specific interactions between N2O and catalyst surfaces could guide the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes. These advancements could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical applications.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂，可以有效地利用N2O，这是一种强温室气体。铁基材料和以钒为基础的催化剂在使用N2O时表现出较高的丙烯产量，这表明N2O在提高选择性方面具有潜力。然而，催化剂快速失活的问题，主要是由于焦炭形成，使得N2O在与其他软氧化剂如CO2相比时可行性较低。值得注意的是，与氧气相比，N2O能够显著提高丙烯选择性，达到75%，这是由于N2O更少地氧化还原化的钒物种。这与氧气导致丙烯选择性降低的情况形成对比，在氧气中，过氧钒酸盐物种的形成减少了丙烯的选择性。XPS分析表明，N2O能够稳定钼在镍钼酸盐上的还原状态，这有助于提高丙烯的选择性。 

为了应对N2O-ODHP过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的问题，策略可能集中在开发能抵抗焦炭形成的催化剂上。研究可以探索催化剂负载、支持类型和不同金属之间协同作用的优化，以提高选择性和寿命。此外，了解N2O与催化剂表面的特定相互作用可以指导开发更高效稳定的催化剂，用于N2O-ODHP过程。这些进步有可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用选项。
