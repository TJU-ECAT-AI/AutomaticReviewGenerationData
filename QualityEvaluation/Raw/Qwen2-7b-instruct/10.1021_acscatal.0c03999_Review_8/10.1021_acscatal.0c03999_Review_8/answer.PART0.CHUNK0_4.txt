[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas."
[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O."
[3] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."
[4] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."
[5] "It is hypothesized that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."
[6] "As reported by Kondratenko et al., when O2 is used for ODHP, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 75% to 50% is observed as C3H8 conversion increases from 2% to 10% using a 2.8% VOx/SiO2 catalyst."
[7] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."
[8] "Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2."
[9] "On the basis of these observations, it was hypothesized that C3H6 adsorption is more likely to occur on the exposed surface of the acidic γ-Al2O3 support."
[10] "It should be noted that for molybdenum oxides catalysts, N2O was co-fed with 10% O2."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O can effectively utilize this strong greenhouse gas as an oxidant. Iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts, especially Fe-ZSM-5, show high C3H6 yield when using N2O. For instance, N2O increases C3H6 selectivity significantly, reaching up to 75% from 55% in comparison to oxygen. This enhanced selectivity is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to oxidize reduced VOx species, stabilizing molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen. Moreover, coke formation is identified as the main reason for the quick deactivation of N2OODHP catalysts, making it less feasible than other soft oxidants like CO2. Peroxovanadate species formation under O2 is also linked to decreased selectivity towards C3H6. Strategies to address the challenges of catalyst deactivation and instability include improving catalyst stability and understanding deactivation mechanisms, which require further research. N2O is typically co-fed with 10% O2 in studies involving molybdenum oxides catalysts.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中使用N2O作为氧化剂，可以有效地利用这种强烈的温室气体。铁基材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，以及含钒催化剂，在使用N2O时显示出高的C3H6产率。例如，与氧气相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂时，C3H6的选择性可显著提高至75%。这种增强的选择性归因于N2O对还原VOx物种的氧化能力较弱，使钼在镍钼酸盐上的稳定性更高，与分子氧相比。此外，焦炭形成被认为是N2OODHP催化剂快速失活的主要原因，使其不如其他软氧化剂（如CO2）更可行。在使用O2进行ODHP时，氧物种的形成被归咎于C3H6选择性的降低。策略包括改进催化剂稳定性并理解失活机制，这需要进一步的研究以解决催化剂失活和不稳定性的问题。钼氧化物催化剂通常与10% O2一起共喂养。
