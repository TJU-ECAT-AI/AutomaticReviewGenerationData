4. Using N2O as an oxidant results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
For vanadium catalysts, using N2O instead of O2 in ODHP results in increased selectivity of C3H6.

4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides
Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species.

Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2.

4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides
Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen.

4. Challenges
Despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
As reported by Kondratenko et al., when O2 is used for ODHP, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 75% to 50% is observed as C3H8 conversion increases from 2% to 10% using a 2.8% VOx/SiO2 catalyst.

Critical Challenges
While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream.

4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
Interestingly, as shown in Table 9, C3H6 selectivity tends to be higher as the VOx species are more reduced.

Strategies
Improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O.

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is favored as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it significantly increases propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, such as oxygen. This is particularly true for vanadium-based catalysts, where N2O can lead to increased selectivity of C3H6. Molybdenum catalysts also show improved C3H6 selectivity with the addition of N2O.

2. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP processes results in better control over unwanted overoxidation reactions, which leads to higher propylene yields. The ability of N2O to stabilize catalysts in a more reduced state contributes to enhanced selectivity towards propylene.

3. Despite the benefits, N2O-ODHP faces significant challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Most N2O-based catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke formation, limiting their practical application. Catalysts based on vanadium and iron, which typically offer the highest propylene yields, still experience deactivation issues within hours of operation.

4. Strategies to address these limitations include developing catalysts with improved stability against coke formation and enhancing our understanding of the deactivation mechanisms involved. Research efforts should focus on identifying catalyst compositions and operating conditions that can mitigate coke buildup and extend catalyst life. Additionally, exploring alternative catalyst materials or modifying existing ones to operate more efficiently with N2O could lead to more feasible and practical N2O-ODHP processes.

1. 硝酸氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中作为氧化剂受到青睐，因为它能显著提高丙烯选择性，相比其他氧化剂如氧气。特别是对于以钒为基础的催化剂，N2O可以增加C3H6的选择性。钼基催化剂在添加N2O时也显示出更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 将N2O用作ODHP过程中的氧化剂能够更好地控制不必要的过氧化反应，从而提高丙烯产率。N2O稳定催化剂在还原状态的能力有助于提高丙烯选择性。

3. 尽管有这些好处，N2O-ODHP仍面临催化剂失活和稳定性问题的重大挑战。大多数基于N2O的催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失效，限制了其实际应用。基于钒和铁的催化剂通常提供最高的丙烯产率，但仍然存在几小时内操作期间的失活问题。

4. 应对这些限制的策略包括开发具有改善的抗焦炭形成稳定性的催化剂，并增强我们对失活机制的理解。研究努力应集中在识别能够减少焦炭积聚并延长催化剂寿命的催化剂组成和操作条件上。此外，探索替代催化剂材料或修改现有材料，使其在使用N2O时更高效地运行，可能会导致更可行且实用的N2O-ODHP过程。
