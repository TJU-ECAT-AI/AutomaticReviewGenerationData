Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is noted that N2O provides several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of enhancing propylene selectivity. A range of catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 materials, have been utilized in this process. However, significant challenges exist, including the potential for catalyst deactivation and instability due to the formation of unwanted byproducts and the risk of catalyst poisoning.
