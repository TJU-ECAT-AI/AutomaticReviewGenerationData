Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it presents several advantages over molecular oxygen (O2). One key advantage is the higher propylene selectivity offered by N2O. In this process, various catalysts, such as supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3, have been utilized. However, significant challenges arise due to catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly concerning high operation costs and potential toxicity. Strategies to mitigate these limitations could include refining catalyst composition, improving process conditions, and exploring the development of more efficient and less toxic catalysts.
