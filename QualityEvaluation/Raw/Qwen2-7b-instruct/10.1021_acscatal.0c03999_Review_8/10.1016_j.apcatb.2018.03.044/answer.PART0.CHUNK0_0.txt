The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it offers higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts used in this process are known for their high activity and stability. However, the main challenges faced are catalyst deactivation and stability issues, especially when using N2O. Potential solutions include creating more durable catalyst compositions, fine-tuning operational parameters, and enhancing catalyst regeneration techniques.
