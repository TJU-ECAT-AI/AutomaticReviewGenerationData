[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron-containing zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[2] "The initial propylene yield over the fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites was the same, but the latter sample exhibited faster deactivation."
[3] "The reason for the mismatch cannot be currently ascertained."
[4] "The absorption band at 3670 cm1 assigned to the extraction of framework gallium entails a change in the nature of the associated extra-framework iron species, resulting in extensive clustering as confirmed by TEM."
[5] "Appropriate strategies for catalyst regeneration should be designed to avoid modification of the iron speciation on coke removal leading to diminished ODHP performance."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is advantageous in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because of its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor, enabling efficient dehydrogenation of propane through coordination of reactive atomic oxygen species by specific iron species on the zeolite catalyst.

2. Despite the similarity in initial propylene yield between fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites, the regenerated sample showed faster deactivation, indicating that the catalyst structure changed during the first reaction-regeneration cycle.

3. The exact reason for the mismatch between the infrared spectra of the fresh and coked catalysts is not yet clear.

4. The removal of framework gallium through combustion during air regeneration leads to a change in the nature of associated extra-framework iron species, causing extensive clustering of iron nanoparticles.

5. Strategies for catalyst regeneration need to be developed to prevent modification of iron speciation during coke removal, which can lead to reduced efficiency in ODHP.

1. 由于其作为单氧供体的特异性以及能够高效脱氢丙烷的特定铁物种与活性原子氧物种的协调作用，氮氧化物（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中表现出优势。

2. 尽管新鲜和再生后的FeGaSi沸石催化剂的初始丙烯产量相似，但再生后的样品显示出更快的失活，表明在第一个反应-再生周期中催化剂结构发生了变化。

3. 目前还不清楚新鲜和焦化催化剂红外光谱之间差异的确切原因。

4. 空气再生过程中通过燃烧去除框架镓导致与相关额外框架铁物种相关的吸收带改变，引起铁纳米颗粒的广泛聚集。

5. 需要开发再生策略，以防止在焦炭去除期间修改铁物种，这可能导致ODHP效率降低。
