[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[2] "Over FeGa-st, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."
[3] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."
[4] "The regeneration process is not completely reversible, however; the initial propylene yield was equal in the fresh and regenerated samples, but the latter exhibited faster deactivation."
[5] "This finding can be explained by the alteration of iron speciation in the catalyst during the first reactionregeneration cycle. In particular, it was proven that air treatment of the spent sample for coke burn-off caused significant iron clustering, leading to a reduced number of active sites and thus a less efficient catalyst for ODHP."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Its unique ability to act as a mono-oxygen donor and its capability to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation contributes to the high performance of iron zeolite catalysts in this process. 

2.Iron zeolite catalysts show distinct performances in ODHP, with FeGa-st demonstrating the highest initial propylene yield (21%) compared to FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%).

3.After the reaction, regeneration in air effectively removes coke deposits, restoring the porous properties of the zeolite and preserving its crystallinity. However, the regeneration process is not fully reversible.

4.The initial propylene yield remains equivalent between fresh and regenerated samples, but the regenerated catalyst exhibits faster deactivation. This is attributed to alterations in iron speciation during the first reactionregeneration cycle, specifically leading to significant iron clustering, which reduces active sites and efficiency.

5.Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it more practical might involve developing more stable catalysts, improving regeneration methods, or optimizing operating conditions to minimize deactivation. Research directions could focus on modifying catalyst structures, enhancing stability against coke formation, or exploring alternative methods to remove coke deposits without compromising catalyst performance.

1.在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用N2O作为氧化剂提供了优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。N2O的独特能力作为单氧供体和协调活性原子氧物种的能力，使其能够高效地使丙烷脱氢，这有助于铁沸石催化剂在该过程中的高表现。

2.在铁沸石催化剂中，不同样品在ODHP中的性能存在差异。FeGa-st表现出最高的初始丙烯产率（21%），相比之下，FeAl-lie为16%，FeGe-st为10%。

3.反应后，空气再生有效地去除焦炭沉积物，恢复了沸石的孔隙特性和保持其晶格完整性。然而，再生过程并不是完全可逆的。

4.新鲜和再生样品的初始丙烯产率保持不变，但再生催化剂显示出更快的失活。这归因于在第一次反应再生循环期间铁物种的改变，特别是导致大量铁团聚，减少活性位点和效率。

5.为了使N2O-ODHP更具实用性，可能的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂、改进再生方法或优化操作条件以最小化失活。研究方向可以集中在修改催化剂结构、增强抵抗焦炭形成的能力或探索去除焦炭沉积物而不损害催化剂性能的方法。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages compared to other oxidants. Its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor allows for efficient dehydrogenation of propane, generating propylene. This process is crucial for expanding the supply of propylene to meet the growing demand, especially as the conventional supply and demand gap widens. 

Several catalysts have been employed in this process, including iron-containing MFI zeolites. These materials show unique catalytic properties, especially when treated with steam or liquid-ion exchange, which enhances their performance. The challenges faced in this process are primarily associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Deactivation occurs due to the deposition of coke on active extra-framework iron species, impacting the efficiency of the catalyst.

Fortunately, regeneration of the catalysts in air has been shown to be effective in removing coke and restoring the original porosity of the zeolite, ensuring the crystallinity remains intact. This process allows for the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP by enabling the recovery of the catalyst for repeated use. 

One critical limitation is the potential alteration of iron speciation during the first reaction-regeneration cycle, leading to a reduced number of active sites and increased susceptibility to coke deposition. Strategies to address this issue could involve designing regeneration methods that avoid changes in iron constitution. Research in this direction could focus on developing new catalysts with enhanced stability, improving the regeneration process to maintain the structure of active iron species, and optimizing the operating conditions for more efficient use of N2O as an oxidant in the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，作为氧化剂使用一氧化二氮（N2O）具有多个优势。它的单氧供体特异性使其能够高效地使丙烷脱氢生成丙烯，这为满足不断扩大的丙烯供需差距提供了有效的技术途径。已使用多种催化剂，特别是含铁的MFI沸石，在此过程中表现出独特催化特性，尤其是经过蒸汽活化或液相离子交换处理后性能提升。

催化剂失活的主要挑战在于焦炭沉积于活性额外框架铁物种上，这影响了催化剂的效率。幸运的是，空气再生过程已被证明能有效去除焦炭，并恢复原孔隙体积，保持晶体完整性。这一过程使得N2O-ODHP技术的实践应用成为可能，通过重复使用催化剂。

一个关键限制是，在第一次反应-再生循环中，铁物种的性质可能会改变，导致活性位点数量减少并增加焦炭沉积的风险。为解决这一问题，可以设计再生方法以避免铁物种性质的变化。研究方向可以集中在开发稳定性增强的新催化剂、优化再生过程以维持活性铁物种结构以及调整操作条件，使N2O作为ODHP过程中氧化剂的使用更加有效。

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. This is primarily due to its ability to act as a mono-oxygen donor, facilitating the coordination of reactive atomic oxygen species that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane. N2O's specificity in this role makes it a valuable oxidant for producing propylene from propane.

In terms of the various catalysts employed in this process, iron-containing zeolites, particularly those with frameworks such as Fe-ZSM-5, have proven highly effective. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts have demonstrated initial propene yields reaching up to 25%, showcasing the high efficiency of these materials in ODHP. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the deactivation of catalysts through coke deposition, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield.

The key to addressing this limitation lies in gaining a deeper understanding of the deactivation mechanism and catalyst regeneration processes. In situ infrared spectroscopy and other complementary techniques provide valuable insights into the kinetics of coke formation, the deactivation mechanism, and the regeneration of the catalyst in air. These methods enable researchers to monitor the processes involved and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic processes.

One potential strategy to overcome the limitations of N2O-ODHP involves designing regeneration strategies that avoid modifications to the iron speciation during the removal of coke. This approach aims to preserve the structure and number of active sites, thereby maintaining high levels of propylene production. Research efforts should focus on identifying ways to prevent alterations in the iron constitution during the reaction and regeneration cycles, ensuring that the catalyst retains its effectiveness and stability.

By integrating in situ techniques with traditional analytical methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into the complex interplay between catalyst activity, coke formation, and regeneration. This understanding is crucial for developing more efficient and sustainable catalyst systems, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation in the petrochemical industry.
