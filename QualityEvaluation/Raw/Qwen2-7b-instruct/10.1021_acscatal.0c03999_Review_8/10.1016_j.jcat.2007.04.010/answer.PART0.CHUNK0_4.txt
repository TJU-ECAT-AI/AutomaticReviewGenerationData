[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron-containing zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[2] "More recently, several groups applied these materials in the functionalization of light alkanes for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks."
[3] "The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction conditions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses."
[4] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%."
[5] "However, the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical groups in the zeolite cannot be probed."
[6] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."

Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages over other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. This is primarily due to its ability to act as a mono-oxygen donor, facilitating the coordination of reactive atomic oxygen species that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane. N2O's specificity in this role makes it a valuable oxidant for producing propylene from propane.

In terms of the various catalysts employed in this process, iron-containing zeolites, particularly those with frameworks such as Fe-ZSM-5, have proven highly effective. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts have demonstrated initial propene yields reaching up to 25%, showcasing the high efficiency of these materials in ODHP. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the deactivation of catalysts through coke deposition, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield.

The key to addressing this limitation lies in gaining a deeper understanding of the deactivation mechanism and catalyst regeneration processes. In situ infrared spectroscopy and other complementary techniques provide valuable insights into the kinetics of coke formation, the deactivation mechanism, and the regeneration of the catalyst in air. These methods enable researchers to monitor the processes involved and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic processes.

One potential strategy to overcome the limitations of N2O-ODHP involves designing regeneration strategies that avoid modifications to the iron speciation during the removal of coke. This approach aims to preserve the structure and number of active sites, thereby maintaining high levels of propylene production. Research efforts should focus on identifying ways to prevent alterations in the iron constitution during the reaction and regeneration cycles, ensuring that the catalyst retains its effectiveness and stability.

By integrating in situ techniques with traditional analytical methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into the complex interplay between catalyst activity, coke formation, and regeneration. This understanding is crucial for developing more efficient and sustainable catalyst systems, making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation in the petrochemical industry.

分析使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用，可以看出N2O在丙烯选择性方面相对于其他氧化剂的优势。这主要是由于其作为单氧供体的特异性，能够促进能够有效脱氢丙烷的活性原子氧物种的协调。N2O在这种角色的独特性使其成为从丙烷生产丙烯的有价值的氧化剂。

在所使用的各种催化剂中，含铁沸石显示出高效率。特别是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂，其初始丙烯产率达到25%，证明了这些材料在ODHP中的高效性。然而，使用N2O进行ODHP的一个关键挑战是催化剂通过焦炭沉积而失活，导致丙烯产量迅速下降。

解决这一限制的关键在于深入了解失活机制和催化剂再生过程。原位红外光谱和其他补充技术提供了关于焦炭形成、失活机制以及在空气中再生催化剂的重要见解。这些方法使研究人员能够监控涉及的过程并阐明基础机制，从而为催化过程提供更全面的理解。

一个潜在的策略是设计避免在去除焦炭期间对铁物种进行修改的再生策略，以保持活性位点的数量和结构，从而维持高水平的丙烯生产。研究工作应集中在识别防止在反应和再生周期期间对铁构成进行改变的方法上，以确保催化剂保持其有效性与稳定性。

通过将原位技术与传统分析方法结合使用，研究人员可以获得有关催化剂活性、焦炭形成和再生之间复杂相互作用的宝贵见解。这种理解对于开发更高效和可持续的催化剂系统至关重要，使得N2O-ODHP成为工业应用的可行选项。
