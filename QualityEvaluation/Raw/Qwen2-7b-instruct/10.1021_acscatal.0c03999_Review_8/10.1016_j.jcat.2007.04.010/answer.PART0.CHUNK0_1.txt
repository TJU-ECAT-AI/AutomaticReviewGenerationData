Analyzing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it is evident that N2O offers several advantages compared to other oxidants. Its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor allows for efficient dehydrogenation of propane, generating propylene. This process is crucial for expanding the supply of propylene to meet the growing demand, especially as the conventional supply and demand gap widens. 

Several catalysts have been employed in this process, including iron-containing MFI zeolites. These materials show unique catalytic properties, especially when treated with steam or liquid-ion exchange, which enhances their performance. The challenges faced in this process are primarily associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Deactivation occurs due to the deposition of coke on active extra-framework iron species, impacting the efficiency of the catalyst.

Fortunately, regeneration of the catalysts in air has been shown to be effective in removing coke and restoring the original porosity of the zeolite, ensuring the crystallinity remains intact. This process allows for the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP by enabling the recovery of the catalyst for repeated use. 

One critical limitation is the potential alteration of iron speciation during the first reaction-regeneration cycle, leading to a reduced number of active sites and increased susceptibility to coke deposition. Strategies to address this issue could involve designing regeneration methods that avoid changes in iron constitution. Research in this direction could focus on developing new catalysts with enhanced stability, improving the regeneration process to maintain the structure of active iron species, and optimizing the operating conditions for more efficient use of N2O as an oxidant in the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，作为氧化剂使用一氧化二氮（N2O）具有多个优势。它的单氧供体特异性使其能够高效地使丙烷脱氢生成丙烯，这为满足不断扩大的丙烯供需差距提供了有效的技术途径。已使用多种催化剂，特别是含铁的MFI沸石，在此过程中表现出独特催化特性，尤其是经过蒸汽活化或液相离子交换处理后性能提升。

催化剂失活的主要挑战在于焦炭沉积于活性额外框架铁物种上，这影响了催化剂的效率。幸运的是，空气再生过程已被证明能有效去除焦炭，并恢复原孔隙体积，保持晶体完整性。这一过程使得N2O-ODHP技术的实践应用成为可能，通过重复使用催化剂。

一个关键限制是，在第一次反应-再生循环中，铁物种的性质可能会改变，导致活性位点数量减少并增加焦炭沉积的风险。为解决这一问题，可以设计再生方法以避免铁物种性质的变化。研究方向可以集中在开发稳定性增强的新催化剂、优化再生过程以维持活性铁物种结构以及调整操作条件，使N2O作为ODHP过程中氧化剂的使用更加有效。
