[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane."
[2] "Over FeGa-st, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."
[3] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."
[4] "The regeneration process is not completely reversible, however; the initial propylene yield was equal in the fresh and regenerated samples, but the latter exhibited faster deactivation."
[5] "This finding can be explained by the alteration of iron speciation in the catalyst during the first reactionregeneration cycle. In particular, it was proven that air treatment of the spent sample for coke burn-off caused significant iron clustering, leading to a reduced number of active sites and thus a less efficient catalyst for ODHP."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. Its unique ability to act as a mono-oxygen donor and its capability to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation contributes to the high performance of iron zeolite catalysts in this process. 

2.Iron zeolite catalysts show distinct performances in ODHP, with FeGa-st demonstrating the highest initial propylene yield (21%) compared to FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%).

3.After the reaction, regeneration in air effectively removes coke deposits, restoring the porous properties of the zeolite and preserving its crystallinity. However, the regeneration process is not fully reversible.

4.The initial propylene yield remains equivalent between fresh and regenerated samples, but the regenerated catalyst exhibits faster deactivation. This is attributed to alterations in iron speciation during the first reactionregeneration cycle, specifically leading to significant iron clustering, which reduces active sites and efficiency.

5.Strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it more practical might involve developing more stable catalysts, improving regeneration methods, or optimizing operating conditions to minimize deactivation. Research directions could focus on modifying catalyst structures, enhancing stability against coke formation, or exploring alternative methods to remove coke deposits without compromising catalyst performance.

1.在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，使用N2O作为氧化剂提供了优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。N2O的独特能力作为单氧供体和协调活性原子氧物种的能力，使其能够高效地使丙烷脱氢，这有助于铁沸石催化剂在该过程中的高表现。

2.在铁沸石催化剂中，不同样品在ODHP中的性能存在差异。FeGa-st表现出最高的初始丙烯产率（21%），相比之下，FeAl-lie为16%，FeGe-st为10%。

3.反应后，空气再生有效地去除焦炭沉积物，恢复了沸石的孔隙特性和保持其晶格完整性。然而，再生过程并不是完全可逆的。

4.新鲜和再生样品的初始丙烯产率保持不变，但再生催化剂显示出更快的失活。这归因于在第一次反应再生循环期间铁物种的改变，特别是导致大量铁团聚，减少活性位点和效率。

5.为了使N2O-ODHP更具实用性，可能的策略包括开发更稳定的催化剂、改进再生方法或优化操作条件以最小化失活。研究方向可以集中在修改催化剂结构、增强抵抗焦炭形成的能力或探索去除焦炭沉积物而不损害催化剂性能的方法。
