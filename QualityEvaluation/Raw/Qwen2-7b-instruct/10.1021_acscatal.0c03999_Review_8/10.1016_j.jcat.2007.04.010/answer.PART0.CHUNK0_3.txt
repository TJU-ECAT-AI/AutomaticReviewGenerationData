[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane [4]."
[2] "These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2 as the oxidant [9]."
[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propylene yield [4]."
[4] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."
[5] "This finding can be explained by the alteration of iron speciation in the catalyst during the first reactionregeneration cycle."
[6] "Re- generation strategies should be carefully designed to avoid iron site modification."

1. Nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers high propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, as it specifically donates monoxide and allows for efficient dehydrogenation by coordinated iron species.

2. Iron zeolites, such as those with FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi frameworks, have been successfully employed as catalysts in ODHP, showing competitive performance with V- and Mo-based catalysts using oxygen.

3. A significant challenge in using iron zeolites for ODHP with N2O is the deactivation through coke formation, causing a quick decline in propylene yield.

4. After air regeneration, the coke is removed, and the original porosity is largely restored, with the zeolite's crystallinity unaffected.

5. The observed faster deactivation in the regenerated catalyst compared to the fresh one is attributed to the alteration of iron constitution during the first reactionregeneration cycle.

6. To overcome the limitations, careful design of regeneration strategies is crucial to prevent modification of iron sites, ensuring the catalyst's efficiency remains high.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）中，使用N2O作为氧化剂提供了与其它氧化剂相比高的丙烯选择性，因为它专门提供单氧，并允许通过协调铁物种高效脱氢。

2. 包括FeAlSi、FeGaSi和FeGeSi骨架在内的铁沸石已经被成功地应用于ODHP中，其性能与使用氧气的V-和Mo基催化剂相当。

3. 使用铁沸石进行ODHP时，N2O的一个重大挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这会导致丙烯产量迅速下降。

4. 空气再生后，焦炭被去除，原始孔隙度得到了大量恢复，而沸石的结晶性保持不变。

5. 观察到在再生催化剂中比新鲜催化剂更快的失活，这是由于在第一个反应再生周期中铁构成的改变导致的。

6. 为了克服这些限制，精心设计的再生策略是关键，以防止铁位点的修改，确保催化剂的效率保持高。
