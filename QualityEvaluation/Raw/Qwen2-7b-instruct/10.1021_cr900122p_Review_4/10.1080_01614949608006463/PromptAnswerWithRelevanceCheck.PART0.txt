<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. In the case of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes leads to deactivation through β-H transfer. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism might involve different pathways, possibly related to the nature of the support and the reactivity of the metal center. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, selectivity, and product purity. These factors can significantly impact the efficiency and economic viability of the catalytic process.

[1] "Role of the type of C-H bond activation."
[2] "Role of acidity and basicity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The type of C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the selective oxidation of paraffins. Catalysts often employ acidic properties to activate C-H bonds, facilitating the subsequent oxidation reactions. Additionally, basicity can influence the reaction pathway, affecting the stability of intermediates and the selectivity of the overall process. These aspects are fundamental in designing catalysts for efficient and controlled oxidation reactions.
