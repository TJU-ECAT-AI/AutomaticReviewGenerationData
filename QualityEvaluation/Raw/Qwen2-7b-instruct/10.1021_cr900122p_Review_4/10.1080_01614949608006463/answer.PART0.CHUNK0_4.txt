[1] "Role of the type of C-H bond activation."
[2] "Role of acidity and basicity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The type of C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the selective oxidation of paraffins. Catalysts often employ acidic properties to activate C-H bonds, facilitating the subsequent oxidation reactions. Additionally, basicity can influence the reaction pathway, affecting the stability of intermediates and the selectivity of the overall process. These aspects are fundamental in designing catalysts for efficient and controlled oxidation reactions.
