The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. In the case of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes leads to deactivation through β-H transfer. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism might involve different pathways, possibly related to the nature of the support and the reactivity of the metal center. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, selectivity, and product purity. These factors can significantly impact the efficiency and economic viability of the catalytic process.

在支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于以镧系/锕系为基础的催化剂，π-基表面复合物的形成通过β-H转移导致失活。对于以Re为基础、支撑在硅上的催化剂，机制可能涉及不同的途径，这可能与支持物的性质和金属中心的反应性有关。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能包括活性、选择性和产品质量的降低。这些因素可以显著影响催化过程的效率和经济可行性。
