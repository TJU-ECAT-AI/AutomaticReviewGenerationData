The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form π-allyl surface complexes through this process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts use β-H transfer as a key mechanism. The formation of π-allyl complexes and β-H transfer are critical steps in these deactivation pathways. The consequences of these deactivations may result in decreased catalyst efficiency and shorter lifespan.

C-H键内激活在支撑烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂通过形成π-异丙基表面复合物来实现这一过程，而硅支持的Re基催化剂则利用β-H转移作为其失活途径的关键步骤。π-异丙基复合物的形成和β-H转移是理解这些失活过程的基本步骤。这些失活途径的潜在后果可能包括催化剂性能下降和寿命缩短。
