The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. The mechanisms for deactivation vary between lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These processes can lead to reduced catalyst performance and decreased longevity due to the deactivation pathways.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的失活机制存在显著差异。关键步骤包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成。β-H转移是导致这些催化剂失活的另一个重要步骤。这些失活途径可能导致催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短。
