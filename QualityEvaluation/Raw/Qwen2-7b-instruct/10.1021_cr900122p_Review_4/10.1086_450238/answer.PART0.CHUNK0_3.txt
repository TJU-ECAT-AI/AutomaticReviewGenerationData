1. Intramolecular C-H bond activation is pivotal in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form an allyl surface complex during their deactivation process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts utilize β-H transfer as a key step. Both types of catalysts require the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can result in β-H transfer leading to deactivation.

1. 内部分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活中起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂在失活过程中会形成一个表面异丙基复合物，而硅基支持的Re基催化剂则通过β-H转移作为其失活途径的关键步骤。两种催化剂都需要形成π-异丙基表面复合物，这可能导致β-H转移，从而导致失活。
