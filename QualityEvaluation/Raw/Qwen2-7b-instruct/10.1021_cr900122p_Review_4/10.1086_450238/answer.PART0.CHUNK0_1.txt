The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through this process. Both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts use intramolecular C-H bond activation for this purpose. Following the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer is a critical step. These deactivation pathways have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts.
