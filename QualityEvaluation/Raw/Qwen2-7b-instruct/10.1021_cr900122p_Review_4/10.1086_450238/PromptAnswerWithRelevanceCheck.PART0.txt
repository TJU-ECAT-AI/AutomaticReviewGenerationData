The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form π-allyl surface complexes through this process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts use β-H transfer as a key mechanism. The formation of π-allyl complexes and β-H transfer are critical steps in these deactivation pathways. The consequences of these deactivations may result in decreased catalyst efficiency and shorter lifespan.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through this process. Both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts use intramolecular C-H bond activation for this purpose. Following the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer is a critical step. These deactivation pathways have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

The literature does not contain specific details regarding the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, nor does it compare the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. It also lacks information on the key steps in these processes, such as the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

1. Intramolecular C-H bond activation is pivotal in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form an allyl surface complex during their deactivation process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts utilize β-H transfer as a key step. Both types of catalysts require the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can result in β-H transfer leading to deactivation.
