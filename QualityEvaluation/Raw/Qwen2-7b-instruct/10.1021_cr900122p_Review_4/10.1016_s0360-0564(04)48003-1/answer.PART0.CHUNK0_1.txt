The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is pivotal. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts utilize the formation of π-allyl surface complexes as a mechanism for deactivation, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts rely on β-H transfer. These processes significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity due to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂通过形成π-亚甲基表面复合物作为失活机制。而SiO2支持的Re基催化剂则依赖于β-H转移作为其失活途径的关键步骤。这些过程对催化剂性能和寿命有重大影响，主要是由于形成了π-亚甲基表面复合物和进行了β-H转移。
