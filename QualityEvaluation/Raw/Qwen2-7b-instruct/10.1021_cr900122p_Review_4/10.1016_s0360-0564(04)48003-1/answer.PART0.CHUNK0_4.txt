The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Different mechanisms are observed in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps include the activation of intramolecular C-H bonds leading to π-allyl surface complex formation, followed by β-H transfer. These processes can significantly affect catalyst performance and longevity.
