[1] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures and consequently there is no difficulty about 'activating' the hydrogen molecules for this particular exchange."
[2] "The rate of exchange of CD, with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[3] "The surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange with deuterium much more slowly than the rate of the hydrogen-deuterium reaction."
[4] "When CD,is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135" which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH, and CD,"
[5] "With silica-alumina I the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much nore rapidly than methane in contrast to the results with y-alumina."

The document does not provide information on the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. It discusses the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts, focusing on the rates of ring and side-group hydrogen atom exchange, the behavior of the catalysts under different conditions, and comparisons with other catalysts and chemical reactions. There is no direct connection to the topic of C-H bond activation and its impact on catalyst performance in alkene polymerization and metathesis processes. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the questions regarding these specific catalysts and mechanisms.

文档没有提供关于内分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和金属环化催化剂失效中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和硅支持的铼基催化剂中涉及的具体机制的信息。它讨论了苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与氘的交换反应在硅铝酸盐和氧化铝催化剂上的速率、环氢原子和侧链氢原子的交换行为，在不同条件下的催化剂行为以及与其他催化剂和化学反应的比较。没有直接与这些特定催化剂和机制相关的联系，因此我无法对关于这些特定催化剂和机制的问题给出答案。
