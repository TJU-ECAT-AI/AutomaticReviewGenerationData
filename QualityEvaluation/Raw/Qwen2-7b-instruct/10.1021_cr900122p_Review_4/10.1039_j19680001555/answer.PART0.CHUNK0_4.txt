[1] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina."
[2] "On any catalyst the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups."
[3] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[4] "Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of m-xylene were also carried out."
[5] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."

The study examined the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina catalysts with varying alumina contents. The reactions were characterized by the uniform exchange rate of hydrogen atoms in the ring positions across the hydrocarbons, with no significant directing effects from the side groups. The catalyst with 13% alumina showed significantly slower reaction rates compared to the others. Additional experiments were conducted on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and the isomerization of m-xylene. Among the catalysts, silica-alumina I exhibited the lowest activity in hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates equivalent to those of side-group exchange.

研究考察了苯、甲苯和邻二甲苯与重氢在两种不同氧化铝含量（13%或45%）的硅铝酸盐催化剂上的交换反应。反应中，环位氢原子在整个烃类分子之间的交换速率一致，且侧基未产生显著的方向效应。含13%氧化铝的催化剂显示出比其他催化剂明显更低的反应速率。还进行了氢-重氢交换实验以及邻二甲苯异构化实验。在这些催化剂中，含13%氧化铝的催化剂在氢-重氢交换中的活性最低，并以与侧基交换相当的速度异构化邻二甲苯。
