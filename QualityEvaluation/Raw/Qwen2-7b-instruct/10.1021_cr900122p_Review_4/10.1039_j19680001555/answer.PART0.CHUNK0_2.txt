[1] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (11) alumina and on pure alumina."
[2] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[3] "Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards."
[4] "Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of m-xylene were also carried out."
[5] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."
[6] "Comparison with homogeneous acid catalysis shows that the ring hydrogen atoms react in preference to side-group atoms."
[7] "Comparison with metals or other oxides indicates that the exchange of m-xylene with deuterium may be a useful reaction for testing catalysts and for indicating the type of reactions which are likely to occur with hydrocarbon molecules."

The document analyzes the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. It compares the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The document discusses the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity. It highlights that the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on silica-alumina catalysts. The rates of reaction were lower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts. The exchange of side groups with toluene or m-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards. The document also notes subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and the isomerization of m-xylene. It points out that silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange. The document compares these findings with homogeneous acid catalysis, highlighting that the ring hydrogen atoms react in preference to side-group atoms. It further discusses how the exchange of m-xylene with deuterium may be a useful reaction for testing catalysts and for indicating the type of reactions which are likely to occur with hydrocarbon molecules.

文档分析了在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂中，分子内C-H键活化导致催化剂失活的作用。它将镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的具体机制进行了比较。这些过程的关键步骤包括形成π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移。文档讨论了这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。它指出，在二氧化硅-氧化铝催化剂上研究了苯、对二甲苯和间二甲苯与氘的交换反应。在二氧化硅-氧化铝I上的反应速率低于其他催化剂。与侧链的交换比环交换慢30倍以上。文档还注意到关于氢-氘交换和间二甲苯异构化的辅助实验。它指出，二氧化硅-氧化铝I在氢-氘交换中的活性最低，并且以与侧链交换相似的速度异构化间二甲苯。文档将这些发现与均相酸催化进行了比较，指出环氢原子优先于侧链原子反应。它进一步指出，间二甲苯与氘的交换可能是测试催化剂以及预测可能发生的烃分子反应类型的一种有用反应。
