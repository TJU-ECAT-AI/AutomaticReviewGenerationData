[1] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[2] "The purpose of the present work was to investigate the activity of silica-alumina and alumina catalysts for the exchange of the hydrogen atoms in benzene, toluene, and m-xylene."
[3] "The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much more rapidly than methane."
[4] "The activation energies for the exchange of the ring atoms are similar on both silica-alumina I1 and y-alumina and the higher activity of the former may be associated with a greater number of catalytic sites."
[5] "With silica-alumina I the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much more rapidly than methane."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The specific mechanisms differ between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation often occurs through the formation of π-allyl complexes, which can undergo β-H transfer reactions leading to the loss of functionality and deactivation of the catalyst. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts typically deactivate via a different pathway, often involving the abstraction of hydrogen from the catalyst surface, which disrupts the active site and reduces catalyst efficiency. The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include decreased activity, selectivity, and lifetime, necessitating careful control and optimization of reaction conditions to mitigate deactivation.

The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium on silica-alumina catalysts reveals that the rate of ring hydrogen atom exchange is slightly faster than that of the ring atoms of alkylbenzenes. However, alkylbenzenes exchange more rapidly than methane. The activation energies for ring hydrogen atom exchange are similar on silica-alumina I1 and y-alumina, suggesting that the higher activity of silica-alumina I1 may be attributed to having more catalytic sites. This indicates that the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst significantly influence its reactivity and efficiency in deuterium exchange reactions, which in turn affects the stability and performance of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

在支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化的作用涉及π-邻基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。不同的机制存在于镧系/锕系基和硅支持的Re基催化剂之间。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活通常通过形成π-邻基复合物进行，随后发生β-H转移反应，导致功能丧失和催化剂失活。相比之下，硅支持的Re基催化剂的失活通常通过从催化剂表面抽象氢的途径进行，这破坏了活性位点并降低了催化剂效率。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响包括活性、选择性和寿命的降低，需要仔细控制和优化反应条件以减少失活。

在硅铝酸盐催化剂上进行氢与氘交换显示，环氢原子的交换速率略快于烷基苯环原子。然而，烷基苯环交换比甲烷更快。硅铝酸盐I1和y型催化剂上的环氢原子交换的激活能相似，表明硅铝酸盐I1更高的活性可能是由于具有更多催化位点。这表明催化剂的表面化学和结构显著影响其在氘交换反应中的反应性和效率，进而影响支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的稳定性和性能。
