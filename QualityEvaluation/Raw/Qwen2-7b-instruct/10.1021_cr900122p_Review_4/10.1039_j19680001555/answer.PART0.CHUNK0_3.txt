[1] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures and consequently there is no difficulty about 'activating' the hydrogen molecules for this particular exchange."
[2] "The surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange with deuterium much more slowly than the rate of the hydrogen-deuterium reaction."
[3] "With silica-alumina I, the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much more rapidly than methane in contrast to the results with y-alumina."
[4] "The use of such pre-treated catalysts gives substantial amounts of multiple exchange and there is usually a maximum in the curve relating rate to content of deuterium oxide which acts as a poison if present in appreciable quantity."
[5] "The order of activity of different molecules is olefins > saturated hydrocarbon containing tertiary carbon atoms, benzene > hydrogen > saturated hydrocarbons without tertiary carbon atoms."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves several key steps. In the case of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role. This occurs when the catalyst activates the C-H bond of the alkene, allowing for the formation of a π-allyl complex, which is a precursor to the desired polymer or metathesis product. However, this process can lead to deactivation, as the π-allyl complex can undergo further reactions, such as isomerization or rearrangements, rather than forming the intended product.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, β-H transfer is another significant mechanism for deactivation. This process involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from one site on the catalyst surface to another, which can disrupt the catalytic cycle and reduce the catalyst's efficiency. This is particularly relevant for metathesis reactions, where the β-H transfer can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts or affect the selectivity of the reaction.

Both mechanisms, the formation of π-allyl complexes and β-H transfer, can significantly impact the performance and longevity of these catalysts. They can lead to reduced activity, decreased selectivity, and shortened catalyst life. Understanding these deactivation pathways is critical for developing strategies to mitigate their effects, such as improving catalyst design, modifying reaction conditions, or employing additives that can stabilize the catalyst and prevent premature deactivation.

In the context of the provided literature, the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is highlighted through comparisons between different catalyst types and their activities towards various hydrocarbons. The literature discusses how the activation of C-H bonds leads to the formation of surface complexes and how this process can be influenced by factors such as the type of catalyst, the presence of deuterium oxide, and the properties of the hydrocarbons being used. These insights are valuable for understanding the limitations of these catalysts and for guiding future research aimed at enhancing their performance and stability.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，π-二烯表面复合物的形成是一个关键步骤。当催化剂活化烯烃中的C-H键时，允许形成π-二烯复合物，这是期望聚合物或金属迁移产物的前体。然而，这个过程可能导致失活，因为π-二烯复合物可以进一步反应，如异构化或重排，而不是形成预期的产品。

对于以二氧化硅为载体的Re基催化剂，β-H转移是另一个导致催化剂失活的重要机制。这一过程涉及从催化剂表面的一个位点到另一个位点转移一个氢原子，这可能破坏催化循环并降低催化剂的效率。这对于金属迁移反应尤为重要，β-H转移可能导致形成不需要的副产品或影响反应的选择性。

这两种机制，形成π-二烯复合物和β-H转移，都对这些催化剂的性能和寿命有显著影响。它们可能导致活性下降、选择性降低和催化剂寿命缩短。理解这些失活途径对于开发策略来缓解其影响至关重要，如改进催化剂设计、调整反应条件或使用添加剂来稳定催化剂，防止过早失活。

通过提供的文献，内部分子C-H键活化在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中的角色被强调，通过对不同催化剂类型及其对各种烃类活性的比较。文献讨论了活化C-H键如何导致表面复合物的形成以及这一过程受到催化剂类型、去氘化氧化物的存在以及所用烃类性质的影响。这些见解对于了解这些催化剂的局限性和指导未来旨在增强其性能和稳定性的研究具有价值。
