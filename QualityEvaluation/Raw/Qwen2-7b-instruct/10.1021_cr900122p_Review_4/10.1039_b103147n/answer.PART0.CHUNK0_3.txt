Since the provided literature does not contain specific details about the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, nor does it compare the mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, there are no relevant quotes for the second question.
