[1] "For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."
[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts."
[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b)."
[4] "Additionally, β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts."
[5] "It is noteworthy that this reaction can be extended to very long chain alkanes (C36) and polymers, and in fact, supported Zr hydrides can readily polymerize ethene and then depolymerize the thus-formed polyethylene under H2."
[6] "On the other hand, it is disfavored from tertiary alkyl Zr species, as evidenced by the low selectivity in isopentane in the hydrogenolysis of 3-methylpentane (Table 2 and Scheme 24b)."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts reveals distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, deactivation likely occurs through the activation of the allylic C-H bond, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. This process involves the substitution of propene with the allylic C-H bond, resulting in a non-functional complex. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts may deactivate through the activation of the CH bond within metallacyclobutane intermediates, followed by a β-H transfer process. This mechanism results in the creation of a highly reactive species that can either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction or lead to degrafting via the abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand. Side reactions involving β-H transfer also contribute to deactivation in both polymerization and metathesis catalysts, affecting the performance and longevity of these catalysts.

分析内部C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和裂解催化剂失活中的作用揭示了镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂之间的不同机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活可能通过激活邻位C-H键发生，导致形成非活性π-邻位表面复合物。这一过程涉及丙烯与邻位C-H键的取代，从而形成一个非功能性复合物。相比之下，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过激活金属环丁烷中间体中的C-H键，随后进行β-H转移过程而失活。这一机制产生了一个高度反应性的物种，该物种可以通过α-H抽象再生催化剂，或者通过乙基片段的β-H由硅氧烷配体抽象来实现脱附。在聚合和裂解催化剂中，侧向反应也通过β-H转移影响失活，从而影响这些催化剂的性能和寿命。
