(66, 279, 280) One deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a).

(281) More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts.

From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene. The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b).

In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts can deactivate via a β-H transfer process that activates the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, resulting in degrafting and decomposition. Additionally, under low hydrogen pressure, β-H transfer can compete with hydrogenolysis, causing chain walking and deuterium incorporation at various alkyl chain positions during reactions with D2.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant, affecting catalyst performance and longevity. They can lead to reduced reactivity, decreased yield of desired products, and increased production costs due to the need for catalyst regeneration or replacement.

在惰性气体聚合和烯烃化反应催化剂的失活中，内部C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于以镧系元素和锕系元素为基础的催化剂，失活途径通常涉及激活联烯的C-H键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成无活性的π-联烯表面复合物。对于以Re为基础、负载在硅酸盐上的烯烃化催化剂，失活过程可能涉及到在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活C-H键，并通过β-H转移过程导致脱附和分解。此外，在较低氢气压力下，β-H转移可以与氢解竞争，导致链行走，反应使用D2代替H2时，可以在烷基链的不同位置观察到氘的整合。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响重大。它们可能导致反应活性降低、产物收率减少以及由于需要再生或更换催化剂而增加生产成本。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts reveals distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, deactivation likely occurs through the activation of the allylic C-H bond, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. This process involves the substitution of propene with the allylic C-H bond, resulting in a non-functional complex. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts may deactivate through the activation of the CH bond within metallacyclobutane intermediates, followed by a β-H transfer process. This mechanism results in the creation of a highly reactive species that can either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction or lead to degrafting via the abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand. Side reactions involving β-H transfer also contribute to deactivation in both polymerization and metathesis catalysts, affecting the performance and longevity of these catalysts.

分析内部C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和裂解催化剂失活中的作用揭示了镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂之间的不同机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活可能通过激活邻位C-H键发生，导致形成非活性π-邻位表面复合物。这一过程涉及丙烯与邻位C-H键的取代，从而形成一个非功能性复合物。相比之下，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过激活金属环丁烷中间体中的C-H键，随后进行β-H转移过程而失活。这一机制产生了一个高度反应性的物种，该物种可以通过α-H抽象再生催化剂，或者通过乙基片段的β-H由硅氧烷配体抽象来实现脱附。在聚合和裂解催化剂中，侧向反应也通过β-H转移影响失活，从而影响这些催化剂的性能和寿命。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find distinct mechanisms for both types of catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). This results from the catalyst's inability to efficiently insert propene due to the activation of the allylic C-H bond. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, deactivation occurs through the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, followed by a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). This β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based catalysts, making it competitive with hydrogenolysis under low H2 pressure, causing chain walking (Scheme 22c).

The consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant. They impact catalyst performance and longevity by reducing the catalyst's efficiency and effectiveness in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions. The specific mechanisms, involving C-H bond activation and subsequent β-H transfer, highlight the importance of understanding these processes to improve catalyst design and operation.

在研究支持型烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂中内嵌C-H键活化导致的失活作用时，我们发现两种催化剂的不同机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径涉及激活辅助位的C-H键，导致形成无活性的π-辅助位表面复合物（方案22a）。这是由于催化剂无法有效插入丙烯，原因是激活了辅助位的C-H键。对于以二氧化硅为支持的Re基催化剂，失活通过激活金属环丁烷中间体中的β-C-H键，随后进行β-H转移过程（方案22b）发生。这β-H转移也可以导致在低H2压力下与氢解反应的竞争，引起链行走（方案22c）。

这些失活途径的影响是显著的。它们影响催化剂性能和寿命，降低了催化剂在烯烃聚合和裂合反应中的效率和效果。特定的机制，涉及C-H键活化和随后的β-H转移，强调了理解这些过程的重要性，以改进催化剂设计和操作。

(284-286) In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).
Alkane Hydrogenolysis The hydrogenolysis of alkanes and paraffins occurs catalytically at low temperatures on metal hydrides supported on various oxides, e.g. silica, silicaalumina, or alumina. In the case of group 4 metals and particularly Zr, based on selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution (Table 2 and Scheme 23a, e.g. alkane = propane), the hydrogenolysis of alkanes has been proposed to take place with the following key steps: CH bond activation of the alkane via σ-bond metathesis (vide supra), CC bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the MC bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene (composed of two elementary steps, insertion and hydrogenolysis, Scheme 23b). (229, 230, 232, 287-289) In order to account for the absence of alkenes and the relatively low reaction temperatures, an alternative pathway has been proposed from calculations based on the bis-hydride surface species, which avoids the high endothermic formation of alkene intermediates, a relatively thermodynamically disfavored process (Scheme 23c). (229, 230) It is clear, however, that β-alkyl transfer is the key CC bond cleavage step, and this is further supported by the observed lack of hydrogenolysis activities toward ethane, for which the corresponding alkyl surface species (ethyl) does not possess a βC-C bond. Moreover, cyclic alkanes having less than seven carbons (n < 1) do not undergo hydrogenolysis, which illustrates the requirement of a syn-coplanar arrangement of the MC and CC bonds in the β-alkyl transfer transition states (Scheme 23d). (290) Using other supports (silicaalumina (288) and alumina (291)) and group 4 metals (Ti (292) and Hf (293)) does not greatly affect the rate and the product distribution, which shows that β-alkyl transfer is a general CC bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals.Table 2.

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl species is a probable deactivation pathway, involving the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of insertion of propene, which results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation process involves the decomposition of metallacyclobutane intermediates, specifically the well-defined silica-supported Re alkylidene complex (Scheme 22b).

The hydrogenolysis of alkanes catalyzed by metal hydrides, such as zirconium hydride supported on silica, proceeds through a series of steps that involve CH bond activation, CC bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the MC bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene. This process elucidates the importance of β-alkyl transfer as the key CC bond cleavage step, supporting the lack of hydrogenolysis activities towards ethane and the absence of alkenes in the reaction products. These findings indicate that β-alkyl transfer is a general CC bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals, including titanium and hafnium, when compared to other supports like silica-alumina or alumina (Table 2 and Scheme 23).

The alternative pathway for hydrogenolysis, proposed based on calculations using bis-hydride surface species, avoids the energetically unfavorable high-endothermic formation of alkene intermediates (Scheme 23c). The selectivities of hydrogenolysis at low conversions and the final product distributions for various alkanes, as demonstrated in Table 2, further confirm the significance of β-alkyl transfer in CC bond cleavage.

In summary, intramolecular C-H bond activation, particularly β-H transfer, is a critical factor in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, influencing their performance and longevity. The specific mechanisms and key steps vary depending on the type of catalyst, but β-alkyl transfer emerges as a common CC bond cleavage process across different metal systems and support materials.

在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活过程中，内部C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于以镧系/锕系为基础的催化剂，π-烯丙基物种的形成可能是失活途径之一，涉及激活烯丙基C-H键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物（方案22a）。对于由Re基的硅支持的烯烃裂合催化剂，失活过程涉及金属环丁烷中间体的分解，特别是由硅支持的Re烷基idene复合物（方案22b）。

由金属氢化物，如二氧化硅上支撑的锆氢化物催化的烷烃氢解，通过一系列步骤进行：C-H键激活、通过β-烷基转移的CC键激活、MC键的氢解和烷二烯的氢化。这一过程揭示了β-烷基转移作为CC键断裂步骤的关键性，支持了对乙烷的缺乏氢解活性以及反应产物中无烯烃的事实。这些发现表明，β-烷基转移是d0组4金属，包括钛和铪，在其他支持材料（如二氧化硅-氧化铝或氧化铝）时，一般性的CC键断裂过程。

基于bis-hydride表面物种的计算提出的氢解的替代途径，避免了能量不利的高热力学成本的烷烃中间体的形成（方案23c）。在低转化率下进行的氢解的选定性和最终产物分布的最后，根据表2中各种烷烃的数据进一步确认了β-烷基转移在CC键断裂中的重要性。

简而言之，内部C-H键活化，尤其是β-H转移，是支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂失活的关键因素，影响其性能和寿命。具体机制和关键步骤根据催化剂类型而异，但β-烷基转移作为CC键断裂过程的普遍性贯穿不同的金属系统和支持材料之间。
