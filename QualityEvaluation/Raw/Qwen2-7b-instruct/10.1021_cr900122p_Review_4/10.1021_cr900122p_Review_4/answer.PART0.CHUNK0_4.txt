Scheme 22 Scheme 22. (a) Deactivation of Polymerization Catalysts by Formation of π-Allyl Species; (b) Deactivation of Alkene Metathesis Catalysts by Decomposition of Metallacyclobutane Intermediates (e.g. the Well-Defined Silica Supported Re Alkylidene Complex); and (c) H/D Exchange via Chain Walking Additionally, β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts. (284-286) In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).
Alkane Hydrogenolysis The hydrogenolysis of alkanes and paraffins occurs catalytically at low temperatures on metal hydrides supported on various oxides, e.g. silica, silicaalumina, or alumina. In the case of group 4 metals and particularly Zr, based on selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution (Table 2 and Scheme 23a, e.g. alkane = propane), the hydrogenolysis of alkanes has been proposed to take place with the following key steps: CH bond activation of the alkane via σ-bond metathesis (vide supra), CC bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the MC bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene (composed of two elementary steps, insertion and hydrogenolysis, Scheme 23b). (229, 230, 232, 287-289) In order to account for the absence of alkenes and the relatively low reaction temperatures, an alternative pathway has been proposed from calculations based on the bis-hydride surface species, which avoids the high endothermic formation of alkene intermediates, a relatively thermodynamically disfavored process (Scheme 23c). (229, 230) It is clear, however, that β-alkyl transfer is the key CC bond cleavage step, and this is further supported by the observed lack of hydrogenolysis activities toward ethane, for which the corresponding alkyl surface species (ethyl) does not possess a βC-C bond. Moreover, cyclic alkanes having less than seven carbons (n < 1) do not undergo hydrogenolysis, which illustrates the requirement of a syn-coplanar arrangement of the MC and CC bonds in the β-alkyl transfer transition states (Scheme 23d). (290) Using other supports (silicaalumina (288) and alumina (291)) and group 4 metals (Ti (292) and Hf (293)) does not greatly affect the rate and the product distribution, which shows that β-alkyl transfer is a general CC bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals.Table 2.

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl species is a probable deactivation pathway, involving the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of insertion of propene, which results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation process involves the decomposition of metallacyclobutane intermediates, specifically the well-defined silica-supported Re alkylidene complex (Scheme 22b).

The hydrogenolysis of alkanes catalyzed by metal hydrides, such as zirconium hydride supported on silica, proceeds through a series of steps that involve CH bond activation, CC bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the MC bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene. This process elucidates the importance of β-alkyl transfer as the key CC bond cleavage step, supporting the lack of hydrogenolysis activities towards ethane and the absence of alkenes in the reaction products. These findings indicate that β-alkyl transfer is a general CC bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals, including titanium and hafnium, when compared to other supports like silica-alumina or alumina (Table 2 and Scheme 23).

The alternative pathway for hydrogenolysis, proposed based on calculations using bis-hydride surface species, avoids the energetically unfavorable high-endothermic formation of alkene intermediates (Scheme 23c). The selectivities of hydrogenolysis at low conversions and the final product distributions for various alkanes, as demonstrated in Table 2, further confirm the significance of β-alkyl transfer in CC bond cleavage.

In summary, intramolecular C-H bond activation, particularly β-H transfer, is a critical factor in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, influencing their performance and longevity. The specific mechanisms and key steps vary depending on the type of catalyst, but β-alkyl transfer emerges as a common CC bond cleavage process across different metal systems and support materials.

在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活过程中，内部C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于以镧系/锕系为基础的催化剂，π-烯丙基物种的形成可能是失活途径之一，涉及激活烯丙基C-H键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成不活跃的π-烯丙基表面复合物（方案22a）。对于由Re基的硅支持的烯烃裂合催化剂，失活过程涉及金属环丁烷中间体的分解，特别是由硅支持的Re烷基idene复合物（方案22b）。

由金属氢化物，如二氧化硅上支撑的锆氢化物催化的烷烃氢解，通过一系列步骤进行：C-H键激活、通过β-烷基转移的CC键激活、MC键的氢解和烷二烯的氢化。这一过程揭示了β-烷基转移作为CC键断裂步骤的关键性，支持了对乙烷的缺乏氢解活性以及反应产物中无烯烃的事实。这些发现表明，β-烷基转移是d0组4金属，包括钛和铪，在其他支持材料（如二氧化硅-氧化铝或氧化铝）时，一般性的CC键断裂过程。

基于bis-hydride表面物种的计算提出的氢解的替代途径，避免了能量不利的高热力学成本的烷烃中间体的形成（方案23c）。在低转化率下进行的氢解的选定性和最终产物分布的最后，根据表2中各种烷烃的数据进一步确认了β-烷基转移在CC键断裂中的重要性。

简而言之，内部C-H键活化，尤其是β-H转移，是支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂失活的关键因素，影响其性能和寿命。具体机制和关键步骤根据催化剂类型而异，但β-烷基转移作为CC键断裂过程的普遍性贯穿不同的金属系统和支持材料之间。
