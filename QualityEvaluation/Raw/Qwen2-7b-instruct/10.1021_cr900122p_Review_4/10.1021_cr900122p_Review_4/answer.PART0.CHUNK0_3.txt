[1] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts."
[2] "For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."
[3] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts."
[4] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b)."
[5] "β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts."
[6] "In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2."
[7] "This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c)."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find distinct mechanisms for both types of catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). This results from the catalyst's inability to efficiently insert propene due to the activation of the allylic C-H bond. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, deactivation occurs through the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, followed by a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). This β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based catalysts, making it competitive with hydrogenolysis under low H2 pressure, causing chain walking (Scheme 22c).

The consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant. They impact catalyst performance and longevity by reducing the catalyst's efficiency and effectiveness in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions. The specific mechanisms, involving C-H bond activation and subsequent β-H transfer, highlight the importance of understanding these processes to improve catalyst design and operation.

在研究支持型烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂中内嵌C-H键活化导致的失活作用时，我们发现两种催化剂的不同机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径涉及激活辅助位的C-H键，导致形成无活性的π-辅助位表面复合物（方案22a）。这是由于催化剂无法有效插入丙烯，原因是激活了辅助位的C-H键。对于以二氧化硅为支持的Re基催化剂，失活通过激活金属环丁烷中间体中的β-C-H键，随后进行β-H转移过程（方案22b）发生。这β-H转移也可以导致在低H2压力下与氢解反应的竞争，引起链行走（方案22c）。

这些失活途径的影响是显著的。它们影响催化剂性能和寿命，降低了催化剂在烯烃聚合和裂合反应中的效率和效果。特定的机制，涉及C-H键活化和随后的β-H转移，强调了理解这些过程的重要性，以改进催化剂设计和操作。
