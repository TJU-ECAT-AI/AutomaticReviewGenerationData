(66, 279, 280) One deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a).

(281) More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts.

From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene. The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b).

In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion, leading to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts can deactivate via a β-H transfer process that activates the CH bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, resulting in degrafting and decomposition. Additionally, under low hydrogen pressure, β-H transfer can compete with hydrogenolysis, causing chain walking and deuterium incorporation at various alkyl chain positions during reactions with D2.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant, affecting catalyst performance and longevity. They can lead to reduced reactivity, decreased yield of desired products, and increased production costs due to the need for catalyst regeneration or replacement.

在惰性气体聚合和烯烃化反应催化剂的失活中，内部C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于以镧系元素和锕系元素为基础的催化剂，失活途径通常涉及激活联烯的C-H键而不是丙烯插入，导致形成无活性的π-联烯表面复合物。对于以Re为基础、负载在硅酸盐上的烯烃化催化剂，失活过程可能涉及到在金属环丁烷中间体的β位激活C-H键，并通过β-H转移过程导致脱附和分解。此外，在较低氢气压力下，β-H转移可以与氢解竞争，导致链行走，反应使用D2代替H2时，可以在烷基链的不同位置观察到氘的整合。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响重大。它们可能导致反应活性降低、产物收率减少以及由于需要再生或更换催化剂而增加生产成本。
