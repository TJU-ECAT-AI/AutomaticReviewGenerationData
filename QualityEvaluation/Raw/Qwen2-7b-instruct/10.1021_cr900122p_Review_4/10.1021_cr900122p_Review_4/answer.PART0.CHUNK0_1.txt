Scheme 20 Scheme 20. Formation of Alkylidene from Bis-alkyl Surface Species via: (a) Addition of an OH on the Alkylidene Moiety Followed by α-H Abstraction, (b) σ-Bond Metathesis, (c) Addition of an OH on a Nitrido Moiety Followed by α-H Abstraction, and (c) Formation of a Bis-alkyl Species Followed by α-H Abstraction

Scheme 21 Scheme 21. Grafting of (a) [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] on SiO2-(700), Yielding [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], and of (b) [M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] on Silica or Alumina, Yielding [(EO)M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (M = Mo or W; R = tBu; and E = Si or Al of Silica or Alumina Surfaces)

Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a).

Scheme 22 Scheme 22. (a) Deactivation of Polymerization Catalysts by Formation of π-Allyl Species; (b) Deactivation of Alkene Metathesis Catalysts by Decomposition of Metallacyclobutane Intermediates (e.g. the Well-Defined Silica Supported Re Alkylidene Complex); and (c) H/D Exchange via Chain Walking Additionally, β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts.

Scheme 23 Scheme 23. Hydrogenolysis of Alkane on [ZrH]: (a) Hydrogenolysis of Propane and Final Product Distribution. (b) Proposed Elementary Steps for Mono-hydride Active Sites vs (c) a Bis-hydrides (R = CH3 for Propane). (d) β-Alkyl Transfer for M-Cycloalkyl Intermediates
