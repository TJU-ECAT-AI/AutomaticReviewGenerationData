FOR DEUTERIUM
EXCHANGE
WITH BENZENE
OVER ALUMINA
4323 Catalytic Sites for Deuterium Exchange with Benzene over Alumina by P. C. Saunders and Joe W. Hightower* Department of Chemical Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77001 (Received February Id, 1970) Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers. Exchange of benzene H atoms with DZ occurred readily at room temperature, but intermolecular redistribution of H and D atoms between CeHe and CeDe occurred at least 10-20 times as rapidly under the same conditions. Both reactions apparently took place on the same sites whose concentration was 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2 as determined by COZ poisoning. Radioactive C1Q2 was used to confirm complete adsorption. Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction. The exchange reaction with D z exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect by being faster than CeDe-Hz exchange; the kCH/kcD = 2 was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism in which CH (or CD) cleavage wa3 rate limiting. Benzene also poisoned the Hz-D2 equilibration. Speculation about the active sites led to the conclusion that all these exchange reactions perhaps occur on exposed Ala+ surface ions.
Introduction A characterization of the chemical nature of catalyti- cally active sites on alumina has been the object of nu- merous papers spanning several years. Direct spectro- scopic examination of surface functional groups, such as. lattice terminating OH groups or A13+ ions, and changes which they undergo during adsorption have led to identification of Lewis acid, Brgnsted, electron trans- fer, and perhaps other sites on alumina. Despite these advances, there remains considerable speculation about which, if any, of these sites are responsible for hydro- carbon catalysis. It is entirely possible that no single type of site is responsible for all reactions and that in some cases different sites must work in coordination to produce the desired catalysis.
For this reason it is important to investigate a range o f selected reaction types designed to probe the chem- ical nature and possibly to determine the concentration of active sites. One such test reaction is the exchange of hydrogen atoms with D 2 under mild conditions.
Larson and Hallza studied D 2 exchange with methane,while Pink and coworkersZb chose exchange with an- other paraffin, propane, for their test reaction.
Alu- mina is also an excellent catalyst for exchanging vinyl H atcms in olefins with Dz without  a t u r a t i o n ,and this technique has been used to prepare relatively pure per- deuterated 01efins. The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques. l t 4 Using D2 exchange with aromatics as test reactions, McCosh and KemballG found ring H exchange rates over a (probably) X-alumina sample comparable with the methane rate,2a no ring directing effects due to methyl substitution, no multiple exchange, and very slow side group exchange. The purpose of this report is to describe some of the finer details of the exchange of Dz with benzene7 carried out over the same y-, ?-alumina catalyst used in the methanel arid olefin3-5 reactions.
Experimental Section The 0.10-g catalyst sample was probably a mixture of y- and 7-alumiha prepared from the neutral hydrolysis of very pure aluminum isopropoxide by the MK Research and Development Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa.8 Its BET-N2 surface area was 158 m2/g, and metallic impurities (other than Al) were less than 50 ppm. Standard pretreatment included slowly rais- ing the sample temperature under vacuum to 530,treating it at temperature with 150 Torr 0 2  for 1 hr,and evacuating the catalyst for 2 hr to a sticking NIcLeod vacuum. It was then isolated from the vacuum system and cooled to reaction temperature. Both the catalyst and pretreatment are similar to those used in the previous s t  d i e s .   f  - The same catalyst sample was used in all these ex- periments, the standard pretreatment being per- formed before each experiment. Some irreversible poisoning occurred in the first few reactions, as the ex- change activity decreased about 30% between the first and tenth runs starting with a fresh catalyst (see Table I). However, after that the catalyst appeared to be fairly well stabilized, and the initial exchange rates were reproducible to within f 5%.

A 2-ft long Kemball-typeg Pyrex capillary leak e connected the recirculation loop di- rectly to the ion source of the mass spectrometer. This leak was sufficiently small that only 0.3%/hr of a reac- tion mixture was lost under normal operating condi- tions (1 10 Torr in reactor system).
Deuterium analyses were made on an ion-pumped CEC 21-104 mass spectrometer under low-voltage con- ditions where -H fragmentation was negligibly small (much less than 0.1%).
Realtive sensitivities for C6He and CeDB were measured with a micromanometer and accounted for in the calculations, and the usual Cla isotopic impurity corrections were made.
Radioactivity analyses were carried out in a small metal-valve-isolated chamber containing a mercury manometer and separated by a 0.001-in. thick mica windowfr om agas flow open end Geiger-Muller counter.
A Nuclear-Chicago Model 192A Ultrascaler accumu- lated the pulses for a preset time.
Procedures. After the catalyst had been pretreated,bypassed, and cooled to reaction temperature, a stan- dard benzene-D2 (10 : 100 Torr) mixture was thoroughly mixed in the recirculation loop. At time zero the mix- ture was admitted to the catalyst by manipulation of the two reactor bypass stopcocks, and scans over the mass range from m/e 78 to 85 were taken at regular intervals on the mass spectrometer. In the redistribu- tion experiments, mixtures of 5 :5 :100 = CaH&.&Da- He were used, while the HgDz equilibrations involved equal amounts of the two reactants whose total pres- sure was 100 Torr. Back exchange reactions made use of C&--H2 (10: 100 Torr) mixtures.
In the poisoning experiments, a known pressure of the gaseous test compound was first carefully measured into the calibrated doser, and after the reaction rate had become well established (24 min in the exchange experiments and 8 min in the redistribution reactions),the recirculation stream was diverted through the doser, and the poison was carried as a slug directly to the catalyst.
Radioactive COz poison was used as a probe to ascer- tain whether all the poison was adsorbed on the catalyst.
The appearance of ,radioactivity in the gas phase after
C1402
injection would indicate incomplete adsorption,and specific activity (counts min-I mm- in counter) measurements of aliquots o f the gas phase would deter- mine the fraction of that material adsorbed.
The linear Kemball equations1 were used to describe the course of the exchange reac- tions, 4, of benzene with Dz, and the first-order rate constant k, is a measure of the number of D atoms entering 100 hydrocarbon molecules per minute. 4- represents the statistical equilibrium value of 4 based on the initial benzene-Dz ratio (isotope effects were neglected in this treatment). The rate constant for the disappearance of the lightweight material is Ice, and the ratio k,/ko measures the multiplicity, 34, of the exchange reaction.
Rate equations for the redistribution reactions are similar to those derived by Bolder, et aZ.lZ An extent of reaction variable, u,was defined as Treatment o f Data,3 6 i = O i = 4 u = Cid, + C(6 - i ) d i where i is the number of D atoms per molecule, and d,is the fraction of total hydrocarbon atoms which con- tain i D atoms. The rate constant for the redistribu- tion reaction, k,, may be determined from the slope of plots o f In (u,- u) us. time where u ,
is the equilib- rium (assumed to be a binary distribution) value o f u.
The Hz-D2 rate constant, k H D ,  was calculated from the slope o f In (HD, - HD) vs. time plots.
Results A summary of most of the experimental results is contained in Table I. c6Hg-D Exchange. After the initial catalyst de- activation (runs 4-10], the activit,y for C6&-Dz ex- change remained essentially constant (k, = 5.1 i
0.2
min-) with a half-time of about 1 hr. In all cases the multiplicity, M ,  of the reaction was near unity.
COZ was an effective poison for this reaction.
Whereas the unpoisoned 4 plot remained linear until equilibrium was approached (Figure 2, curve A), addi- tion of COZ via the dosing device caused an abrupt break in the curve (Figure 2, curve b) which was fol- lowed by a new straight line from which a poisoned rate constant, k , p ,  could be calculated. Figure 3 (curve a) shows the ratio of the rate constants for several runs in which various amounts of COz were added. The titra- (9) C. Kemball, Proc. Roy. SOC., Ser. A ,207, 539 (1951).

At 24 rnin the "lethal dose" of Cl4O2,e.g., just enough C1402 necessary to poison the catalyst completely (note break in 4 plot), was added via the doser. The first radioactivity measurement at 25 min showed some activity, but after 38 min there was no measurable activity in the gas phase; hence, all the C02 was adsorbed. At 42 rnin the catalyst was by- passed, and a second identical Cl4OZ poison dose was added. Two measurements (at 47 and 54 min) in the bypassed condition indicated the activity level ex- pected from the first C1402 dose had there been no ad- sorption. All activity measurements in Figure 4 are normalized to this value. At 58 rnin the catalyst was again opened to the recirculation system, and some additional adsorption of Ci402 (about 30% of the second dose) occurred.
Beginning at 83 min, the catalyst temperature was increased rapidly in three separate steps and main- tained at the indicated temperature between each jump. At 96" all the Cl4OZ adsorbed in the second dose and about 12% of the first dose was desorbed.
The exchange activity remained poisoned, however,until 50-60% of the adsorbed CI4O2 from the first pulse was desorbed at 222". All the C1402 was essentially desorbed at 400", for the specific activity of the gas phase was about double that for a single dose.
The redistribution of H and D atoms between benzene molecules occurred much more rapidly than did either the c6He-D or CeDe-Hz exchange reactions. The rate constants were about an order of magnitude greater at 20", and the times re- quired for half-conversion to equilibrium were  / Z O  as long as that for the C6H6 + Dz exchange reaction.
C02 also poisoned this reaction, and the amount neces- sary for complete catalyst deactivation (15 X 1OlZ

Effect o f Deuterated Catalyst. Exchanging the 2 X 1014 H atoms/cm2 intrinsically on the catalyst had no apparent affect on any of the results.
The exchange and redistribution rates were identical on both hydro- genated and deuterated catalysts. No exchange be- tween H atoms in the benzene and surface H atoms was observed.
Discussion These results, coupled with other exchange re- s u l t   & over an alumina catalyst from the same GA- 48 batch which had been treated in an equivalent man- ner, have clearly demonstrated the ability of alumina to activate CH bonds in hydrocarbons under mild con- ditions. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits consider- able discrimination between different types of bonds,the order of exchange rates being aromatic ring CH > olefinic vinyl CH3v4 > paraffinic CH.2a The GA-48 used in these experiments is apparently about two orders of magnitude more active than the catalyst used by McCosh and Kemball,6 and the acti- vation energy (4.3 kcal/mol) is significantly lower than the value they obtained (6.0 kcal/mol) for the same reaction. Although their absolute activities varied markedly with outgassing temperature, Flockhart,et  1 . ) found a still higher activation energy (8.7 kcal/ mol) for propane exchange with D2 over a cataIyst simi- lar to that used by McCosh and Kemball. These ob- servations illustrate some of the dangers in comparing absolute rate data taken from different catalysts and casts doubt on some of the conclusions drawn by Mc- Cosh and Kemball. It appears that rather than hav- ing the same activation energies, each bond type may have its own unique activation energy with that for aromatic ring being lower than those for olefinic or for paraffinic C-H bonds. While the absolute values may vary from one catalyst to another, the ratio of the acti- vation energies apparently remains about the same in each system. For example, for GA-48 the aromatic ring-paraffinic (methane) ratio is 4.3:5.7 kcal = 0.8,and for the McCosh-Flockhart type catalyst the ratio is 6,0:8.7 kcal = 0.7 for aromatic ring-paraffinic (pro- pane) exchange. Also, the relative exchangeability of the ring H atoms and side group H atoms McCosh and Kemball observed in the alkyl benzenes compares favorably with the relative exchangeabilities of benzene and methane atoms over GA-48 under similar condi- tions.
All investigators2-416 have observed that the re- action multiplicity, M ,  is unity and have concluded that the exchange reactions are all stepwise. While this is likely the case, there is another factor which could account for M being one and which could obscure the true nature of the exchange reaction. This factor is the extremely rapid intermolecular redistribution reaction which occurs at a rate 10-20 times as fast as the exchange with Dz. A necessary and sufficient con- dition for M = 1 requires only the maintenance of a statistical equilibrium distribution among all exchange- able positions at all times within the hydrocarbon;this condition was assured by the rapid redistribution reaction regardless of the multiplicity of the initial but slower D2 exchange reaction. Moreover, this scram- bling reaction can also explain the absence of ortho-para- directing effects which McCosh and KembalP did not observe in the ring exchange of alkylbenzenes. The rapid redistribution occurs only among olefinic vinyl4 and aromatic ring CH bonds; paraffinic CH bonds are not so involved.
The poisoning experiments have supplied consider- able information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites, Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs. It is possible that ben- zene is so strongly adsorbed as to prevent adsorption of these compounds; mass spectral analyses indicated that NO, CO, and O2 were not adsorbed to an apprecia- ble degree; adsorption of H2O and NHa were not tested.
The fact that NO is not a poison does not necessarily rule out the A13+ Lewis acid NO adsorption site, identi- fied by Lunsford13 using an epr technique, as being operative in these reactions. The site concentration by NO spin density measurements was 4.9 X cm2,and Lunsford suggested that they may be the same as the 5.2 X 1012/cm2 a sites identified by Peril4 using l-butene to titrate the adsorbed C02 ir spectrum.

other explanation is that the temperature (20") was not high enough for NO to overcome the activation energy barrier for adsorption on the active sites; Larson and Hallza found NO did poison methane exchange when added at a higher temperature. CO is known not to adsorb on alumina to a significant degree; its ir spectra is discussed at length by Parkyns.16 The inert be- havior of CO is thus not unexpected.
Water caused some poisoning, but its effect was small compared with the devastating effect of COz. This is likely due to nonselective adsorption on activated alumina, as suggested by Larson and At room temperature, 0 2 is reduced only very slowly by hydro- gen (or Dz) to form water on alumina. Larson and Hall found this reaction also poisoned their methane exchange when the temperature was increased suffi- ciently to activate the reaction.
They postulated the formation of water directly on the active sites in this way. The temperature was apparently too low for this reaction to occur in the present study.
The fact that fairly large doses of ammonia caused no drastic poisoning suggests that the exchange reac- tions do not occur on the acid-base pair sites originally proposed by Peril4 Unfortunately, it is not known whether the ammonia,adsorbed at all nor if the NH bonds underwent exchange with Dz.
An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between am- monia and the alumina surface, but this interaction (if it did occur) did not affect the exchange rate.
The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the re- action mechanism.
Carbon dioxide was clearly the most effective poison tested. I f one assumes a 1:1 = site-poison molecule ratio, the poisoning intercept in Figure 3 gives a site density of about 15 X loL2 sites/cm2 for both the DZ exchange and the redistribution reactions. This value is the same as that observed for cyclopentene exchange with Dz4 and Hz-Dz equilibration,16 even though the method of COz addition was different in the latter paper. However, this value must be taken as a maxi- mum measure of the site concentration, as the COZ may also have been adsorbed nonselectively on sites other than those which catalyze the reactions. Supporting this contension is the nonlinearity of all the poisoning curves, and extrapolation of the initial slopes of the curves gives an intercept in the range 6-8 X 10l2 sites/ em2 in all cases. (Another interpretation for the non- linearity of the poisoning curves may be that the sites are inhomogeneous and that the most highly active sites are the first ones selectively poisoned.) Further evidence comes from the radioactive poisoning experi- ments. Whereas the catalyst could adsorb at least 30% more COz than was necessary to poison the ex- change reaction, the exchange activity did not recom- mence until the temperature was increased (between 96 and 222" in Figure 4) to the point where 12-60% of the first C1402 dose was desorbed. This would indicate that a coverage in the range 6-13 X l0lz molecules/cm2 was sufficient to poison the reaction if they were all ad- sorbed selectively on the active sites. On the basis of these findings, we believe the true site density is prob- ably about 8 X 1012/cm2.
Peril4 has shown by ir measurements that COz is held in a variety of ways on alumina, and most of the bands he observed have also been observed by Little and Am- berg," Parkyns,lB and Gregg and Ramsay.lQ In his most thorough treatment of band identification, Par- kyns18 divided the ir absorption bands observed when COz was adsorbed on alumina into two groups: those which were pressure sensitive and those which were time dependent. Neither of these categories can adequately explain the poisoning results, for the COz adsorption occurred fairly rapidly (not time dependent) and the ad- sorbed material on the active sites could not be removed except by heating to temperatures greater than 100' (not pressure dependent). The structures associated with these bands were probably physically adsorbed
COZ,
bicarbonate ions, or carbonate ions.On the other hand, a single band at 1780 em-' was neither pressure nor time dependent, nor was it removed by evacuation at 100.lB This band is probably due to a linear structure of the form O-CtO +o-c=o // or

+ involving especially exposed aluminum cations. 143 l8 This band was observed only on the y-alumina samples and was absent on the X-alumina prepared from aluminum trihydrate (Table I, ref 19). Since this latter was the same type catalyst used by McCosh and Kemball, per- haps the absence of this type GO2 adsorption site could account for their much lower activity level and higher activation energy than observed for the GA-48 catalyst for benzene exchange.
These findings lead us to suggest that the Hz-D equi- libration, Dz exchange, and intermolecular HD redistri- bution reactions all occur on the same exposed A13+ sur- face ions whose concentration is the order of 8 X 101%/cm2.
The sites may be the same ones on which NO is weakly adsorbed13 and with which COZ interacts to give an ir band at 1780 cm-l.18 The D 2 exchange re- (15) N. D. Parkyns, J .  Chem. SOC.

4329 actions are likely stepwise involving a dissociative mech- anism whose slow step is CH cleavage. The much greater activity of vinyl or aromatic CH bonds than paraffinic CH indicates that the initial interaction with the surface may involve attraction of the ?r system in the molecule. Perhaps two molecules ?r bonded to the same or adjacent A13+ ions could undergo the redistribution reaction. Strong adsorption of the ?r system in benzene probably inhibits adsorption of hydrogen on these same sites and accounts for the poisoning of the H2-D2 equil- ibration by benzene.
Such H2-D2 poisoning is prob- ably fairly common in oxide catalysis, having been re- cently reported by Conner and KokesZ0 in the ethylene- zinc oxide system.
Now that these exchange sites have been somewhat better characterized, it is doubtful that they are the same ones which catalyze isomerization in olefins. Re- sults from some experiments currently underway will hopefully resolve this uncertainty.

<questions>


Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
