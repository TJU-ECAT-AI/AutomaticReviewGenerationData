[1] "Reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 require the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of the hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions. Hydrogen disposal can take place by transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface or by the recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
[2] "Isotopic exchange experiments suggest that propane aromatization occurs on H-ZSM5 by a complex reaction sequence involving dehydrogenation to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C6+ aromatics. These reactions proceed in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reactions to form methane and ethane."
[3] "Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface."
[4] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."
[5] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation pathways involving the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Key steps in these processes include:

1. **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: This occurs as the catalyst facilitates the formation of allylic alkenes, which can then form π-allyl complexes on the surface of the catalyst. This complexation affects the catalytic activity by altering the surface properties and potentially blocking active sites.

2. **β-H transfer**: In the context of metathesis reactions, β-H transfer is a mechanism that can lead to catalyst deactivation. It involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a β-position of a substrate, often leading to the formation of a new bond that may deactivate the catalyst or alter its reactivity.

Regarding the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity:

- **Impact on performance**: The formation of π-allyl complexes and β-H transfer can lead to a decrease in the catalyst's efficiency, as the active sites may become less accessible or the catalyst may lose its ability to catalyze the desired reactions effectively.

- **Effect on longevity**: Frequent deactivation can shorten the catalyst's operational lifespan, necessitating more frequent regeneration or replacement. This can increase production costs and decrease the overall economic viability of the process.

In conclusion, understanding and managing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and deactivation is crucial for optimizing the performance and longevity of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Strategies might include modifying the catalyst formulation to enhance stability against these deactivation pathways, improving process conditions to mitigate their impact, or developing more robust catalyst designs that are less susceptible to deactivation.

分析烷基聚合和裂合催化剂在支撑结构中的内部分子C-H键活化导致的失活机制，我们发现镧系/锕系为基础和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂均会经历形成π-二烯基表面复合物和β-H转移的过程。这些过程的关键步骤包括：

1. **形成π-二烯基表面复合物**：在催化剂催化形成二烯基烯烃时，可能会在催化剂表面上形成π-二烯基复合物。这种复合物化可能会影响催化活性，改变表面性质或阻塞活性位点。

2. **β-H转移**：在裂合反应的背景下，β-H转移是可能导致催化剂失活的一种机制。它涉及从β位置的基团中去除一个氢原子，并可能导致形成新的键，这可能使催化剂失效或改变其反应性。

关于这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响：

- **性能影响**：形成π-二烯基复合物和β-H转移可能导致催化剂效率下降，因为活性位点可能变得不那么可访问，或者催化剂可能失去催化所需反应的能力。

- **寿命效应**：频繁的失活可以缩短催化剂的使用寿命，需要更频繁地再生或更换。这会增加生产成本并降低整个过程的经济可行性。

综上所述，理解和管理C-H键激活和失活的机制对于优化支撑烷基聚合和裂合催化剂的性能和寿命至关重要。策略可能包括通过改进催化剂配方来增强稳定性以抵抗这些失活路径、改善工艺条件以减轻其影响，或开发更稳健的催化剂设计，使其对失活更不敏感。
