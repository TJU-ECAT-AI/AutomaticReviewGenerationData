[1] "The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations."

[2] "The presence of Ga and Zn species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- ble 2, Fig. 1). Yet, C3Hs/C3D 8 exchange data show that C-H bond activation rates on H- ZSM5 appear to be similar to those on Ga/H- ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 (Table 3, Fig. 11) [42]."

[3] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an indepen- dent measure of the D-content in the surface pool [22,28,29,42]."

[4] "Clearly, the function of Ga sites cannot be limited to the initial dehydrogenation of propane because the rate of propene conversion to aro- matics also increases when Ga is introduced into H-ZSM5."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through the process of β-H transfer. This mechanism typically leads to the deactivation of the catalyst as the β-H atom is transferred to the metal center, causing the complex to lose its catalytically active state. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, also rely on β-H transfer, but the specific mechanisms might differ due to the different support properties and the nature of the metal catalyst.

The formation of π-allyl complexes involves the stabilization of a C-H bond on the catalyst surface, which subsequently undergoes β-H transfer to form a more stable allyl complex. This process can lead to deactivation as the catalyst loses its ability to efficiently perform the desired polymerization or metathesis reactions.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Decreased efficiency and increased production costs can result from the need to regenerate or replace the catalyst after it reaches a certain level of deactivation. Additionally, the selectivity and product distribution might be negatively impacted, affecting the quality and yield of the final product.

The increased deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane, as observed in the presence of Ga and Zn species, indicates that these metals facilitate the dehydrogenation process, potentially impacting the overall deactivation dynamics. However, the similar C-H bond activation rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 suggest that the intrinsic properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining the extent of deactivation.

The enhanced rate of propene conversion to aromatics when Ga is introduced into H-ZSM5 highlights the importance of metal cations in facilitating specific reaction pathways. While Ga and Zn can enhance the conversion rates, they do not necessarily limit the C-H bond activation step, which remains critical for the efficient operation of these catalysts.

In summary, the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves complex mechanisms that vary between different types of catalysts. The specific pathways, such as β-H transfer leading to π-allyl complex formation, can impact catalyst performance and longevity. The presence of metal cations can influence these processes, offering potential strategies to mitigate deactivation and optimize catalyst efficiency.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，内分子C-H键活化的作用因镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅支持的Re基催化剂而异。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常涉及通过β-H转移形成π-烯丙基表面复合物的过程。这一机制通常会导致催化剂失活，因为β-H原子转移到金属中心，使复合物失去其催化活性状态。硅支持的Re基催化剂也依赖于β-H转移，但由于支持特性和金属催化剂的不同性质，特定机制可能有所不同。

π-烯丙基复合物的形成涉及到在催化剂表面上稳定一个C-H键，随后通过β-H转移形成更稳定的烯丙基复合物。这个过程可能导致失活，因为催化剂失去了高效执行所需聚合或金属易位反应的能力。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。效率下降和增加生产成本可能导致需要再生或更换催化剂，当催化剂达到一定水平的失活时。此外，选择性和产品分布可能受到负面影响，影响最终产品的质量和产量。

在存在Ga和Zn物种的情况下观察到的未反应丙烷中较高的脱氘含量表明，这些金属促进了脱氢过程，可能会影响整体失活动态。然而，H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上相似的C-H键激活率表明，催化剂本身的内在属性在确定失活程度方面起着关键作用。

当Ga引入到H-ZSM5中时，丙烯转化为芳香族化合物的增强速率突显了金属离子在促进特定反应路径中的重要性。尽管Ga和Zn可以增强转化速率，但它们并不必然限制C-H键活化步骤，这仍然是这些催化剂有效运行的关键。

综上所述，支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活涉及复杂的机制，这些机制在不同类型的催化剂之间有所不同。特定路径，如导致π-烯丙基复合物形成的β-H转移，可能会影响催化剂性能和寿命。金属离子的存在可能影响这些过程，提供可能的策略来减少失活并优化催化剂效率。
