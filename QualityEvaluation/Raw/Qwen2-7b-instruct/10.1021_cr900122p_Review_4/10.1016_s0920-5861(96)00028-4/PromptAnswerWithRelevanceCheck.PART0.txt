[1] "The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations."

[2] "The presence of Ga and Zn species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- ble 2, Fig. 1). Yet, C3Hs/C3D 8 exchange data show that C-H bond activation rates on H- ZSM5 appear to be similar to those on Ga/H- ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 (Table 3, Fig. 11) [42]."

[3] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an indepen- dent measure of the D-content in the surface pool [22,28,29,42]."

[4] "Clearly, the function of Ga sites cannot be limited to the initial dehydrogenation of propane because the rate of propene conversion to aro- matics also increases when Ga is introduced into H-ZSM5."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through the process of β-H transfer. This mechanism typically leads to the deactivation of the catalyst as the β-H atom is transferred to the metal center, causing the complex to lose its catalytically active state. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, also rely on β-H transfer, but the specific mechanisms might differ due to the different support properties and the nature of the metal catalyst.

The formation of π-allyl complexes involves the stabilization of a C-H bond on the catalyst surface, which subsequently undergoes β-H transfer to form a more stable allyl complex. This process can lead to deactivation as the catalyst loses its ability to efficiently perform the desired polymerization or metathesis reactions.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Decreased efficiency and increased production costs can result from the need to regenerate or replace the catalyst after it reaches a certain level of deactivation. Additionally, the selectivity and product distribution might be negatively impacted, affecting the quality and yield of the final product.

The increased deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane, as observed in the presence of Ga and Zn species, indicates that these metals facilitate the dehydrogenation process, potentially impacting the overall deactivation dynamics. However, the similar C-H bond activation rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 suggest that the intrinsic properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining the extent of deactivation.

The enhanced rate of propene conversion to aromatics when Ga is introduced into H-ZSM5 highlights the importance of metal cations in facilitating specific reaction pathways. While Ga and Zn can enhance the conversion rates, they do not necessarily limit the C-H bond activation step, which remains critical for the efficient operation of these catalysts.

In summary, the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves complex mechanisms that vary between different types of catalysts. The specific pathways, such as β-H transfer leading to π-allyl complex formation, can impact catalyst performance and longevity. The presence of metal cations can influence these processes, offering potential strategies to mitigate deactivation and optimize catalyst efficiency.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，内分子C-H键活化的作用因镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅支持的Re基催化剂而异。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常涉及通过β-H转移形成π-烯丙基表面复合物的过程。这一机制通常会导致催化剂失活，因为β-H原子转移到金属中心，使复合物失去其催化活性状态。硅支持的Re基催化剂也依赖于β-H转移，但由于支持特性和金属催化剂的不同性质，特定机制可能有所不同。

π-烯丙基复合物的形成涉及到在催化剂表面上稳定一个C-H键，随后通过β-H转移形成更稳定的烯丙基复合物。这个过程可能导致失活，因为催化剂失去了高效执行所需聚合或金属易位反应的能力。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。效率下降和增加生产成本可能导致需要再生或更换催化剂，当催化剂达到一定水平的失活时。此外，选择性和产品分布可能受到负面影响，影响最终产品的质量和产量。

在存在Ga和Zn物种的情况下观察到的未反应丙烷中较高的脱氘含量表明，这些金属促进了脱氢过程，可能会影响整体失活动态。然而，H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上相似的C-H键激活率表明，催化剂本身的内在属性在确定失活程度方面起着关键作用。

当Ga引入到H-ZSM5中时，丙烯转化为芳香族化合物的增强速率突显了金属离子在促进特定反应路径中的重要性。尽管Ga和Zn可以增强转化速率，但它们并不必然限制C-H键活化步骤，这仍然是这些催化剂有效运行的关键。

综上所述，支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活涉及复杂的机制，这些机制在不同类型的催化剂之间有所不同。特定路径，如导致π-烯丙基复合物形成的β-H转移，可能会影响催化剂性能和寿命。金属离子的存在可能影响这些过程，提供可能的策略来减少失活并优化催化剂效率。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, this document presents a detailed study on the reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 zeolites. The key steps involve the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of hydrogen atoms, which can occur through transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments or recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen. Modifications of the zeolites with Ga and Zn cations enhance the hydrogen disposal rate, the propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic exchange experiments reveal that C-H bond activation occurs at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, yet Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into products. Ga and Zn sites facilitate the removal of hydrogen atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, enabling more efficient turnover of acid sites without the formation of cracking products.

Hydrogen disposal can take place by transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface or by the recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
[2] "Isotopic exchange experiments suggest that propane aromatization occurs on H-ZSM5 by a complex reaction sequence involving dehydrogenation to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C6+ aromatics. These reactions proceed in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reactions to form methane and ethane."
[3] "Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface."
[4] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."
[5] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation pathways involving the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Key steps in these processes include:

1. **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: This occurs as the catalyst facilitates the formation of allylic alkenes, which can then form π-allyl complexes on the surface of the catalyst. This complexation affects the catalytic activity by altering the surface properties and potentially blocking active sites.

2. **β-H transfer**: In the context of metathesis reactions, β-H transfer is a mechanism that can lead to catalyst deactivation. It involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a β-position of a substrate, often leading to the formation of a new bond that may deactivate the catalyst or alter its reactivity.

Regarding the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity:

- **Impact on performance**: The formation of π-allyl complexes and β-H transfer can lead to a decrease in the catalyst's efficiency, as the active sites may become less accessible or the catalyst may lose its ability to catalyze the desired reactions effectively.

- **Effect on longevity**: Frequent deactivation can shorten the catalyst's operational lifespan, necessitating more frequent regeneration or replacement. This can increase production costs and decrease the overall economic viability of the process.

In conclusion, understanding and managing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and deactivation is crucial for optimizing the performance and longevity of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Strategies might include modifying the catalyst formulation to enhance stability against these deactivation pathways, improving process conditions to mitigate their impact, or developing more robust catalyst designs that are less susceptible to deactivation.

分析烷基聚合和裂合催化剂在支撑结构中的内部分子C-H键活化导致的失活机制，我们发现镧系/锕系为基础和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂均会经历形成π-二烯基表面复合物和β-H转移的过程。这些过程的关键步骤包括：

1. **形成π-二烯基表面复合物**：在催化剂催化形成二烯基烯烃时，可能会在催化剂表面上形成π-二烯基复合物。这种复合物化可能会影响催化活性，改变表面性质或阻塞活性位点。

2. **β-H转移**：在裂合反应的背景下，β-H转移是可能导致催化剂失活的一种机制。它涉及从β位置的基团中去除一个氢原子，并可能导致形成新的键，这可能使催化剂失效或改变其反应性。

关于这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响：

- **性能影响**：形成π-二烯基复合物和β-H转移可能导致催化剂效率下降，因为活性位点可能变得不那么可访问，或者催化剂可能失去催化所需反应的能力。

- **寿命效应**：频繁的失活可以缩短催化剂的使用寿命，需要更频繁地再生或更换。这会增加生产成本并降低整个过程的经济可行性。

综上所述，理解和管理C-H键激活和失活的机制对于优化支撑烷基聚合和裂合催化剂的性能和寿命至关重要。策略可能包括通过改进催化剂配方来增强稳定性以抵抗这些失活路径、改善工艺条件以减轻其影响，或开发更稳健的催化剂设计，使其对失活更不敏感。

Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 207-231 Structure and function of metal cations in light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5 Joseph A. Biscardi, Enrique Iglesia * Department of Chemical Engineering, Unit,ersity of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA Abstract The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics. Quasi-equilibrated acid-cata- lyzed cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization reactions of alkene intermediates occur in sequence with these dehydrogena- tion reactions. Each dehydrogenation reaction is in turn limited by the rate of elementary steps that dispose of H-atoms formed in C-H bond activation steps. The rate of C-H bond activation, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and propane chemical conversion have been measured from the rates of isotopic redistribution and chemical conversion during reactions of C3Hs/C3D 8 and D2/C3H s mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSMS. Isotopic studies show that C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSMS.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.
