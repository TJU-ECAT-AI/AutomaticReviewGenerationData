1. The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, goes through acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations.

2. On H-ZSM5, the 3C content in propane decreases with increased conversion due to the dilution of the pure propane-2-13C reactant by unlabeled products of propene hydrogenation.

3. Initial reaction products do not contain 3C and are mainly derived from unlabeled propene molecules in the feed mixture.

4. The addition of Ga and Zn to H-ZSM5 does not alter the reaction pathways significantly.

5. The (r_l/r 2) ratio for all catalysts is almost unaffected by conversion level, as shown in Figure 7.

6. The presence of cationic Ga and Zn within zeolite channels might displace protons and decrease the number of available acid-catalyzed reaction sites.

7. Activation of C-H bonds necessitates the presence of acid sites, as demonstrated in the studies of C3H8/C3D 8 mixtures.

8. The introduction of H 2 to C3H8/He mixtures makes Ga/H-ZSM5 resemble H-ZSM5 catalytically due to the auto-generated high hydrogen concentration caused by the hydrogen desorption bottleneck.

9. The presence of Ga species enables gas-phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb, competing effectively for surface sites, thereby reducing aromatic selectivity.

1. 烷烃脱氢形成的初代丙烯中间体，在沸石通道内通过缩合或碳正离子加成进行酸催化链增长反应。

2. 在H-ZSM5上，随着转化率增加，丙烷中3C的含量下降，这是由于纯丙烷-2-13C反应物被丙烯氢化产物的无标记产品稀释所致。

3. 初始反应产物不包含3C，并主要来源于混合物中的无标记丙烯分子。

4. 向H-ZSM5中添加Ga和Zn不会显著改变反应路径。

5. 所有催化剂的（r_l/r 2）比几乎不受转化率影响，如图7所示。

6. 铟离子化的Ga和Zn存在于沸石通道内可能会置换出质子并减少可利用的酸催化反应位点的数量。

7. 活化C-H键需要酸性位点，这一点在C3H8/C3D 8混合物的研究中得到证明。

8. 向C3H8/He混合物中引入H 2使Ga/H-ZSM5与H-ZSM5在催化上相似，这是由于自动生成的高氢浓度导致氢解离瓶颈。

9. Ga物种允许气态氢以解离吸附方式吸附，有效地竞争表面位点，从而降低芳香族选择性。
