[1] "Reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 require the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of the hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions."
[2] "Hydrogen disposal can take place by transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface or by the recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen (H2)."
[3] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate,and aromatic selectivity."
[4] "Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."
[5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, this document presents a detailed study on the reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 zeolites. The key steps involve the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of hydrogen atoms, which can occur through transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments or recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen. Modifications of the zeolites with Ga and Zn cations enhance the hydrogen disposal rate, the propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic exchange experiments reveal that C-H bond activation occurs at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, yet Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into products. Ga and Zn sites facilitate the removal of hydrogen atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, enabling more efficient turnover of acid sites without the formation of cracking products.

分析支持的烯烃聚合和金属化反应催化剂的内在C-H键活化在催化剂失活过程中的作用，本文详细研究了H-ZSM5沸石上丙烷的反应。关键步骤包括C-H键的激活和氢原子的处理，处理方式可以是转移到吸附的碳氢化合物碎片上或通过重组脱附形成氢分子。对含镓和锌的沸石进行改性可以提高氢处理率、丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。同位素交换实验表明，在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上C-H键激活速率相似，但镓和锌离子增加了化学丙烷转化、氢脱附和D-原子进入产物的速率。镓和锌位点通过移除激活C-H键的酸位点上的氢原子来促进酸位点的高效循环，从而避免生成裂解产物。
