[1] "The fact that on Cu(100) 8-H elimination is much faster in 3-hexyl groups than in cyclohexyl moieties indicates that molecular strain also hinders the reaction, and suggests a cyclic transition state?24 Finally, a mo- lecular cluster calculation for the decomposition of isobutyl decomposition on aluminum surfaces favors a four-center planar intermediate?12 The activation barrier for 8 elimination ranges from 24 to 37 kcaVmol on aluminum,5I6 but is less than 10 kcaVmol on most transition metal sur- f a c e

The document discusses the influence of molecular strain on the reaction rates of 8-H elimination, with faster rates observed in 3-hexyl groups compared to cyclohexyl moieties on Cu(100). It also mentions a cyclic transition state for this process. Additionally, it notes that the activation barrier for 8 elimination on aluminum surfaces is approximately 24 to 37 kcaVmol, which is significantly higher than the barrier on most transition metal surfaces, typically less than 10 kcaVmol.

[1] "This difference is paralleled by differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction,and therefore may be related to the affinity of the different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 ) or Fe(lOO)lOz surfaces;since normal primary isotope effects can at the most account for a factor of 5,the remaining difference must be due either to tunneling or to secondary effects."

The disparity in reaction thermodynamics mirrors the distinct affinities of various surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Moreover, the deuterium atom elimination from an ethyl group occurs approximately 10 times slower than the normal hydrogen elimination on either Cu(100) or Fe(100) surfaces. Considering normal primary isotope effects can account for at most a factor of 5, the remaining discrepancy is attributed to tunneling or secondary effects.

这种差异在热力学反应中与不同表面对于原子氢的亲和性相呼应。此外，从乙基组中除去氘原子的速度大约是铜(100)或铁(100)表面上正常氢原子去除速度的10倍。考虑到正常的初级同位素效应最多只能解释为因子5，剩余的差异归因于隧穿或次级效应。

[1] "The simplest case of an a-H elimination step is the conversion of methyl to methylene groups. In contrast to the olefin produced in y-elimination reactions, though, the methylene moiety that results from a-H abstraction is not stable in free form, and therefore remains coordinated to the metal."

[1] "Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, particularly in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, affecting the efficiency and stability of the catalytic activity."
