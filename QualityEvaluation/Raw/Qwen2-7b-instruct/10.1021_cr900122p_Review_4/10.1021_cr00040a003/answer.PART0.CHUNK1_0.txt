[1] "This structure sensitivity may be related to the need for a reasonably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respectively,3J and each extra hydrogen requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms."
[2] "Since such large ensembles are difficult to emulate with organometallic clusters, it may be difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation typically involves the formation of π-allyl complexes which can undergo β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst. In silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the process might also involve the formation of π-allyl complexes, but the specifics of β-H transfer and the deactivation pathways could differ due to the different support materials and catalyst structures. The key steps include the formation of these complexes, followed by the β-H transfer reactions that lead to the deactivation of the catalysts. These deactivation pathways can have significant consequences on catalyst performance and longevity, potentially reducing the efficiency and lifespan of the catalysts in industrial applications.

The structure sensitivity of these reactions refers to the requirement for a large ensemble of metal atoms to facilitate the reactions. The adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respectively, and each extra hydrogen atom requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms. This large ensemble is challenging to emulate with organometallic clusters, thus making it difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用，涉及到π-邻基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活通常涉及π-邻基复合物的形成，随后发生β-H转移以失活催化剂。对于SiO2支持的Re基催化剂，过程可能也涉及π-邻基复合物的形成，但由于不同的支持材料和催化剂结构，β-H转移和失活途径可能会有所不同。关键步骤包括形成这些复合物，随后发生导致催化剂失活的β-H转移反应。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命具有重大影响，可能降低催化剂在工业应用中的效率和使用寿命。

这些反应的结构敏感性指的是需要一个较大的金属原子簇来促进反应。乙烯和乙炔的吸附需要最少四个表面镍原子和两个镍原子，每个额外的氢原子需要一个空位以及另外三个Ni原子。这个大的簇难以用有机金属簇来模拟，因此很难在均相系统中重现这些表面反应。
