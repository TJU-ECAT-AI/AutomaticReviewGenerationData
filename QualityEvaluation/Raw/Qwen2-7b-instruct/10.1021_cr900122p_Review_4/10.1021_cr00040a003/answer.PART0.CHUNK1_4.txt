The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves several key steps. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often form π-allyl surface complexes, which can be deactivated through β-H transfer reactions. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts also utilize intramolecular C-H bond activation but might be subject to different deactivation pathways. Key steps include breaking the alkene backbone, leading to the formation of cycloalkanes or other byproducts. These deactivation pathways can impact catalyst performance, selectivity, and economic viability, affecting the efficiency of polymerization or metathesis processes.

在支撑型烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键活化起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常会形成π-邻二醇表面复合物，这些可以通过β-H转移反应被失活。硅支持的Re基催化剂也利用内部分子C-H键活化，但可能受到不同的失活途径的影响。关键步骤包括断裂烯烃骨架，导致形成环烷烃或其他副产品。这些失活途径可以影响催化剂性能、选择性和经济可行性，从而影响聚合或裂合过程的效率。
