The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process includes the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which stabilize reactive intermediates and lead to catalyst deactivation. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, however, experience β-H transfer as a key step in their deactivation pathway. This process allows for the release of hydrogen, which can weaken the catalyst structure over time.

在支撑型烯烃聚合和金属环化催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂经历一个形成π-二烯表面复合物的过程，这稳定了活性中间体并导致催化剂失活。另一方面，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂则经历β-H转移作为其失活途径的关键步骤。这一过程允许氢的释放，从而逐渐削弱催化剂结构。
