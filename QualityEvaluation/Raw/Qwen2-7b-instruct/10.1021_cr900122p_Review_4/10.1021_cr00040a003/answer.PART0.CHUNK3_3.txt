[1] "The key steps in the process of intramolecular C-H bond activation involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer."
[2] "Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often deactivate through a mechanism involving the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the alkene backbone."
[3] "Silica-supported Re-based catalysts may also deactivate via β-H transfer, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity over time."
[4] "The deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts typically deactivate through hydrogen abstraction from the alkene backbone, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts may deactivate via β-H transfer, affecting their performance and longevity over time.

在支持型烯烃聚合和裂解催化剂的内分子C-H键活化过程中，关键步骤包括形成π-邻二烯基表面复合物和β-H转移。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常通过从烯烃骨架中抽取氢原子来失活，而SiO2支持的Re基催化剂也可能通过β-H转移失活，这会对其性能和寿命产生影响。
