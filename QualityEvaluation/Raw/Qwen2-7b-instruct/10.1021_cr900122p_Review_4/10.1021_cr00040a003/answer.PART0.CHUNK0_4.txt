[1] "The details of the mechanism for 8-H elimination on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic"
[2] "The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl groups."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This occurs when the allyl group from the alkene substrate is activated and inserted into the catalyst metal center, forming a π-allyl complex. Subsequent β-H transfer from the catalyst metal center to the allyl group results in the cleavage of the alkene double bond and the formation of a new alkene or olefin.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism involves similar steps but with a different catalyst metal. The allyl group from the alkene substrate is activated and inserted into the Re center, forming a π-allyl complex. Then, β-H transfer from the Re center to the allyl group occurs, leading to the cleavage of the alkene double bond and the formation of a new alkene or olefin.

The key steps in these processes are:
1. Activation of the allyl group from the alkene substrate by the catalyst metal center.
2. Insertion of the activated allyl group into the catalyst metal center, forming a π-allyl complex.
3. β-H transfer from the catalyst metal center to the allyl group, resulting in the cleavage of the alkene double bond.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Frequent β-H transfer events can lead to the gradual loss of catalyst activity as the number of active sites decreases. Additionally, the formation of inactive byproducts can reduce the overall yield of desired products. Therefore, understanding and controlling these deactivation pathways is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and longevity in industrial alkene polymerization and metathesis processes.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键激活的作用至关重要。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程通常涉及π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成。这发生在烯烃基质中的烯丙基从催化剂金属中心激活，并插入形成π-烯丙基复合物。

对于Si基支持的Re基催化剂，机制类似但使用不同的催化剂金属。烯烃基质中的烯丙基被激活并插入Re中心，形成π-烯丙基复合物。然后，Re中心向烯丙基进行β-H转移，导致双键断裂和新烯烃或不饱和烃的形成。

这些过程的关键步骤是：
1. 催化剂金属中心对烯烃基质中的烯丙基的激活。
2. 烯烃基质中的烯丙基插入到催化剂金属中心，形成π-烯丙基复合物。
3. β-H从催化剂金属中心转移到烯丙基，导致双键断裂。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果是显著的。频繁的β-H转移事件可能导致催化剂活性逐渐丧失，因为有效站点数量减少。此外，形成的无用副产品会降低目标产物的整体产率。因此，理解并控制这些失活途径对于优化工业烯烃聚合和金属易位过程中的催化剂性能和寿命至关重要。
