[1] "The details of the mechanism for 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic"
[2] "The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl g r 0  p s . S This promo- tion by alkyl substitution at the 8 position was seen tyl."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These processes typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the activation of the C-H bond results in the formation of a π-allyl complex, which then undergoes β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the intramolecular C-H activation leads to the formation of a π-allyl species, followed by β-H transfer, which ultimately leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can significantly impact the efficiency and yield of polymerization and metathesis reactions, necessitating careful management of reaction conditions to prolong catalyst life.

在支持的烯烃聚合和甲基化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键激活涉及镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的特定机制。这些过程通常涉及π-丙烯基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，C-H键的激活导致π-丙烯基复合物的形成，随后发生β-H转移，从而失活催化剂。同样，对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，分子内C-H激活导致π-丙烯基物种的形成，随后发生β-H转移，最终导致催化剂失活。这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能显著影响聚合和甲基化反应的效率和产率，需要仔细管理反应条件以延长催化剂寿命。
