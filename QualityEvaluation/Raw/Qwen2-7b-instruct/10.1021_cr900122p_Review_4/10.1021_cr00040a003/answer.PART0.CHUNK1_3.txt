[1] "The conversion of adsorbed ethylene into ethylidyne species on transition metal surfaces involves multiple steps. Any mechanism that attempts to explain this reaction must include at least two steps in order to account for the changes that occur within the surface moieties."
[2] "Ethylene exchanges its hydrogen atoms simultaneously during the formation of ethylidyne as well."
[3] "The mechanism of this reaction is more complicated than initially thought. For example, a recent STM study has shown that the kinetics for the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(ll1) may depend on the availability of the appropriate ensemble of metal atoms, since the reaction appears to take place preferentially on the boundaries between the islands formed by ethylene and ethylidyne."
[4] "The lack of a significant buildup of any species other than ethylene and ethylidyne during ethylidyne formation argues for a mechanism with an initial slow step or, more likely, for a fast equilibrium between ethylene and a second species."
[5] "Ethylidyne and ethylene are both much more stable than any of the other proposed species, so if such an equilibrium were to be established, the second moiety would have to be present in small concentrations on the surface at all times during the ethylene conversion."
[6] "Given that the rate for ethylidyne formation is independent of the surface coverage of coadsorbed hydrogen, the most likely mechanism for ethylidyne formation is that involving ethylidene."
[7] "Results from kinetic experiments with trideuterioethylene on Pt(ll1) ruled out the simple two-step irreversible sequence via an ethylidene intermediate."
[8] "Studies on the surface chemistry of vinyl iodide argue against the idea of a pathway involving vinyl intermediates as well."
[9] "A third proposal is that ethyl groups may coexist in small concentrations on the surface throughout the course of the reaction, perhaps in equilibrium with the adsorbed ethylene."
[10] "Recent RAIRS experiments have shown that the rate of ethylidyne formation is not affected by the presence of coadsorbed hydrogen on the surface."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves complex mechanisms that differ between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The key steps involve the formation of a π-allyl complex through a C-H activation event, followed by β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst.

Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit different deactivation pathways. The specific mechanisms are not as well-defined as those for lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, but they typically involve the formation of surface complexes that can undergo β-H transfer or other reactions leading to catalyst deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include decreased activity and selectivity over time, which can significantly impact industrial processes relying on these catalysts. The stability and longevity of the catalysts can be improved by optimizing synthesis conditions, modifying the support material, or incorporating additives that inhibit deactivation pathways.

The complexity of these deactivation mechanisms underscores the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the specific interactions between the catalyst, support, and reaction substrates to enhance catalyst performance and extend their useful life.

在支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键活化起着复杂的作用。这种作用在镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅基铼基催化剂之间有所不同。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，π-亚甲基表面复合物的形成起着关键作用。这些复合物可以通过C-H激活事件形成，随后发生β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。关键步骤包括通过C-H活化事件形成π-亚甲基复合物，然后发生β-H转移以使催化剂失活。

硅基铼基催化剂的失活途径则有所不同。特定机制尚未明确定义，但通常涉及形成表面复合物，这些复合物可以进行β-H转移或其他导致催化剂失活的反应。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在影响包括随着时间推移活性和选择性的降低，这显著影响依赖这些催化剂的工业过程。催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命可以通过优化合成条件、修改支持材料或引入抑制失活途径的添加剂来改善。

这些失活机制的复杂性强调了深入了解催化剂、支持物和反应底物之间的特定相互作用以提高催化剂性能并延长其使用寿命的重要性。
