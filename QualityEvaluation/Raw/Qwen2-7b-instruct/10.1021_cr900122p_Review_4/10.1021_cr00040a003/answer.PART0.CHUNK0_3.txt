[1] "The details of the mechanism for 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic"
[2] "The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl groups."
[3] "The selective desorption of CH3- CD=CHz from the 2,2-dideuteriopropyl group that forms in this case indicates that P-hydride elimination reactions are highly preferred over a- or y-H eliminations (which would produce either Do or Dz-propenes)."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically starts with the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This involves the activation of an alkene molecule by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an allyl group attached to the metal surface. The π-allyl complex is a crucial intermediate in the polymerization process. However, this complex can undergo deactivation through β-H transfer, where a hydrogen atom is transferred from the allyl group to the catalyst metal, leading to the regeneration of the catalyst but also causing the termination of the polymer chain.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is somewhat different. The catalysts often involve a metathesis reaction, where an alkene undergoes a rearrangement to form a new alkene with a different double bond configuration. This process can also be interrupted by the deactivation mechanism involving β-H transfer. The key difference lies in the nature of the catalyst and the type of reaction, which affects the pathways of deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Frequent deactivation leads to a decrease in catalyst activity and productivity, necessitating more frequent regeneration or replacement of the catalyst. This not only increases operational costs but also impacts the sustainability and efficiency of the industrial processes that rely on these catalysts. Therefore, understanding and optimizing these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for improving catalyst stability and enhancing the economic viability of polymerization and metathesis processes.

在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活中，介链C-H键激活起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的机制有所不同。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程通常始于表面π-二烯基复合物的形成。这涉及到烯烃分子通过催化剂的活化，导致在金属表面上形成二烯基团。π-二烯基复合物是聚合过程中的关键中间体。然而，这个复合物可以通过β-H转移进行失活，其中从二烯基团转移到催化剂金属的一个氢原子，导致催化剂的再生，同时也会终止聚合链。

对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，过程有所不同。催化剂通常涉及裂合反应，其中一个烯烃经历重组形成具有不同双键配置的新烯烃。这个过程也可能被β-H转移的失活机制中断。关键的区别在于催化剂的性质和反应类型，这影响了失活路径。

这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果非常重要。频繁的失活导致催化剂活性和生产力下降，需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂。这不仅增加了运营成本，也影响了依赖这些催化剂的工业过程的可持续性和效率。因此，理解并优化这些失活机制对于提高催化剂稳定性以及增强聚合和裂合过程的经济性至关重要。
