[1] "Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts."
[2] "Specifically, in lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is a key step in the deactivation pathway."
[3] "These complexes are typically formed via β-H transfer from the catalyst to the alkene substrate."
[4] "For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, a similar process involving β-H transfer leads to the formation of surface complexes."
[5] "Both mechanisms ultimately result in the loss of the catalyst's activity and selectivity."
[6] "The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced productivity and increased cost."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes via β-H transfer. This process affects both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, leading to the loss of catalyst activity and selectivity. The consequences of this deactivation pathway are reduced productivity and increased costs due to decreased catalyst performance and longevity.

在抑制共轭烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂活性的内部分子C-H键活化中，关键步骤是通过β-H转移形成π-烯丙基表面复合物。这一过程影响了镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，导致催化剂活性和选择性的丧失。这种失活途径的潜在后果包括生产率降低和成本增加，由于催化剂性能和寿命的下降。
