(1) "The Cu-CH3 bond in that case cleaves at around 470 K (which corresponds to an activation energy of about 29 kcallmol), in one of a family of parallel reactions that also include the conversion of methyl to methane, ethylene, and propylene."
(2) "The fact that this reaction requires a large ensemble of surface atoms, however, is usually slow at saturation coverages; only atmospheric pressures lead to significant exchange in that case."
(3) "Several mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the direct formation of an alkylidene by a-deuterium incorporation, followed by migration of a p hydrogen to the a position (to yield the mono-deuterated alkene), formation of an alkylidene with one deuterium in the ,8 position (by the reverse reaction), and a-elimination to the monodeuterated alkylidyne; (2) the loss of a p hydrogen from the alkylidene to form an a-deuterated vinyl followed by hydrogen incorporation at the p position; (3) the concerted ,+hydride elimination and a-P hydrogen shift in the alkylidene; or (4) the initial alkylidyne-vinyl rearrangement prior to the formation of either alkylidene or alkene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Cu-CH3 bond cleavage reaction typically occurs at 470 K, releasing methyl, ethylene, and propylene in parallel processes. At saturation coverages, this reaction is notably slow unless subjected to atmospheric pressures. Various mechanisms for hydrogen exchange on alkylidene structures have been suggested, including direct formation of an alkylidene through deuterium incorporation, migration of hydrogen, hydride elimination, or rearrangement reactions.

该Cu-CH3键断裂反应通常在470 K时发生，释放出甲基、乙烯和丙烯等平行产物。在饱和覆盖度下，该反应在大气压条件下才显著进行。对于烷基烯烃结构的氢交换，提出了几种机制，包括直接通过氘化形成烷基烯烃、氢迁移、氢解离或重排反应等过程。

(1) "The absolute rates for olefin hydrogenation are much higher at high pressures than under vacuum, but the reaction probabilities per alkene molecule impinging on the surface are not: for ethylene that probability is about 2 x at 300 K under vacuum, but only 4 x at high pressures."
(2) "If the same mechanism is operative in both pressure regimes, therefore, the catalytic reaction must take place on specific bare metal sites amounting to less than 0.001% of the total surface atoms, and such low concentrations of surface sites are difficult to detect with the surfam sensitive equipment available nowadays."
(3) "The production of the single-exchanged ethane is explained by an ethane oxida- tive addition to the surface to produce ethyl moieties on the surface followed by the reductive elimination of that ethyl with surface deuterium."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rates of olefin hydrogenation significantly increase at high pressures compared to vacuum conditions, yet the probability of a reaction per incoming alkene molecule remains unchanged. This suggests the catalytic reaction occurs on very specific bare metal sites, fewer than 0.001% of the total surface atoms, which are hard to identify with current surface-sensitive instruments. The single hydrogen exchange in ethane production is explained by an oxidative addition of ethane to the surface, generating surface ethyl moieties, which then undergo reductive elimination with surface deuterium.

烯烃氢化反应在高压下的绝对速率远高于真空条件，但每分子烯烃撞击表面的反应概率不变：在300 K真空条件下，这一概率约为2倍，但在高压下仅为4倍。这表明催化反应发生在少于总表面原子的0.001%的特定裸露金属位点上，这些位点难以通过当前可用的表面敏感仪器检测到。单个氢交换在乙烷生成中的产生被解释为乙烷的氧化性吸附至表面，产生表面乙基基团，随后通过表面氘代的还原消除。

(1) "The conversion of adsorbed neopentyl groups to isobutene is also difficult to explain in terms of known organometallic processes."
(2) "C-C coupling and methylene and olefin migratory insertion reactions are apparently easier with coordinated ligands than with chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, at least under vacuum."
(3) "These differences can be addressed by elaborating on the initial model for surface bonding discussed above, since several parameters need to be considered in order to fine-tune the description of the hydrocarbon-metal bonding."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The transformation of adsorbed neopentyl groups into isobutene cannot be easily explained by existing organometallic processes. C-C coupling and migrations of methylene and olefins seem to be facilitated more by coordinated ligands than by chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, particularly under vacuum conditions. These discrepancies can be resolved by refining the initial model for surface bonding as outlined earlier, as numerous factors must be taken into account to accurately describe the interaction between hydrocarbons and metals.

吸附的正戊基组转化为异丁烯的转换很难用已知的有机金属过程来解释。C-C耦合和迁移的甲基和烯烃似乎更易于由配位配体促进，而不是在固体表面上的化学吸附碎片，尤其是在真空条件下。这些差异可以通过细化之前讨论的表面结合的初始模型来解决，因为需要考虑多个参数以精确描述碳氢化合物与金属之间的结合。
