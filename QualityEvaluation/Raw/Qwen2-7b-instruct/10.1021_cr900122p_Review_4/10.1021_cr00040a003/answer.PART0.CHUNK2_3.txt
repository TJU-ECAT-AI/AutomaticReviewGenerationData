[1] "Several examples were indeed found for this. In terms of the structure of the adsorbed hydrocarbons,for instance, single a-bond- ed species such as alkyls, alkenyls, aryls, and acetyl- ides, multiple a-bonded moieties such as alkylidenes,alkylidynes, vinylidenes, and metallacycles, and n-bonded molecules such as alkenes, alkynes, dienes,allyls, and arenes, have all been seen both in orga- nometallic complexes and on metal surfaces."
[2] "The most studied dehydrogenation reaction in surface science has been the conversion of cyclohex- ane. This process has been characterized on plati- num,866 ruthenium,867 and tungsten868 single crystals."
[3] "With respect to the idea of ethylidyne acting as a hydrogen transfer agent, this is supported by the fact that ethylidyne is capable of undergoing H-D exchange at the methyl group (at low coverages only under vacuum, but even at saturation under atmospheric pressures)."
[4] "Alkane hydrogenolysis has perhaps been the most studied reaction on single crystals under catalytic conditions."

1. Single a-bonded species like alkyls, alkenyls, aryls, acetylides, and multiple a-bonded moieties like alkylidenes, alkylidynes, vinylidenes, and metallacycles, along with n-bonded molecules such as alkenes, alkynes, dienes, allyls, and arenes, have been observed both in organometallic complexes and on metal surfaces.

2. The conversion of cyclohexane has been extensively studied on platinum, ruthenium, and tungsten single crystals.

3. Ethylidyne has been shown to undergo H-D exchange at the methyl group, supporting its potential role as a hydrogen transfer agent. This exchange occurs at low coverages under vacuum and even at saturation under atmospheric pressures.

4. Alkane hydrogenolysis has been the most extensively studied reaction on single crystal surfaces under catalytic conditions.

1. 单个a键物种如烷基、烯基、芳基、乙酰基以及多个a键物种如烷基烯基、烷基炔基、乙烯基烯基和金属环，与n键分子如烯烃、炔烃、二烯、烯醇和芳烃，在有机金属复合物和金属表面均有观察到。

2. 在铂、钌和钨单晶上，已对环己烷的转化进行了广泛的研究。

3. 证实了乙基烯基在低覆盖度下仅在真空条件下，甚至在饱和状态下在大气压力下也能进行H-D交换。这支持了其作为氢转移剂的可能性。

4. 在单晶表面上，催化条件下的烷烃氢解是研究最多的反应。
