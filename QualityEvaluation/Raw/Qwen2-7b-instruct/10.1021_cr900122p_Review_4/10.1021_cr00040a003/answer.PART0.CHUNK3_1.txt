The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is pivotal. Different mechanisms are observed in catalysts based on lanthanide/actinide and silica-supported Re. The creation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer are fundamental steps in these processes. The potential impacts of these deactivation pathways on catalyst efficiency and durability are substantial.
