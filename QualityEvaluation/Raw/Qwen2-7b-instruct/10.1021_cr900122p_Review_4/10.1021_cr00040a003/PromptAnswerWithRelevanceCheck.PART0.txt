[1] "This structure sensitivity may be related to the need for a reasonably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respectively,3J and each extra hydrogen requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms."
[2] "Since such large ensembles are difficult to emulate with organometallic clusters, it may be difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation typically involves the formation of π-allyl complexes which can undergo β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst. In silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the process might also involve the formation of π-allyl complexes, but the specifics of β-H transfer and the deactivation pathways could differ due to the different support materials and catalyst structures. The key steps include the formation of these complexes, followed by the β-H transfer reactions that lead to the deactivation of the catalysts. These deactivation pathways can have significant consequences on catalyst performance and longevity, potentially reducing the efficiency and lifespan of the catalysts in industrial applications.

The structure sensitivity of these reactions refers to the requirement for a large ensemble of metal atoms to facilitate the reactions. The adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respectively, and each extra hydrogen atom requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms. This large ensemble is challenging to emulate with organometallic clusters, thus making it difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用，涉及到π-邻基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活通常涉及π-邻基复合物的形成，随后发生β-H转移以失活催化剂。对于SiO2支持的Re基催化剂，过程可能也涉及π-邻基复合物的形成，但由于不同的支持材料和催化剂结构，β-H转移和失活途径可能会有所不同。关键步骤包括形成这些复合物，随后发生导致催化剂失活的β-H转移反应。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命具有重大影响，可能降低催化剂在工业应用中的效率和使用寿命。

这些反应的结构敏感性指的是需要一个较大的金属原子簇来促进反应。乙烯和乙炔的吸附需要最少四个表面镍原子和两个镍原子，每个额外的氢原子需要一个空位以及另外三个Ni原子。这个大的簇难以用有机金属簇来模拟，因此很难在均相系统中重现这些表面反应。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms that differ based on the type of catalyst used. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can lead to β-H transfer reactions that deactivate the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway might involve similar mechanisms but with distinct details regarding the interaction of the metal center with the substrate. The key steps in these processes include the initial activation of the C-H bond through the formation of an allyl complex, followed by β-H transfer leading to the formation of a less reactive species. The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, potentially reducing the efficiency and lifespan of the catalysts. The evaluation of these pathways requires detailed understanding of the surface chemistry and the interactions between the metal center, the substrate, and the adsorbed species during the reaction.

[1] "This difference is paralleled by differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction,and therefore may be related to the affinity of the different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 ) or Fe(lOO)lOz surfaces;since normal primary isotope effects can at the most account for a factor of 5,the remaining difference must be due either to tunneling or to secondary effects."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The disparity in reaction thermodynamics mirrors the distinct affinities of various surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Moreover, the deuterium atom elimination from an ethyl group occurs approximately 10 times slower than the normal hydrogen elimination on either Cu(100) or Fe(100) surfaces. Considering normal primary isotope effects can account for at most a factor of 5, the remaining discrepancy is attributed to tunneling or secondary effects.

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the mechanisms specific to lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, which are crucial for the performance and longevity of these catalysts.

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the key steps involve the activation of intramolecular C-H bonds leading to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This process is initiated by the interaction of the catalyst with the alkene substrate, leading to the stabilization of the π-allyl complex. The β-H transfer step then facilitates the deactivation pathway, releasing the product and regenerating the catalyst. This mechanism allows for efficient alkene polymerization, but the stability of the catalyst can be compromised by the deactivation pathways.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the activation of intramolecular C-H bonds plays a significant role in metathesis reactions. The catalyst interacts with the alkene substrate, forming surface complexes that can undergo β-H transfer. This step is essential for the formation of new alkene products through metathesis. However, the repeated activation and deactivation cycles can lead to deactivation pathways that negatively impact the catalyst's performance and longevity. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalytic activity, decreased selectivity, and the formation of byproducts, ultimately affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the catalyst in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.

These mechanisms highlight the importance of understanding the specific pathways involved in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. By elucidating the key steps, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, researchers can optimize catalyst design and development, enhancing the performance and longevity of these catalysts in industrial applications.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These processes typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the activation of the C-H bond results in the formation of a π-allyl complex, which then undergoes β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the intramolecular C-H activation leads to the formation of a π-allyl species, followed by β-H transfer, which ultimately leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can significantly impact the efficiency and yield of polymerization and metathesis reactions, necessitating careful management of reaction conditions to prolong catalyst life.

(1) "The Cu-CH3 bond in that case cleaves at around 470 K (which corresponds to an activation energy of about 29 kcallmol), in one of a family of parallel reactions that also include the conversion of methyl to methane, ethylene, and propylene."
(2) "The fact that this reaction requires a large ensemble of surface atoms, however, is usually slow at saturation coverages; only atmospheric pressures lead to significant exchange in that case."
(3) "Several mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the direct formation of an alkylidene by a-deuterium incorporation, followed by migration of a p hydrogen to the a position (to yield the mono-deuterated alkene), formation of an alkylidene with one deuterium in the ,8 position (by the reverse reaction), and a-elimination to the monodeuterated alkylidyne; (2) the loss of a p hydrogen from the alkylidene to form an a-deuterated vinyl followed by hydrogen incorporation at the p position; (3) the concerted ,+hydride elimination and a-P hydrogen shift in the alkylidene; or (4) the initial alkylidyne-vinyl rearrangement prior to the formation of either alkylidene or alkene."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Cu-CH3 bond cleavage reaction typically occurs at 470 K, releasing methyl, ethylene, and propylene in parallel processes. At saturation coverages, this reaction is notably slow unless subjected to atmospheric pressures. Various mechanisms for hydrogen exchange on alkylidene structures have been suggested, including direct formation of an alkylidene through deuterium incorporation, migration of hydrogen, hydride elimination, or rearrangement reactions.

(1) "The absolute rates for olefin hydrogenation are much higher at high pressures than under vacuum, but the reaction probabilities per alkene molecule impinging on the surface are not: for ethylene that probability is about 2 x at 300 K under vacuum, but only 4 x at high pressures."
(2) "If the same mechanism is operative in both pressure regimes, therefore, the catalytic reaction must take place on specific bare metal sites amounting to less than 0.001% of the total surface atoms, and such low concentrations of surface sites are difficult to detect with the surfam sensitive equipment available nowadays."
(3) "The production of the single-exchanged ethane is explained by an ethane oxida- tive addition to the surface to produce ethyl moieties on the surface followed by the reductive elimination of that ethyl with surface deuterium."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rates of olefin hydrogenation significantly increase at high pressures compared to vacuum conditions, yet the probability of a reaction per incoming alkene molecule remains unchanged. This suggests the catalytic reaction occurs on very specific bare metal sites, fewer than 0.001% of the total surface atoms, which are hard to identify with current surface-sensitive instruments. The single hydrogen exchange in ethane production is explained by an oxidative addition of ethane to the surface, generating surface ethyl moieties, which then undergo reductive elimination with surface deuterium.

烯烃氢化反应在高压下的绝对速率远高于真空条件，但每分子烯烃撞击表面的反应概率不变：在300 K真空条件下，这一概率约为2倍，但在高压下仅为4倍。这表明催化反应发生在少于总表面原子的0.001%的特定裸露金属位点上，这些位点难以通过当前可用的表面敏感仪器检测到。单个氢交换在乙烷生成中的产生被解释为乙烷的氧化性吸附至表面，产生表面乙基基团，随后通过表面氘代的还原消除。

(1) "The conversion of adsorbed neopentyl groups to isobutene is also difficult to explain in terms of known organometallic processes."
(2) "C-C coupling and methylene and olefin migratory insertion reactions are apparently easier with coordinated ligands than with chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, at least under vacuum."
(3) "These differences can be addressed by elaborating on the initial model for surface bonding discussed above, since several parameters need to be considered in order to fine-tune the description of the hydrocarbon-metal bonding."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The transformation of adsorbed neopentyl groups into isobutene cannot be easily explained by existing organometallic processes. C-C coupling and migrations of methylene and olefins seem to be facilitated more by coordinated ligands than by chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, particularly under vacuum conditions. These discrepancies can be resolved by refining the initial model for surface bonding as outlined earlier, as numerous factors must be taken into account to accurately describe the interaction between hydrocarbons and metals.

[1] "The conversion of adsorbed ethylene into ethylidyne species on transition metal surfaces involves multiple steps. Any mechanism that attempts to explain this reaction must include at least two steps in order to account for the changes that occur within the surface moieties."
[2] "Ethylene exchanges its hydrogen atoms simultaneously during the formation of ethylidyne as well."
[3] "The mechanism of this reaction is more complicated than initially thought. For example, a recent STM study has shown that the kinetics for the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(ll1) may depend on the availability of the appropriate ensemble of metal atoms, since the reaction appears to take place preferentially on the boundaries between the islands formed by ethylene and ethylidyne."
[4] "The lack of a significant buildup of any species other than ethylene and ethylidyne during ethylidyne formation argues for a mechanism with an initial slow step or, more likely, for a fast equilibrium between ethylene and a second species."
[5] "Ethylidyne and ethylene are both much more stable than any of the other proposed species, so if such an equilibrium were to be established, the second moiety would have to be present in small concentrations on the surface at all times during the ethylene conversion."
[6] "Given that the rate for ethylidyne formation is independent of the surface coverage of coadsorbed hydrogen, the most likely mechanism for ethylidyne formation is that involving ethylidene."
[7] "Results from kinetic experiments with trideuterioethylene on Pt(ll1) ruled out the simple two-step irreversible sequence via an ethylidene intermediate."
[8] "Studies on the surface chemistry of vinyl iodide argue against the idea of a pathway involving vinyl intermediates as well."
[9] "A third proposal is that ethyl groups may coexist in small concentrations on the surface throughout the course of the reaction, perhaps in equilibrium with the adsorbed ethylene."
[10] "Recent RAIRS experiments have shown that the rate of ethylidyne formation is not affected by the presence of coadsorbed hydrogen on the surface."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves complex mechanisms that differ between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The key steps involve the formation of a π-allyl complex through a C-H activation event, followed by β-H transfer to deactivate the catalyst.

Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit different deactivation pathways. The specific mechanisms are not as well-defined as those for lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, but they typically involve the formation of surface complexes that can undergo β-H transfer or other reactions leading to catalyst deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include decreased activity and selectivity over time, which can significantly impact industrial processes relying on these catalysts. The stability and longevity of the catalysts can be improved by optimizing synthesis conditions, modifying the support material, or incorporating additives that inhibit deactivation pathways.

The complexity of these deactivation mechanisms underscores the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the specific interactions between the catalyst, support, and reaction substrates to enhance catalyst performance and extend their useful life.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically starts with the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This involves the activation of an alkene molecule by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an allyl group attached to the metal surface. The π-allyl complex is a crucial intermediate in the polymerization process. However, this complex can undergo deactivation through β-H transfer, where a hydrogen atom is transferred from the allyl group to the catalyst metal, leading to the regeneration of the catalyst but also causing the termination of the polymer chain.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is somewhat different. The catalysts often involve a metathesis reaction, where an alkene undergoes a rearrangement to form a new alkene with a different double bond configuration. This process can also be interrupted by the deactivation mechanism involving β-H transfer. The key difference lies in the nature of the catalyst and the type of reaction, which affects the pathways of deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Frequent deactivation leads to a decrease in catalyst activity and productivity, necessitating more frequent regeneration or replacement of the catalyst. This not only increases operational costs but also impacts the sustainability and efficiency of the industrial processes that rely on these catalysts. Therefore, understanding and optimizing these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for improving catalyst stability and enhancing the economic viability of polymerization and metathesis processes.

在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活中，介链C-H键激活起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的机制有所不同。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程通常始于表面π-二烯基复合物的形成。这涉及到烯烃分子通过催化剂的活化，导致在金属表面上形成二烯基团。π-二烯基复合物是聚合过程中的关键中间体。然而，这个复合物可以通过β-H转移进行失活，其中从二烯基团转移到催化剂金属的一个氢原子，导致催化剂的再生，同时也会终止聚合链。

对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，过程有所不同。催化剂通常涉及裂合反应，其中一个烯烃经历重组形成具有不同双键配置的新烯烃。这个过程也可能被β-H转移的失活机制中断。关键的区别在于催化剂的性质和反应类型，这影响了失活路径。

这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果非常重要。频繁的失活导致催化剂活性和生产力下降，需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂。这不仅增加了运营成本，也影响了依赖这些催化剂的工业过程的可持续性和效率。因此，理解并优化这些失活机制对于提高催化剂稳定性以及增强聚合和裂合过程的经济性至关重要。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This occurs when the allyl group from the alkene substrate is activated and inserted into the catalyst metal center, forming a π-allyl complex. Subsequent β-H transfer from the catalyst metal center to the allyl group results in the cleavage of the alkene double bond and the formation of a new alkene or olefin.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism involves similar steps but with a different catalyst metal. The allyl group from the alkene substrate is activated and inserted into the Re center, forming a π-allyl complex. Then, β-H transfer from the Re center to the allyl group occurs, leading to the cleavage of the alkene double bond and the formation of a new alkene or olefin.

The key steps in these processes are:
1. Activation of the allyl group from the alkene substrate by the catalyst metal center.
2. Insertion of the activated allyl group into the catalyst metal center, forming a π-allyl complex.
3. β-H transfer from the catalyst metal center to the allyl group, resulting in the cleavage of the alkene double bond.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. Frequent β-H transfer events can lead to the gradual loss of catalyst activity as the number of active sites decreases. Additionally, the formation of inactive byproducts can reduce the overall yield of desired products. Therefore, understanding and controlling these deactivation pathways is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and longevity in industrial alkene polymerization and metathesis processes.

1. 催化剂金属中心对烯烃基质中的烯丙基的激活。
2. 烯烃基质中的烯丙基插入到催化剂金属中心，形成π-烯丙基复合物。
