(334) "Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms that differ based on the type of catalyst used. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can lead to β-H transfer reactions that deactivate the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway might involve similar mechanisms but with distinct details regarding the interaction of the metal center with the substrate. The key steps in these processes include the initial activation of the C-H bond through the formation of an allyl complex, followed by β-H transfer leading to the formation of a less reactive species. The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, potentially reducing the efficiency and lifespan of the catalysts. The evaluation of these pathways requires detailed understanding of the surface chemistry and the interactions between the metal center, the substrate, and the adsorbed species during the reaction.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移反应催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。不同类型的催化剂（如镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂）涉及不同的具体机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，通常失活通过形成π-亚甲基表面复合物进行，这可能导致β-H转移反应，从而导致催化剂失活。对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，失活路径可能类似但涉及与底物相互作用的金属中心的特定细节。这些过程的关键步骤包括初始激活C-H键形成亚甲基复合物，随后进行β-H转移导致形成较不活泼的物种。这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的，可能降低催化剂的效率和寿命。评估这些路径需要详细了解表面化学和金属中心、底物以及吸附物种之间的相互作用。
