[1] "The details of the mechanism for β-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups."
[2] "The selective desorption of CH3- CD=CHz from the 2,2-dideuteriopropyl group that forms in this case indicates that β-H eliminations reactions are highly preferred over α- or γ-H eliminations (which would produce either Do or Dz-propenes)."
[3] "p-Hydride elimination is in fact one of the most common reactions followed by alkyl groups on metal surfaces."

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.
