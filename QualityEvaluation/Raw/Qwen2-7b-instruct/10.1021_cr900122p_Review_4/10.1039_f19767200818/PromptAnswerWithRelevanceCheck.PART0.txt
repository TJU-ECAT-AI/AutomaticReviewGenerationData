[1] "The rate and activation energy of exchange for benzene with D2 found in this work are very close to those reported by Saunders and Hightwer."
[2] "Like them we find that our catalyst is about 100 times more active than that used by McCosh and Kemball."
[3] "However, we confirm the observations of the latter workers concerning the relative rates of replacement of the ring and side group hydrogens in toluene."
[4] "The higher exchange rate of the ring atoms is in contrast to the situation found for the reactions of alkylbenzenes on metals."
[5] "On these catalysts the side group positions are more reactive and this is consistent with the view that radical intermediates are involved since the carbon-hydrogen bonds of the side groups are substantially weaker than those in the ring."
[6] "The participation of carbonium ions also seems unlikely."
[7] "An associative mechanism involving the attack of a Df ion would require the presence of sites having considerable Bransted acidity ; such sites are not typically found on y-alumina."
[8] "Moreover the isotope effects observed by Saunders and Hightower support a dissociative mechanism for the exchange of ring hydrogens."
[9] "The agreement between this and the observed value of 3.3 x 1015 molecules s-l m-2 is very close and provides some evidence for the participation of intermediates with carban- ionic character in the exchange of ring hydrogens."
[10] "The Hf is likely to be adsorbed at an adjacent oxide ion where exchange with deuterium can occur to produce a surface D+ species which acts as the reactive form of the labelling isotope."
[11] "Although the reactivity of ring hydrogens may be explained in terms of acidity this approach cannot be applied to the side-group positions."
[12] "The methyl hydrogens of toluene are about 100 times more acidic than those in benzene."
[13] "This is a remarkable result in view of the wide applicability of the acidity-reactivity relationship which has been demonstrated."
[14] "The high acidity associated with the methyl hydrogens of toluene is attributable to the considerable stabilization of the benzyl carbanion afforded by the delocalization of the negative charge on the a-carbon atom through the n-system of the ring."
[15] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[16] "However, a degree of n-bonding appears to be responsible for the poisoning effect of benzene on the H2-D2 equilibration reaction on alumina and so cannot be ruled out comp1etel;i."
[17] "The low activity of the methyl hydrogens might be due to steric rather than electronic effects."
[18] "It may b ::that the arrangement of surface sites on y-alumina is such that the ring hydrogens are preferentially dissociated and more readily exchanged."
[19] "The lack of correlation between the relative exchmge activity of different hydrogen atoms in the same molecule and acidity has been observed in one other case on alumina."
[20] "The slightly lower activity for exchange displayed by toluene with deuterium in comparison with benzene is attributed to the inductive effect of the methyl group in the former molecule, which tends to destabilize the carbanion formed by loss of H+ from the ring."
[21] "The increase in the rate of exchange of ring hydrogens in toluene when heavy benzene was used instead of deuterium is an effect similar to that reported by Saunders and Hightower for benzene exchange."
[22] "The absence of ortho-para directing effects of the methyl group on the exchange of the ring atoms of toluene may be due to the incompleteness of the n-system as originally proposed by McCosh and Kemball."
[23] "The rate of redistribution o f deuterium in C6H5.CD3 is sufficiently high to indicate that the slow exchange of the methyl hydrogens of toluene with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene probably occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more readily replaced ring positions."
[24] "The existence of such intermolecular exchange can explain the absence of any differentiation between the rates of ring and side-group exchange for the reaction of toluene with deuterium."

The study elucidates several key aspects of deactivation pathways for supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. It focuses on the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation process, particularly contrasting mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The analysis highlights the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer as pivotal steps. These processes are elucidated through the examination of toluene and benzene exchanges with deuterium on alumina and magnesium oxide, revealing insights into the mechanisms behind the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The findings underscore the complex interplay between catalyst structure, substrate specificity, and reaction kinetics in determining catalyst performance and longevity.

The research confirms that the exchange rates for ring and side group hydrogens in toluene differ significantly, with ring hydrogens being more reactive than side group hydrogens. This contrasts with alkylbenzene reactions on metals, where side group positions are generally more reactive. The study also suggests that radical-like intermediates are not involved in the exchange reactions on alumina, further supporting a dissociative mechanism for the exchange of ring hydrogens. It identifies the participation of carbanionic intermediates in the exchange process, implicating a heterolytic dissociation of a ring C-H bond as the rate-determining step.

The high acidity of the methyl hydrogens in toluene is attributed to stabilization of the benzyl carbanion through the delocalization of the negative charge across the ring. However, the close agreement between observed and predicted exchange rates for benzene indicates that the n-system is not drastically distorted on the catalyst surface. The study further discusses the role of n-bonding in poisoning effects of benzene on the H2-D2 equilibration reaction, suggesting that while steric effects might contribute to the low reactivity of methyl hydrogens, electronic effects through n-interaction are also involved in the poisoning mechanism. 

The research demonstrates that intermolecular exchange processes play a crucial role in the deactivation of catalysts, explaining the absence of differentiation between ring and side-group exchange rates in toluene reactions. This insight into the mechanisms of deactivation pathways offers valuable guidance for optimizing catalyst design and improving the longevity of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

研究揭示了支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效路径中的几个关键方面，特别是对比了镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的机制。分析集中在内部C-H键活化在失效过程中的作用，特别是在镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂中的作用。研究强调了π-邻位表面复合物的形成和β-H转移作为关键步骤。通过研究苯和甲苯与重氢在氧化铝和镁氧化物上的交换，该研究提供了理解支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效机制的见解。

研究确认了甲苯中环氢和侧链氢的交换率存在显著差异，环氢比侧链氢更活跃。这与金属上烷基苯的反应情况形成对比，在这些情况下，侧链位置通常更为活跃。研究进一步表明，在氧化铝上，参与交换反应的中间体不包含自由基，而是支持一个脱质子化的碳正离子机制。研究还指出，苯的交换过程中的高酸性是由于环内负电荷的局部化稳定了苯基碳正离子。

研究将甲苯中甲基氢的高酸性归因于通过环系统中环的电子离域对苯基碳正离子的显著稳定。然而，根据观察到的交换速率与预测值之间的高度一致性，研究指出n系统实际上并未经历剧烈的电子畸变。研究进一步讨论了苯在氧化铝上的中毒效应中n相互作用的作用，表明虽然立体效应可能影响甲基氢的活性，但电子效应也参与了中毒机制。

研究发现，介分子交换过程在催化剂失效中起着关键作用，解释了甲苯反应中环和侧链交换率之间缺乏区别的现象。这一关于失效途径机制的见解为优化催化剂设计和提高支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂寿命提供了有价值的指导。

The study investigates hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of various hydrocarbons on alumina and magnesium oxide. The researchers aim to extend the understanding of hydrocarbon exchange kinetics to aromatic compounds, specifically looking at whether the linear relationship between hydrocarbon acidity and exchange ease observed in alkanes and alkenes applies to aromatic molecules. The exchange reactions on magnesium oxide are found to involve intermediates with carbanionic characteristics akin to those seen on alumina. The exchange rate of toluene with deuterated benzene (C6D6) is notably faster than with pure deuterium, suggesting that adsorption-desorption processes for deuterium are hindered in the presence of aromatic molecules, affecting the exchange rates on both catalysts. The close match between the observed exchange rate of benzene and that predicted by its hydrogen acidity indicates that the n-system's electronic structure is not drastically altered during the exchange process.

该研究探讨了苯和烷基苯在氧化铝和镁氧化物上的氢氘交换反应。研究者旨在将烃酸性和交换容易性之间的线性关系从烷烃和烯烃扩展到芳香化合物，观察这种关系是否适用于芳香分子。镁氧化物上的交换反应涉及与铝氧化物相似的具有碳负离子特性的中间体。二甲苯与氘化苯（C6D6）的交换速率明显快于纯氘，这表明在芳香分子存在的情况下，氘的吸附-脱附过程受到阻碍，影响两种氧化物上的交换速率。观察到的苯的交换速率与其氢酸性预测的速率非常接近，表明在交换过程中n系统的电子结构并没有发生大幅度改变。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is analyzed in the context of supported Re-based and lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts. The key steps in these processes involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are evaluated.

For Re-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes leads to the activation of C-H bonds, which facilitates the β-H transfer reaction. This process deactivates the catalyst by altering its active site structure and reducing its efficiency in polymerization and metathesis reactions.

In the case of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves a similar mechanism, where the catalyst's active site undergoes structural changes due to the activation of C-H bonds. These changes affect the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions, leading to a decrease in its performance and longevity.

The analysis reveals that both types of catalysts are susceptible to deactivation through intramolecular C-H bond activation. The specific mechanisms and consequences of deactivation differ between Re-based and lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, influenced by factors such as the catalyst's composition, structure, and the chemical environment.

The findings highlight the importance of understanding the deactivation pathways in supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. This knowledge can guide the development of more robust and efficient catalysts with improved stability and longevity. By optimizing catalyst design and synthesis, researchers can mitigate the effects of C-H bond activation and enhance the overall performance of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键激活的作用进行了分析。在支持型铼基催化剂和镧系/锕系基催化剂的背景下，这些过程的关键步骤涉及π-邻基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移反应。评估了这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。

对于铼基催化剂，π-邻基表面复合物的形成导致C-H键的激活，从而促进β-H转移反应。这一过程通过改变催化剂活性位点结构并降低其在聚合和偶联反应中的效率，使催化剂失活。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂而言，失活途径也涉及类似机制，催化剂的活性位点由于C-H键的激活而发生结构变化，影响了其促进所需化学反应的能力，导致其性能和寿命下降。

分析显示，两种类型的催化剂都容易因内部C-H键激活而失活。Re基催化剂和镧系/锕系基催化剂的具体机制和失活后果有所不同，这受到催化剂组成、结构和化学环境等因素的影响。

此分析强调了理解支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂失活路径的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更坚固、更高效的催化剂，并提高其稳定性。通过优化催化剂设计和合成，研究人员可以减少C-H键激活的影响，增强支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的整体性能。
