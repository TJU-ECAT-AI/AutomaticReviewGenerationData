[1] "Intramolecular redistribution of deuterium in [a-2H3]-toluene and [aa-ZH6]-p-xylene has also been followed."
[2] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[3] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[4] "The rate of redistribution of deuterium in C6H5.CD3 is sufficiently high to indicate that the slow exchange of the methyl hydrogens of toluene with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene probably occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more readily replaced ring positions."
[5] "Magnesium oxide appears to be an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons."
[6] "There seems to be some parallel between magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide (rutile) for reactions of propene and toluene, although titanium dioxide is a much less active catalyst."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is analyzed in the context of supported Re-based and lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts. The key steps in these processes involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are evaluated.

For Re-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes leads to the activation of C-H bonds, which facilitates the β-H transfer reaction. This process deactivates the catalyst by altering its active site structure and reducing its efficiency in polymerization and metathesis reactions.

In the case of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves a similar mechanism, where the catalyst's active site undergoes structural changes due to the activation of C-H bonds. These changes affect the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions, leading to a decrease in its performance and longevity.

The analysis reveals that both types of catalysts are susceptible to deactivation through intramolecular C-H bond activation. The specific mechanisms and consequences of deactivation differ between Re-based and lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, influenced by factors such as the catalyst's composition, structure, and the chemical environment.

The findings highlight the importance of understanding the deactivation pathways in supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. This knowledge can guide the development of more robust and efficient catalysts with improved stability and longevity. By optimizing catalyst design and synthesis, researchers can mitigate the effects of C-H bond activation and enhance the overall performance of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键激活的作用进行了分析。在支持型铼基催化剂和镧系/锕系基催化剂的背景下，这些过程的关键步骤涉及π-邻基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移反应。评估了这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。

对于铼基催化剂，π-邻基表面复合物的形成导致C-H键的激活，从而促进β-H转移反应。这一过程通过改变催化剂活性位点结构并降低其在聚合和偶联反应中的效率，使催化剂失活。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂而言，失活途径也涉及类似机制，催化剂的活性位点由于C-H键的激活而发生结构变化，影响了其促进所需化学反应的能力，导致其性能和寿命下降。

分析显示，两种类型的催化剂都容易因内部C-H键激活而失活。Re基催化剂和镧系/锕系基催化剂的具体机制和失活后果有所不同，这受到催化剂组成、结构和化学环境等因素的影响。

此分析强调了理解支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂失活路径的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更坚固、更高效的催化剂，并提高其稳定性。通过优化催化剂设计和合成，研究人员可以减少C-H键激活的影响，增强支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的整体性能。
