[1] "The rate and activation energy of exchange for benzene with D2 found in this work are very close to those reported by Saunders and Hightwer."
[2] "Like them we find that our catalyst is about 100 times more active than that used by McCosh and Kemball."
[3] "However, we confirm the observations of the latter workers concerning the relative rates of replacement of the ring and side group hydrogens in toluene."
[4] "The higher exchange rate of the ring atoms is in contrast to the situation found for the reactions of alkylbenzenes on metals."
[5] "On these catalysts the side group positions are more reactive and this is consistent with the view that radical intermediates are involved since the carbon-hydrogen bonds of the side groups are substantially weaker than those in the ring."
[6] "The participation of carbonium ions also seems unlikely."
[7] "An associative mechanism involving the attack of a Df ion would require the presence of sites having considerable Bransted acidity ; such sites are not typically found on y-alumina."
[8] "Moreover the isotope effects observed by Saunders and Hightower support a dissociative mechanism for the exchange of ring hydrogens."
[9] "The agreement between this and the observed value of 3.3 x 1015 molecules s-l m-2 is very close and provides some evidence for the participation of intermediates with carban- ionic character in the exchange of ring hydrogens."
[10] "The Hf is likely to be adsorbed at an adjacent oxide ion where exchange with deuterium can occur to produce a surface D+ species which acts as the reactive form of the labelling isotope."
[11] "Although the reactivity of ring hydrogens may be explained in terms of acidity this approach cannot be applied to the side-group positions."
[12] "The methyl hydrogens of toluene are about 100 times more acidic than those in benzene."
[13] "This is a remarkable result in view of the wide applicability of the acidity-reactivity relationship which has been demonstrated."
[14] "The high acidity associated with the methyl hydrogens of toluene is attributable to the considerable stabilization of the benzyl carbanion afforded by the delocalization of the negative charge on the a-carbon atom through the n-system of the ring."
[15] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[16] "However, a degree of n-bonding appears to be responsible for the poisoning effect of benzene on the H2-D2 equilibration reaction on alumina and so cannot be ruled out comp1etel;i."
[17] "The low activity of the methyl hydrogens might be due to steric rather than electronic effects."
[18] "It may b ::that the arrangement of surface sites on y-alumina is such that the ring hydrogens are preferentially dissociated and more readily exchanged."
[19] "The lack of correlation between the relative exchmge activity of different hydrogen atoms in the same molecule and acidity has been observed in one other case on alumina."
[20] "The slightly lower activity for exchange displayed by toluene with deuterium in comparison with benzene is attributed to the inductive effect of the methyl group in the former molecule, which tends to destabilize the carbanion formed by loss of H+ from the ring."
[21] "The increase in the rate of exchange of ring hydrogens in toluene when heavy benzene was used instead of deuterium is an effect similar to that reported by Saunders and Hightower for benzene exchange."
[22] "The absence of ortho-para directing effects of the methyl group on the exchange of the ring atoms of toluene may be due to the incompleteness of the n-system as originally proposed by McCosh and Kemball."
[23] "The rate of redistribution o f deuterium in C6H5.CD3 is sufficiently high to indicate that the slow exchange of the methyl hydrogens of toluene with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene probably occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more readily replaced ring positions."
[24] "The existence of such intermolecular exchange can explain the absence of any differentiation between the rates of ring and side-group exchange for the reaction of toluene with deuterium."

The study elucidates several key aspects of deactivation pathways for supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. It focuses on the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation process, particularly contrasting mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The analysis highlights the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer as pivotal steps. These processes are elucidated through the examination of toluene and benzene exchanges with deuterium on alumina and magnesium oxide, revealing insights into the mechanisms behind the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The findings underscore the complex interplay between catalyst structure, substrate specificity, and reaction kinetics in determining catalyst performance and longevity.

The research confirms that the exchange rates for ring and side group hydrogens in toluene differ significantly, with ring hydrogens being more reactive than side group hydrogens. This contrasts with alkylbenzene reactions on metals, where side group positions are generally more reactive. The study also suggests that radical-like intermediates are not involved in the exchange reactions on alumina, further supporting a dissociative mechanism for the exchange of ring hydrogens. It identifies the participation of carbanionic intermediates in the exchange process, implicating a heterolytic dissociation of a ring C-H bond as the rate-determining step.

The high acidity of the methyl hydrogens in toluene is attributed to stabilization of the benzyl carbanion through the delocalization of the negative charge across the ring. However, the close agreement between observed and predicted exchange rates for benzene indicates that the n-system is not drastically distorted on the catalyst surface. The study further discusses the role of n-bonding in poisoning effects of benzene on the H2-D2 equilibration reaction, suggesting that while steric effects might contribute to the low reactivity of methyl hydrogens, electronic effects through n-interaction are also involved in the poisoning mechanism. 

The research demonstrates that intermolecular exchange processes play a crucial role in the deactivation of catalysts, explaining the absence of differentiation between ring and side-group exchange rates in toluene reactions. This insight into the mechanisms of deactivation pathways offers valuable guidance for optimizing catalyst design and improving the longevity of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

研究揭示了支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效路径中的几个关键方面，特别是对比了镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的机制。分析集中在内部C-H键活化在失效过程中的作用，特别是在镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂中的作用。研究强调了π-邻位表面复合物的形成和β-H转移作为关键步骤。通过研究苯和甲苯与重氢在氧化铝和镁氧化物上的交换，该研究提供了理解支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效机制的见解。

研究确认了甲苯中环氢和侧链氢的交换率存在显著差异，环氢比侧链氢更活跃。这与金属上烷基苯的反应情况形成对比，在这些情况下，侧链位置通常更为活跃。研究进一步表明，在氧化铝上，参与交换反应的中间体不包含自由基，而是支持一个脱质子化的碳正离子机制。研究还指出，苯的交换过程中的高酸性是由于环内负电荷的局部化稳定了苯基碳正离子。

研究将甲苯中甲基氢的高酸性归因于通过环系统中环的电子离域对苯基碳正离子的显著稳定。然而，根据观察到的交换速率与预测值之间的高度一致性，研究指出n系统实际上并未经历剧烈的电子畸变。研究进一步讨论了苯在氧化铝上的中毒效应中n相互作用的作用，表明虽然立体效应可能影响甲基氢的活性，但电子效应也参与了中毒机制。

研究发现，介分子交换过程在催化剂失效中起着关键作用，解释了甲苯反应中环和侧链交换率之间缺乏区别的现象。这一关于失效途径机制的见解为优化催化剂设计和提高支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂寿命提供了有价值的指导。
