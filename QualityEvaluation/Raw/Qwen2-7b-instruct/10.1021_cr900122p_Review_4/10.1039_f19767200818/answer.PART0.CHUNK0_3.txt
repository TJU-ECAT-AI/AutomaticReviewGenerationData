[1] "Some hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide have been investigated."
[2] "The results are discussed and probable mechanisms for the reactions proposed."
[3] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[4] "The investigations were carried out using three types of experiments : (a) ordinary exchange of light hydrocarbon with deuterium as D2, (b) cross exchange which involved the reaction between a light hydrocarbon and a labelled reactant (in this case [2H6]-benzene) and (c) redistribution reactions in which the scrambling of deuterium initially located in the side groups of selectively labelled alkylbenzenes was followed."
[5] "For those reactions in which a single hydrocarbon underwent exchange the apparatus used was essentially that described before."
[6] "The rate of exchange of the group A hydrogens was higher by a factor of about 5 at 293 K when ['H6]-benzene was used instead of Dz,"
[7] "In contrast to the behaviour of alumina, steady poisoning of magnesium oxide was apparent during some experi- ments, and was particularly severe at temperatures above 350 K."
[8] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[9] "The exchange of alkanes and cycloalkanes with D2 on y-alumina has shown that the ease of replacement of a given hydrogen atom is governed by its acidity."

The study investigates hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide. The researchers discuss the probable mechanisms for these reactions and conduct experiments using three types of setups: ordinary exchange, cross exchange, and redistribution reactions. For single hydrocarbon exchanges, they use a setup similar to previous studies. The rate of exchange for group A hydrogens increases by a factor of about 5 when using ['H6]-benzene instead of Dz. Magnesium oxide shows steady poisoning at temperatures above 350 K, unlike alumina. The close agreement between observed and predicted exchange rates suggests that electronic distortion of the n-system does not occur. The ease of hydrogen replacement in alkanes and cycloalkanes on y-alumina is governed by their acidity.

研究了苯和烷基苯在y-氧化铝和镁氧化物上的氢氘交换反应。研究者讨论了这些反应的可能机制，并使用三种实验设置：普通交换、交叉交换和重新分配反应。对于单个烃的交换，他们使用与先前研究相似的设置。当使用['H6]-苯而不是Dz时，组A氢的交换速率增加约5倍。镁氧化物在高于350K的温度下表现出持续的中毒现象，这与氧化铝不同。与预测的交换率之间的密切一致性表明，n系统的电子畸变实际上并未发生。烷烃和环烷烃在y-氧化铝上的置换能力由它们的酸性决定。
