[1] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[2] "Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive."
[3] "Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid."
[4] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."

<p>The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert.</p>
<p>This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins,these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle. But in practice, these approaches may be primarily applicable to the small-scale production of specialized chemicals, given that large-scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources seem to be problematic1.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygensuch as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its renaissance began in the late 1950s. Practitioners of this art are thus well placed to address the alkane activation problem.</p>

The literature discusses the challenges and methods for activating inert C-H bonds in alkanes, which are crucial for efficient alkane conversion and utilization. It explains why alkanes are chemically inert and how they can be made reactive under certain conditions, particularly through transition metal complexes. The text also touches on the difficulties in achieving selective transformations, leading to the reliance on unsaturated hydrocarbons for producing important petrochemicals. It suggests that transition metal chemistry holds promise for addressing the alkane activation problem due to its history of activating small, inert molecules.

The main challenge in converting alkanes to more valuable products lies in their chemical inertness. Alkanes, due to their strong and localized CC and CH bonds, lack the necessary chemical reactivity to participate in reactions easily. This inertness makes it difficult to achieve selective transformations under controlled conditions. High-temperature reactions, such as those used in combustion, are not controllable and typically result in the formation of stable but economically unattractive products like carbon dioxide and water. The conversion of alkanes into more valuable chemicals is further complicated by the high costs associated with transporting gas and converting hydrocarbon gas into liquid fuels or chemicals. Developing efficient methods for direct conversion of methane, the main component of natural gas, into methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could significantly enhance the utilization of methane resources.

烷烃的主要挑战在于它们的化学惰性。由于烷烃中CC和CH键之间的强大且局部化连接，它们缺乏参与反应所需的化学活性。这种惰性使得在可控条件下实现选择性转化变得困难。高温反应，如燃烧中所遇到的，不易控制，通常导致形成稳定但经济上不吸引人的产品，如二氧化碳和水。将烷烃转化为更有价值的化学品进一步受到运输气体和将碳氢化合物气体转化为可运输液体燃料或化学品的高成本的阻碍。开发高效的直接甲烷转换方法为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学品，可以显著提高甲烷资源的利用效率。

<p>Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products. The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water. The currently prevalent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals. Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygens such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons. The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes. Milder and better-controlled direct conversions of alkanes into olefins may thus offer large economic benefits. Alkane chemistry could also improve the utilization of methane, the principal component of natural gas. Many of the world's established natural gas resource locations are remote, in sites where there is little or no local demand, such as the north slope of Alaska. Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid4. The available conversion methods are indirect, involving production of synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), followed by conversion to the desired product. Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization.</p>

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the mechanism typically involves the formation of a π-allyl complex on the surface, which can lead to deactivation through β-H transfer. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the β-H transfer process plays a crucial role in catalyst deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, decreased selectivity, and shortened operational life of the catalysts.

The literature discusses the challenges in directly converting alkanes into more valuable products due to their chemical inertness. High temperatures enable reactions, but they are often uncontrollable and lead to thermodynamically stable but economically unattractive products like carbon dioxide and water. Processes like cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to olefins but require high temperatures and are energy-intensive. Inducing reactions with highly reactive species, such as superacids or free radicals, is demanding and expensive, with limited control over product selectivity. As a result, most petrochemicals, including oxygenates like alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids, are derived from unsaturated hydrocarbons rather than alkanes due to the difficulties in achieving selective transformations under suitable conditions.

文献讨论了将烷烃直接转化为更有价值产品的挑战，由于它们的化学惰性。高温可以引发反应，但往往难以控制，并导致热力学上稳定但经济上不吸引人的产物，如二氧化碳和水。裂解和热脱氢化等过程将烷烃转化为烯烃，但需要高温并且能源消耗高。通过使用超级酸或自由基等高度活性物种诱导反应是具有挑战性的，并且成本昂贵，对产品选择性控制有限。因此，大多数石油化工产品，包括醇、醛和羧酸等氧代物，是从不饱和烃而不是烷烃中获得的，这是因为在合适条件下实现选择性转化的困难。
