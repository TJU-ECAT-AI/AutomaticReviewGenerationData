<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>The currently prevalent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals.</p>
<p>Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>

The literature discusses the challenges in directly converting alkanes into more valuable products due to their chemical inertness. High temperatures enable reactions, but they are often uncontrollable and lead to thermodynamically stable but economically unattractive products like carbon dioxide and water. Processes like cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to olefins but require high temperatures and are energy-intensive. Inducing reactions with highly reactive species, such as superacids or free radicals, is demanding and expensive, with limited control over product selectivity. As a result, most petrochemicals, including oxygenates like alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids, are derived from unsaturated hydrocarbons rather than alkanes due to the difficulties in achieving selective transformations under suitable conditions.

文献讨论了将烷烃直接转化为更有价值产品的挑战，由于它们的化学惰性。高温可以引发反应，但往往难以控制，并导致热力学上稳定但经济上不吸引人的产物，如二氧化碳和水。裂解和热脱氢化等过程将烷烃转化为烯烃，但需要高温并且能源消耗高。通过使用超级酸或自由基等高度活性物种诱导反应是具有挑战性的，并且成本昂贵，对产品选择性控制有限。因此，大多数石油化工产品，包括醇、醛和羧酸等氧代物，是从不饱和烃而不是烷烃中获得的，这是因为在合适条件下实现选择性转化的困难。
