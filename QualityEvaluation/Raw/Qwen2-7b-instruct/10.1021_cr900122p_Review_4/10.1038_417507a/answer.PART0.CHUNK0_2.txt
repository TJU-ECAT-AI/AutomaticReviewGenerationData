[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid4."
[4] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."

The main challenge in converting alkanes to more valuable products lies in their chemical inertness. Alkanes, due to their strong and localized CC and CH bonds, lack the necessary chemical reactivity to participate in reactions easily. This inertness makes it difficult to achieve selective transformations under controlled conditions. High-temperature reactions, such as those used in combustion, are not controllable and typically result in the formation of stable but economically unattractive products like carbon dioxide and water. The conversion of alkanes into more valuable chemicals is further complicated by the high costs associated with transporting gas and converting hydrocarbon gas into liquid fuels or chemicals. Developing efficient methods for direct conversion of methane, the main component of natural gas, into methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could significantly enhance the utilization of methane resources.

烷烃的主要挑战在于它们的化学惰性。由于烷烃中CC和CH键之间的强大且局部化连接，它们缺乏参与反应所需的化学活性。这种惰性使得在可控条件下实现选择性转化变得困难。高温反应，如燃烧中所遇到的，不易控制，通常导致形成稳定但经济上不吸引人的产品，如二氧化碳和水。将烷烃转化为更有价值的化学品进一步受到运输气体和将碳氢化合物气体转化为可运输液体燃料或化学品的高成本的阻碍。开发高效的直接甲烷转换方法为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学品，可以显著提高甲烷资源的利用效率。
