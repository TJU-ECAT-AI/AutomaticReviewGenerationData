<p>The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert.</p>
<p>This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins,these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle. But in practice, these approaches may be primarily applicable to the small-scale production of specialized chemicals, given that large-scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources seem to be problematic1.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygensuch as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its renaissance began in the late 1950s. Practitioners of this art are thus well placed to address the alkane activation problem.</p>

The literature discusses the challenges and methods for activating inert C-H bonds in alkanes, which are crucial for efficient alkane conversion and utilization. It explains why alkanes are chemically inert and how they can be made reactive under certain conditions, particularly through transition metal complexes. The text also touches on the difficulties in achieving selective transformations, leading to the reliance on unsaturated hydrocarbons for producing important petrochemicals. It suggests that transition metal chemistry holds promise for addressing the alkane activation problem due to its history of activating small, inert molecules.

文献讨论了激活烷烃中惰性C-H键的方法及其对高效烷烃转化和利用的重要性。它解释了为什么烷烃在化学上是惰性的，并在特定条件下如何通过过渡金属复合物使其反应。文本还提到了难以实现选择性转换的困难，这导致依赖不饱和烃生产重要的石油化学品。它建议，过渡金属化学有可能解决烷烃激活问题，因为它有历史记录，可以激活一些小且惰性的分子。
