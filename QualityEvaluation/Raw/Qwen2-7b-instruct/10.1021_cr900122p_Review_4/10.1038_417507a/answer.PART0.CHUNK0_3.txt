<p>Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products. The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water. The currently prevalent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals. Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygens such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons. The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes. Milder and better-controlled direct conversions of alkanes into olefins may thus offer large economic benefits. Alkane chemistry could also improve the utilization of methane, the principal component of natural gas. Many of the world's established natural gas resource locations are remote, in sites where there is little or no local demand, such as the north slope of Alaska. Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid4. The available conversion methods are indirect, involving production of synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), followed by conversion to the desired product. Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization.</p>

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the mechanism typically involves the formation of a π-allyl complex on the surface, which can lead to deactivation through β-H transfer. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the β-H transfer process plays a crucial role in catalyst deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, decreased selectivity, and shortened operational life of the catalysts.

在支撑烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活过程中，内分子C-H键活化起着关键作用，涉及π-邻二烯基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，机制通常涉及表面形成π-邻二烯基复合物，这可能导致通过β-H转移导致催化剂失活。对于硅支持的Re基催化剂，β-H转移过程在催化剂失活中扮演着重要角色。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能包括活性降低、选择性下降和催化剂使用寿命缩短。
