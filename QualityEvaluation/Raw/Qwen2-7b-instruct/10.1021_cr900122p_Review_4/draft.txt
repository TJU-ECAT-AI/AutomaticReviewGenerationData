1. Mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with emphasis on lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1\], \[10.1081/cr-100101952\], and \[10.1086/450238\]. Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a pivotal role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with distinct mechanisms observed in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalyst systems. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can undergo β-H transfer reactions leading to catalyst destabilization. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts may follow a similar path but through different surface complex formations and β-H transfer pathways due to the inherent properties of Re-based catalysts. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shortened longevity, impacting the yield of desired products, increasing production costs, and posing environmental challenges necessitating more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there exists an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining the understanding of β-H transfer mechanisms, developing new catalyst supports, and enhancing catalyst stability to mitigate deactivation pathways. Additionally, exploring the synergies between lanthanide/actinide and Re-based catalysts could lead to the creation of novel catalyst architectures with improved selectivity and longevity. The integration of computational chemistry tools could further aid in predicting and optimizing catalyst performance, guiding the design of catalysts that are more robust against deactivation pathways. As the field progresses, there is a growing interest in developing catalysts that are not only efficient but also sustainable, paving the way for more eco-friendly industrial processes.
