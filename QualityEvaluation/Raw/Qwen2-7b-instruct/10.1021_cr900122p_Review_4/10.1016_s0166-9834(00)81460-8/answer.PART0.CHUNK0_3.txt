The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators. Alumina showed no activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C. The exchange reaction readily occurred at room temperature after it was evacuated at 600°C for 2 hours. The surface hydroxyl groups were involved in the exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups. When magnesia was heated, two major bands due to hydroxyl groups appeared, agreeing with previous studies. On alumina, no exchange of hydroxyl groups to 00 was observed up to 250°C, even after being evacuated at 700°C. The C-H bond needs to be broken for methane to exchange its hydrogen.

氢交换反应在不同的氧化物催化剂上对甲烷分子、甲烷和氢以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢进行了研究。铝氧烷在温度高于400°C时才显示出活性。在600°C下真空处理2小时后，即使在室温下也能迅速发生交换反应。表面羟基团参与了甲烷与表面羟基团的交换反应。当镁砂加热时，出现了两个主要的羟基峰，这与先前的研究结果一致。在铝氧烷中，直到250°C都没有观察到羟基团向00的交换，即使在700°C下被真空处理过。为了使甲烷交换其氢原子，必须断开C-H键。
