[4] "The lowest evacuation temperature required for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was about 45O'C."

The study investigates the hydrogen exchange reaction between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts on various oxide catalysts. It was found that alumina showed no activity until evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C. Magnesia required a lower evacuation temperature of around 450°C for the equilibration reaction to occur. The carbon dioxide that poisons the equilibration reaction adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C. No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed up to 250°C on alumina, even after being evacuated at 700°C. Below 250°C, no hydroxyl group exchange occurred, whereas many hydrogen exchanges took place during the equilibration reaction.

研究了甲烷分子之间的氢交换反应、甲烷和氢之间的反应以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的反应，这些反应在各种氧化物催化剂上进行了研究。研究发现，当铝酸盐在高于400°C的温度下被抽真空时才表现出活性。镁则需要大约450°C的抽真空温度来催化等温反应。导致等温反应中毒的二氧化碳最强烈吸附，并在280°C给出TD谱图的峰值。直到250°C之前，在铝酸盐上没有观察到羟基团的交换，即使在700°C下被抽真空也是如此。在低于250°C的情况下，没有观察到羟基团的交换，而等温反应期间发生了许多氢交换。

Since the provided literature focuses on the hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and CH, on various oxide catalysts, it does not contain information related to the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, nor does it compare specific mechanisms involving lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Therefore, it is not possible to analyze or discuss these topics based on the given text.

由于提供的文献主要关注在不同氧化物催化剂上进行的甲烷氢交换反应，它没有包含与支持烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的内键C-H键活化导致的催化剂失活过程相关的信息，也没有比较涉及镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的具体机制。因此，基于给定文本，无法分析或讨论这些主题。

The hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and CH, was studied over various oxide catalysts, including alumina, silica, titanium oxide, magnesia, and alumina modified with acid and base. Alumina showed the highest activity when evacuated at 600°C, followed by magnesia. Silica and titanium oxide were inactive at temperatures up to 600°C. Alumina modified with potassium carbonate retained about 20% of its original activity, whereas alumina modified with sulfuric acid completely lost its activity. The surface density of active sites on alumina, measured using carbon dioxide and TPD, was one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. The surface hydroxyl groups were also studied in relation to their involvement in the CD, - CH, exchange reaction.

The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators. Alumina showed no activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C. The exchange reaction readily occurred at room temperature after it was evacuated at 600°C for 2 hours. The surface hydroxyl groups were involved in the exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups. When magnesia was heated, two major bands due to hydroxyl groups appeared, agreeing with previous studies. On alumina, no exchange of hydroxyl groups to 00 was observed up to 250°C, even after being evacuated at 700°C. The C-H bond needs to be broken for methane to exchange its hydrogen.

氢交换反应在不同的氧化物催化剂上对甲烷分子、甲烷和氢以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢进行了研究。铝氧烷在温度高于400°C时才显示出活性。在600°C下真空处理2小时后，即使在室温下也能迅速发生交换反应。表面羟基团参与了甲烷与表面羟基团的交换反应。当镁砂加热时，出现了两个主要的羟基峰，这与先前的研究结果一致。在铝氧烷中，直到250°C都没有观察到羟基团向00的交换，即使在700°C下被真空处理过。为了使甲烷交换其氢原子，必须断开C-H键。

The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts, particularly alumina, has been extensively studied. It was found that the surface density of active sites of alumina, measured with carbon dioxide, is significantly lower than previously estimated. The lowest required evacuation temperature for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was approximately 450°C. Carbon dioxide that adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C is identified as the one that poisons the equilibration reaction on alumina. At temperatures up to 250°C, no exchange of hydroxyl groups to 00 was observed on alumina, indicating that the hydroxyl groups are not involved in the CD,-CH, reaction at these low temperatures. The present results suggest that the equilibration reaction of methane on alumina involves no hydroxyl groups of the catalyst or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear at this stage. Silica and titanium oxide are not capable of breaking the C-H bond of methane even after being evacuated at high temperatures.

在催化剂表面的氢交换反应，特别是对铝氧化物的研究已经进行了广泛的研究。发现铝氧化物表面活性位点的数量，通过二氧化碳测量，明显低于之前的估计。铝氧化物上进行等温反应所需的最低蒸发温度约为450°C。能够引起铝氧化物等温反应中毒的碳二氧，是那个在280°C下给出TPD峰值的最强烈吸附的那部分。在250°C以下的温度范围内，没有观察到铝氧化物上的羟基组分与D00的交换，这表明在这些较低温度下，羟基组分并未参与甲烷-D氢交换反应。当前的结果表明，在铝氧化物上的甲烷等温反应涉及催化剂上的羟基组分或与活性位点关联的羟基组分数量极其微小。目前尚不清楚这一现象的原因。即使在高温下被蒸发，硅酸盐和钛氧化物也无法裂解甲烷中的C-H键。
