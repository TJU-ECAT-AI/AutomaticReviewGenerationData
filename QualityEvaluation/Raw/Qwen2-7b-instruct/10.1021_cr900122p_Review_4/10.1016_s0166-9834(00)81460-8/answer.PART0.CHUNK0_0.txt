[1] "The catalytic exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, between methane and hydrogen and between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalyst has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators Cl-31."
[2] "Alumina did not show any activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400C."
[3] "When evacuated at 6OO"C, magnesia catalyzed the equilibration reaction above 250C, but the activity was one order of magnitude lower than that of alumina at 4OO'C as seen in Table 1."
[4] "The lowest evacuation temperature required for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was about 45O'C."
[5] "Comparing these results with Fig. 3,it is obvious that the carbon dioxide which poisons the equilibration reaction is that which adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 28O'C."
[6] "On alumina, no exchange of the OH groups to 00 was observed in 15 min up to 250C even after alumina was evacuated at 700C as shown in Fig. 5."
[7] "Below 25O"C,however, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min while quite a large number of H-D exchanges took place in the same period of time during the equilibration reaction."

The study investigates the hydrogen exchange reaction between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts on various oxide catalysts. It was found that alumina showed no activity until evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C. Magnesia required a lower evacuation temperature of around 450°C for the equilibration reaction to occur. The carbon dioxide that poisons the equilibration reaction adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C. No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed up to 250°C on alumina, even after being evacuated at 700°C. Below 250°C, no hydroxyl group exchange occurred, whereas many hydrogen exchanges took place during the equilibration reaction.

研究了甲烷分子之间的氢交换反应、甲烷和氢之间的反应以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的反应，这些反应在各种氧化物催化剂上进行了研究。研究发现，当铝酸盐在高于400°C的温度下被抽真空时才表现出活性。镁则需要大约450°C的抽真空温度来催化等温反应。导致等温反应中毒的二氧化碳最强烈吸附，并在280°C给出TD谱图的峰值。直到250°C之前，在铝酸盐上没有观察到羟基团的交换，即使在700°C下被抽真空也是如此。在低于250°C的情况下，没有观察到羟基团的交换，而等温反应期间发生了许多氢交换。
