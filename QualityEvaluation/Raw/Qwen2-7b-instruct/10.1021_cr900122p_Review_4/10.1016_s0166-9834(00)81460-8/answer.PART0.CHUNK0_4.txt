The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts, particularly alumina, has been extensively studied. It was found that the surface density of active sites of alumina, measured with carbon dioxide, is significantly lower than previously estimated. The lowest required evacuation temperature for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was approximately 450°C. Carbon dioxide that adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C is identified as the one that poisons the equilibration reaction on alumina. At temperatures up to 250°C, no exchange of hydroxyl groups to 00 was observed on alumina, indicating that the hydroxyl groups are not involved in the CD,-CH, reaction at these low temperatures. The present results suggest that the equilibration reaction of methane on alumina involves no hydroxyl groups of the catalyst or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear at this stage. Silica and titanium oxide are not capable of breaking the C-H bond of methane even after being evacuated at high temperatures.

在催化剂表面的氢交换反应，特别是对铝氧化物的研究已经进行了广泛的研究。发现铝氧化物表面活性位点的数量，通过二氧化碳测量，明显低于之前的估计。铝氧化物上进行等温反应所需的最低蒸发温度约为450°C。能够引起铝氧化物等温反应中毒的碳二氧，是那个在280°C下给出TPD峰值的最强烈吸附的那部分。在250°C以下的温度范围内，没有观察到铝氧化物上的羟基组分与D00的交换，这表明在这些较低温度下，羟基组分并未参与甲烷-D氢交换反应。当前的结果表明，在铝氧化物上的甲烷等温反应涉及催化剂上的羟基组分或与活性位点关联的羟基组分数量极其微小。目前尚不清楚这一现象的原因。即使在高温下被蒸发，硅酸盐和钛氧化物也无法裂解甲烷中的C-H键。
