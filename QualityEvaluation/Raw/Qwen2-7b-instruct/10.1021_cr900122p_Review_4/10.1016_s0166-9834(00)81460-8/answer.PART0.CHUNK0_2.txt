[1] "The hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and CH, was investigated over alumina, silica, titanium oxide, magnesia, and alumina modified with acid and base."
[2] "When evacuated at 600C. alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to 600C."

The hydrogen exchange reaction between CD, and CH, was studied over various oxide catalysts, including alumina, silica, titanium oxide, magnesia, and alumina modified with acid and base. Alumina showed the highest activity when evacuated at 600°C, followed by magnesia. Silica and titanium oxide were inactive at temperatures up to 600°C. Alumina modified with potassium carbonate retained about 20% of its original activity, whereas alumina modified with sulfuric acid completely lost its activity. The surface density of active sites on alumina, measured using carbon dioxide and TPD, was one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. The surface hydroxyl groups were also studied in relation to their involvement in the CD, - CH, exchange reaction.

对CD, 和CH, 的氢交换反应在包括氧化铝、二氧化硅、二氧化钛、镁氧化物和酸改性的氧化铝在内的多种氧化物催化剂上进行了研究。当在600°C下抽真空时，氧化铝表现出最高活性，随后是镁氧化物。二氧化硅和二氧化钛在600°C以下的所有温度下均无活性。改性为碳酸钾的氧化铝保留了大约20%的原始活性，而改性为硫酸的氧化铝完全失去了活性。通过二氧化碳和TPD测量的氧化铝表面活性位点密度比先前估计的小一个数量级。还研究了表面羟基团在CD, - CH, 交换反应中的作用。
