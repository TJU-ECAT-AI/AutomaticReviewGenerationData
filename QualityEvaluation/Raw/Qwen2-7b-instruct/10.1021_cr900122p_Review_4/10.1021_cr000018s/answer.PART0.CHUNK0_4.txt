<p>There are two major pathways for carbon formation: The tendency to form carbon on the catalyst surface depends on reaction kinetics, process conditions (temperature, pressure flow rates), and reformer design.</p>
<p>In H2 production, there are always concerns with regard to carbon formation 22 which can build rapidly and poison the process. Carbon leads to fouling (clogging) of the reactor and blocks active sites on the catalyst, and thus it is important to inhibit carbon formation.</p>
<p>There must be acceptable, energy-efficient means to remove any accumulating carbon coproduct.</p>
<p>Formation of carbon (coke) during the process is a critical issue that impacts performance and lifetime of commercial catalysts. Current technology can remove and minimize coke formation. However, the goal of current research must be to do so more effectively, to extend catalyst life, to reduce the operating temperatures (admittedly at the expense of lower conversions), and to reduce the steam-to-hydrocarbon ratio.</p>
<p>Current Ni or Ru catalysts are adequate to produce H2, which is currently thermodynamically limited for this very endothermic process.</p>

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is analyzed through the comparison of lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The specific mechanisms involved for both types of catalysts are discussed, focusing on the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The key steps in these processes are outlined, detailing the pathways leading to catalyst deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are evaluated. This analysis helps in understanding the factors affecting the stability and efficiency of these catalysts in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.
