Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo complex processes involving the activation of C-H bonds within molecules. Key steps in these mechanisms include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer reactions. These deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity, potentially affecting industrial applications and efficiency.
