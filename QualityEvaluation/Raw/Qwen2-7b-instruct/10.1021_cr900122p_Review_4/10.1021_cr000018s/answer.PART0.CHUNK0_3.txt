The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts can be analyzed by comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes are stabilized by the metal center and facilitate the transfer of β-H from the allyl group to the metal surface, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. This process is facilitated by the high stability and electronic properties of lanthanide/actinide centers, which allow for the formation of these complexes.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway also involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. However, the silica support provides a more rigid and stable environment, which affects the stability and reactivity of the complexes. The β-H transfer from the allyl group to the metal surface still occurs, but the overall process might be influenced differently due to the support's properties. The silica support can influence the accessibility of the complexes to the surface and the rate of β-H transfer, impacting the catalyst's performance and longevity.

These deactivation pathways have potential consequences on catalyst performance and longevity. The rapid formation of π-allyl surface complexes can lead to a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting the efficiency of the polymerization or metathesis reactions. Additionally, the β-H transfer process can lead to the formation of inactive species, which can accumulate over time and further degrade the catalyst's performance. Understanding and mitigating these deactivation pathways are crucial for improving the stability and effectiveness of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.

在分析内禀分子C-H键活化对支撑烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活作用时，可以通过比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的具体机制来进行对比。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径通常涉及π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成。这些复合物通过金属中心稳定，并促进了烯丙基组分向金属表面的β-H转移，导致催化剂失活。这个过程得益于镧系/锕系中心的高稳定性和电子性质，允许形成这些复合物。

对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，失活途径也涉及到π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成。然而，二氧化硅支持提供了更稳定和刚性的环境，这会影响复合物的稳定性和反应性。烯丙基向金属表面的β-H转移仍然发生，但由于支持的性质，整体过程可能受到不同的影响。二氧化硅支持可以影响复合物到达表面的可接近性和β-H转移速率，从而影响催化剂的性能和寿命。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命有潜在的影响。快速形成π-烯丙基表面复合物会导致催化剂活性和选择性的下降，影响聚合或裂解反应的效率。此外，β-H转移过程可能导致形成无活性物种，随着时间的推移积累并进一步降低催化剂的性能。理解并减少这些失活途径对于提高支撑烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的稳定性和有效性至关重要。
