Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that the specific mechanisms vary between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is a key step in their deactivation process. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo β-H transfer as a crucial step in their deactivation pathway. These distinct deactivation pathways have significant implications for the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

分析介链C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的作用，我们发现不同类型的催化剂（镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基）的失活机制有所不同。镧系/锕系基催化剂的失活过程中关键步骤是形成π-邻二烯表面复合物。而二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂则经历β-H转移作为其失活过程的关键步骤。这些不同的失活途径对催化剂的性能和使用寿命有重要影响。
