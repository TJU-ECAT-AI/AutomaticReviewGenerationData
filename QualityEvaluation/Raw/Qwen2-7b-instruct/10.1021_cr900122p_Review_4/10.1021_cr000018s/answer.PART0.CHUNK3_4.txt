Tobin J. Marks' research interests involve the synthetic and mechanistic chemistry of f- and d-elements, with a focus on organometallic compounds. His work applies these principles to homogeneous catalysis and explores the design, synthesis, and properties of unique molecules and materials derived from them. Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. This process involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These deactivation pathways affect catalyst performance and longevity significantly.
