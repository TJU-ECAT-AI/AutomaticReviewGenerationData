Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts reveals distinct mechanisms for different types of catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often deactivate through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation via β-H transfer. The key steps in both processes involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These deactivation pathways can have significant consequences on the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

分析内嵌C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的作用揭示了不同类型催化剂的不同机制。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常通过形成π-烯丙基表面复合物进行失活，而SiO2支持的Re基催化剂则通过β-H转移经历失活。两个过程的关键步骤都涉及形成π-烯丙基表面复合物和β-H转移。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命有显著影响。
