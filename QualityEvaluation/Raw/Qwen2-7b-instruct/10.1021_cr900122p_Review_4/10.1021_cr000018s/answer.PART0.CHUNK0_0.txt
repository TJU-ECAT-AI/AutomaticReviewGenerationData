[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a complex process that varies depending on the type of catalyst used. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can lead to the deactivation of the catalyst. This occurs through a β-H transfer reaction, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the catalyst surface, leading to its deactivation."
[2] "In contrast, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanism often involves a different set of steps. The key step here is also the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, but the β-H transfer process differs in terms of the energy profile and the pathways involved. This can affect the catalyst's performance and longevity differently compared to lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts."

Silica-supported Re-based catalysts also form π-allyl surface complexes, but the β-H transfer process and the energy profile differ, affecting the catalyst's performance and longevity differently.

通过内部分子C-H键活化导致的催化剂失活在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。镧系/锕系基催化剂通过形成π-二烯表面复合物并随后进行β-H转移反应而失活。这个过程导致从催化剂表面抽象氢原子，导致失活。SiO2支持的Re基催化剂也形成π-二烯表面复合物，但β-H转移过程和能量轮廓不同，这会影响催化剂的性能和寿命。
