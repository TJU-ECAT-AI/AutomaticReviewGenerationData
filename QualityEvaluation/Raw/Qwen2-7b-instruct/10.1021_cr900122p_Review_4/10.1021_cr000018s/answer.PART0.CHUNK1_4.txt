[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)3+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"
[3] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."
[4] "The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting."
[5] "These systems produce formate and CO as products."
[6] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%."
[7] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process typically involves the formation of a π-allyl complex, which then undergoes β-H transfer, leading to deactivation. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is similar but specifics may vary due to differences in the catalyst structure and the nature of the support. The key steps include the initial formation of a π-allyl complex followed by the removal of a hydrogen atom, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shortened longevity. Optimizing the conditions and catalyst design can mitigate these effects and prolong the catalyst's useful life.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程通常涉及形成π-烯丙基复合物，随后进行β-H转移，导致催化剂失活。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，机制类似，但具体细节可能因催化剂结构和载体性质的不同而有所不同。关键步骤包括初始形成π-烯丙基复合物，随后去除一个氢原子，导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径的潜在后果包括催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短。优化条件和催化剂设计可以减轻这些影响并延长催化剂的使用寿命。
