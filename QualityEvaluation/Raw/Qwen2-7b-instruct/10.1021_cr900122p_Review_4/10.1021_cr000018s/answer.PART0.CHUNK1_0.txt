[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)3+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"
[3] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described. Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanisms differ slightly in specifics but share commonalities in their pathways towards deactivation.

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation typically involves the formation of π-allyl complexes through the activation of C-H bonds adjacent to the catalyst center. Subsequent β-H transfer from these complexes leads to the formation of a more stable species, which can deactivate the catalyst. This process is often facilitated by the high electron density of the lanthanide or actinide center, which enhances the intramolecular activation of C-H bonds.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanism also involves the formation of π-allyl complexes, albeit through a different pathway. The high reactivity of the ruthenium center in these catalysts allows for the direct activation of C-H bonds on the alkene substrate, forming the π-allyl complex. β-H transfer from these complexes leads to the deactivation of the catalyst, similar to the lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts.

The key steps in these processes are the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. They can lead to a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity over time, necessitating regeneration or replacement of the catalyst. Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and enhancing their stability and efficiency in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.

在支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用，涉及π-邻基复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，尽管具体细节略有不同，但这些失活途径的基本路径是相似的。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活通常涉及通过激活催化剂中心附近的C-H键来形成π-邻基复合物。随后的β-H转移从这些复合物产生更稳定的物种，从而导致催化剂失活。镧系或锕系中心的高电子密度增强了C-H键的分子内激活，这有助于这一过程。

对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，失活机制也涉及形成π-邻基复合物，但途径有所不同。Re中心的高活性允许直接激活烯烃基质上的C-H键，形成π-邻基复合物。随后的β-H转移导致催化剂失活，与镧系/锕系基催化剂类似。

这些过程的关键步骤是形成π-邻基表面复合物和β-H转移。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能是显著的。它们可能导致催化剂活性和选择性随时间下降，需要再生或更换催化剂。理解这些失活机制对于优化催化剂设计并提高其在烯烃聚合和环化反应中的稳定性和效率至关重要。
