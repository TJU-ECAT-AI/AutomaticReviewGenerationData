The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes followed by β-H transfer reactions. This process leads to the inactivation of both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. However, the specific mechanisms for these two types of catalysts differ. The deactivation pathways for these catalysts can have significant consequences on their performance and lifespan.

在抑制共轭烯烃聚合和环化催化剂活性的过程中，内部分子C-H键的激活起着关键作用。这一过程包括形成表面π-亚甲基复合物，随后发生β-H转移反应导致催化剂失活。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，其失活途径有所不同；而硅支持的Re基催化剂则表现出相似的机制但有所差异。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命会产生重要影响。
