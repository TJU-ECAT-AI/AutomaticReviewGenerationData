[1] "In the past 10 years, research efforts on methane monooxygenase and related enzymes have substantially increased our understanding of oxygen activation at nonheme diiron active sites."
[2] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible. (1) CO2 is a cheap, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a totally renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal."
[3] "The hydrogenation of CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons is also known.155 For C2 and higher hydrocarbons, hybrid catalysts such as CuZnOCr2O3 and HY zeolite are generally used."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over metal oxides to form styrene (17) and propene, respectively.146,147 In these reactions, no part of the CO2 molecule is incorporated into the organic product, rather the oxygen of CO2 serves to remove two H atoms of the hydrocarbon."
[5] "The hydrogenation of CO2 to formate.157 Because this reaction is not thermodynamically favored, amines and supercritical CO2 have been used to drive this reaction."

1. Research on methane monooxygenase and related enzymes has significantly enhanced our understanding of oxygen activation at nonheme diiron active sites. 

2. There are multiple reasons to produce chemicals from CO2, including its low cost, nontoxicity, and renewability compared to fossil fuels.

3. The hydrogenation of CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons is a known process, often employing hybrid catalysts like CuZnOCr2O3 and HY zeolite for C2 and higher hydrocarbons.

4. In the dehydrogenation reactions of ethylbenzene and propane, the oxygen from CO2 acts to remove hydrogen atoms from hydrocarbons, without incorporating any part of the CO2 molecule into the final product.

5. The hydrogenation of CO2 to formate is a reaction that isn't thermodynamically favorable, so it is typically facilitated with the aid of amines and supercritical CO2.

1. 对于甲烷单氧酶和相关酶的研究，我们对非血红素二铁活性位点的氧气激活有了更深入的理解。

2. 将二氧化碳转化为化学物质有多个理由，包括其低成本、无毒性以及与化石燃料相比的可再生性。

3. 二氧化碳的氢化为甲烷和更高碳数的烃类提供了可能，通常使用CuZnOCr2O3和HY沸石等混合催化剂进行C2及以上碳数的氢化反应。

4. 在乙苯和丙烷的脱氢反应中，二氧化碳中的氧被用于去除烃中的氢原子，而没有将任何二氧化碳分子的一部分整合到最终产物中。

5. 二氧化碳氢化为碳酸盐的反应不是热力学上有利的，因此通常需要胺和超临界二氧化碳来促进这一反应。
