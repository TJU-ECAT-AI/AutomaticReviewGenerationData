[1] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible. (1) CO2 is a cheap, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a totally renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal."

[2] "In the case of alkynes and olefins, electrochemical reductive carboxylations result in effective addition of the formic acid CH bond to CC double or triple bonds."

[3] "Under oxidative conditions, CO2 may react with olefins to afford cyclic carbonates that find wide industrial applications."

[4] "This selectivity of reduced forms of the catalyst for H+ versus CO2 also appears to determine the nature of the CO2 reduction product observed."

[5] "The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a critical issue."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation through specific mechanisms. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which then undergo β-H transfer reactions leading to the formation of alkylated catalyst species. This results in a decrease in the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, ultimately leading to its deactivation. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts deactivate through a similar pathway but with a different mechanism. They form π-allyl surface complexes, which then undergo β-H transfer reactions. However, in this case, the β-H transfer leads to the formation of alkylated Re species, which can also deactivate the catalyst. Both deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of these catalysts, necessitating further research to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.

在分析内嵌C-H键活化对支持型烯烃聚合和共轭反应催化剂失活的作用时，我们发现镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂通过特定机制经历了失活过程。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程通常涉及形成π-亚甲基表面复合物，随后进行β-H转移反应，形成烷基化催化剂物种。这导致活性和选择性的下降，最终导致催化剂失活。相比之下，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂通过类似途径但使用不同的机制失活。它们形成π-亚甲基表面复合物，随后进行β-H转移反应。然而，在这种情况下，β-H转移导致形成烷基化Re物种，这也可以使催化剂失活。这两种失活途径均对这些催化剂的性能和寿命产生重大影响，需要进一步研究以开发更稳定和高效的催化剂用于烯烃聚合和共轭反应。
