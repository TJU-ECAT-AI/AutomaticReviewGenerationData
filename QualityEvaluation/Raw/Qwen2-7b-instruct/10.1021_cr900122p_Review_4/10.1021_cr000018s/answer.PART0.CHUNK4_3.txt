The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts through intramolecular C-H bond activation involves specific mechanisms that are distinct for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The main steps involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These processes can notably impact the performance and lifespan of the catalysts due to their deactivating effects.
