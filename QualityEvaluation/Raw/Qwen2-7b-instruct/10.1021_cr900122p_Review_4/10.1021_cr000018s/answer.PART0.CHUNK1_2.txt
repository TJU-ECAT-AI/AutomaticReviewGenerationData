[1] "Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined. These may be important in polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers in analogy to propene polymerization. Likewise, chain transfer reagents to control polymer molecular weights are also needed. Catalysts with higher turnover frequencies than currently available are needed."

The factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity in metal-centered CO2 transformations are not well-defined. These factors might be crucial for polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers, similar to propene polymerization. Chain transfer agents for controlling polymer molecular weights are also required. Higher turnover frequency catalysts than those currently available are needed.

[1] "For heterogeneous electrocatalysts are needed that operate at lower overpotentials with higher selectivity. Although Cu electrodes catalyze CO2 reduction to methane, comparable catalysts for producing methanol are unknown. Methanol production has been reported at Mo electrodes but selectivity and current densities are very low, typically less than 40% and 1 ma/cm2, respectively."

[1] "The cleavage of CO bonds as CO2 is reduced is also not well understood. During CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO mediated by Pd catalysts, a vacant coordination site facilitates the CO bond cleavage.192 This cleavage occurs via migration of a water molecule or hydroxide ion from a metal carboxylate carbon atom to a vacant coordination site on the metal (Scheme 18)."

The breaking of CO bonds as CO2 is reduced is also poorly understood. In the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO facilitated by Pd catalysts, a vacant coordination site aids in the breaking of the CO bond.192 This breaking takes place via the migration of a water molecule or hydroxide ion from a metal carboxylate carbon atom to an empty coordination site on the metal (Scheme 18).

CO键的断裂在CO2降低时也未得到充分理解。在Pd催化剂介导的CO2电解还原至CO过程中，一个空的配位位置有助于CO键的断裂。192这种断裂通过水分子或氢氧根离子从金属羧酸盐碳原子迁移到金属上的空配位位置发生（方案18）。
