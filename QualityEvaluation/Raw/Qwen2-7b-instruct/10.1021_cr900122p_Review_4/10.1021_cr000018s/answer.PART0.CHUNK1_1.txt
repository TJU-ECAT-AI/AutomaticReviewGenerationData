[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)3+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."
[3] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. This process leads to the removal of the catalyst from the surface, affecting its performance and longevity.

Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts deactivate through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which subsequently undergo β-H transfer reactions. This results in the loss of the catalyst's active center, causing deactivation.

Silica-supported Re-based catalysts also experience deactivation through intramolecular C-H bond activation. The β-H transfer leads to the regeneration of the catalyst's active center, but this process can be inefficient, leading to decreased catalyst performance and longevity.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant. They affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability, impacting the overall efficiency of the polymerization or metathesis reactions. Optimizing the conditions, such as the irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, could help mitigate these effects and prolong catalyst longevity.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用。这涉及π-基团表面复合物的形成以及β-H转移，导致催化剂从表面上被移除，影响其性能和寿命。

镧系/锕系基催化剂通过形成π-基团表面复合物而失活，随后进行β-H转移反应。这导致催化剂活性中心的丢失，引起失活。

硅基Re基催化剂也通过分子内C-H键的激活经历失活过程。β-H转移导致催化剂活性中心的再生，但这个过程可能效率低下，导致催化剂性能和寿命下降。

这些失活途径的影响是重大的。它们影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，进而影响聚合或金属易位反应的整体效率。优化照射波长、光照强度、照射时间和催化剂浓度等条件，可以减轻这些影响并延长催化剂的使用寿命。
