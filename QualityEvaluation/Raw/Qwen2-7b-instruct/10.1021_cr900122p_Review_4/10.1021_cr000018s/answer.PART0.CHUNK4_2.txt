[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been extensively studied. This process involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer."
[2] "For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanism typically involves the formation of a π-allyl complex followed by β-H transfer to the metal center."
[3] "In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts may deactivate via a different pathway, often involving the abstraction of hydrogen from the catalyst surface."

在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用。这涉及到π-亚甲基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活机制通常包括形成π-亚甲基复合物，随后是向金属中心转移β-H。相比之下，Si基铼催化剂的失活可能通过不同的途径进行，通常涉及从催化剂表面抽取氢。这两种机制最终导致活性丧失，影响催化剂的性能和寿命。
