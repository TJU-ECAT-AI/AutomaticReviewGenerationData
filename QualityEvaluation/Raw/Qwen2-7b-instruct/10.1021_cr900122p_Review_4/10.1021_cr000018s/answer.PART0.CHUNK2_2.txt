[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been a subject of extensive research. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can lead to β-H transfer reactions that deactivate the catalyst. On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts also undergo similar deactivation pathways, albeit with different mechanisms involving specific interactions with the support material."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role, leading to β-H transfer reactions that deactivate the catalyst. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based catalysts also undergo deactivation through comparable pathways, though the specific mechanisms may differ due to the interaction with the support material.

在支持型烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常涉及形成π-烯丙基表面复合物，这可能导致β-H转移反应，从而导致催化剂失活。对于以二氧化硅为支持的Re基催化剂，尽管具体机制可能因与支持材料的相互作用而有所不同，但它们也通过类似的失活途径进行。
