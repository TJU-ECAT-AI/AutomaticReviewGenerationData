The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. This process starts with the activation of intramolecular C-H bonds, which then leads to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. Subsequently, β-H transfer events occur, causing the deactivation of the catalyst.

在支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用。无论是以镧系/锕系为基础还是以二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，其失活过程都涉及π- allyl表面复合物的形成。这一过程始于对分子内C-H键的激活，随后形成了π- allyl表面复合物。接着，发生β-H转移事件，导致催化剂失活。
