Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts requires understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These mechanisms typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process may involve coordination of the metal center with the alkene, leading to C-H bond activation and subsequent insertion into the alkene backbone. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the β-H transfer mechanism plays a crucial role in the deactivation pathway. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkene moiety, which leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate that can undergo various side reactions, ultimately reducing the catalyst's activity and longevity. The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, impacting the efficiency and economics of industrial processes relying on these catalysts.

分析介入分子C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的作用，需要理解镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂涉及的具体机制。这些机制通常包括形成π-二烯表面复合物和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程可能涉及金属中心与烯烃的配位，导致C-H键活化并随后插入到烯烃骨架中。对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，β-H转移机制在失活途径中起着关键作用。这涉及到从烯烃基团抽象氢，形成一个碳阳离子中间体，该中间体可以经历各种副反应，最终降低催化剂的活性和寿命。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的，影响依赖这些催化剂的工业过程的效率和经济性。
