<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Intramolecular C-H bond activation is pivotal in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. This process typically involves the creation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer reactions. There are differing deactivation mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts versus silica-supported Re-based catalysts.
