Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is a critical step. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts employ β-H transfer as a key mechanism. These deactivation pathways can have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts.
