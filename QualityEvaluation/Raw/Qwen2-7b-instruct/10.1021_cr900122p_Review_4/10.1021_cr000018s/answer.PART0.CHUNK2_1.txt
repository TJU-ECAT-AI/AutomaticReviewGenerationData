The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, deactivation occurs via the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts experience deactivation through different mechanisms due to the distinct nature of their metal centers. The key steps in the deactivation process involve the initial activation of an intramolecular C-H bond, which leads to the formation of reactive intermediates capable of undergoing transformations like β-H elimination or hydrogen migration, thus causing the loss of catalytic activity.

在受支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活通过形成π-邻二烯表面复合物并随后进行β-H转移而发生。相比之下，由于金属中心的不同性质，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂通过不同的机制经历失活。失活过程的关键步骤涉及初始激活分子内C-H键，从而形成可进行β-H消除或氢迁移等转化的活性中间体，导致催化活性的丧失。
