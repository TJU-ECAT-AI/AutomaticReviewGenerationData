[1] "Despite intensive efforts to obtain conclusive mechanistic evidence, a firm decision between these alternatives cannot yet be made."
[2] "At present, it is not clear whether the "active" form of hydrogen is only atomic or includes a molecular species."
[3] "Infrared studies provide the strongest evidence that hydrogen adsorption on at least some metals is atomic."
[4] "Often, it is assumed that this reactive molecular hydrogen species is weakly adsorbed."

The nature of adsorbed hydrogen on zinc oxide has been a subject of extensive research. The document discusses the adsorption and infrared studies of hydrogen and deuterium on zinc oxide, suggesting that hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide is predominantly atomic, with a small fraction present in molecular form. The molecular form of hydrogen is thought to occur on a limited number of zinc oxide sites, accounting for approximately 5 to 10% of the surface. Poisoning studies with water indicate that the molecular hydrogen and dissociative hydrogen occur on the same sites. The infrared studies and isotope effect suggest a considerable barrier to rotation on the surface, which plays a role in the ortho-para hydrogen conversion over zinc oxide.

吸附在锌氧化物上的氢的性质一直是研究的重点。文档讨论了氢和重氢在锌氧化物上的吸附和红外光谱研究，表明锌氧化物上的氢吸附主要是原子形式，其中一小部分以分子形式存在。分子形式的氢被认为发生在锌氧化物的有限数量的位点上，占表面的大约5%到10%。水中毒性实验显示，分子氢和解离氢发生在相同的位点上。红外光谱研究和同位素效应表明，表面旋转有一个显著的障碍，这在正交-顺磁氢转换中扮演角色。
