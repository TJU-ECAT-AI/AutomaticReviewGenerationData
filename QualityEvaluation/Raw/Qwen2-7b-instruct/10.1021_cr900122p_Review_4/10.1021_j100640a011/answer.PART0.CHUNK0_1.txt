Answer: The literature discusses the reversible adsorption of hydrogen and deuterium on zinc oxide at -195 and -183°C, focusing on the isotope effect, adsorption isotherms, infrared spectroscopy, and the nature of the adsorbed molecular hydrogen species. The experiments suggest that the hydrogen is present in a molecular form and is limited to 5 to 10% of the surface. Poisoning studies with water indicate that the hydrogen adsorption sites are the same as those for the dissociative type I hydrogen. The infrared spectra and isotope effect suggest a significant barrier to rotation on the surface. The authors discuss the role of this molecular hydrogen species in the ortho-para hydrogen conversion, considering its possible involvement in the exchange reactions over zinc oxide.

Answer: The text explores the mechanism of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.
