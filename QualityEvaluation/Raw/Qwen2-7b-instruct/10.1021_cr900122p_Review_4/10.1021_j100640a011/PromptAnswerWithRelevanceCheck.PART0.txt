The nature of adsorbed hydrogen on zinc oxide has been a subject of extensive research. The document discusses the adsorption and infrared studies of hydrogen and deuterium on zinc oxide, suggesting that hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide is predominantly atomic, with a small fraction present in molecular form. The molecular form of hydrogen is thought to occur on a limited number of zinc oxide sites, accounting for approximately 5 to 10% of the surface. Poisoning studies with water indicate that the molecular hydrogen and dissociative hydrogen occur on the same sites. The infrared studies and isotope effect suggest a considerable barrier to rotation on the surface, which plays a role in the ortho-para hydrogen conversion over zinc oxide.

The literature discusses the adsorption and spectroscopic properties of hydrogen and deuterium on zinc oxide surfaces at cryogenic temperatures. The hydrogen adsorption is characterized as reversible and involves both atomic and molecular species. The molecular hydrogen is present in a small percentage of the surface and shows a significant isotope effect. The nature of the adsorbed hydrogen is studied using infrared spectroscopy, which reveals the presence of molecular hydrogen. The adsorption characteristics of molecular hydrogen are compared to those of type I and type I11 hydrogen, with type I11 hydrogen adsorbing on a fraction of the surface comparable to that responsible for type I adsorption. Water adsorption selectively poisons the sites for type I adsorption, supporting the interpretation that type I and type I11 hydrogen adsorb on the same sites. The detailed interpretation of the infrared spectrum indicates that the barrier to rotation of the molecular hydrogen species is high, but the exact height of the barrier cannot be precisely determined due to uncertainties in the parameters of the model. The molecular hydrogen species is considered a prime candidate for the intermediate in ortho-para hydrogen conversion on zinc oxide surfaces.

文献讨论了在低温下锌氧化物表面上氢和重氢的吸附和光谱特性。吸附的氢包括原子和分子两种形式，其中分子氢占据表面的小比例，并显示出显著的同位素效应。通过红外光谱法发现存在分子氢。通过比较类型I和类型III氢的吸附特性，发现类型III氢在表面的吸附比例与类型I相似。水吸附选择性地破坏了类型I吸附的位点，支持了类型I和类型III氢在相同位点吸附的解释。红外光谱的详细解释表明，分子氢物种的旋转障碍很高，但确定障碍的确切高度是困难的，因为模型参数存在不确定性。认为在锌氧化物表面上，这种分子氢物种是正交-顺式氢转换的候选中间体。

The literature references a wide array of scientific works spanning decades, covering topics such as chemical reactions, catalysis, spectroscopy, and the theory of metals and alloys. However, none of the references directly address the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, specifically for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes for the given questions.
