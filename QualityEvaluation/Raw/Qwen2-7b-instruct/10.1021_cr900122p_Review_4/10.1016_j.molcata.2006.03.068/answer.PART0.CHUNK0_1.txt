The literature discusses the transformations of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, focusing on the activation of these alkanes into more valuable products such as isomerization, aromatization, and alkylation reactions. It covers various aspects including the mechanism of activation, reaction schemes, and the nature of active sites. The review also explores the transformation of both pure alkanes and those in mixtures with alkenes or aromatic hydrocarbons under different conditions, providing insights into the role of zeolite catalysts in these processes.
