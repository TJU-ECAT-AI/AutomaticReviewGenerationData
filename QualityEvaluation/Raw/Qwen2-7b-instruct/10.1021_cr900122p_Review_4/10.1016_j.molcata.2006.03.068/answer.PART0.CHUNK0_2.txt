This review paper discusses the activation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, focusing on their transformation into more valuable products such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, isobutanebutene alkylation, and benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. It examines different activation mechanisms, including the carbenium-chain mechanism, the protolytic mechanism, and the transformation of light alkanes over both acid and metal zeolite catalysts, highlighting the importance of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts.
