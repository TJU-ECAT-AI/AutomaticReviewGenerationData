The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a complex process that involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this typically involves the coordination of a ligand to the metal center, followed by the activation of a C-H bond of the alkene substrate. This activated C-H bond then undergoes a concerted rearrangement, resulting in the formation of a π-allyl intermediate. The subsequent β-H transfer step leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. In silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is similar, but the surface chemistry and support effects can influence the efficiency and selectivity of the β-H transfer step. The deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of these catalysts, necessitating careful control of the reaction conditions and catalyst design to minimize deactivation and prolong catalyst activity.

In the context of the provided literature, the quotes mentioned are related to various topics such as admission of fellows, meeting schedule, papers presented, and candidate applications. They do not provide specific details about the mechanisms of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the question based on the given content.

However, considering the nature of the question, it can be inferred that the deactivation of these catalysts is associated with the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These steps involve the coordination of the catalyst to the alkene substrate, activation of a C-H bond, and subsequent rearrangement leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The specifics of these mechanisms would depend on the type of catalyst (lanthanide/actinide-based vs. silica-supported Re-based) and the details of the reaction conditions. The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity would require a detailed analysis of the kinetic parameters, stability studies, and possibly computational modeling to fully understand the impact on the catalytic activity.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，由内分子C-H键激活的作用是一个复杂的过程，涉及到π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，这通常涉及配体与金属中心的配位，随后是烯烃基质中C-H键的活化。活化的C-H键随后经历一个协同重排，产生π-烯丙基中间体。随后的β-H转移步骤导致催化剂失活。对于硅支持的铼基催化剂，机制相似，但表面化学和支撑效果可以影响β-H转移步骤的效率和选择性。这些失活途径可以显著影响催化剂的性能和寿命，需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂设计以最小化失活并延长催化剂活性。

根据提供的文献，提到的引文与诸如成员的正式接纳、会议时间表、论文发表和候选人申请等主题相关。它们没有提供关于内分子C-H键激活在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的具体机制的详细信息。因此，无法基于给定内容直接回答问题。

然而，考虑到问题的性质，可以推断这些催化剂的失活与π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移有关。这些步骤涉及到催化剂对烯烃基质的配位，C-H键的活化，以及随后的重排导致催化剂失活。具体机制取决于催化剂的类型（镧系/锕系基vs. 硅支持的铼基）和反应条件的细节。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响需要进行详细的分析，包括动力学参数、稳定性研究，可能还需要计算建模来全面理解其催化活性的影响。
