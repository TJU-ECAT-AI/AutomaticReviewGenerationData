Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation is significant in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. Specific mechanisms for deactivation differ between lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The process begins with the formation of surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer events. These deactivation pathways can affect catalyst performance and longevity, potentially leading to reduced efficiency and shorter operational lifespans.
