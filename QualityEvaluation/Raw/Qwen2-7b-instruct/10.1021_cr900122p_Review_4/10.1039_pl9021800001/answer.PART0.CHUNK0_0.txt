<EnglishVersionAnswer>
An investigation into the composition of brittle platinum was conducted. Furthermore, it was discovered that during the polymerisation of liquid cyanic acid, two isomerides were formed. These are cyamelide and cyanuric acid, not just cyamelide.

The question regarding the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, and discussing the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, cannot be answered from the provided literature. The document lacks relevant information on these topics.

Answer: The provided literature does not contain information related to the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, nor does it compare the mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. There is no mention of the formation of π-allyl surface complexes or β-H transfer in the context of these processes. Therefore, the requested analysis cannot be performed based on the available data.
