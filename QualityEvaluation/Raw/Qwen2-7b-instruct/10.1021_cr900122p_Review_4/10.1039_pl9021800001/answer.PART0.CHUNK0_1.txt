The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves different mechanisms depending on the type of catalyst. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often deactivate through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts tend to deactivate via β-H transfer. These deactivation pathways significantly influence the performance and longevity of catalysts. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for enhancing catalyst efficiency and stability.

在支撑烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。不同类型的催化剂采用不同的机制。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常通过形成π-二烯表面复合物失活。相比之下，硅支持的Re基催化剂倾向于通过β-H转移失活。这些失活途径显著影响催化剂的性能和寿命。理解这些机制对于提高催化剂的效率和稳定性至关重要。
