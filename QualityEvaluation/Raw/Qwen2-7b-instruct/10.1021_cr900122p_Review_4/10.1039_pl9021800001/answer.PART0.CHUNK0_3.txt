[1] "The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated, was of very great interest."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conclusion that the impact on the conductivity of air or other gas between oppositely charged surfaces isn't due to an invisible force from thorium molecules, but rather the release of a small amount of mixed substance in thorium that can be dissolved and precipitated, was highly intriguing.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
结论指出，影响空气或两极表面之间气体导电性的力量不是来自钍分子的无形力，而是源自于钍中混合物微量释放的一种物质，该物质可以被溶解和沉淀，这一观点非常引人入胜。

[1] "The stability of the chlorine derivative of cyanuric acid and the analogy of its reactions with those of substances such as nitrogen iodide and cyanogen iodide showed that it could not contain -0-GI groups."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The stability of the chlorine derivative of cyanuric acid and its reaction similarities with substances like nitrogen iodide and cyanogen iodide indicated that it could not contain -0-GI groups.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

[1] "The electrical methods employed for the measurement of emanating power and radioactivity depend on the universal property of the radiations from substances known as radioactive of ionising or producing charged carriers from the gas through which they pass whereby the gas is rendered capable of conducting a current of electricity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The electrical techniques used for measuring emanating power and radioactivity rely on the inherent property of the emissions from substances known as radioactive or ionizing, which generate charged particles as they pass through a gas, enabling the gas to conduct an electric current.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
用于测量放射性物质辐射能和放射性的电气方法依赖于这些物质在通过气体时产生带电载体的能力，这种气体因此能够传导电流。

[1] "The removal of the latter is consequently not accompanied by corresponding changes in the emanating power. The straight line radioactivity, on the other hand, is apparently unaffected by any of the causes which so profoundly alter the value of the emanating power, and appears much more likely to be additive with regard to mass."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Removing the latter does not result in corresponding changes to the emanating power. Conversely, the straight-line radioactivity seems unaffected by the factors that significantly alter the emanating power's value, suggesting it might be more additive concerning mass.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
去除后者不会伴随相应的辐射能变化。相反，直线辐射活动性似乎不受那些显著改变辐射能值因素的影响，更有可能与质量呈累加关系。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "Since the only known gases which would survive in unaltered amount the action of all the reagents employed are the gases of the argon family, the authors conclude that the emanation is allied in properties to the elements of this group."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Given that the only recognized gases that would remain unchanged under the action of all the employed reagents are those of the argon family, the authors conclude that the emanation shares properties with the elements of this group.

由于只有氩族气体在所有试剂作用下能保持不变，作者推断该发射物在性质上与这个族的元素有关联。

[1] "The actual ThX is probably present only in minute quantity, exhibiting the behaviour of being dragged down by precipitates, without reference to its true analytical behaviour."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The actual ThX is likely present in minuscule amounts, showing the behavior of being pulled down by precipitates, irrespective of its true analytical characteristics.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
实际存在的ThX很可能仅以微量存在，表现出被沉淀物拉下的行为，与它的真正分析特性无关。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The removal of an intensely radioactive and emanating material from thorium is found, in accord- ance with this view, to reduce the straight line radioactivity of the thorium very materially, These results show that thorium is partially separated from ThX, the constituent responsible for its activity, and the latter can be obtained free from thorium, "
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
According to this perspective, removing a highly radioactive and emitting material from thorium is found to significantly decrease the straight-line radioactivity of thorium, demonstrating that thorium is partly separated from ThX, the component responsible for its activity, and ThX can be isolated from thorium.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
按照这一观点，从钍中移除高度放射性和发射物质会显著降低钍的直线辐射活性，这表明钍部分分离出了ThX，这一成分负责其活性，而ThX可以从钍中分离出来。
