<p>Initial studies from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the formation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites.</p>
<p>Spoto et al. (163) studied ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5 using FTIR spectroscopy while collecting 7 interferograms per second at 4 cm−1 resolution.</p>
<p>In regime (A), a frequency shift for the Brnsted acid sites (3610 cm−1 band) and the ethylene molecule were found, while no perturbation of the external silanol groups (3746 cm−1 band) was observed.</p>
<p>The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm−1 for the O-H Brnsted acid site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond (measured by the 11 cm−1 downward shift of the n(C5 5C) bond).</p>
<p>At longer times on stream, oligomeric products with branched chains could also be discerned. For propylene a higher red-shift (from 3610 cm−1 to 3070 cm−1) as well as considerably more oligomerization was found.</p>
<p>Essentially identical TPD product distributions from all three adsorbates suggested that the cracking and alkylation of similar oligomeric species was involved.</p>
<p>The formation of hexatriene and thermal cyclization has been noted for noble metal catalysts, in agreement with Meriaudeau and Naccache (215), we seek to distinguish the mechanism for cyclization over acidic zeolites from bifunctional noble metal catalysts that form metallocy- cloalkane intermediates and are efficient for aromatization.</p>
<p>The intrinsic activation barrier calculated for mono- molecular cracking for n-hexane was calculated from data at low conversions and found to be 161 kJ/mol which matches well with the values presented by Dumesic and coworkers.</p>
<p>Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate constants for paraffin aromatization.</p>
<p>The model developed acknowledges the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, considers the existence of methoxy surface species, includes alkyl-lation reactions as discussed in Section 3.1.4, as well as postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions.</p>

The literature highlights the formation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites. FTIR spectroscopy was utilized to study ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5, revealing specific frequency shifts and perturbations indicative of p-complex formation. The literature also discusses the intrinsic activation barrier for n-hexane cracking, the formation of hexatriene and thermal cyclization for noble metal catalysts, and the model's ability to predict the experimental data for olefin and paraffin aromatization. The model takes into account the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, the existence of methoxy surface species, alkyl-lation reactions, and cyclization steps involving hydride abstraction reactions.
