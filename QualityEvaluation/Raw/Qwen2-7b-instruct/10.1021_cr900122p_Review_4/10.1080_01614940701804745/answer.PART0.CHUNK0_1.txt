[1] "Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas (140, 141) have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species."
[2] "Luzgin et al. (145) have also demonstrated unimolecular scrambling of 13C in butane and propane using 13C and 1H MAS NMR although n-C4 to i-C4 isomerization reactions were proposed to occur via bimolecular oligomerization-cracking cycles."
[3] "Truitt et al. (69) have also used NMR methods to demonstrate (i) that alkanes interact with zeolites at Brnsted acid sites via specific adsorption complexes that enable (ii) low temperature (273 K) exchange between iso- butane and the Brnsted acid proton."
[4] "Quantum chemical calculations have also been extensively employed to develop mechanistic understanding for alkane activation over zeolitic acid sites."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl complexes through the activation of C-H bonds plays a crucial role in the deactivation pathway. This involves the breaking of the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an allyl radical, which then reacts with the catalyst to deactivate it. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the β-H transfer mechanism is dominant. In this process, a hydrogen atom is transferred from a β-position to a γ-position of the catalyst-bound alkene, leading to the formation of a carbene and a saturated alkane, which results in the catalyst's deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, as they lead to a decrease in the catalyst's activity and lifetime, affecting the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the polymerization and metathesis reactions.

分析内键C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和金属转移催化剂失活中的作用，需要理解镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂中涉及的具体机制。这些过程的关键步骤包括形成π-异丙基表面复合物和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，通过C-H键的活化形成π-异丙基复合物是失活路径中的关键环节。这涉及到C-H键的断裂，导致异丙基自由基的形成，然后与催化剂反应，使其失活。对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，β-H转移机制占主导地位。在这个过程中，从β位转移到γ位的氢原子与催化剂上的烯烃反应，形成一个卡宾和一个饱和烷烃，导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响显著，导致催化剂活性和寿命的下降，影响聚合和金属转移反应的整体效率和成本效益。
