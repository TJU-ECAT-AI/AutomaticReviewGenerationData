[1] "The reaction chemistry of propane aromatization is comprised of numerous successive steps."
[2] "The observed product distribution for the experimental studies shows a cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio close to 3, in other words C-C bond cleavage is found to be more facile compared to C-H bond cleavage."
[3] "Since, the ratio observed was identical for the two isotopic switching events shown in Eq. (2), the authors concluded that cleavage of the O-H bond of the zeolite was rate limiting for the cracking reaction."
[4] "Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas (140, 141) have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species."
[5] "In a separate series of experiments, pressure transient response exper- iments were carried out for n-C4H10 to monitor the dependence of cracking and dehydrogenation as a function of time on stream (136)."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which often lead to the deactivation through β-H transfer. This process involves the breaking of a hydrogen atom from the alkene, which is then transferred to the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of a new surface complex. This repeated β-H transfer can lead to the gradual deactivation of the catalyst over time.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism of deactivation typically involves the formation of surface complexes that are prone to undergo intramolecular C-H bond activation. These complexes can rearrange through various pathways, often leading to the release of hydrogen and the formation of new alkene products. This can result in a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, ultimately causing its deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the gradual loss of β-H transfer capability can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the polymerization process, affecting the quality and yield of the final product. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the decreased activity and selectivity can result in a lower conversion rate and the formation of unwanted byproducts, impacting the overall economic viability of the process.

To mitigate these deactivation pathways, strategies such as catalyst regeneration, careful control of reaction conditions, and the development of more stable catalyst supports can be employed. These measures aim to prolong the catalyst's lifetime and maintain its optimal performance throughout the course of the reaction.

分析支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的内键氢键解活作用在镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂中的角色涉及理解这两种催化剂的具体机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，关键步骤包括形成π-乙基表面复合物，通常导致通过β-H转移的解活。这一过程涉及从烯烃断裂一个氢原子，并将其转移到催化剂表面，从而形成新的表面复合物。这种重复的β-H转移可能导致催化剂逐渐失活。

对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，解活机制通常涉及形成易于进行内键氢键解活的表面复合物。这些复合物可以通过多种途径重新排列，最终导致氢的释放和新烯烃产物的形成。这可能导致催化剂活性和选择性的降低，最终导致其失活。

这些解活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，逐渐失去β-H转移能力可能导致聚合过程效率下降，影响最终产品的质量和产量。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，活性和选择性的降低可能导致转化率下降和副产品的形成，影响过程的整体经济性。

为了减轻这些解活途径的影响，可以采取策略如催化剂再生、精确控制反应条件以及开发更稳定的催化剂支撑材料。这些措施旨在延长催化剂的使用寿命并保持其在反应过程中的最佳性能。
