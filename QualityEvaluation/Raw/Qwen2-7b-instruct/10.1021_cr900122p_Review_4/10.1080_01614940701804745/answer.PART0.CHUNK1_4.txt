Olefin Adsorption As discussed in Section 2.4., initial work from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the for- mation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites. We extend that discussion here and focus only on the olefin adsorption studies.

b-scission/Oligomerization Olefin interconversion and cyclization are known to occur at temperatures in the range 473673 K on HZSM-5, indicating the much higher reactivity of olefins compared to the corresponding paraffins. Cracking of olefins at the higher temperatures used for light paraffin aromatization (773 K) presents experimental challenges due to high reaction rates. The term conjunct polymer- ization was coined by Pines (182) to describe the products of acid-catalyzed reactions of olefins involving successive oligomerization/cracking cycles.

Olefins undergo interconversion and cyclization at temperatures between 473 and 733 K on HZSM-5, highlighting their higher reactivity compared to corresponding paraffins. The high reaction rates when cracking olefins at 773 K for light paraffin aromatization pose experimental challenges. Pines coined the term 'conjoint polymerization' to describe the products of acid-catalyzed reactions of olefins involving successive oligomerization/cracking cycles.

烯烃在473至733 K的温度范围内在HZSM-5上发生互换和环化，这表明它们与对应的烷烃相比具有更高的反应活性。在773 K下对烯烃进行轻质烷烃芳构化时，由于反应速率高，这提出了实验上的挑战。Pines将酸催化反应中烯烃经历的连续缩聚/裂解周期的产品描述为“联合聚合”。

Cyclization Dehydrocyclodimerization, the conversion of light olefins (C2-C4) to aro- matics is often carried out over bifunctional catalysts containing acidic and dehydrogenation components. However, cyclization also occurs over purely acidic zeolites as well. It is postulated that cyclization involves an equilibrium between 5- and 6-membered ring species although 5-membered ring species are not observed in any significant concentration in the product distribution.
