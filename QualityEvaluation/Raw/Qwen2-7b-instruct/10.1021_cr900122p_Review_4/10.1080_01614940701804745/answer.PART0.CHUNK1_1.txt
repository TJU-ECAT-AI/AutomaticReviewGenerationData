[1] "Among the large variety of metallic components added to HZSM-5 to enhance the dehydrogenation function of these catalysts, gallium and zinc have been evaluated to give the best performance."

[2] "Our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of these Ga-based formulations."

[3] "Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc, and our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of these Ga-based formulations."
