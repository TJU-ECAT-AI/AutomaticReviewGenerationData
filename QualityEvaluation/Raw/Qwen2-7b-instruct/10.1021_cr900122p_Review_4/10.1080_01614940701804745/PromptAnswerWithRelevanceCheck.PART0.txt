<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, the literature highlights the importance of the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the literature does not provide specific details on the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in deactivation pathways. However, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role. The β-H transfer from these complexes leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. The consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant on catalyst performance and longevity. They lead to a decline in activity and selectivity, necessitating frequent regeneration or replacement of the catalyst to maintain optimal performance in industrial applications.

The potential for intramolecular C-H bond activation to contribute to deactivation is acknowledged in the literature. The strong coulombic interactions between the adsorbed intermediates and the catalyst surface substantially modify the geometry and reactivity of the adsorbed species. This modification requires that the stable intermediates in the heterogeneous acid-catalyzed transformations of hydrocarbons on zeolites are covalently bonded alkoxide intermediates rather than carbenium ions. The persistence of carbenium ions in zeolites for molecules with high proton affinities is shown by recent experimental studies (93, 94). Additionally, theoretical studies (95) based on steric inaccessibility arguments propose the existence of carbenium ions. However, in general, the strong interactions between adsorbed intermediates and catalyst surfaces lead to modifications in the geometry and reactivity of these species, making covalently bonded alkoxide intermediates the stable forms in the catalytic process.

分析在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键激活的作用，文献强调了镧系/锕系基和硅支持的Re基催化剂中涉及的特定机制的重要性。这些过程的关键步骤包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，文献没有提供分子内C-H键激活在失活途径中的具体细节。然而，对于硅支持的Re基催化剂，π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成起着关键作用。从这些复合物转移β-H导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。它们导致活性和选择性的下降，需要频繁地再生或更换催化剂以维持最佳性能，在工业应用中。

文献承认分子内C-H键激活有可能促进催化剂的失活。强烈的库仑相互作用使得吸附中间体与催化剂表面的几何结构和反应性发生显著改变。这要求在沸石基酸催化转化中，稳定的中间体为共价键合的醇氧中间体，而不是碳正离子。最近的实验研究（93, 94）显示，对于具有高质子亲和力的分子，存在持续的碳正离子。此外，基于空间不可接近性论点的理论研究（95）提出存在碳正离子的存在。然而，总的来说，吸附中间体与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用导致这些物种的几何结构和反应性发生修改，使共价键合的醇氧中间体成为催化过程中的稳定形式。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl complexes through the activation of C-H bonds plays a crucial role in the deactivation pathway. This involves the breaking of the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an allyl radical, which then reacts with the catalyst to deactivate it. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the β-H transfer mechanism is dominant. In this process, a hydrogen atom is transferred from a β-position to a γ-position of the catalyst-bound alkene, leading to the formation of a carbene and a saturated alkane, which results in the catalyst's deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant, as they lead to a decrease in the catalyst's activity and lifetime, affecting the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the polymerization and metathesis reactions.

分析内键C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和金属转移催化剂失活中的作用，需要理解镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂中涉及的具体机制。这些过程的关键步骤包括形成π-异丙基表面复合物和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，通过C-H键的活化形成π-异丙基复合物是失活路径中的关键环节。这涉及到C-H键的断裂，导致异丙基自由基的形成，然后与催化剂反应，使其失活。对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，β-H转移机制占主导地位。在这个过程中，从β位转移到γ位的氢原子与催化剂上的烯烃反应，形成一个卡宾和一个饱和烷烃，导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响显著，导致催化剂活性和寿命的下降，影响聚合和金属转移反应的整体效率和成本效益。

<p>Initial studies from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the formation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites.</p>
<p>Spoto et al. (163) studied ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5 using FTIR spectroscopy while collecting 7 interferograms per second at 4 cm−1 resolution.</p>
<p>In regime (A), a frequency shift for the Brnsted acid sites (3610 cm−1 band) and the ethylene molecule were found, while no perturbation of the external silanol groups (3746 cm−1 band) was observed.</p>
<p>The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm−1 for the O-H Brnsted acid site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond (measured by the 11 cm−1 downward shift of the n(C5 5C) bond).</p>
<p>At longer times on stream, oligomeric products with branched chains could also be discerned. For propylene a higher red-shift (from 3610 cm−1 to 3070 cm−1) as well as considerably more oligomerization was found.</p>
<p>Essentially identical TPD product distributions from all three adsorbates suggested that the cracking and alkylation of similar oligomeric species was involved.</p>
<p>The formation of hexatriene and thermal cyclization has been noted for noble metal catalysts, in agreement with Meriaudeau and Naccache (215), we seek to distinguish the mechanism for cyclization over acidic zeolites from bifunctional noble metal catalysts that form metallocy- cloalkane intermediates and are efficient for aromatization.</p>
<p>The intrinsic activation barrier calculated for mono- molecular cracking for n-hexane was calculated from data at low conversions and found to be 161 kJ/mol which matches well with the values presented by Dumesic and coworkers.</p>
<p>Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate constants for paraffin aromatization.</p>
<p>The model developed acknowledges the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, considers the existence of methoxy surface species, includes alkyl-lation reactions as discussed in Section 3.1.4, as well as postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions.</p>

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which often lead to the deactivation through β-H transfer. This process involves the breaking of a hydrogen atom from the alkene, which is then transferred to the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of a new surface complex. This repeated β-H transfer can lead to the gradual deactivation of the catalyst over time.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism of deactivation typically involves the formation of surface complexes that are prone to undergo intramolecular C-H bond activation. These complexes can rearrange through various pathways, often leading to the release of hydrogen and the formation of new alkene products. This can result in a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, ultimately causing its deactivation.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the gradual loss of β-H transfer capability can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the polymerization process, affecting the quality and yield of the final product. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the decreased activity and selectivity can result in a lower conversion rate and the formation of unwanted byproducts, impacting the overall economic viability of the process.

To mitigate these deactivation pathways, strategies such as catalyst regeneration, careful control of reaction conditions, and the development of more stable catalyst supports can be employed. These measures aim to prolong the catalyst's lifetime and maintain its optimal performance throughout the course of the reaction.

分析支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的内键氢键解活作用在镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂中的角色涉及理解这两种催化剂的具体机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，关键步骤包括形成π-乙基表面复合物，通常导致通过β-H转移的解活。这一过程涉及从烯烃断裂一个氢原子，并将其转移到催化剂表面，从而形成新的表面复合物。这种重复的β-H转移可能导致催化剂逐渐失活。

对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，解活机制通常涉及形成易于进行内键氢键解活的表面复合物。这些复合物可以通过多种途径重新排列，最终导致氢的释放和新烯烃产物的形成。这可能导致催化剂活性和选择性的降低，最终导致其失活。

这些解活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，逐渐失去β-H转移能力可能导致聚合过程效率下降，影响最终产品的质量和产量。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，活性和选择性的降低可能导致转化率下降和副产品的形成，影响过程的整体经济性。

为了减轻这些解活途径的影响，可以采取策略如催化剂再生、精确控制反应条件以及开发更稳定的催化剂支撑材料。这些措施旨在延长催化剂的使用寿命并保持其在反应过程中的最佳性能。
