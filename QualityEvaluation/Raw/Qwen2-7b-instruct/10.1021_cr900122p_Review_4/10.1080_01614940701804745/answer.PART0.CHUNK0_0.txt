[1] "Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas (140, 141) have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species."
[2] "In summary, although recent experimental (93, 94) studies have shown the existence of persistent carbenium ions in zeolites for molecules with high proton affinities and carbenium ions have also been proposed in recent theoretical studies (95) based on steric inaccessibility arguments, in general, strong coulombic interactions between the adsorbed intermediate and the catalyst surface substantially modify the geometry and reactivity of the adsorbed species and require that the stable intermediates in the heterogeneous acid-catalyzed transformations of hydrocarbons on zeolites are covalently bonded alkoxide intermediates."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, the literature highlights the importance of the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the literature does not provide specific details on the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in deactivation pathways. However, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes plays a crucial role. The β-H transfer from these complexes leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. The consequences of these deactivation pathways are significant on catalyst performance and longevity. They lead to a decline in activity and selectivity, necessitating frequent regeneration or replacement of the catalyst to maintain optimal performance in industrial applications.

The potential for intramolecular C-H bond activation to contribute to deactivation is acknowledged in the literature. The strong coulombic interactions between the adsorbed intermediates and the catalyst surface substantially modify the geometry and reactivity of the adsorbed species. This modification requires that the stable intermediates in the heterogeneous acid-catalyzed transformations of hydrocarbons on zeolites are covalently bonded alkoxide intermediates rather than carbenium ions. The persistence of carbenium ions in zeolites for molecules with high proton affinities is shown by recent experimental studies (93, 94). Additionally, theoretical studies (95) based on steric inaccessibility arguments propose the existence of carbenium ions. However, in general, the strong interactions between adsorbed intermediates and catalyst surfaces lead to modifications in the geometry and reactivity of these species, making covalently bonded alkoxide intermediates the stable forms in the catalytic process.

分析在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键激活的作用，文献强调了镧系/锕系基和硅支持的Re基催化剂中涉及的特定机制的重要性。这些过程的关键步骤包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，文献没有提供分子内C-H键激活在失活途径中的具体细节。然而，对于硅支持的Re基催化剂，π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成起着关键作用。从这些复合物转移β-H导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是重大的。它们导致活性和选择性的下降，需要频繁地再生或更换催化剂以维持最佳性能，在工业应用中。

文献承认分子内C-H键激活有可能促进催化剂的失活。强烈的库仑相互作用使得吸附中间体与催化剂表面的几何结构和反应性发生显著改变。这要求在沸石基酸催化转化中，稳定的中间体为共价键合的醇氧中间体，而不是碳正离子。最近的实验研究（93, 94）显示，对于具有高质子亲和力的分子，存在持续的碳正离子。此外，基于空间不可接近性论点的理论研究（95）提出存在碳正离子的存在。然而，总的来说，吸附中间体与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用导致这些物种的几何结构和反应性发生修改，使共价键合的醇氧中间体成为催化过程中的稳定形式。
