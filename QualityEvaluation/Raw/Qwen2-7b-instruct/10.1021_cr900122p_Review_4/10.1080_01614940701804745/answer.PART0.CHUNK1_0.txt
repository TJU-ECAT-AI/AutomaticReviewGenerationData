[1] "The authors noted an increase in catalytic activity when the Si/Al ratio decreased from 21.5 to 35.25 and attribute this to enhanced acidity, however; this explanation contradicts observations from several other experimental studies wherein no acidity change is observed with Si/Al ratio."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The authors observed an increase in catalytic activity when the Si/Al ratio went from 21.5 to 35.25, attributing it to increased acidity; however, this explanation conflicts with several other experimental studies showing no change in acidity with the Si/Al ratio.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

作者注意到当Si/Al比率从21.5降低到35.25时，催化活性增加，并将其归因于酸性的增强；然而，这一解释与多个其他实验研究的结果相矛盾，这些研究表明Si/Al比率的变化不会导致酸性的变化。
