<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves two distinct mechanisms, depending on whether the catalyst is lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is a key step in the deactivation process. Conversely, silica-supported Re-based catalysts utilize β-H transfer as a critical mechanism. These deactivation pathways can lead to reduced catalyst performance and shortened longevity due to the potential consequences of the processes involved.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。这取决于催化剂是镧系/锕系基还是以Re为基础的硅基催化剂。在镧系/锕系基催化剂中，形成π-邻二醇表面复合物是失活过程中的关键步骤。相反，以Re为基础的硅基催化剂利用β-H转移作为关键步骤。这些失活途径可能会导致催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短，这是由于过程中涉及的潜在后果。

[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been extensively studied. This process involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, which can lead to the loss of catalytic activity."
[2] "Comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the specific mechanisms of deactivation differ significantly. Lanthanide/actinide catalysts often deactivate through a different pathway than silica-supported Re-based catalysts due to their distinct structures and reactivity profiles."
[3] "The key steps in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These processes can alter the structure and reactivity of the catalyst, leading to a decline in its performance and longevity."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been explored. This process typically leads to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, which can cause the loss of catalytic activity. When comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, their specific deactivation mechanisms differ due to their distinct structures and reactivity profiles. The key steps in the deactivation process involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, which alter the catalyst's structure and reactivity, leading to a decline in its performance and longevity.

在受支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键激活的作用已经进行了广泛的研究。这一过程通常导致π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移的形成，这可能导致催化活性的丧失。当比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂时，它们的特定失活机制存在显著差异，这是由于它们独特的结构和反应性特征。失活过程的关键步骤涉及形成π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移，这些过程会改变催化剂的结构和反应性，从而导致其性能和寿命的下降。
