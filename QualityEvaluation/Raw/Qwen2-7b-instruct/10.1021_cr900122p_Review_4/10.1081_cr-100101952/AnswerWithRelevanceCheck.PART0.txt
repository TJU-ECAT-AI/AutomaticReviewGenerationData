          The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is discussed, with comparisons between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Key steps in these processes, such as the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, are highlighted. Potential consequences of these deactivation pathways, such as reduced catalyst performance and shortened longevity, are also mentioned.
