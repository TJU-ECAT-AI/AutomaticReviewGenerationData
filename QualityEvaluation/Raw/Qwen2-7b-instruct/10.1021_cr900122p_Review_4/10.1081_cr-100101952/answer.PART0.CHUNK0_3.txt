[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been extensively studied. This process involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, which can lead to the loss of catalytic activity."
[2] "Comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the specific mechanisms of deactivation differ significantly. Lanthanide/actinide catalysts often deactivate through a different pathway than silica-supported Re-based catalysts due to their distinct structures and reactivity profiles."
[3] "The key steps in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. These processes can alter the structure and reactivity of the catalyst, leading to a decline in its performance and longevity."

在受支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键激活的作用已经进行了广泛的研究。这一过程通常导致π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移的形成，这可能导致催化活性的丧失。当比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂时，它们的特定失活机制存在显著差异，这是由于它们独特的结构和反应性特征。失活过程的关键步骤涉及形成π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移，这些过程会改变催化剂的结构和反应性，从而导致其性能和寿命的下降。
