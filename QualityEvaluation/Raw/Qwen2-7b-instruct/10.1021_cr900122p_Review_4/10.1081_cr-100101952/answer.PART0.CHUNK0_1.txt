The document does not contain specific information regarding the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, particularly comparing the mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Therefore, an analysis of the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and an evaluation of the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity cannot be provided based on the available content.

文档中没有提供关于内间C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂失活中的作用的特定信息，特别是对于镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的机制比较。因此，无法基于可用内容分析这些过程的关键步骤，包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移，以及这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果的评估。
