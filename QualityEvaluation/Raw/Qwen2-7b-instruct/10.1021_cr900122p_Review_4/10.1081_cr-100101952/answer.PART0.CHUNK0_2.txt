The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves two distinct mechanisms, depending on whether the catalyst is lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is a key step in the deactivation process. Conversely, silica-supported Re-based catalysts utilize β-H transfer as a critical mechanism. These deactivation pathways can lead to reduced catalyst performance and shortened longevity due to the potential consequences of the processes involved.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。这取决于催化剂是镧系/锕系基还是以Re为基础的硅基催化剂。在镧系/锕系基催化剂中，形成π-邻二醇表面复合物是失活过程中的关键步骤。相反，以Re为基础的硅基催化剂利用β-H转移作为关键步骤。这些失活途径可能会导致催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短，这是由于过程中涉及的潜在后果。
