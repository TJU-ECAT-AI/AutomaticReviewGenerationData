The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the cleavage of the C-H bond within the π-allyl complex, leading to the loss of hydrogen and the formation of a new π-allyl species. This process can be catalyzed by a nearby metal center, facilitating the deactivation of the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, β-H transfer plays a crucial role in deactivation. In this process, a hydrogen atom from a β-position of an alkene is transferred to a transition metal center, leading to the formation of a carbene or a related species that can deactivate the catalyst. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity, necessitating the development of strategies to mitigate them.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属化催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，其涉及的具体机制有所不同。关键步骤包括π-二甲基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径通常涉及π-二甲基复合物中C-H键的断裂，导致氢的释放和新π-二甲基物种的形成。这一过程可能由附近的一个金属中心催化，从而导致催化剂的失活。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，β-H转移在失活过程中扮演着重要角色。在这个过程中，烯烃β位上的一个氢原子被转移至过渡金属中心，形成一种碳烯或相关物种，这可以导致催化剂的失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命产生显著影响，需要发展策略来减轻它们的影响。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through intramolecular C-H bond activation. This process leads to the formation of a π-allyl complex, which then undergoes β-H transfer, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism might differ due to the different nature of the metal and support. The β-H transfer step is crucial in both cases, leading to the loss of reactivity and eventual deactivation of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shorter longevity. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop strategies to mitigate deactivation and prolong catalyst life.

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts requires understanding the unique characteristics of these catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity.

On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones.

The key steps in these processes include the formation of surface complexes, which can then undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalysts. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop strategies to mitigate the deactivation and improve the overall catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can be severe, as they can lead to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement. Therefore, addressing these issues is crucial for advancing the field of catalysis, especially in the context of sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

分析异分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和裂解催化剂失活过程中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂涉及的具体机制，需要理解这些催化剂的独特特性。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活过程通常涉及π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成。这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。β-H转移通常从更受限的位置转移到更不受限的位置，这可能会破坏催化剂并降低其活性。

另一方面，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过不同的机制失活。尽管具体细节未在文献中详细说明，但可以预见，失活过程可能涉及表面复合物的形成以及随后的β-H转移。然而，由于Re基催化剂与镧系/锕系基催化剂的性质不同，因此具体的β-H转移路径可能有所不同。

这些过程的关键步骤包括形成表面复合物，然后这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能是严重的，因为它们可能导致目标产物产率下降、生产成本增加，并且由于需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂而对环境影响增大。因此，解决这些问题对于推进催化领域发展，特别是在可持续化学制造过程方面至关重要。

<p>Historically, the development of catalytic processes has been accomplished primarily by empirical trial and error.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the introduction of new catalytic processes by and large has preceded the corresponding molecular-level explanation of how they function.</p>
<p>The demands of new industrial processes are ever increasing; witness, for instance, the desire to selectively synthesize enantiopure chiral compounds for pharmaceutical and agricultural applications and for uses in the food industry.</p>
<p>A more extensive knowledge is require of the molecular details of catalysis, and better synthetic methods are also needed to prepare the catalyst that can satisfy the conditions identified by such basic studies.</p>
<p>Catalysis is now at a crossroad, where the old empirical procedures need to be substituted by a more molecularly driven designing approach.</p>
<p>Once a desired catalytic process has been chosen, basic chemical criteria need to be identified to define the requirements for the catalyst.</p>
<p>Those criteria are to be derived from fundamental mechanistic studies of surface reactions, which are being aided by the increasingly large pool of surface-sensitive analytical techniques developed in the last few decades.</p>
<p>In parallel, the paradigm of catalysis is shifting from a focus on increasing the rate of conversion of feedstocks to products in relatively simple reactions to an emphasis on improving the selectivity of catalysts to preferentially promote desirable reactions from complex manifolds of available pathways in more sophisticated synthetic processes.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the old catalyst preparation protocols have proven inadequate for the needs of new catalytic processes.</p>
<p>We believe that it is this synergy between the fields of modern surface science, computational chemistry, and materials synthesis that will usher the field of heterogeneous catalysis into a new modality where catalysts will be designed at a molecular level to selectively promote specific reactions in complex systems.</p>
<p>Controlling the size of the nanoparticles used for catalysis can lead to profound changes in catalytic behavior.</p>
<p>Some surface-science work has recently focused on addressing this issue.</p>
<p>In the case of gold cited above, for instance, a clear correlation has been reported between the size of gold particles dispersed on a titania support and both the magnitude of the electronic band gap of the metal and its catalytic activity for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>Another example of surface-science studies of reactivity dependence on nanoparticle size is that reported for CO and O2 adsorption on Pd/Fe3O4 model catalysts.</p>
<p>It has become clear that metal nanoparticles of dimensions of around a few nanometers are particularly active and can display much different chemistry than that observed with bulk samples of the same element.</p>
<p>Much of the surface-science work in this area to date has focused on simple oxidation reactions, but the potential is there to extend the research to other more complex catalytic systems.</p>
<p>It would be particularly interesting to direct this type of fundamental studies with surface-science tools and model catalyst samples to the investigation of changes in selectivity with particle size.</p>
<p>Controlling the size of the nanoparticles used for catalysis can lead to profound changes in catalytic behavior.</p>
<p>One very prominent example of this principle is that recently identified with gold: metallic gold is typically chemically inert, but when made into nanoparticles of only a few nanometers in diameter it can promote a great number of reactions under quite mild conditions.</p>
<p>It is critical to control particle size during the synthesis of those catalysts.</p>
<p>It was concluded that the observed trends are related to a quantum-size effect with respect to the thickness of the islands that gold forms on the support.</p>
<p>Another example of surface-science studies of reactivity dependence on nanoparticle size is that reported for CO and O2 adsorption on Pd/Fe3O4 model catalysts.</p>
<p>An atypically weak CO adsorption state was identified on very small Pd particles, on the order of a couple of nanometers in diameter (Fig. 1), attributable to a strong interaction with the support; those particles also displayed facile oxidation and reduction.</p>
<p>It has become clear that metal nanoparticles of dimensions of around a few nanometers are particularly active and can display much different chemistry than that observed with bulk samples of the same element.</p>
<p>Many heterogeneous catalysts require multiple functionalities to promote different individual reactions within a multiple-step process.</p>
<p>For instance, the metal phase is used mainly to promote hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, whereas acidity in the support is added to catalyze isomerization steps.</p>
<p>Electrocatalysts can be designed and optimized separately for each half-reaction.</p>
<p>Such division of labor is particularly common in photo- and electrochemically driven catalysis, processes that have regained much interest in recent times in connection with the harvesting and use of energy.</p>
<p>There is much room for improvement in the design of these nanostructured photocatalysts still.</p>
<p>Finally, new types of catalytic sites may develop at the interface of two or more different solid phases.</p>
<p>This may result in a desirable synergy leading to new catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>There are also many new challenges ahead in the field of catalysis in terms of the chemical reactions to be promoted.</p>
<p>Many old catalytic processes can certainly be improved, either by increasing their selectivity toward the desired reaction or by finding alternatives that require milder conditions, that is, lower pressures and/or temperatures.</p>
<p>There are certain practical applications for which catalysis is ideally suited.</p>
<p>Perhaps less discussed but equally important is the need of treatments to clean waste and ground waters.</p>
<p>On the energy production side, fuel cells are being implemented in many applications, including for the propulsion of automobiles, but their development has been hampered by a couple of key unresolved issues, specifically the ease with which the anode, where hydrogen is consumed, is poisoned by other gases (i.e., CO), and the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode.</p>
<p>There is much active research in all these catalytic issues in terms of the manufacturing and consumption of fuels, but new unforeseen transformative advances are still possible and needed.</p>
<p>Another area where catalysis excels is in addressing environmental remediation issues.</p>
<p>Another big challenge for catalysis is in the activation and use of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Lastly, it would be highly desirable to develop heterogeneous catalytic processes for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, for pharmaceutical, agro, and other (adhesives, additives, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, cutting fluids, dyes, lubricants, pigments) applications.</p>
<p>The ability to exert greater control on the nature of the active sites in catalysts affords the use of properties that were not accessible in the past.</p>
<p>Finally, molecular features can also be incorporated via the anchoring or tethering of those onto the surface of the support.</p>
<p>These new tools, together with a greater understanding of the underlying chemistry to be promoted, can be applied to a vast variety of chemicals problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives.</p>
<p>Catalysis is an old and well-established field of chemistry, but in many respects it is still in its adolescence and it is undergoing a renaissance; the future of molecularly-focused heterogeneous catalysis is bright.</p>

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, we find that both lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts undergo deactivation through distinct mechanisms involving π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway primarily involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which then undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to catalyst deactivation. This process is facilitated by the high reactivity of the metal centers in these catalysts, allowing for facile formation of reactive π-allyl intermediates.

In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts deactivate through a different mechanism, which also involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes but is characterized by a different β-H transfer process. The specific nature of the silica support and the electronic properties of the Re center influence the stability of the π-allyl complexes and the likelihood of β-H transfer events, thus affecting the deactivation kinetics and pathways.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity and selectivity over time, necessitating the development of strategies to mitigate deactivation and prolong catalyst life. This may involve the use of stabilizing additives, optimizing the catalyst formulation, or exploring alternative catalyst designs that reduce the propensity for β-H transfer and the formation of deleterious surface complexes.

In summary, the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, with implications for catalyst performance and longevity. Understanding and controlling these deactivation pathways is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency and sustainability in industrial applications.

在分析内嵌C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效中的作用时，我们发现镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂通过涉及π-亚基表面复合物和β-H转移的不同机制发生失效。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失效途径主要涉及形成π-亚基表面复合物，然后发生β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失效。这一过程得益于这些催化剂中金属中心的高度反应性，允许形成活性π-亚基中间体。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂通过不同的机制发生失效，也涉及形成π-亚基表面复合物，但其β-H转移过程具有不同的特性。支持物的特定性质和Re中心的电子性质影响π-亚基复合物的稳定性以及β-H转移事件的可能性，从而影响失效动力学和路径。

这些失效路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果包括随着时间推移活动性和选择性的降低，需要发展策略来减轻失效并延长催化剂寿命。这可能涉及使用稳定添加剂、优化催化剂配方或探索减少β-H转移倾向和形成有害表面复合物的催化剂设计。

总之，支撑烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失效涉及镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的差异机制，对催化剂性能和寿命有影响。理解并控制这些失效路径对于提高工业应用中的催化剂效率和可持续性至关重要。
