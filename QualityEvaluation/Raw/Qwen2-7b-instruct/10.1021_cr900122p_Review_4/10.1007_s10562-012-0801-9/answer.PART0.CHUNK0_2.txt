[1] "The ability to exert greater control on the nature of the active sites in catalysts affords the use of properties that were not accessible in the past."
[2] "Once potential effects in catalysis in terms of activity or selectivity versus surface structure are identified, preferably via basic studies using surface-science research and/or theoretical calculations, those surface structures may be realized by using the growing variety of synthetic routes available to make nanoparticles with specific shapes."
[3] "Much of the new nanomaterials synthetic methodology that has been developed over the last few years can be implemented to design complex nanoarchitectures for catalysis as well [28]."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not directly addressed in the literature. The text focuses on the use of nanoparticles, shapes, and supports in heterogeneous catalysis, but does not provide specifics on the mechanisms of deactivation pathways for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. It does not discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, nor does it evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an analysis based on the information provided.

文档中没有直接讨论支撑烯烃聚合和环化催化剂中内在分子C-H键活化在催化剂失活过程中的作用。文本主要关注纳米粒子、形状和支持物在异质催化中的应用，但没有提供关于镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的失活路径机制的具体信息。它也没有讨论这些过程的关键步骤，包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移，也没有评估这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在影响。因此，基于提供的信息，无法提供分析。
