<p>The ability to exert greater control on the nature of the active sites in catalysts affords the use of properties that were not accessible in the past.</p>
<p>We have discussed the role that the size and shape of nanoparticles of catalytic active phases may play in defining reaction selectivity.</p>
<p>We have also identified the different ways in which the manufacturing of better-defined supports can enhance catalytic performance, by defining the environment around the active site or by adding new functionality on the surface of the solid itself or at the interface between the two components.</p>
<p>Finally, molecular features can also be incorporated via the anchoring or tethering of those onto the surface of the support.</p>

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the cleavage of the C-H bond within the π-allyl complex, leading to the loss of hydrogen and the formation of a new π-allyl species. This process can be catalyzed by a nearby metal center, facilitating the deactivation of the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, β-H transfer plays a crucial role in deactivation. In this process, a hydrogen atom from a β-position of an alkene is transferred to a transition metal center, leading to the formation of a carbene or a related species that can deactivate the catalyst. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity, necessitating the development of strategies to mitigate them.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属化催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，其涉及的具体机制有所不同。关键步骤包括π-二甲基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径通常涉及π-二甲基复合物中C-H键的断裂，导致氢的释放和新π-二甲基物种的形成。这一过程可能由附近的一个金属中心催化，从而导致催化剂的失活。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，β-H转移在失活过程中扮演着重要角色。在这个过程中，烯烃β位上的一个氢原子被转移至过渡金属中心，形成一种碳烯或相关物种，这可以导致催化剂的失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命产生显著影响，需要发展策略来减轻它们的影响。
