Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway typically involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes through intramolecular C-H bond activation. This process leads to the formation of a π-allyl complex, which then undergoes β-H transfer, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism might differ due to the different nature of the metal and support. The β-H transfer step is crucial in both cases, leading to the loss of reactivity and eventual deactivation of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shorter longevity. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop strategies to mitigate deactivation and prolong catalyst life.

分析内部分子C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的作用，涉及了解镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂中涉及的具体机制。镧系/锕系基催化剂的失活途径通常涉及通过内部分子C-H键活化形成π-烯丙基表面复合物。这一过程导致形成π-烯丙基复合物，然后进行β-H转移，导致催化剂失活。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，由于金属和载体的不同性质，机制可能有所不同。β-H转移步骤在两种情况下都是关键的，导致活性丧失和催化剂最终失活。这些失活路径的潜在后果包括催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短。通过理解这些机制，研究人员可以开发策略来减轻失活并延长催化剂寿命。
