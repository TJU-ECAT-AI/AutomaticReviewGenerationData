[1] "In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, there is still a need to improve on the performance of many old catalytic processes, for the production and processing of basic feedstocks and commodity chemicals."
[2] "New processes are also desirable to tackle issues associated with the management of energy and with environmental problems."
[3] "Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts requires understanding the unique characteristics of these catalysts. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity.

On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones.

The key steps in these processes include the formation of surface complexes, which can then undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalysts. These deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop strategies to mitigate the deactivation and improve the overall catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can be severe, as they can lead to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement. Therefore, addressing these issues is crucial for advancing the field of catalysis, especially in the context of sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

分析异分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和裂解催化剂失活过程中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂涉及的具体机制，需要理解这些催化剂的独特特性。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活过程通常涉及π-烯丙基表面复合物的形成。这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。β-H转移通常从更受限的位置转移到更不受限的位置，这可能会破坏催化剂并降低其活性。

另一方面，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过不同的机制失活。尽管具体细节未在文献中详细说明，但可以预见，失活过程可能涉及表面复合物的形成以及随后的β-H转移。然而，由于Re基催化剂与镧系/锕系基催化剂的性质不同，因此具体的β-H转移路径可能有所不同。

这些过程的关键步骤包括形成表面复合物，然后这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响可能是严重的，因为它们可能导致目标产物产率下降、生产成本增加，并且由于需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂而对环境影响增大。因此，解决这些问题对于推进催化领域发展，特别是在可持续化学制造过程方面至关重要。
