[1] "The reaction is quite efficient and, to our knowledge, unprecedented. In batch reactions, methane conversions as high as 50% at 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (43% yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) and molar productivity rates of 1O-7 mol cm-3 s-1 with Hg(II) turnover frequencies of 10-3 s-' have been observed (21)."
[2] "Three key steps in the catalytic sequence have been established. The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to produce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1. This species then decomposes to the product and the reduced species, mercurous bisulfate, in the functionalization step."
[4] "In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate."

The mercury-catalyzed system for the oxidation of methane to methanol involves several key steps. Firstly, methane undergoes an electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate, forming methyl mercuric bisulfate (1). This species then decomposes in the functionalization step, producing the product and reducing to mercurous bisulfate. Finally, in the reoxidation step, mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate. This catalytic cycle completes the conversion of methane to methanol efficiently under mild conditions.

该汞催化系统将甲烷氧化为甲醇涉及几个关键步骤。首先，甲烷与汞酸二硫化物发生亲电取代反应，形成甲基汞酸二硫化物（1）。然后，在功能化步骤中，这种物种分解产生产物并还原为亚汞酸二硫化物。最后，在氧化步骤中，亚汞酸二硫化物被硫酸氧化，再生汞酸二硫化物。这一催化循环在温和条件下高效地完成了甲烷到甲醇的转换。
