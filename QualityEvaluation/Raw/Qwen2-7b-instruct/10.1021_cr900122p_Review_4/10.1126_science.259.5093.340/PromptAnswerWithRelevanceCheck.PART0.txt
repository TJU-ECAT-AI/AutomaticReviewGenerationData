Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

[1] "Three key steps in the catalytic sequence have been established. The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[2] "The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to pro- duce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1."
[3] "In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate."
[4] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation."

The literature describes a system where mercury ions catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol. The key steps involve the activation of methane through an electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate, forming methyl mercuric bisulfate. Subsequently, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate. The methyl bisulfate produced can be hydrolyzed to form methanol.

[1] "The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50 percent, 85 percent selectivity to methyl bisulfate (-43 percent yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of 10-7 mole per cubic centimeter per second and Hg(ll) turnover frequency of 10-3 per second."
[2] "The keys to this discovery are the novel use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane through an electro- philic displacement reaction (10) and the production of the monomethyl ester of sul- furic acid, methyl bisulfate, as a methanol precursor that is less reactive than meth- ane."
[3] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation:"
[4] "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of methanol produced from '3C-enriched methane confirmed that the methanol is produced from the oxidation of methane (and not some carbon-containing contam- inant)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mercury-catalyzed system for the oxidation of methane to methanol involves several key steps. Firstly, the reaction proceeds efficiently under mild conditions with mercuric ions (Hg(ll)) acting as the catalyst. The mechanism involves an electrophilic displacement reaction where methane is converted to methyl bisulfate (CH30SO3H), which is a less reactive precursor to methanol. The reaction produces sulfur dioxide (SO2) and water (H2O) as byproducts. The selectivity towards methyl bisulfate reaches 85% at a methane conversion rate of 50%. The methyl bisulfate is then hydrolyzed to produce methanol. This system is advantageous due to its potential practicality in converting methane to methanol using molecular oxygen, which is more environmentally friendly than high-temperature conversion methods. The GC-MS analysis of isolated methanol samples confirms that it is derived solely from the methane oxidation process, indicating no contamination issues.

该汞催化系统在温和条件下，利用二价汞（Hg(ll)）作为催化剂，实现了甲烷向甲醇的氧化。该过程的关键步骤包括通过亲电取代反应将甲烷转化为甲基硫酸酯（CH30SO3H），这是一种比甲烷更不活泼的甲醇前体。反应产物包括二氧化硫（SO2）和水（H2O）。在50%的甲烷转化率下，甲基硫酸酯的选择性达到85%。该系统的优势在于其可能的实用性，可以使用分子氧将甲烷转化为甲醇，这比高温转换方法更为环保。通过气相色谱-质谱法（GC-MS）分析分离出的甲醇样品，确认了甲醇仅来源于甲烷氧化过程，表明不存在污染问题。

In batch reactions, methane conversions as high as 50% at 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (43% yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) and molar productivity rates of 1O-7 mol cm-3 s-1 with Hg(II) turnover frequencies of 10-3 s-' have been observed (21)."

The mercury-catalyzed system enables the selective oxidation of methane to methanol through methyl bisulfate, a less reactive precursor to methanol. The methyl bisulfate can be easily hydrolyzed to produce methanol, which can be isolated by distillation. GC-MS analysis of the isolated methanol from '3C-enriched methane confirms that the methanol is produced exclusively from methane, not any carbon-containing contaminants.
