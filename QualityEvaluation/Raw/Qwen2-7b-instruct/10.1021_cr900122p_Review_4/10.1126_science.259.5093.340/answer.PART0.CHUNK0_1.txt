[1] "The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50 percent, 85 percent selectivity to methyl bisulfate (-43 percent yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of 10-7 mole per cubic centimeter per second and Hg(ll) turnover frequency of 10-3 per second."
[2] "The keys to this discovery are the novel use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane through an electro- philic displacement reaction (10) and the production of the monomethyl ester of sul- furic acid, methyl bisulfate, as a methanol precursor that is less reactive than meth- ane."
[3] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation:"
[4] "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of methanol produced from '3C-enriched methane confirmed that the methanol is produced from the oxidation of methane (and not some carbon-containing contam- inant)."

The mercury-catalyzed system for the oxidation of methane to methanol involves several key steps. Firstly, the reaction proceeds efficiently under mild conditions with mercuric ions (Hg(ll)) acting as the catalyst. The mechanism involves an electrophilic displacement reaction where methane is converted to methyl bisulfate (CH30SO3H), which is a less reactive precursor to methanol. The reaction produces sulfur dioxide (SO2) and water (H2O) as byproducts. The selectivity towards methyl bisulfate reaches 85% at a methane conversion rate of 50%. The methyl bisulfate is then hydrolyzed to produce methanol. This system is advantageous due to its potential practicality in converting methane to methanol using molecular oxygen, which is more environmentally friendly than high-temperature conversion methods. The GC-MS analysis of isolated methanol samples confirms that it is derived solely from the methane oxidation process, indicating no contamination issues.

该汞催化系统在温和条件下，利用二价汞（Hg(ll)）作为催化剂，实现了甲烷向甲醇的氧化。该过程的关键步骤包括通过亲电取代反应将甲烷转化为甲基硫酸酯（CH30SO3H），这是一种比甲烷更不活泼的甲醇前体。反应产物包括二氧化硫（SO2）和水（H2O）。在50%的甲烷转化率下，甲基硫酸酯的选择性达到85%。该系统的优势在于其可能的实用性，可以使用分子氧将甲烷转化为甲醇，这比高温转换方法更为环保。通过气相色谱-质谱法（GC-MS）分析分离出的甲醇样品，确认了甲醇仅来源于甲烷氧化过程，表明不存在污染问题。
