[1] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen."
[2] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the methanol can be isolated by distillation:"
[3] "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of methanol produced from '3C-enriched methane confirmed that the methanol is produced from the oxidation of methane (and not some carbon-containing contaminant)."

The mercury-catalyzed system enables the selective oxidation of methane to methanol through methyl bisulfate, a less reactive precursor to methanol. The methyl bisulfate can be easily hydrolyzed to produce methanol, which can be isolated by distillation. GC-MS analysis of the isolated methanol from '3C-enriched methane confirms that the methanol is produced exclusively from methane, not any carbon-containing contaminants.

汞催化系统使甲烷的选择性氧化为甲醇通过甲基硫酸盐，甲基硫酸盐是一个更不活泼的甲醇前体。甲基硫酸盐可以容易地水解生成甲醇，然后可以通过蒸馏进行分离。从富碳-3C的甲烷中分离出的甲醇的GC-MS分析证实，甲醇仅由甲烷产生，而不是任何碳含量的污染物。
