[1] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen."
[2] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the methanol can be isolated by distillation:"
[3] "The catalyzed oxidation of methane by mercuric ions is a remarkably efficient reaction."
[4] "Understanding the molecular basis for such a system would be valuable to the continuing search for even more efficient methane oxidation catalysts."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not covered in the provided document. The document focuses on the development of a mercury-catalyzed system for the oxidation of methane to methanol, rather than discussing the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation in alkene polymerization or metathesis reactions.
