[1] "Three key steps in the catalytic sequence have been established. The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[2] "The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to pro- duce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1."
[3] "In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate."
[4] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation."

The literature describes a system where mercury ions catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol. The key steps involve the activation of methane through an electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate, forming methyl mercuric bisulfate. Subsequently, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate. The methyl bisulfate produced can be hydrolyzed to form methanol.

文献描述了一个系统，其中汞离子催化甲烷氧化为甲醇。关键步骤涉及通过甲基汞硫酸盐与亲电置换反应激活甲烷，形成甲基汞硫酸盐。随后，亚汞硫酸盐被硫酸氧化，再生汞硫酸盐。产生的甲基硫酸盐可以水解形成甲醇。
