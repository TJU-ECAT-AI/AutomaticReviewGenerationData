[1] "Based on the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces, we have provided a molecular level discussion of the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis."
[2] "It was only after theoretical methods based on density functional theory calculations were developed into a semi-quantitative tool in describing surface reactivity,22 and the calculations were coupled to careful experiments, that it became clear that there could be many orders of magnitude differences in reaction rates for different surface structures."
[3] "For transition metals, it has been found quite generally that the d-band centerthe first moment of the density of states projected onto the d-orbitals for the surface atoms interacting with the adsorbatesis a good measure of the ability of the atoms in question to form bonds to an adsorbate."
[4] "Often close-packed surfaces give the highest and very open structures like steps the lowest values of b, but this need not be so for all molecules."
[5] "The relative importance of two sites k and l is given by rk rl AkeEak=kT AleEal=kT"
[6] "From the discussion in the previous section, it is clear that there often exists a linear relation between the barrier for dissociative chemisorption, Ea1, and the dissociative chemi- sorption energy, DE, and that an equivalent relation often exists for the removal step."
[7] "We thus conclude that the BEP relations for surface reac- tions directly entail volcano relations for the catalytic rate as a function of surface reactivity, and that there is ample reason for describing the surface reactivity in terms of the dissociative chemisorption energy of the key reactants."
[8] "Fig. 5 suggests a set of rules for determining the nature of the active site. For metals on the right leg of the volcano (noble metals), the steps are always the most active."
[9] "The degree of structure sensitivity can be quantified using the term 'degree of structure sensitivity', which is defined based on the relative importance of different surface geometries in the reaction rate."
[10] "For metals on the left leg of the volcano (reactive metals), it depends on the degree of structure sensitivity of the elementary step whether the reaction will appear structure sensitive or not."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These processes typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The deactivation pathways can significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity. The degree of structure sensitivity in these reactions can be quantified using the term 'degree of structure sensitivity', which helps in understanding the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis. The nature of the active sites varies across different types of catalysts, and this variation influences the catalytic activity as a function of particle size. The BEP relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces provide a molecular-level discussion of the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis. These relations determine the trends in catalytic activity from one metal to the next through volcano relationships and identify the structural effects that contribute to the overall catalytic rate.
