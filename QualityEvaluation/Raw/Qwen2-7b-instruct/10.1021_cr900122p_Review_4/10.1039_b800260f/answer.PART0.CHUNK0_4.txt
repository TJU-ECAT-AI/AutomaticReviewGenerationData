The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not directly addressed in the provided literature. The document discusses the nature of active sites in heterogeneous metal catalysis, the relationship between surface reactivity and catalytic activity, and the influence of particle size on catalytic performance. It does not delve into the specifics of C-H bond activation or its impact on the deactivation of catalysts for alkene polymerization and metathesis.

However, the principles discussed in the text can be applied to understand C-H bond activation in the context of catalyst deactivation. Typically, in metal-catalyzed polymerization and metathesis reactions, C-H bonds of the alkene substrate can activate upon adsorption on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates. These intermediates can undergo various reactivities, including deactivation pathways, which might involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The specifics of these processes depend on the catalyst type, such as lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, and the nature of the substrate.

The document highlights the importance of understanding the structure-sensitivity of catalytic reactions, which could be crucial in elucidating the mechanisms behind C-H bond activation and its impact on catalyst performance and longevity. By considering the electronic and geometric effects on the active sites, researchers can gain insights into the factors influencing the deactivation pathways and potentially design catalysts with improved stability and efficiency.

To address the deactivation of specific catalysts, further investigation into the reaction mechanisms, the role of surface chemistry, and the influence of catalyst structure and composition would be required. This might involve detailed surface science techniques, kinetic studies, and computational modeling to dissect the specific pathways involved in C-H bond activation and subsequent deactivation.

本文没有直接讨论烷基聚合和环化催化剂支持下C-H键活化在催化剂失活中的作用。文档讨论了异质金属催化反应中活性位点的性质，表面反应性与催化活性之间的关系，以及颗粒尺寸对催化性能的影响。它没有深入探讨C-H键活化及其对烷基聚合和环化催化剂失活的具体过程。

然而，根据文本中讨论的原则，可以应用于理解C-H键活化在催化剂失活背景下的上下文。通常，在金属催化的聚合和环化反应中，烷基的C-H键在催化剂表面上吸附时会活化，导致形成活性中间体。这些中间体可能经历各种反应性，包括可能导致催化剂失活的路径，如π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。这些过程的具体细节取决于催化剂类型（如镧系/锕系基或硅基Re基催化剂）和底物的性质。

文档强调了理解催化反应结构敏感性的意义，这可能有助于揭示C-H键活化及其对催化剂性能和寿命影响的机制。通过考虑活性位点的电子效应和几何效应，研究人员可以获得洞察力，了解影响失活途径的因素，并有可能设计具有改进稳定性和效率的催化剂。

要解决特定催化剂的失活问题，需要进一步调查反应机理、表面化学的影响、催化剂结构和组成的性质。这可能涉及详细表面科学技术、动力学研究和计算建模，以解析C-H键活化和随后失活的具体路径。
