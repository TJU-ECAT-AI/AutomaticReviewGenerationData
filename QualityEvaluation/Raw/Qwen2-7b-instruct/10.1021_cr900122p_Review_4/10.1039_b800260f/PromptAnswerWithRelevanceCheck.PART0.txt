[1] "Based on the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces, we have provided a molecular level discussion of the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis."
[2] "It was only after theoretical methods based on density functional theory calculations were developed into a semi-quantitative tool in describing surface reactivity,22 and the calculations were coupled to careful experiments, that it became clear that there could be many orders of magnitude differences in reaction rates for different surface structures."
[3] "For transition metals, it has been found quite generally that the d-band centerthe first moment of the density of states projected onto the d-orbitals for the surface atoms interacting with the adsorbatesis a good measure of the ability of the atoms in question to form bonds to an adsorbate."
[4] "Often close-packed surfaces give the highest and very open structures like steps the lowest values of b, but this need not be so for all molecules."
[5] "The relative importance of two sites k and l is given by rk rl AkeEak=kT AleEal=kT"
[6] "From the discussion in the previous section, it is clear that there often exists a linear relation between the barrier for dissociative chemisorption, Ea1, and the dissociative chemi- sorption energy, DE, and that an equivalent relation often exists for the removal step."
[7] "We thus conclude that the BEP relations for surface reac- tions directly entail volcano relations for the catalytic rate as a function of surface reactivity, and that there is ample reason for describing the surface reactivity in terms of the dissociative chemisorption energy of the key reactants."
[8] "Fig. 5 suggests a set of rules for determining the nature of the active site. For metals on the right leg of the volcano (noble metals), the steps are always the most active."
[9] "The degree of structure sensitivity can be quantified using the term 'degree of structure sensitivity', which is defined based on the relative importance of different surface geometries in the reaction rate."
[10] "For metals on the left leg of the volcano (reactive metals), it depends on the degree of structure sensitivity of the elementary step whether the reaction will appear structure sensitive or not."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These processes typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The deactivation pathways can significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity. The degree of structure sensitivity in these reactions can be quantified using the term 'degree of structure sensitivity', which helps in understanding the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis. The nature of the active sites varies across different types of catalysts, and this variation influences the catalytic activity as a function of particle size. The BEP relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces provide a molecular-level discussion of the nature of the active sites in metal catalysis. These relations determine the trends in catalytic activity from one metal to the next through volcano relationships and identify the structural effects that contribute to the overall catalytic rate.

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, discussing the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluating the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity, requires a detailed examination of the literature.

However, the provided document does not contain information on the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, specifically focusing on the mechanisms involving lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. It discusses topics related to surface science and heterogeneous catalysis, such as the nature of active sites, Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi relations, volcano curves, and the classification of structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes or information to answer the question directly from the document.

To address the question, one would need to consult research articles specifically focused on the deactivation mechanisms of the mentioned catalysts, including details on the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, and the impact on catalyst performance and longevity.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not directly addressed in the provided literature. The document discusses the nature of active sites in heterogeneous metal catalysis, the relationship between surface reactivity and catalytic activity, and the influence of particle size on catalytic performance. It does not delve into the specifics of C-H bond activation or its impact on the deactivation of catalysts for alkene polymerization and metathesis.

However, the principles discussed in the text can be applied to understand C-H bond activation in the context of catalyst deactivation. Typically, in metal-catalyzed polymerization and metathesis reactions, C-H bonds of the alkene substrate can activate upon adsorption on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates. These intermediates can undergo various reactivities, including deactivation pathways, which might involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The specifics of these processes depend on the catalyst type, such as lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, and the nature of the substrate.

The document highlights the importance of understanding the structure-sensitivity of catalytic reactions, which could be crucial in elucidating the mechanisms behind C-H bond activation and its impact on catalyst performance and longevity. By considering the electronic and geometric effects on the active sites, researchers can gain insights into the factors influencing the deactivation pathways and potentially design catalysts with improved stability and efficiency.

To address the deactivation of specific catalysts, further investigation into the reaction mechanisms, the role of surface chemistry, and the influence of catalyst structure and composition would be required. This might involve detailed surface science techniques, kinetic studies, and computational modeling to dissect the specific pathways involved in C-H bond activation and subsequent deactivation.

本文没有直接讨论烷基聚合和环化催化剂支持下C-H键活化在催化剂失活中的作用。文档讨论了异质金属催化反应中活性位点的性质，表面反应性与催化活性之间的关系，以及颗粒尺寸对催化性能的影响。它没有深入探讨C-H键活化及其对烷基聚合和环化催化剂失活的具体过程。

然而，根据文本中讨论的原则，可以应用于理解C-H键活化在催化剂失活背景下的上下文。通常，在金属催化的聚合和环化反应中，烷基的C-H键在催化剂表面上吸附时会活化，导致形成活性中间体。这些中间体可能经历各种反应性，包括可能导致催化剂失活的路径，如π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。这些过程的具体细节取决于催化剂类型（如镧系/锕系基或硅基Re基催化剂）和底物的性质。

文档强调了理解催化反应结构敏感性的意义，这可能有助于揭示C-H键活化及其对催化剂性能和寿命影响的机制。通过考虑活性位点的电子效应和几何效应，研究人员可以获得洞察力，了解影响失活途径的因素，并有可能设计具有改进稳定性和效率的催化剂。

要解决特定催化剂的失活问题，需要进一步调查反应机理、表面化学的影响、催化剂结构和组成的性质。这可能涉及详细表面科学技术、动力学研究和计算建模，以解析C-H键活化和随后失活的具体路径。
