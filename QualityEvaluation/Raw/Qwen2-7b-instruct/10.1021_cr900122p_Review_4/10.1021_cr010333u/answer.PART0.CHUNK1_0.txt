The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts varies significantly between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts often deactivate via the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. Conversely, silica-supported Re-based catalysts deplete their activity through β-H transfer. These deactivation pathways can result in a decline in catalytic efficacy and accelerate the degradation of the catalysts over time.

支持型烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活机制在镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂之间存在显著差异。镧系/锕系基催化剂的失活通常涉及表面π-异丙基复合物的形成。相反，二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂通过β-H转移导致活性丧失。这些失活途径可能导致催化剂效能下降，并加速催化剂的老化过程。
