The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is primarily twofold. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the activation leads to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, whereas in silica-supported Re-based catalysts, β-H transfer plays a central role. These mechanisms ultimately result in the deactivation of the catalysts by creating surface-bound species that inhibit further polymerization or metathesis reactions. The key steps involve the activation of C-H bonds, the creation of surface complexes, and the subsequent deactivation through complex formation. The consequences of these deactivation pathways are detrimental to catalyst performance and longevity, necessitating the exploration of more resilient catalyst designs.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键活化起着关键作用。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，活化导致π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成；而对于二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂，则是通过β-H转移起作用。这些机制最终导致催化剂失活，因为它们形成了抑制进一步聚合或金属易位反应的表面结合物种。关键步骤包括C-H键的激活、表面复合物的形成以及随后通过复合形成失活。这些失活途径的后果对催化剂性能和寿命不利，需要探索更耐用的催化剂设计。
