The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not extensively detailed in the provided literature. However, focusing on the context given, the deactivation of lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts might involve similar mechanisms, yet the specifics might differ based on the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, deactivation could potentially occur through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer reactions. These reactions can lead to the stabilization of transition metal complexes on the surface of the catalyst, which can deactivate the catalyst over time. The β-H transfer is a common mechanism in which hydrogen atoms are transferred from a hydrogen-bearing substrate to a transition metal center, leading to the formation of a metal hydride and the substrate's transformation into a new product.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, deactivation might also involve π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the nature of the support (silica) could influence the stability of the complexes and the rate of β-H transfer reactions. The silica support might alter the electronic properties of the metal center, affecting the reactivity and stability of the complexes. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity would depend on factors such as the rate of deactivation, the extent of deactivation, and the efficiency of the catalyst regeneration or replacement.

In summary, the deactivation of lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts might involve similar mechanisms such as the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer reactions. The specifics of these processes, including the details of the reaction pathways and the factors influencing catalyst stability, would depend on the nature of the catalyst and the support material.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity would depend on the rate of deactivation, the extent of deactivation, and the efficiency of catalyst regeneration or replacement. Faster deactivation rates and higher extents of deactivation could lead to decreased catalyst performance and shorter lifetimes. Efficient regeneration or replacement strategies would be necessary to maintain optimal catalytic activity and prolong catalyst life.

在提供的文献中，关于内部分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂失活中的作用的描述并不详细。然而，基于给定的上下文，镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的失活可能涉及类似的机制，但具体细节可能会根据催化剂的性质和反应条件的不同而有所不同。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活可能通过形成π-亚甲基表面复合物，随后发生β-H转移反应来实现。这些反应可能导致表面过渡金属中心上稳定复合物的形成，从而随着时间的推移使催化剂失效。β-H转移是一个常见的机制，在这种机制中，氢原子从带氢的底物转移到过渡金属中心，导致形成金属氢化物以及底物转化为新产物。

对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，失活也可能涉及π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移。然而，支撑材料（二氧化硅）的性质可能会影响复合物的稳定性以及β-H转移反应的速度。二氧化硅支撑材料可能会改变金属中心的电子特性，影响复合物的反应性和稳定性。这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果将取决于失活速度、失活程度以及催化剂再生或替换的效率。

简而言之，镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的失活可能涉及类似的机制，如形成π-亚甲基表面复合物和β-H转移反应。这些过程的具体细节，包括反应途径的细节以及影响催化剂稳定性的因素，将取决于催化剂和支撑材料的性质。

这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果将取决于失活速度、失活程度以及催化剂再生或替换的效率。更快的失活速率和更高的失活程度可能导致降低催化剂性能和缩短催化剂寿命。需要有效的再生或替换策略来维持最佳催化活性并延长催化剂寿命。
