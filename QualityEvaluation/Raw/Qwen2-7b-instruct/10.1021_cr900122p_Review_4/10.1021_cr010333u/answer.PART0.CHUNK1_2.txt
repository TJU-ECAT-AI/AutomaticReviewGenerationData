The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts usually involves intramolecular C-H bond activation. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this process typically forms π-allyl surface complexes. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, β-H transfer acts as the principal step in the deactivation pathway. These mechanisms can result in the loss of catalytic activity and reduce the catalysts' lifespan.

支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失效通常涉及分子内C-H键活化。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，这个过程通常形成π-烯丙基表面复合物。对于硅支持的铼基催化剂，β-H转移是失效路径的主要步骤。这些机制可能导致催化活性丧失并缩短催化剂寿命。
