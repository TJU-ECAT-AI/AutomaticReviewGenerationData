1. The stability issues of vanadium-containing catalysts limit their application in liquid-phase reactions despite their inherent activity in catalytic oxidations. This is because the lack of stability affects the longevity and efficiency of the catalysts in these conditions.

2. Transition metals that react through peroxometalic species include titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W).

3. For the production of bulk products, air or oxygen are commonly used as oxidants. However, when the added value of the product increases, more expensive oxidants with higher active oxygen content can be utilized.

4. Polyoxovanadate has been found to be an active catalyst for converting highly toxic mustard gas bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide into less toxic sulfoxides through the use of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP).

5. It is well documented that soluble Lewis acids can act as promoters in oxidation reactions, and examples of this will be discussed in the relevant section.

6. The electron abstraction capacity of Lewis acids, such as the ability to lower the oxidation potential of benzene, is influenced by the strength of the association between the acid and the substrate. 

7. The stability issues of vanadium-based catalysts restrict their utilization in liquid-phase reactions, despite their inherent catalytic activity in oxidation processes. This is due to the lack of stability affecting the catalyst's performance in these conditions.

1. 虽然钒基催化剂在催化氧化反应中具有内在活性，但由于稳定性问题限制了它们在液相反应中的应用。这影响了催化剂的寿命和效率。

2. 反应过氧金属物种的过渡金属包括钛（Ti）、锆（Zr）、钼（Mo）和钨（W）。

3. 生产大宗产品时，通常使用空气或氧气作为氧化剂。然而，当产品的附加值增加时，可以使用更昂贵、活性更高的氧化剂。

4. 聚氧钒酸盐已被发现是一种有效的催化剂，能够通过叔丁醇过氧化氢（TBHP）将高度有毒的芥子气体二（2-氯乙基）硫化物转化为较无害的砜类化合物。

5. 已经明确，可溶性路易斯酸可以在氧化反应中起促进作用，并将在相关部分提供实例。

6. 钒酸盐的电子抽取能力，如降低苯的氧化电势的能力，受酸与基质之间结合强度的影响。

7. 钒基催化剂的稳定性问题限制了它们在液相反应中的应用，尽管这些催化剂在氧化过程中的活性很高。这是由于缺乏稳定性影响了催化剂在这些条件下的性能。
