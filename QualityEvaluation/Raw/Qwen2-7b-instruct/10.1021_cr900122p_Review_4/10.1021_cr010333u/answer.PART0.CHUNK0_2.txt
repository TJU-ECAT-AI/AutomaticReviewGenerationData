[1] "The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts can be attributed to several mechanisms, including the intramolecular C-H bond activation."
[2] "Specifically, the key steps involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer."
[3] "Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts can undergo deactivation via β-H transfer, where the catalyst's active site donates a hydrogen atom to a C-H bond within the catalyst itself."
[4] "Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, might deactivate through a similar β-H transfer mechanism, but with the additional consideration of the reactivity of the supported rhenium species."
[5] "These deactivation pathways can significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity, necessitating careful control over the catalyst's composition and operating conditions to mitigate such issues."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts undergo deactivation via β-H transfer, where the catalyst's active site donates a hydrogen atom to a C-H bond within the catalyst itself. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a similar β-H transfer mechanism, but with the additional consideration of the reactivity of the supported rhenium species.

在支持的烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活中，内部分子C-H键激活的作用涉及π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。镧系/锕系基催化剂通过β-H转移进行失活，其中催化剂的活性位点向催化剂自身内的C-H键捐赠氢原子。硅基载铼催化剂可能通过类似β-H转移机制进行失活，但需要考虑支持的铼物种的活性。这些失活途径会显著影响催化剂的性能和寿命，需要仔细控制催化剂的组成和操作条件来减轻此类问题。
