[1] "The intramolecular C-H bond activation is a crucial step in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts."
[2] "For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the process involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which subsequently undergo β-H transfer."
[3] "In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts also involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, but the β-H transfer step differs significantly."
[4] "The β-H transfer leads to the release of hydrogen and the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, which is detrimental to the catalyst's performance and longevity."

1. Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a critical role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. 
2. In lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this process begins with the creation of π-allyl surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer.  
3. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts also form π-allyl surface complexes, yet the β-H transfer step exhibits distinct characteristics.  
4. The β-H transfer results in hydrogen release and the creation of a new carbon-carbon bond, negatively impacting the catalyst's efficiency and durability.
