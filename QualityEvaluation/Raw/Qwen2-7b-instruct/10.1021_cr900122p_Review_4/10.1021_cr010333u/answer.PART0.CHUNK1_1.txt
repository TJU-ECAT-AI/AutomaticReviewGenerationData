[1] "Alkane oxidation with dioxygen through a radical mechanism is generally referred to as autoxidation and suffers from the relatively harsh conditions to be initiated and very low selectivity, due to secondary reactions of the primary products."
[2] "Alkane activation on a solid surface requires the presence of strong acid or basic sites."
[3] "Enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and non-heme, iron-based oxidase are able to carry out selectively the oxyfunctionalization of alkanes with O2."
[4] "Inorganic catalysts such as transition metal complexes and metal substituted polyoxometalates either in homogeneous phase or supported on a solid carrier by anchoring in mesoporous materials or by encapsulation in microporous molecular sieves are effective when using oxidants such as iodosylbenzene, alkyl hydroperoxides, and hydrogen peroxide,283,284,553-558 and can, in some cases, also use molecular oxygen as oxidant. 559-562"

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a complex phenomenon that varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes often leads to deactivation through β-H transfer reactions. This process involves the stabilization of a π-allyl intermediate, which can then undergo β-H elimination to regenerate the catalyst. However, this regeneration is often inefficient, leading to a gradual loss of catalyst activity over time. On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, which are widely used in olefin polymerization and metathesis, can also suffer from deactivation mechanisms. These catalysts can deactivate through the formation of surface complexes that are prone to undergo β-H transfer, leading to the loss of catalytic activity. The key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, and the regeneration of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include a decrease in catalyst performance and longevity, affecting the efficiency and economics of industrial processes.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the gradual loss of activity can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity in industrial settings. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanisms can result in decreased product quality, increased waste generation, and higher operational costs. To mitigate these issues, researchers and engineers often focus on improving catalyst design, optimizing operating conditions, and developing strategies for catalyst recycling and regeneration. This includes exploring new catalyst supports, modifying catalyst formulations, and implementing advanced process technologies to enhance catalyst stability and efficiency.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键的活化起着复杂的作用，这种作用在镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂之间有所不同。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，π-二烯醇表面复合物的形成往往导致通过β-H转移反应导致失活。这个过程涉及稳定π-二烯醇中间体，然后可以通过β-H消除来再生催化剂。然而，这种再生通常是低效的，导致催化剂活性逐渐下降。另一方面，广泛用于烯烃聚合和金属迁移的二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂也可能遭受失活机制。这些催化剂可以通过形成易于发生β-H转移的表面复合物而失活，从而导致催化活性的丧失。这些过程的关键步骤包括形成π-二烯醇表面复合物、β-H转移和催化剂再生。这些失活途径的潜在后果包括催化剂性能和寿命的降低，影响工业流程的效率和经济性。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，活性的逐渐丧失可能导致工业环境中的成本增加和生产率降低。同样地，对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，失活机制可能导致产品品质下降、废物生成量增加和运营成本更高。为了缓解这些问题，研究人员和工程师通常专注于改进催化剂设计、优化操作条件以及开发催化剂回收和再生策略。这包括探索新的催化剂支撑材料、修改催化剂配方以及实施先进的工艺技术，以提高催化剂稳定性与效率。
