[1] "Alkane activation on a solid surface requires the presence of strong acid or basic sites."
[2] "In the case of Ti-mesoporous materials, a leaching of Ti in the presence of H2O2 occurs."
[3] "Aldehydes are oxidized to the corresponding peracids using O2. When this is done in the presence of a reactant able to be oxidized by the peracids, a system is developed in which the aldehyde can act as a oxygen transfer agent."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this typically leads to the formation of a π-allyl complex on the surface, which can then undergo β-H transfer reactions leading to deactivation. The silica-supported Re-based catalysts similarly form π-allyl complexes, but the nature of the deactivation pathways might differ due to the different properties of the supported rhenium catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide catalysts. The consequences of these deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts, necessitating careful design and optimization to mitigate these effects.

In the context of using molecular oxygen (O2) for alkane oxyfunctionalization, the presence of strong acid or basic sites on the solid surface is crucial for alkane activation. The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in this process involves the use of aldehydes as oxygen transfer agents, where the aldehyde can be oxidized by peracids formed in the presence of molecular oxygen. This allows for the selective oxyfunctionalization of alkanes, with the aldehyde acting as a mediator between the oxygen source and the alkane substrate.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的自解活中，分子内C-H键的激活涉及π-异丙基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。对于镧系/锕系催化剂，这通常导致表面形成π-异丙基复合物，随后进行β-H转移反应导致失活。支持的铼催化剂中的π-异丙基复合物的形成与镧系/锕系催化剂有所不同，主要是由于支持的铼催化剂的性质不同。这些失活途径的影响可以显著影响催化剂的性能和寿命，因此需要仔细设计和优化以减轻这些影响。

在使用分子氧（O2）进行烷烃氧化功能化的过程中，固体表面上的强酸或碱性位点对于烷烃的活化至关重要。在这一过程中，醛类作为氧转移剂的作用是关键，其中醛类可以在分子氧的存在下被过酸氧化。这允许选择性地对烷烃进行氧化功能化，其中醛类作为氧源和烷烃底物之间的媒介。
