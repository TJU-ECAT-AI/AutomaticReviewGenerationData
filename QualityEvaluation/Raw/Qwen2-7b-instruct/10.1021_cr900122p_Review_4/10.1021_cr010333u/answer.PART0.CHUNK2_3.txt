[1] "The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts has been extensively studied. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes are typically formed through the activation of an adjacent C-H bond, followed by a β-H transfer to the catalyst metal center, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst."

[2] "On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts also undergo deactivation through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. However, the mechanism differs slightly, as the β-H transfer occurs from a more distant H atom, often located on a different alkene chain. This process leads to the deactivation of the catalyst by removing the active site from the surface."

在支持的烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活中，涉及到π-亚基表面复合物的形成。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，过程始于相邻C-H键的激活，随后是β-H向催化剂金属中心的转移。这一机制导致催化剂的失活。相比之下，硅支持的铼基催化剂也形成π-亚基表面复合物，但β-H转移发生在较远的H原子上，通常位于不同的烯烃链上。这个过程通过从表面移除活性位点来导致催化剂失活。
