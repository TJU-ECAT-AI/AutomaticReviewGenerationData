Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the processes. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, where the C-H bond of the alkene is activated intramolecularly to form a π-allyl complex. This complex then undergoes β-H transfer, releasing hydrogen and forming a new bond, leading to the termination of the polymer chain. The high coordination of lanthanide and actinide elements facilitates this process efficiently.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism involves a similar activation of the C-H bond, but the high reactivity of the rhenium center leads to faster β-H transfer. The rhenium atom acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the alkene and activating the C-H bond. The formation of a metallacycle then leads to β-H elimination, causing deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shorter longevity, affecting the efficiency and economic viability of the polymerization and metathesis processes.

These deactivation mechanisms highlight the importance of catalyst design and support in controlling the stability and selectivity of supported catalysts. Optimizing the Lewis acidity and basicity of the support, adjusting the coordination number of the metal center, and employing promoter metals can mitigate the deactivation pathways, improving catalyst performance and longevity.

分析支撑型烯烃聚合和金属化反应催化剂中分子内C-H键活化导致催化剂失活的作用，需要理解这些过程的具体机制。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，关键步骤包括形成π-烯丙基表面复合物，其中烯烃的C-H键通过分子内激活形成π-烯丙基复合物。然后，该复合物经历β-H转移，释放氢并形成新键，导致聚合链终止。镧系和锕系元素的高配位性促进了这一过程的有效性。

对于硅支持的铼基催化剂，激活C-H键的过程类似，但铼中心的高活性导致β-H转移更快。铼原子作为路易斯酸，与烯烃相互作用并激活C-H键。形成金属环后，导致β-H消除，造成失活。这些失活途径的潜在后果包括催化剂性能降低和寿命缩短，影响聚合和金属化过程的效率和经济性。

这些失活机制强调了催化剂设计和支持在控制催化剂稳定性和选择性中的重要性。优化支持的路易斯酸性和碱性、调整金属中心的配位数、采用促进金属可以减轻失活途径，改善催化剂性能和寿命。
