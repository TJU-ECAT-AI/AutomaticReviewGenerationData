[1] "The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is more efficient at sites with more than one vanadium atom."
[2] "In situ Raman spectroscopy as well as low-temperature CO adsorption monitored by IR suggests that the reversible oxidation and reduction between vanadyl pyrophosphate and a phase of vanadyl phosphate operates on the surface during the selective oxidation of n-butane exhibiting a relatively high selectivity toward maleic anhydride."
[3] "Apparently, the higher the number of Lewis acid sites, the higher the catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and the increased yield of ethylene."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, the specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts can be outlined as follows:

1. **Lanthanide/Actinide-based catalysts**:
   - **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: The lanthanide/actinide catalysts form π-allyl complexes through the activation of the C-H bond of the alkene. This process involves the stabilization of the allyl radical on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of a π-allyl complex.
   - **β-H transfer**: Subsequent β-H transfer reactions occur, where the hydrogen atom from the allyl radical is transferred to a neighboring hydrogen atom, typically from an adjacent C-H bond. This step is crucial for the propagation of the polymerization or metathesis reaction.
   - **Deactivation pathways**: Over time, the surface of the catalyst becomes saturated with π-allyl complexes, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The saturation of the surface limits the availability of active sites for further reactions, resulting in a decline in catalyst performance and longevity.

2. **Silica-supported Re-based catalysts**:
   - **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: Similar to lanthanide/actinide catalysts, Re-based catalysts also form π-allyl complexes through the activation of the C-H bond of the alkene. However, the mechanism might differ slightly due to the different properties of Re compared to lanthanide/actinide elements.
   - **β-H transfer**: β-H transfer reactions also occur in Re-based catalysts, facilitating the propagation of the polymerization or metathesis reaction.
   - **Deactivation pathways**: Deactivation in Re-based catalysts might be influenced by different factors, such as the specific structure of the silica support, the coordination of Re, or the presence of other reactive species on the surface. The saturation of the surface with π-allyl complexes can still lead to deactivation, but the specifics might vary depending on the catalyst composition and reaction conditions.

**Key steps in these processes**:
- Activation of C-H bonds through the formation of π-allyl complexes.
- Propagation of the reaction via β-H transfer.
- Deactivation due to surface saturation with π-allyl complexes.

**Potential consequences**:
- Reduced catalyst performance and longevity due to saturation of active sites.
- Impact on the efficiency and yield of the polymerization or metathesis reactions.

The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts through intramolecular C-H bond activation highlights the importance of catalyst design and reaction conditions in maintaining optimal performance. The specific mechanisms and deactivation pathways can vary significantly depending on the type of catalyst (lanthanide/actinide vs. silica-supported Re) and the nature of the supported alkene reaction.

分析介入分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活中的作用，对于镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂的具体机制可以概述如下：

1. **镧系/锕系基催化剂**：
   - **形成π-邻基表面复合物**：镧系/锕系催化剂通过活化烯烃中的C-H键形成π-邻基复合物。这一过程涉及在催化剂表面上稳定化邻基自由基，导致形成π-邻基复合物。
   - **β-H转移**：随后发生β-H转移反应，其中邻基自由基的氢原子转移到相邻的C-H键上，通常是邻近的氢原子。这一步对于聚合或复分解反应的传播至关重要。
   - **失活途径**：催化剂表面随着时间的推移变得饱和有π-邻基复合物，导致催化剂失活。表面饱和限制了进一步反应的活性位点可用性，从而导致催化剂性能和寿命下降。

2. **二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂**：
   - **形成π-邻基表面复合物**：与镧系/锕系催化剂类似，Re基催化剂也通过活化烯烃中的C-H键形成π-邻基复合物。然而，由于Re与镧系/锕系元素的不同性质，机制可能略有不同。
   - **β-H转移**：Re基催化剂中也发生β-H转移反应，促进聚合或复分解反应的传播。
   - **失活途径**：Re基催化剂的失活可能受到不同的影响因素，如支持二氧化硅的结构、Re的配合物或其他表面反应性物种的存在。表面饱和有π-邻基复合物仍然可能导致失活，但具体细节可能根据催化剂组成和反应条件而有所不同。

**关键步骤**：
- 通过形成π-邻基复合物激活C-H键。
- 通过β-H转移促进反应的传播。
- 由于表面饱和π-邻基复合物导致失活。

**潜在后果**：
- 由于活性位点饱和导致催化剂性能和寿命降低。
- 影响聚合或复分解反应的效率和产率。

支持型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂通过介入分子C-H键活化的失活揭示了催化剂设计和反应条件对维持最佳性能的重要性。不同类型的催化剂（镧系/锕系vs.二氧化硅支持的Re）和支持的烯烃反应的具体机制和失活路径可能会有很大差异。
