The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is pivotal. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts undergo deactivation through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which then undergo β-H transfer. Similarly, silica-supported Re-based catalysts deactivate via the same mechanisms, involving π-allyl formation followed by β-H transfer. These deactivation pathways have notable impacts on the performance and lifespan of the catalysts.

在支撑型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键的激活起着关键作用。对于以镧系/锕系为基础的催化剂，失活过程涉及形成π-异丙基表面复合物，随后进行β-H转移。同样地，以硅为基础的Re催化剂通过相同的机制失活，涉及形成π-异丙基随后进行β-H转移。这些失活途径对催化剂的性能和寿命有显著影响。
