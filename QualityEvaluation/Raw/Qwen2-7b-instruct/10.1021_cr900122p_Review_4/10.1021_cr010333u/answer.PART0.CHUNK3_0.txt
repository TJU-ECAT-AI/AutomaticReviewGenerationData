The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts tend to resist deactivation due to their stronger Lewis acidity, whereas silica-supported Re-based catalysts are more prone to deactivation through β-H transfer. The main steps in these processes include the creation of π-allyl complexes, which can result in chain termination or deactivation through β-H transfer reactions.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活过程中，分子内C-H键活化起着重要作用。具体机制涉及π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。镧系/锕系基催化剂通常由于其更强的路易斯酸性而具有更高的抗失活性，而SiO2支持的Re基催化剂更容易通过β-H转移反应失活。这些过程的主要步骤包括生成π-邻二烯复合物，这可能导致链终止或通过β-H转移反应导致失活。
