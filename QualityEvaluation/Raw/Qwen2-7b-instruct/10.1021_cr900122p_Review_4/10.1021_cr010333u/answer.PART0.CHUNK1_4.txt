The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a critical aspect of catalyst performance. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts can deactivate through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts can deactivate via β-H transfer reactions. These mechanisms highlight the importance of surface chemistry and catalyst structure in influencing deactivation pathways.
