The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is a complex phenomenon that varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes often leads to deactivation through β-H transfer reactions. This process involves the stabilization of a π-allyl intermediate, which can then undergo β-H elimination to regenerate the catalyst. However, this regeneration is often inefficient, leading to a gradual loss of catalyst activity over time. On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, which are widely used in olefin polymerization and metathesis, can also suffer from deactivation mechanisms. These catalysts can deactivate through the formation of surface complexes that are prone to undergo β-H transfer, leading to the loss of catalytic activity. The key steps in these processes include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, and the regeneration of the catalyst. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include a decrease in catalyst performance and longevity, affecting the efficiency and economics of industrial processes.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the gradual loss of activity can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity in industrial settings. Similarly, for silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanisms can result in decreased product quality, increased waste generation, and higher operational costs. To mitigate these issues, researchers and engineers often focus on improving catalyst design, optimizing operating conditions, and developing strategies for catalyst recycling and regeneration. This includes exploring new catalyst supports, modifying catalyst formulations, and implementing advanced process technologies to enhance catalyst stability and efficiency.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键的活化起着复杂的作用，这种作用在镧系/锕系基催化剂和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂之间有所不同。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，π-二烯醇表面复合物的形成往往导致通过β-H转移反应导致失活。这个过程涉及稳定π-二烯醇中间体，然后可以通过β-H消除来再生催化剂。然而，这种再生通常是低效的，导致催化剂活性逐渐下降。另一方面，广泛用于烯烃聚合和金属迁移的二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂也可能遭受失活机制。这些催化剂可以通过形成易于发生β-H转移的表面复合物而失活，从而导致催化活性的丧失。这些过程的关键步骤包括形成π-二烯醇表面复合物、β-H转移和催化剂再生。这些失活途径的潜在后果包括催化剂性能和寿命的降低，影响工业流程的效率和经济性。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，活性的逐渐丧失可能导致工业环境中的成本增加和生产率降低。同样地，对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂，失活机制可能导致产品品质下降、废物生成量增加和运营成本更高。为了缓解这些问题，研究人员和工程师通常专注于改进催化剂设计、优化操作条件以及开发催化剂回收和再生策略。这包括探索新的催化剂支撑材料、修改催化剂配方以及实施先进的工艺技术，以提高催化剂稳定性与效率。

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, the specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts can be outlined as follows:

1. **Lanthanide/Actinide-based catalysts**:
   - **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: The lanthanide/actinide catalysts form π-allyl complexes through the activation of the C-H bond of the alkene. This process involves the stabilization of the allyl radical on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of a π-allyl complex.
   - **β-H transfer**: Subsequent β-H transfer reactions occur, where the hydrogen atom from the allyl radical is transferred to a neighboring hydrogen atom, typically from an adjacent C-H bond. This step is crucial for the propagation of the polymerization or metathesis reaction.
   - **Deactivation pathways**: Over time, the surface of the catalyst becomes saturated with π-allyl complexes, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The saturation of the surface limits the availability of active sites for further reactions, resulting in a decline in catalyst performance and longevity.

2. **Silica-supported Re-based catalysts**:
   - **Formation of π-allyl surface complexes**: Similar to lanthanide/actinide catalysts, Re-based catalysts also form π-allyl complexes through the activation of the C-H bond of the alkene. However, the mechanism might differ slightly due to the different properties of Re compared to lanthanide/actinide elements.
   - **β-H transfer**: β-H transfer reactions also occur in Re-based catalysts, facilitating the propagation of the polymerization or metathesis reaction.
   - **Deactivation pathways**: Deactivation in Re-based catalysts might be influenced by different factors, such as the specific structure of the silica support, the coordination of Re, or the presence of other reactive species on the surface. The saturation of the surface with π-allyl complexes can still lead to deactivation, but the specifics might vary depending on the catalyst composition and reaction conditions.

**Key steps in these processes**:
- Activation of C-H bonds through the formation of π-allyl complexes.
- Propagation of the reaction via β-H transfer.
- Deactivation due to surface saturation with π-allyl complexes.

**Potential consequences**:
- Reduced catalyst performance and longevity due to saturation of active sites.
- Impact on the efficiency and yield of the polymerization or metathesis reactions.

The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts through intramolecular C-H bond activation highlights the importance of catalyst design and reaction conditions in maintaining optimal performance. The specific mechanisms and deactivation pathways can vary significantly depending on the type of catalyst (lanthanide/actinide vs. silica-supported Re) and the nature of the supported alkene reaction.

1. **镧系/锕系基催化剂**：
   - **形成π-邻基表面复合物**：镧系/锕系催化剂通过活化烯烃中的C-H键形成π-邻基复合物。这一过程涉及在催化剂表面上稳定化邻基自由基，导致形成π-邻基复合物。
   - **β-H转移**：随后发生β-H转移反应，其中邻基自由基的氢原子转移到相邻的C-H键上，通常是邻近的氢原子。这一步对于聚合或复分解反应的传播至关重要。
   - **失活途径**：催化剂表面随着时间的推移变得饱和有π-邻基复合物，导致催化剂失活。表面饱和限制了进一步反应的活性位点可用性，从而导致催化剂性能和寿命下降。

2. **二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂**：
   - **形成π-邻基表面复合物**：与镧系/锕系催化剂类似，Re基催化剂也通过活化烯烃中的C-H键形成π-邻基复合物。然而，由于Re与镧系/锕系元素的不同性质，机制可能略有不同。
   - **β-H转移**：Re基催化剂中也发生β-H转移反应，促进聚合或复分解反应的传播。
   - **失活途径**：Re基催化剂的失活可能受到不同的影响因素，如支持二氧化硅的结构、Re的配合物或其他表面反应性物种的存在。表面饱和有π-邻基复合物仍然可能导致失活，但具体细节可能根据催化剂组成和反应条件而有所不同。

**关键步骤**：
- 通过形成π-邻基复合物激活C-H键。
- 通过β-H转移促进反应的传播。
- 由于表面饱和π-邻基复合物导致失活。

**潜在后果**：
- 由于活性位点饱和导致催化剂性能和寿命降低。
- 影响聚合或复分解反应的效率和产率。

支持型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂通过介入分子C-H键活化的失活揭示了催化剂设计和反应条件对维持最佳性能的重要性。不同类型的催化剂（镧系/锕系vs.二氧化硅支持的Re）和支持的烯烃反应的具体机制和失活路径可能会有很大差异。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not extensively detailed in the provided literature. However, focusing on the context given, the deactivation of lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts might involve similar mechanisms, yet the specifics might differ based on the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. 

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, deactivation could potentially occur through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer reactions. These reactions can lead to the stabilization of transition metal complexes on the surface of the catalyst, which can deactivate the catalyst over time. The β-H transfer is a common mechanism in which hydrogen atoms are transferred from a hydrogen-bearing substrate to a transition metal center, leading to the formation of a metal hydride and the substrate's transformation into a new product.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, deactivation might also involve π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the nature of the support (silica) could influence the stability of the complexes and the rate of β-H transfer reactions. The silica support might alter the electronic properties of the metal center, affecting the reactivity and stability of the complexes. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity would depend on factors such as the rate of deactivation, the extent of deactivation, and the efficiency of the catalyst regeneration or replacement.

In summary, the deactivation of lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts might involve similar mechanisms such as the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer reactions. The specifics of these processes, including the details of the reaction pathways and the factors influencing catalyst stability, would depend on the nature of the catalyst and the support material.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity would depend on the rate of deactivation, the extent of deactivation, and the efficiency of catalyst regeneration or replacement. Faster deactivation rates and higher extents of deactivation could lead to decreased catalyst performance and shorter lifetimes. Efficient regeneration or replacement strategies would be necessary to maintain optimal catalytic activity and prolong catalyst life.

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is primarily observed through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and subsequent β-H transfer reactions. This process varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the formation of π-allyl complexes on the surface. These complexes are formed through the interaction of the catalyst with the alkene substrate, leading to the stabilization of an allylic carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent β-H transfer reaction then occurs, where a hydrogen atom from a neighboring hydrocarbon group is transferred to the allylic carbon, resulting in the formation of a new C-H bond and the elimination of a hydrogen molecule. This process is energetically favorable due to the stability gained by the formation of a more substituted allylic carbocation.

In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts typically exhibit deactivation through a similar mechanism but with different catalyst properties influencing the reaction pathway. The ruthenium species in these catalysts are capable of forming π-allyl complexes, but the stability and reactivity of these complexes differ from those of lanthanide/actinide catalysts. The β-H transfer step is still crucial, but the nature of the catalyst surface and the surrounding solvent can affect the rate and efficiency of this transfer.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. The rate of deactivation can greatly influence the productivity and selectivity of the polymerization or metathesis reactions. High deactivation rates can lead to reduced catalyst lifetime, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement, which increases operational costs. Additionally, the formation of byproducts during the deactivation process can affect product purity and quality, impacting downstream processing and potentially requiring additional purification steps.

To mitigate these issues, researchers aim to develop catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation. Strategies include optimizing the catalyst structure, modifying the support material, and altering the catalyst formulation to reduce the propensity for β-H transfer reactions. The goal is to create catalysts that maintain high activity and selectivity over multiple cycles, thereby extending their operational lifespan and improving overall efficiency in industrial processes.

分析内部分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂失活中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的具体机制。讨论这些过程的关键步骤，包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移，并评估这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活路径通常涉及表面形成π-邻二烯复合物。这些复合物通过催化剂与烯烃基质的相互作用形成，导致邻二烯碳-碳双键的稳定化。随后的β-H转移反应发生，从相邻的碳氢化合物组分中转移一个氢原子到邻二烯碳上，形成新的C-H键并释放氢分子。这个过程在形成更取代的邻二烯碳正离子时是能量有利的。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂通常通过类似的过程失活，但催化剂性质影响反应途径的不同。这些催化剂中的钌物种能够形成π-邻二烯复合物，但这些复合物的稳定性和活性与镧系/锕系催化剂不同。β-H转移步骤仍然关键，但催化剂表面和周围溶剂的性质可以影响此转移的速率和效率。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响至关重要。失活速率极大地影响聚合或偶联反应的生产力和选择性。高失活速率可能导致催化剂寿命缩短，需要频繁再生或更换，增加运营成本。此外，在失活过程中形成的副产品可能会影响产物纯度和质量，可能需要额外的精炼步骤。

为了缓解这些问题，研究人员旨在开发具有增强稳定性和抗失活性的催化剂。策略包括优化催化剂结构、修改支撑材料以及改变催化剂配方以减少β-H转移反应的倾向。目标是创建能够在多个周期中保持高活性和选择性的催化剂，从而延长其使用寿命并提高工业过程的整体效率。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this typically leads to the formation of a π-allyl complex on the surface, which can then undergo β-H transfer reactions leading to deactivation. The silica-supported Re-based catalysts similarly form π-allyl complexes, but the nature of the deactivation pathways might differ due to the different properties of the supported rhenium catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide catalysts. The consequences of these deactivation pathways can significantly impact the performance and longevity of the catalysts, necessitating careful design and optimization to mitigate these effects.

In the context of using molecular oxygen (O2) for alkane oxyfunctionalization, the presence of strong acid or basic sites on the solid surface is crucial for alkane activation. The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in this process involves the use of aldehydes as oxygen transfer agents, where the aldehyde can be oxidized by peracids formed in the presence of molecular oxygen. This allows for the selective oxyfunctionalization of alkanes, with the aldehyde acting as a mediator between the oxygen source and the alkane substrate.

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the processes. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, where the C-H bond of the alkene is activated intramolecularly to form a π-allyl complex. This complex then undergoes β-H transfer, releasing hydrogen and forming a new bond, leading to the termination of the polymer chain. The high coordination of lanthanide and actinide elements facilitates this process efficiently.

For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism involves a similar activation of the C-H bond, but the high reactivity of the rhenium center leads to faster β-H transfer. The rhenium atom acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the alkene and activating the C-H bond. The formation of a metallacycle then leads to β-H elimination, causing deactivation. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways include reduced catalyst performance and shorter longevity, affecting the efficiency and economic viability of the polymerization and metathesis processes.

These deactivation mechanisms highlight the importance of catalyst design and support in controlling the stability and selectivity of supported catalysts. Optimizing the Lewis acidity and basicity of the support, adjusting the coordination number of the metal center, and employing promoter metals can mitigate the deactivation pathways, improving catalyst performance and longevity.
