The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is primarily observed through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and subsequent β-H transfer reactions. This process varies between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway often involves the formation of π-allyl complexes on the surface. These complexes are formed through the interaction of the catalyst with the alkene substrate, leading to the stabilization of an allylic carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent β-H transfer reaction then occurs, where a hydrogen atom from a neighboring hydrocarbon group is transferred to the allylic carbon, resulting in the formation of a new C-H bond and the elimination of a hydrogen molecule. This process is energetically favorable due to the stability gained by the formation of a more substituted allylic carbocation.

In contrast, silica-supported Re-based catalysts typically exhibit deactivation through a similar mechanism but with different catalyst properties influencing the reaction pathway. The ruthenium species in these catalysts are capable of forming π-allyl complexes, but the stability and reactivity of these complexes differ from those of lanthanide/actinide catalysts. The β-H transfer step is still crucial, but the nature of the catalyst surface and the surrounding solvent can affect the rate and efficiency of this transfer.

The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. The rate of deactivation can greatly influence the productivity and selectivity of the polymerization or metathesis reactions. High deactivation rates can lead to reduced catalyst lifetime, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement, which increases operational costs. Additionally, the formation of byproducts during the deactivation process can affect product purity and quality, impacting downstream processing and potentially requiring additional purification steps.

To mitigate these issues, researchers aim to develop catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation. Strategies include optimizing the catalyst structure, modifying the support material, and altering the catalyst formulation to reduce the propensity for β-H transfer reactions. The goal is to create catalysts that maintain high activity and selectivity over multiple cycles, thereby extending their operational lifespan and improving overall efficiency in industrial processes.

分析内部分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂失活中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂的具体机制。讨论这些过程的关键步骤，包括π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移，并评估这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。

对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活路径通常涉及表面形成π-邻二烯复合物。这些复合物通过催化剂与烯烃基质的相互作用形成，导致邻二烯碳-碳双键的稳定化。随后的β-H转移反应发生，从相邻的碳氢化合物组分中转移一个氢原子到邻二烯碳上，形成新的C-H键并释放氢分子。这个过程在形成更取代的邻二烯碳正离子时是能量有利的。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的铼基催化剂通常通过类似的过程失活，但催化剂性质影响反应途径的不同。这些催化剂中的钌物种能够形成π-邻二烯复合物，但这些复合物的稳定性和活性与镧系/锕系催化剂不同。β-H转移步骤仍然关键，但催化剂表面和周围溶剂的性质可以影响此转移的速率和效率。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响至关重要。失活速率极大地影响聚合或偶联反应的生产力和选择性。高失活速率可能导致催化剂寿命缩短，需要频繁再生或更换，增加运营成本。此外，在失活过程中形成的副产品可能会影响产物纯度和质量，可能需要额外的精炼步骤。

为了缓解这些问题，研究人员旨在开发具有增强稳定性和抗失活性的催化剂。策略包括优化催化剂结构、修改支撑材料以及改变催化剂配方以减少β-H转移反应的倾向。目标是创建能够在多个周期中保持高活性和选择性的催化剂，从而延长其使用寿命并提高工业过程的整体效率。
