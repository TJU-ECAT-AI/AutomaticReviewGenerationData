The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Mechanisms involve the creation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts deactivate through the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts deactivate via β-H transfer. These pathways impact the performance and lifespan of the catalysts.

C-H键内激活在支持型烯烃聚合和偶联催化剂的失活中起着关键作用。机制涉及π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。镧系/锕系基催化剂通过形成π-邻二烯表面复合物而失活，而二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂则通过β-H转移而失活。这些途径影响催化剂的性能和寿命。
