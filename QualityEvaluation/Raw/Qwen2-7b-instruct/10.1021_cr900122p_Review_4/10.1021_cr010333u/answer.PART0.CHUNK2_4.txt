[1] "The kinetic data for the deactivation of the supported alkene polymerization catalysts were fitted to a model that accounts for the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and subsequent β-H transfer reactions."
[2] "For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of π-allyl surface complexes is typically followed by β-H transfer reactions leading to the deactivation of the catalyst."
[3] "Silica-supported Re-based catalysts, on the other hand, also undergo similar deactivation pathways, involving the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, but with distinct features related to the specific interactions of Re with the silica support."

The deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, followed by β-H transfer reactions. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, this process leads to deactivation primarily through β-H transfer. Silica-supported Re-based catalysts also experience deactivation through similar mechanisms, albeit with unique characteristics related to the interaction of Re with the silica support.

在支持型烯烃聚合和金属环化催化剂的失活过程中，形成了π-亚基表面复合物，并随后发生了β-H转移反应。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，这一过程主要通过β-H转移导致失活。而硅基支持的Re基催化剂也经历类似的失活途径，但其与硅支持物的Re相互作用具有独特的特性。
