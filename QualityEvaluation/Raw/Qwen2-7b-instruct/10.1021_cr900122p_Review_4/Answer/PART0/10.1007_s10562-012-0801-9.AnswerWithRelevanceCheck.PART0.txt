          [1] "The ability to exert greater control on the nature of the active sites in catalysts affords the use of properties that were not accessible in the past."
          [2] "New processes are also desirable to tackle issues associated with the management of energy and with environmental problems."
          [3] "Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives."

          Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts requires understanding the unique characteristics of these catalysts. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity. On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can be severe, as they can lead to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

          分析内部分子C-H键活化在支撑烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失活过程中的作用，比较镧系/锕系基和二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂涉及的具体机制，需要理解这些催化剂的独特特性。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活过程通常涉及π-亚基表面复合物的形成。这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。β-H转移通常从更受限的位置转移到更不受限的位置，这可能会破坏催化剂并降低其活性。另一方面，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过不同的机制失活。尽管具体细节未在文献中详细说明，但可以预见，失活涉及表面复合物和β-H转移的概念相似。然而，由于Re基催化剂与镧系/锕系基催化剂的性质不同，这些复合物的精确性质以及特定的β-H转移路径可能有所不同。这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果可能是严重的，因为它们可能导致目标产品产率下降、生产成本增加，并且由于需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂而对环境影响增大。
