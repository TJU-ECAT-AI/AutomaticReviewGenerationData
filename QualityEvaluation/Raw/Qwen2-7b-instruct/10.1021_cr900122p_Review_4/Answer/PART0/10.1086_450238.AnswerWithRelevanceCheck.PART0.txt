          The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form π-allyl surface complexes through this process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts also use intramolecular C-H bond activation for the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. Following the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer is a critical step. These deactivation pathways have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts.

      <English>
          Intramolecular C-H bond activation is pivotal in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The mechanisms for deactivation differ notably between lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Critical steps involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, leading to reduced catalyst performance and decreased longevity due to the deactivation pathways.
