          The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is pivotal. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts utilize the formation of π-allyl surface complexes as a mechanism for deactivation, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts rely on β-H transfer as a key step in their deactivation pathway. These processes significantly impact catalyst performance and longevity due to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer.
