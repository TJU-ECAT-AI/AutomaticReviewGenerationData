For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. These complexes can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity. On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity can be severe, as they can lead to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9"},
