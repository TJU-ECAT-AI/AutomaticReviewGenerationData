Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a pivotal role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, particularly when comparing the mechanisms involved in lanthanide/actinide-based versus silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1\], \[10.1081/cr-100101952\], and \[10.1086/450238\]. 

            The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form π-allyl surface complexes through this process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts also use intramolecular C-H bond activation for the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. Following the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer is a critical step. These deactivation pathways have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts, leading to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

            The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are severe. The specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts differ significantly. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity.

            On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones.

            New processes are also desirable to tackle issues associated with the management of energy and with environmental problems. Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives.

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests that there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation pathways, optimizing the design of existing catalysts to mitigate the effects of intramolecular C-H bond activation, and exploring alternative routes to achieve desired chemical transformations that minimize the reliance on deactivation-prone catalysts. There is also a need to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for catalyst regeneration or recycling to reduce environmental impact and improve economic viability.
