            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1\], \[10.1081/cr-100101952\], and \[10.1086/450238\]. 

            The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is significant. Lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts form π-allyl surface complexes through this process, while silica-supported Re-based catalysts also use intramolecular C-H bond activation for the formation of π-allyl surface complexes. Following the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer is a critical step. These deactivation pathways have significant impacts on the performance and longevity of the catalysts, leading to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

            The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are severe. The specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts differ significantly. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which can undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. The β-H transfer typically occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, which can destabilize the catalyst and reduce its activity.

            On the other hand, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a different mechanism. While the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer. However, the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways might differ due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones.

            New processes are also desirable to tackle issues associated with the management of energy and with environmental problems. Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives.

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests that there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation pathways, optimizing the design of existing catalysts to mitigate the effects of intramolecular C-H bond activation, and exploring alternative routes to achieve desired chemical transformations that minimize the reliance on deactivation-prone catalysts. There is also a need to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for catalyst regeneration or recycling to reduce environmental impact and improve economic viability.

            在支持的烯烃聚合和裂合催化剂的失活中，内分子C-H键激活的作用是显著的。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活过程通常涉及π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成。这些复合物可以经历β-H转移反应，导致催化剂的失活。β-H转移通常发生在更受限的位置到较不受限的位置，这可以破坏催化剂并降低其活性。另一方面，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过不同的机制失活。虽然具体细节在文献中没有详细说明，但很可能是通过类似的概念，即表面复合物和β-H转移来实现失活。然而，由于Re基催化剂与镧系/锕系基催化剂的性质不同，这些复合体的确切性质和特定的β-H转移途径可能有所不同。

            新的过程也适应当今能源管理和环境问题的挑战。也许更具挑战性的是，需要替换目前用于精细化学品制造的等当量合成和均相催化，这些过程需要高度选择性的过程，以更容易使用和更加环保的异相替代品。

            集成理解和前瞻性展望表明，有探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研究努力可能专注于开发更能抵抗失活路径的新催化剂，优化现有催化剂的设计以减轻内分子C-H键激活的影响，并探索替代路线以实现所需的化学转化，同时减少对容易引起催化剂失活的催化剂的依赖。还需要开发更有效和可持续的方法进行催化剂再生或回收，以减少环境影响并提高经济可行性。

            总之，未来的研究应集中于开发更环保和高效的催化剂系统，同时考虑催化剂设计、再生技术和替代化学途径的综合策略，以实现化学工业的可持续发展。
