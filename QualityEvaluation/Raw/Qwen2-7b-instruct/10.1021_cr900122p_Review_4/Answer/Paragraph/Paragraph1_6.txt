        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9\].

The ability to exert greater control on the nature of the active sites in catalysts affords the use of properties that were not accessible in the past. New processes are also desirable to tackle issues associated with the management of energy and with environmental problems. Perhaps more challenging is the need to substitute the stoichiometric synthesis and homogeneous catalysis used nowadays for the manufacturing of fine chemicals, which require highly selective processes, with easier-to-use and more environmentally friendly heterogeneous alternatives. Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts differ significantly. These processes often lead to the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more selective and environmentally friendly catalysts. By enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions between intramolecular C-H bond activation, surface complexes, and β-H transfer, we could design catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation. This could lead to increased efficiency in the production of valuable chemical intermediates, reducing the environmental footprint of industrial processes. Additionally, the exploration of novel materials and coordination chemistry could provide new insights into the design of catalysts that are capable of withstanding the harsh conditions required for efficient polymerization and metathesis reactions. By addressing the challenges posed by deactivation pathways, we can pave the way for sustainable and economically viable methods of chemical synthesis.
