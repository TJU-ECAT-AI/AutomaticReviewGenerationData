        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1] and [10.1081/cr-100101952]. The intricate role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is thoroughly explored, specifically contrasting the mechanisms involved in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems. 

        For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation process often revolves around the formation of π-allyl surface complexes, which subsequently undergo β-H transfer reactions, leading to the catalyst's deactivation. This β-H transfer typically proceeds from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, destabilizing the catalyst and reducing its efficiency over time. Conversely, silica-supported Re-based catalysts might deactivate through a similar mechanism involving surface complexes and β-H transfer, though the exact nature of these complexes and the specific β-H transfer pathways could vary based on the distinct properties of Re-based catalysts compared to their lanthanide/actinide counterparts.

        The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are profound, leading to decreased yields of desired products, increased production costs, and environmental degradation necessitating more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

        基于参考文献 [10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9] 的深度分析，结合参考文献 [10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1] 和 [10.1081/cr-100101952] 的综合理解，对支持烷基聚合和金属易位催化剂的内分子C-H键活化在催化剂失活中的关键作用进行了全面探讨，并对比了镧系/锕系基与二氧化硅支持的Re基系统的具体机制。

        对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活过程通常围绕π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成展开，随后发生β-H转移反应，导致催化剂失活。这种β-H转移通常从更受阻的位置转移到更不受阻的位置，破坏催化剂稳定性并降低其活性。相比之下，二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂可能通过类似的过程进行失活，涉及表面复合物和β-H转移，尽管这些复合物的精确性质和特定的β-H转移途径可能因Re基催化剂与镧系/锕系催化剂的特性差异而有所不同。

        这些失活路径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响深远，可能导致所需产品的产量下降、生产成本增加以及环境退化，需要更频繁地进行催化剂再生或更换。
