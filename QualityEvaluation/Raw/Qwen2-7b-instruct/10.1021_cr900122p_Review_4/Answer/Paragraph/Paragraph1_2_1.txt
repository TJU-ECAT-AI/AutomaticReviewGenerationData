        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s10562-012-0801-9]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/s0360-0564(04)48003-1], [10.1081/cr-100101952], and [10.1086/450238]. Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, revealing distinct mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. These processes typically involve the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, impacting catalyst performance and longevity in significant ways.

        The β-H transfer often occurs from a more hindered position to a less hindered one, destabilizing the catalyst and reducing its activity. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, while the specifics are not detailed in the literature, it is likely that the deactivation involves a similar concept of surface complexes and β-H transfer, differing due to the different properties of the Re-based catalysts compared to the lanthanide/actinide-based ones.

        The potential consequences of these deactivation pathways are severe, leading to a decrease in the yield of desired products, increased production costs, and reduced environmental impact due to the need for more frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement. This highlights the need for further research to develop catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation, thereby enhancing their performance and longevity.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on designing catalysts with enhanced stability against deactivation pathways, specifically targeting the optimization of β-H transfer reactions and the stabilization of π-allyl surface complexes. Additionally, exploring the use of alternative metals or support materials could provide new insights into catalyst design, aiming to create more efficient and sustainable catalysts for the polymerization and metathesis of alkenes. This could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency and environmental footprint of chemical manufacturing processes, addressing the challenges of energy management and environmental conservation.

        Acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties outlined in the references, particularly regarding the detailed mechanisms and pathways of deactivation, future studies could benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration to integrate insights from catalysis, materials science, and computational chemistry. This collaborative approach would facilitate a more holistic understanding of the deactivation processes, enabling the development of predictive models and design principles for catalysts that are optimized for longevity and performance.

        β-H转移通常发生在更受阻的位置到较不受阻的位置，破坏催化剂活性并降低其活性。对于二氧化硅支持的Re基催化剂而言，尽管具体细节未在文献中详细说明，但很可能是通过类似的概念进行失活，即表面复合物和β-H转移，但由于Re基催化剂的性质与镧系/锕系基催化剂的不同而有所不同。

        这些失活途径的潜在后果极为严重，导致所需产品的产量下降、生产成本增加以及由于需要更频繁地再生或更换催化剂而导致的环境影响。这突显了进一步研究开发对抗失活途径更加耐久的催化剂的必要性，从而增强其性能和使用寿命。
