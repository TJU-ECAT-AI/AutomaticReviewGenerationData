[1] "Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- anoL2"
[2] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter."
[3] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.'"
[4] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[5] "At this stage we have made no attempt to optimise the use of Ga203 as a catalyst component, but it is clear that the incorporation of Gaz03, and possibly also ZnO and Cr203,in catalyst formulations could lead to the design of novel high activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane."

Analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, the literature focuses on the methane partial oxidation to methanol over Ga203-based catalysts. The CH4/D2 exchange reaction is utilized as a predictive catalyst design tool, indicating the high methane activation over Ga203 compared to other simple oxides. Gallium oxide (Ga203) and zinc oxide (ZnO), alongside chromium oxide (Cr203), are highlighted for their high activity in the CH4/D2 exchange reaction. These oxides are preferred catalyst components for the aromatization of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. The correlation between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction supports the effectiveness of Ga203 in enhancing the rate of methanol formation. Incorporating Ga203, ZnO, and Cr203 into catalyst formulations could potentially lead to the development of high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属易位催化剂的失活中，分析了分子内C-H键活化的作用。文献集中在基于Ga203的甲烷部分氧化到甲醇的研究上。利用CH4/D2交换反应作为预测催化剂设计参数，表明Ga203对甲烷激活的能力远高于其他简单氧化物。Ga203、ZnO以及Cr203等氧化物因其在CH4/D2交换反应中的高活性而被用作丙烷和丁烷在Cyclar过程中进行芳香化的优选催化剂成分。甲醇氧化速率与其'*02/1602交换反应速率之间的相关性支持了Ga203在提高甲醇形成速率方面的有效性。将Ga203、ZnO和Cr203纳入催化剂配方中，有可能开发出用于部分甲烷氧化的高活性催化剂。
