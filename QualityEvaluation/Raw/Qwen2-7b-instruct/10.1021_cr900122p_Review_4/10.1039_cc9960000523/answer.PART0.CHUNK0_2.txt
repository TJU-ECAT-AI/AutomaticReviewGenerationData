<p>In recent years there has been considerable research attention directed to the identification of catalysts for the direct conversion of methane to more useful products.</p>
<p>Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,</p>
<p>but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth-anoL2</p>
<p>The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.</p>
<p>We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter.</p>
<p>Most noteworthy is that the rate of methane/deuterium exchange over gallium oxide is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than for any other oxide, with ZnO and chromia also showing high activity.</p>
<p>Under our experimental conditions tantalum oxide, ceria and titania (Degussa P45, mixed anatase and rutile) showed the lowest measurable activity, while silica, niobia, Tb407 and Y203 were inactive.</p>
<p>The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h].</p>
<p>At this stage we have made no attempt to optimise the use of Ga203 as a catalyst component, but it is clear that the incorporation of Gaz03, and possibly also ZnO and Cr203,in catalyst formulations could lead to the design of novel high activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.</p>

The literature discusses the use of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. These materials show high activity in activating methane due to their high exchange rate in the CH4/D2 reaction, which indicates their capability in activating methane and oxygen. The study suggests that the combination of Ga2O3 and ZnO in a physical mixture enhances the rate of methanol formation, indicating that the incorporation of these oxides into catalyst formulations could lead to the development of novel high-activity catalysts for methane oxidation. The findings imply that the initial activation of methane and oxygen plays a crucial role in the overall oxidation process, and the high activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO provides a promising avenue for the design of efficient methane-to-methanol conversion catalysts.

The literature also mentions that gallium oxide and zinc oxide are preferred catalyst components for the aromatization of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. This highlights their effectiveness in alkane activation, particularly through the polarizing of C-H bonds. The study further explores the use of gallium oxide in methane oxidation catalysts, suggesting that its inclusion in formulations could potentially improve the performance of methane-to-methanol conversion reactions.
