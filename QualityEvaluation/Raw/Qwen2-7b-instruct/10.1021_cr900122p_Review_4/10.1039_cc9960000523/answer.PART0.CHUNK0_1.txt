<p>Most noteworthy is that the rate of methane/deuterium exchange over gallium oxide is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than for any other oxide, with ZnO and chromia also showing high activity.</p>
<p>The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.</p>
<p>Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction.</p>
<p>In this way the simple physical mixture of the two oxides has combined beneficially the characteristics of both oxides.</p>
<p>We wish to thank the Gas Research Institute of Chicago for financial support.</p>

The literature focuses on the use of the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a design tool for identifying catalysts for the direct conversion of methane to methanol. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is highlighted for its exceptionally high methane activation rate compared to other simple oxides, leading to the identification of Ga2O3/MoO3 as a selective catalyst for methane partial oxidation to methanol. The literature also discusses the high activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3) in methane activation, which contributes to their effectiveness in the aromatisation of propane and butane. The study further explores the stability of methanol over various oxides and establishes a correlation between the rate of methanol oxidation and its '*02/1602 exchange reaction. The simple physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 is shown to enhance the rate of methanol formation, suggesting potential for designing high activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.

文献主要探讨了使用甲烷/重氢交换反应作为设计工具，用于直接转化甲烷到甲醇的催化剂识别。镓氧化物（Ga2O3）因其与其它简单氧化物相比，甲烷激活速率异常高而受到关注，这导致了将Ga2O3/MoO3识别为甲烷部分氧化到甲醇的高选择性催化剂。文献还讨论了锌氧化物（ZnO）和铬氧化物（Cr2O3）在甲烷激活方面的高活性，这有助于它们在丙烷和丁烷的芳香化过程中的有效性。研究进一步探索了甲醇在各种氧化物上的稳定性，并建立了甲醇氧化速率与其'*02/1602交换反应速率之间的相关性。简单的两种氧化物混合物Ga2O3和MoO3被证明可以增强甲醇形成速率，这表明设计高活性催化剂用于甲烷部分氧化的潜力。
