[1] "Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- anoL2"
[2] "The exchange reaction of methane and other hydrocarbons with deuterium has been extensively studied over many metals and is generally accepted to proceed via surface radical specie."
[3] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.'"
[4] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[5] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[6] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[7] "X-Ray diffraction analysis and other characterisation methods did not indicate that any significant changes in the oxides had occurred on calcination."
[8] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[9] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not discussed within this literature. The text focuses on the methane partial oxidation to methanol over Ga2O3 based catalysts, utilizing the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a design tool. It highlights the importance of C-H bond activation for the effectiveness of catalysts in this context, particularly in relation to the initial activation of methane and oxygen, key steps in the oxidation process. The literature does not compare mechanisms involving lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts nor discuss the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. It does not address the potential consequences of deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

本文未讨论内间C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失效中的作用。文本主要关注基于Ga2O3的催化剂中甲烷的部分氧化到甲醇的过程，利用CH4/D2交换反应作为设计工具。它强调了C-H键活化对于催化剂有效性的关键性，特别是在激活甲烷和氧的关键步骤中。文献没有比较涉及镧系/锕系基和硅支持的Re基催化剂的机制，也没有讨论π-邻二烯表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。它也没有探讨催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果的失效路径。
