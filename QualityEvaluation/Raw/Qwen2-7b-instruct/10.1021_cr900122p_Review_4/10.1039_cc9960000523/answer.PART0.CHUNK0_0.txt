<p>Most noteworthy is that the rate of methane/deuterium exchange over gallium oxide is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than for any other oxide, with ZnO and chromia also showing high activity.</p>
<p>The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.</p>
<p>Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction.</p>
<p>In this way the simple physical mixture of the two oxides has combined beneficially the characteristics of both oxides.</p>
<p>We wish to thank the Gas Research Institute of Chicago for financial support.</p>

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not discussed in this literature. The document focuses on the methane partial oxidation to methanol over Ga2O3 based catalysts and uses the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a design tool for identifying suitable catalysts. There is no mention of lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, nor does it discuss the key steps in these processes or their potential consequences on catalyst performance and longevity.

本文未讨论内部分子C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和环化催化剂失活中的作用。该文献专注于基于Ga2O3的催化剂对甲烷的部分氧化到甲醇，并使用CH4/D2交换反应作为设计工具来识别合适的催化剂。文献中没有提及镧系/锕系基或SiO2支持的Re基催化剂，也没有讨论这些过程的关键步骤及其对催化剂性能和寿命的潜在影响。
