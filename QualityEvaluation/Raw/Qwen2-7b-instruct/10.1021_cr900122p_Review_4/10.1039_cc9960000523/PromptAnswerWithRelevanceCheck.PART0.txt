The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not discussed in this literature. The document focuses on the methane partial oxidation to methanol over Ga2O3 based catalysts and uses the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a design tool for identifying suitable catalysts. There is no mention of lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, nor does it discuss the key steps in these processes or their potential consequences on catalyst performance and longevity.

The literature focuses on the use of the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a design tool for identifying catalysts for the direct conversion of methane to methanol. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is highlighted for its exceptionally high methane activation rate compared to other simple oxides, leading to the identification of Ga2O3/MoO3 as a selective catalyst for methane partial oxidation to methanol. The literature also discusses the high activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3) in methane activation, which contributes to their effectiveness in the aromatisation of propane and butane. The study further explores the stability of methanol over various oxides and establishes a correlation between the rate of methanol oxidation and its '*02/1602 exchange reaction. The simple physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 is shown to enhance the rate of methanol formation, suggesting potential for designing high activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.

<p>Under our experimental conditions tantalum oxide, ceria and titania (Degussa P45, mixed anatase and rutile) showed the lowest measurable activity, while silica, niobia, Tb407 and Y203 were inactive.</p>

The literature discusses the use of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. These materials show high activity in activating methane due to their high exchange rate in the CH4/D2 reaction, which indicates their capability in activating methane and oxygen. The study suggests that the combination of Ga2O3 and ZnO in a physical mixture enhances the rate of methanol formation, indicating that the incorporation of these oxides into catalyst formulations could lead to the development of novel high-activity catalysts for methane oxidation. The findings imply that the initial activation of methane and oxygen plays a crucial role in the overall oxidation process, and the high activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO provides a promising avenue for the design of efficient methane-to-methanol conversion catalysts.

The literature also mentions that gallium oxide and zinc oxide are preferred catalyst components for the aromatization of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. This highlights their effectiveness in alkane activation, particularly through the polarizing of C-H bonds. The study further explores the use of gallium oxide in methane oxidation catalysts, suggesting that its inclusion in formulations could potentially improve the performance of methane-to-methanol conversion reactions.
