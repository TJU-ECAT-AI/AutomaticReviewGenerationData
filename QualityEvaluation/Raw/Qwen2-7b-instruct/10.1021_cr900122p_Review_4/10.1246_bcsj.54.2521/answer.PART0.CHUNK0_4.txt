[1] "Among eleven kinds of aluminas, alumina V prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea exhibited a pronounced activity for the isomerization of 1-butene, while alumina III or II prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea showed the highest activities for the exchange reactions between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium, respectively."

The study highlights that alumina V, synthesized from aluminum sulfate with urea, demonstrated significant activity in the isomerization of 1-butene. On the other hand, alumina III or II, produced from aluminum nitrate combined with ammonia or urea, displayed the highest efficiency in hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
