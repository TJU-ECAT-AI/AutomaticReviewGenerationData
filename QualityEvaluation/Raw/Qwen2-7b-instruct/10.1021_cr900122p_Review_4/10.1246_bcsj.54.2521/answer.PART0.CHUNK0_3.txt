The study highlights that alumina V, prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea, demonstrated significant activity in the isomerization of 1-butene. On the other hand, alumina III or II, prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea, displayed the highest activities in hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
