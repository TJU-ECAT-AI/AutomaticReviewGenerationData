The study highlights the distinct activities of different aluminas for specific chemical reactions. Alumina V, made from aluminium sulfate with urea, is highly active in the isomerization of 1-butene. Conversely, alumina III or II, produced from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea, demonstrates the greatest efficiency in hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
