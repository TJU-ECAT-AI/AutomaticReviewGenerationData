[1] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[2] "Since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[3] "High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum environments normally used in surface science studies, and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady-state concentration of those intermediates on the catalyst surface too low to be detected."

The conversion of hydrocarbons plays a central role in various industries such as crude oil refining, food industry fat modification, and pharmaceutical and fine chemical synthesis. However, due to the complexity of catalytic processes, little is known about the molecular-level steps occurring within these systems. High pressures, which are essential for alkyl group conversion, are difficult to achieve in typical vacuum environments used in surface science studies, leading to a decrease in the detection of steady-state concentrations of intermediates on the catalyst surface.
