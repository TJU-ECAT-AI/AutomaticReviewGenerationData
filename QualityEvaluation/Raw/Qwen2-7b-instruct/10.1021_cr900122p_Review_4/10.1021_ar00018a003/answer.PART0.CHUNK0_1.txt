[1] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[2] "Unfortunately, since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[3] "It is only recently that the advent of a variety of modern surface-sensitive instrumentation has made those studies feasible; the power of using such techniques in elucidating reaction mechanisms has been shown already in several key case."
[4] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[5] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu-um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."
[6] "Alternatively, supersonic beams can be used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies needed for their ativation."
[7] "However, even though studies based on these ideas have yielded very exciting results, they have proven less than general for inves- tigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces."
[8] "Several approaches have been taken in order to ov- ercome the difficulties mentioned above."
[9] "In this account we summarize what we have learned so far from those studies."
[10] "Surface reactions are now routinely studied under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (UHV, 10-'o-lO-ll Torr) in order both to facilitate the use of electron- and ion- based spectroscopies and to keep the sample clean from contaminanb."
[11] "Many surface-sensitive techniques have been developed in the past few decades for t h i s purpose;the ones most commonly used in our experiments in- clude thermal programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray (1)"
[12] "Alkyl halides are particularly good can- didates for studies on surfaces because they are easy to prepare and to handle under vacuum and because they have already been shown to undergo oxidative addition reactions in solution to form organometallic products with alkyl ligands attached directly to the metal center."
[13] "The chemisorption of alkyl halides has already been studied on a wide variety of surfaces (Table I)."
[14] "XPS experiments indicate that bonding to the surface occurs through the halogen end of the molecule: the binding energies of electrons associated with the halide atom shift by up to 1 eV upon chemisorption while the values for the C 1s electrons remain u n a f f e  t e d .'"
[15] "In addition, the molecular axes of the hydrocarbon fragments change orientation in going from below to above h a l f saturation coverages."
[16] "An example of this behavior is illustrated by the RAIRS spectra of ethyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(ll1) shown in Figure 1:"
[17] "Only one peak due to the asymmetric deformation of the methyl group (1431 cm-*) is seen at low coverages, but that feature is replaced by a new one for the symmetric mode (1375 cm-l) at h i g h e r surface concentrations."
[18] "Since only vibrations with dipole moments perpendicular to the surface are infrared active, we conclude that a flat geometxy prevails at low coverages and that a rearrangement takes place around half saturation where the methyl group axes become perpendicular to the surface."
[19] "The photochemistry of these systems has been studied in detail by Professor White at the University of Texas, Austin;"
[20] "Thermal activation is equally effective in driving this step: the energy required to break the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces was measured to be less t h a n 5 kcal/mol,"
[21] "In addition, RAIRS allows for the identification of the species formed on the surface."
[22] "The right panel displays vibrational data for the C-D symmetric stretching mode when starting from chemisorbed CD31 below 200 K one main peak is seen at 2112 a t - ' corresponding to methyl iodide molecularly adsorbed on the surface,"
[23] "In addition, ethyl and propyl iodides have also been shown to dissociate on silver, copper,plati- num, palladium, or nickel surfaces."
[24] "It has been found that in general the early transition metals are the most active for carbon-halogen bond scission and that alkyl iodides are the best candidates for the thermal production of hydrocarbon moieties on a given metal surface."
[25] "Figure 2 exemplifies the occurrence of that reaction for the case of iodomethane adsorbed on Pt- (111):the 13d XPS data shown in the left frame in- dicate that the C-I bond breaks between 200 and 240 K,"
[26] "Moreover, TPD experiments have shown that while the hydrogen produced by that reaction desorbs around 330 K (in a desorption-limited step), the rest comes off above 500 K, suggesting that methylene moieties are stable over a wide range of temperatures."
[27] "For instance, the vibrational data obtained from the thermal activation of methyl iodide on Pt(ll1) indicate that methyl groups are converted into methylene between 240 and 280 K (Figure 2)?'"
[28] "Moreover, TPD data from partially labeled molecules clearly show that the fmt dehydrogenation step occum at the methyl end of the ethyl groups and results in the formation of ad- sorbed ethylene (Figure 3, b o t t  m ) ."
[29] "Such @-hy- drogen elimination is in fact well-known in organo- metallic chemistry and has also been shown to be the preferred dehydrogenation pathway for longer alkyl chains on surfaces."
[30] "However, the signal inteneities in the case of ethyl iodide are about half of those obtained from adsorbing ethylene because of the lower saturation coveragea in the former awe."
[31] "These reaulta have been explained by the occurrence of a series of ethylene-ethyl interconversion steps on the surface similar to those observed for hydrogen coadsorbed with Also, as in hydrogenation reactions, H-D"
[32] "TPD spectra from either CH3CD21 or CD3CH21 on Pt(ll1) show that about 2530% of the ethylene that desorbs around 300 K (after @hydrogen elimination) has experienced at least one hydrogen or deuterium substitution."
[33] "These reaults have been explained by the occurrence of a series of ethylene-ethyl interconversion steps on the surface similar to those observed for hydrogen coadsorbed with Also, as in hydrogenation reactions, H-D"
[34] "The product distributions in these TPD ex- periments, which are similar to those obtained from studies on the catalytic H-D exchange of methane, require the formation of at least three surface interme- diates: we have proposed a mechanism that includes the formation of methyl, methylene, and methylidyne (55) Zaera, F. Catal. Lett. 1991,II, 95."
[35] "This is an important conclusion for catalysis, because it implies that product selectivities may be better controlled by changing the pressures of the reactants rather than the reaction temperature."
[36] "Finally, dimerization products have been reported to form from methyl halides on Ru(100),I1 Pd(lW),l4 Cu- (110),31 and foils of other transition metals,40 as well as from ethyl and propyl moieties on Ag(111).34*35 These carbon-carbon bond formation reactions are responsible for the production of hydrocarbons in Fischel-Tropsch catalytic processes."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Key steps include the C-H bond scission leading to alkyl group formation, followed by hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, H-D exchange, and polymerization. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway typically involves the formation of π-allyl complexes which can undergo β-H transfer leading to the loss of hydrogen and subsequent deactivation. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is similar but the stability of the complexes and the nature of the interactions with the support may differ. The potential consequences on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, selectivity issues, and potentially irreversible deactivation. The deactivation pathways are influenced by factors such as the support material, the nature of the catalyst, and reaction conditions like temperature and pressure.

在支持的烯烃聚合和金属交换催化剂的失活中，分子内C-H键激活的作用涉及π-异丙基表面复合物的形成和β-H转移。关键步骤包括C-H键断裂导致烷基团的生成，随后进行氢化-脱氢、氢氘交换和聚合。对于镧系/锕系基催化剂，失活途径通常涉及形成π-异丙基复合物，这可能导致氢的损失并最终导致失活。对于SiO2支持的Re基催化剂，机制类似，但与载体的稳定性及其与载体的相互作用可能有所不同。催化剂性能和寿命的潜在后果包括活性降低、选择性问题以及可能的不可逆失活。失活途径受支持材料、催化剂性质和反应条件（如温度和压力）等因素的影响。
