The conversion of saturated hydrocarbons, which is crucial for refining crude oil, modifying fats in food industries, and synthesizing pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals, remains poorly understood at the molecular level despite advancements in technology. The complexity of catalytic processes makes it difficult to elucidate the specific steps that occur during these conversions. The activation of hydrocarbons often involves the initial scission of a C-H bond leading to the formation of alkyl groups on the surface. However, due to the low probability of this reaction, catalytic processes require harsh conditions to achieve reasonable conversion rates. High pressures are challenging to reproduce in vacuum environments typically used in surface science studies, and they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making it hard to detect the steady-state concentration of intermediates on the catalyst surface. Efforts to overcome these difficulties include using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, which tend to exhibit higher reactivity, or employing supersonic beams to deliver gas molecules with the necessary activation energies. However, these methods have not proven universally applicable for investigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces.

饱和烃的转换，对于原油精炼、脂肪在食品工业中的改性以及药物和精细化学品的合成至关重要，但在分子水平上仍不清楚这一过程的具体步骤。尽管提到了上述技术进步，但饱和烃转换过程的细节仍然不甚明了。催化过程的复杂性使得难以阐明此类系统中发生的单个步骤。烃类激活通常涉及C-H键断裂，形成表面上的烷基基团。然而，由于反应概率较低，催化过程需要苛刻条件才能实现合理的转化率。高压在通常用于表面科学研究的真空环境中很难复制，并且它们往往会加速烷基基团转化为其他物种的过程，使得难以检测催化剂表面上的中间体的稳态浓度。克服这些困难的努力包括使用具有低配位金属原子的开放表面，这些表面倾向于表现出更高的活性，或者采用超声波束向表面传递具有必要激活能量的气体分子。然而，这些方法尚未证明适用于广泛应用于表面化学研究的表面化学过程。
