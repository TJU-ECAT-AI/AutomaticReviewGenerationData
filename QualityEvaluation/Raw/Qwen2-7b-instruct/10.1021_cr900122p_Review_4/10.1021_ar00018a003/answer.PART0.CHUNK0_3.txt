[5] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[6] "The activation of those compounds is believed to occur through an initial C-H bond scission step that results in the formation of alkyl groups on the surface."
[7] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[8] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu- um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reativity."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not explicitly discussed in the provided document. However, it can be inferred that C-H bond scission plays a crucial role in the activation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces, which subsequently leads to various surface chemistry reactions. The document highlights the importance of C-H bond activation in the conversion of hydrocarbons and the activation of alkyl halides to form alkyl groups on metal surfaces. This process often requires high pressures and temperatures, which can lead to the deactivation of catalysts. The use of open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms is suggested as a method to facilitate C-H bond breaking under vacuum conditions. Another method mentioned for preparing chemisorbed alkyl groups involves the dissociation of alkyl halides. Therefore, while the document does not delve into the specifics of C-H bond activation in relation to catalyst deactivation, it provides foundational insights into the chemistry of alkyl group activation and surface reactions that might influence catalyst performance and longevity.

文档没有明确讨论内键C-H键活化在支持烯烃聚合和金属迁移催化剂失活中的作用。然而，可以推断出C-H键断裂在金属表面激活烷基团中起着关键作用，随后导致表面化学反应的多种变化。文档强调了C-H键激活在烃类转换以及烷基卤化物分解形成烷基团在金属表面上的作用的重要性。这个过程通常需要高压和高温，这可能导致催化剂失效。使用具有低配位金属原子的开放表面作为方法，在真空条件下促进C-H键断裂。另一种准备吸附的烷基团的方法是通过分解烷基卤化物。因此，虽然文档没有深入探讨与催化剂失效相关的C-H键激活的细节，但它提供了关于烷基团激活和表面反应的基础见解，这些可能会影响催化剂性能和寿命。
