Alkyl halides adsorb molecularly on transition metal surfaces at low temperatures. The C-X bond, where X represents halogen, can be easily activated either thermally or photolytically, leading to the formation of adsorbed alkyl moieties. Thermal activation is found to require less energy than gas-phase activation. Professor White's detailed studies on the photochemistry of these systems demonstrate that the C-X bond can be dissociated by ultraviolet light of lower energy than that needed in the gas phase. The energy required for breaking the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces is less than 5 kcal/mol, comparable to observations in solution. The initial step of carbon-halogen bond dissociation leads to the formation of chemisorbed alkyl moieties. These alkyl moieties can undergo further transformations at higher temperatures, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, H-D exchange, and polymerization reactions.

烷基卤化物在过渡金属表面以分子形式吸附，低温下即可实现。碳-卤键（X代表卤素）可通过热激活或光化学激活轻松断裂，产生吸附的烷基基团。热激活所需的能量小于气相激活。怀特教授对这些系统的详细研究表明，使用较低能量的紫外线可使表面的C-X键断裂，该能量低于气相中的所需能量。Ni(100)表面的C-I键断裂所需的能量小于5 kcal/mol，与溶液中观察到的现象相似。初始的碳-卤键断裂导致形成吸附的烷基基团。随着温度升高，表面的烷基基团可以进一步转化为脱氢、加氢、H-D交换和聚合反应。

[1] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[2] "Unfortunately, since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[3] "It is only recently that the advent of a variety of modern surface-sensitive instrumentation has made those studies feasible; the power of using such techniques in elucidating reaction mechanisms has been shown already in several key case."
[4] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[5] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu-um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."
[6] "Alternatively, supersonic beams can be used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies needed for their ativation."
[7] "However, even though studies based on these ideas have yielded very exciting results, they have proven less than general for inves- tigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces."
[8] "Several approaches have been taken in order to ov- ercome the difficulties mentioned above."
[9] "In this account we summarize what we have learned so far from those studies."
[10] "Surface reactions are now routinely studied under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (UHV, 10-'o-lO-ll Torr) in order both to facilitate the use of electron- and ion- based spectroscopies and to keep the sample clean from contaminanb."
[11] "Many surface-sensitive techniques have been developed in the past few decades for t h i s purpose;the ones most commonly used in our experiments in- clude thermal programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray (1)"
[12] "Alkyl halides are particularly good can- didates for studies on surfaces because they are easy to prepare and to handle under vacuum and because they have already been shown to undergo oxidative addition reactions in solution to form organometallic products with alkyl ligands attached directly to the metal center."
[13] "The chemisorption of alkyl halides has already been studied on a wide variety of surfaces (Table I)."
[14] "XPS experiments indicate that bonding to the surface occurs through the halogen end of the molecule: the binding energies of electrons associated with the halide atom shift by up to 1 eV upon chemisorption while the values for the C 1s electrons remain u n a f f e  t e d .'"
[15] "In addition, the molecular axes of the hydrocarbon fragments change orientation in going from below to above h a l f saturation coverages."
[16] "An example of this behavior is illustrated by the RAIRS spectra of ethyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(ll1) shown in Figure 1:"
[17] "Only one peak due to the asymmetric deformation of the methyl group (1431 cm-*) is seen at low coverages, but that feature is replaced by a new one for the symmetric mode (1375 cm-l) at h i g h e r surface concentrations."
[18] "Since only vibrations with dipole moments perpendicular to the surface are infrared active, we conclude that a flat geometxy prevails at low coverages and that a rearrangement takes place around half saturation where the methyl group axes become perpendicular to the surface."
[19] "The photochemistry of these systems has been studied in detail by Professor White at the University of Texas, Austin;"
[20] "Thermal activation is equally effective in driving this step: the energy required to break the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces was measured to be less t h a n 5 kcal/mol,"
[21] "In addition, RAIRS allows for the identification of the species formed on the surface."
[22] "The right panel displays vibrational data for the C-D symmetric stretching mode when starting from chemisorbed CD31 below 200 K one main peak is seen at 2112 a t - ' corresponding to methyl iodide molecularly adsorbed on the surface,"
[23] "In addition, ethyl and propyl iodides have also been shown to dissociate on silver, copper,plati- num, palladium, or nickel surfaces."
[24] "It has been found that in general the early transition metals are the most active for carbon-halogen bond scission and that alkyl iodides are the best candidates for the thermal production of hydrocarbon moieties on a given metal surface."
[25] "Figure 2 exemplifies the occurrence of that reaction for the case of iodomethane adsorbed on Pt- (111):the 13d XPS data shown in the left frame in- dicate that the C-I bond breaks between 200 and 240 K,"
[26] "Moreover, TPD experiments have shown that while the hydrogen produced by that reaction desorbs around 330 K (in a desorption-limited step), the rest comes off above 500 K, suggesting that methylene moieties are stable over a wide range of temperatures."
[27] "For instance, the vibrational data obtained from the thermal activation of methyl iodide on Pt(ll1) indicate that methyl groups are converted into methylene between 240 and 280 K (Figure 2)?'"
[28] "Moreover, TPD data from partially labeled molecules clearly show that the fmt dehydrogenation step occum at the methyl end of the ethyl groups and results in the formation of ad- sorbed ethylene (Figure 3, b o t t  m ) ."
[29] "Such @-hy- drogen elimination is in fact well-known in organo- metallic chemistry and has also been shown to be the preferred dehydrogenation pathway for longer alkyl chains on surfaces."
[30] "However, the signal inteneities in the case of ethyl iodide are about half of those obtained from adsorbing ethylene because of the lower saturation coveragea in the former awe."
[31] "These reaulta have been explained by the occurrence of a series of ethylene-ethyl interconversion steps on the surface similar to those observed for hydrogen coadsorbed with Also, as in hydrogenation reactions, H-D"
[32] "TPD spectra from either CH3CD21 or CD3CH21 on Pt(ll1) show that about 2530% of the ethylene that desorbs around 300 K (after @hydrogen elimination) has experienced at least one hydrogen or deuterium substitution."
[33] "These reaults have been explained by the occurrence of a series of ethylene-ethyl interconversion steps on the surface similar to those observed for hydrogen coadsorbed with Also, as in hydrogenation reactions, H-D"
[34] "The product distributions in these TPD ex- periments, which are similar to those obtained from studies on the catalytic H-D exchange of methane, require the formation of at least three surface interme- diates: we have proposed a mechanism that includes the formation of methyl, methylene, and methylidyne (55) Zaera, F. Catal. Lett. 1991,II, 95."
[35] "This is an important conclusion for catalysis, because it implies that product selectivities may be better controlled by changing the pressures of the reactants rather than the reaction temperature."
[36] "Finally, dimerization products have been reported to form from methyl halides on Ru(100),I1 Pd(lW),l4 Cu- (110),31 and foils of other transition metals,40 as well as from ethyl and propyl moieties on Ag(111).34*35 These carbon-carbon bond formation reactions are responsible for the production of hydrocarbons in Fischel-Tropsch catalytic processes."

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. Key steps include the C-H bond scission leading to alkyl group formation, followed by hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, H-D exchange, and polymerization. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the deactivation pathway typically involves the formation of π-allyl complexes which can undergo β-H transfer leading to the loss of hydrogen and subsequent deactivation. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the mechanism is similar but the stability of the complexes and the nature of the interactions with the support may differ. The potential consequences on catalyst performance and longevity include reduced activity, selectivity issues, and potentially irreversible deactivation. The deactivation pathways are influenced by factors such as the support material, the nature of the catalyst, and reaction conditions like temperature and pressure.

The conversion of saturated hydrocarbons, which is crucial for refining crude oil, modifying fats in food industries, and synthesizing pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals, remains poorly understood at the molecular level despite advancements in technology. The complexity of catalytic processes makes it difficult to elucidate the specific steps that occur during these conversions. The activation of hydrocarbons often involves the initial scission of a C-H bond leading to the formation of alkyl groups on the surface. However, due to the low probability of this reaction, catalytic processes require harsh conditions to achieve reasonable conversion rates. High pressures are challenging to reproduce in vacuum environments typically used in surface science studies, and they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making it hard to detect the steady-state concentration of intermediates on the catalyst surface. Efforts to overcome these difficulties include using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, which tend to exhibit higher reactivity, or employing supersonic beams to deliver gas molecules with the necessary activation energies. However, these methods have not proven universally applicable for investigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces.

饱和烃的转换，对于原油精炼、脂肪在食品工业中的改性以及药物和精细化学品的合成至关重要，但在分子水平上仍不清楚这一过程的具体步骤。尽管提到了上述技术进步，但饱和烃转换过程的细节仍然不甚明了。催化过程的复杂性使得难以阐明此类系统中发生的单个步骤。烃类激活通常涉及C-H键断裂，形成表面上的烷基基团。然而，由于反应概率较低，催化过程需要苛刻条件才能实现合理的转化率。高压在通常用于表面科学研究的真空环境中很难复制，并且它们往往会加速烷基基团转化为其他物种的过程，使得难以检测催化剂表面上的中间体的稳态浓度。克服这些困难的努力包括使用具有低配位金属原子的开放表面，这些表面倾向于表现出更高的活性，或者采用超声波束向表面传递具有必要激活能量的气体分子。然而，这些方法尚未证明适用于广泛应用于表面化学研究的表面化学过程。

The role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts is not explicitly discussed in the provided document. However, it can be inferred that C-H bond scission plays a crucial role in the activation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces, which subsequently leads to various surface chemistry reactions. The document highlights the importance of C-H bond activation in the conversion of hydrocarbons and the activation of alkyl halides to form alkyl groups on metal surfaces. This process often requires high pressures and temperatures, which can lead to the deactivation of catalysts. The use of open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms is suggested as a method to facilitate C-H bond breaking under vacuum conditions. Another method mentioned for preparing chemisorbed alkyl groups involves the dissociation of alkyl halides. Therefore, while the document does not delve into the specifics of C-H bond activation in relation to catalyst deactivation, it provides foundational insights into the chemistry of alkyl group activation and surface reactions that might influence catalyst performance and longevity.
