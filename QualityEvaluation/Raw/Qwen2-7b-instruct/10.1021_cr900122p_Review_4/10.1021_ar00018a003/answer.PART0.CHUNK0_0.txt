Alkyl halides adsorb molecularly on transition metal surfaces at low temperatures. The C-X bond, where X represents halogen, can be easily activated either thermally or photolytically, leading to the formation of adsorbed alkyl moieties. Thermal activation is found to require less energy than gas-phase activation. Professor White's detailed studies on the photochemistry of these systems demonstrate that the C-X bond can be dissociated by ultraviolet light of lower energy than that needed in the gas phase. The energy required for breaking the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces is less than 5 kcal/mol, comparable to observations in solution. The initial step of carbon-halogen bond dissociation leads to the formation of chemisorbed alkyl moieties. These alkyl moieties can undergo further transformations at higher temperatures, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, H-D exchange, and polymerization reactions.

烷基卤化物在过渡金属表面以分子形式吸附，低温下即可实现。碳-卤键（X代表卤素）可通过热激活或光化学激活轻松断裂，产生吸附的烷基基团。热激活所需的能量小于气相激活。怀特教授对这些系统的详细研究表明，使用较低能量的紫外线可使表面的C-X键断裂，该能量低于气相中的所需能量。Ni(100)表面的C-I键断裂所需的能量小于5 kcal/mol，与溶液中观察到的现象相似。初始的碳-卤键断裂导致形成吸附的烷基基团。随着温度升高，表面的烷基基团可以进一步转化为脱氢、加氢、H-D交换和聚合反应。
