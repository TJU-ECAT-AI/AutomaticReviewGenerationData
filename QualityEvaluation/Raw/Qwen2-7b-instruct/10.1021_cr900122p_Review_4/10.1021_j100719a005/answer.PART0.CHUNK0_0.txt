[1] "The purpose of this report is to describe some of the finer details of the exchange of Dz with benzene7 carried out over the same y-, ?-alumina catalyst used in the methanel arid olefin3-5 reactions."
[2] "The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques."
[3] "All investigators2-416 have observed that the re- action multiplicity, M ,  is unity and have concluded that the exchange reactions are all stepwise."
[4] "Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[5] "The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the re- action mechanism."

The document discusses the finer details of deuteration exchange with benzene over alumina catalysts. The catalyst is characterized by its ability to activate CH bonds under mild conditions. The exchange reaction with Dz is faster than that with CH, indicating a stepwise dissociative mechanism. The presence of NO, CO, HzO, O2, and NHs has little impact on the exchange reaction, suggesting they do not interact significantly with the active sites. The concentration of active sites is estimated to be around 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2, and the exchange reactions are observed to occur on exposed Al3+ surface ions. The absence of poisoning by these gases suggests that the active sites are not the same ones which catalyze isomerization in olefins.

该文档讨论了苯在氧化铝催化剂上的氘交换细节。催化剂能够在温和条件下激活CH键。与Dz的交换反应比与H的快，表明存在步进式解离机制。NO、CO、HzO、O2和NHs对交换反应影响不大，这表明它们与活性位点的相互作用不强。活性位点的浓度估计为每平方厘米6-15 x 1012个位点，交换反应发生在暴露的Al3+表面离子上。这些气体的缺乏毒性表明催化烯烃异构化反应的活性位点可能不同。
