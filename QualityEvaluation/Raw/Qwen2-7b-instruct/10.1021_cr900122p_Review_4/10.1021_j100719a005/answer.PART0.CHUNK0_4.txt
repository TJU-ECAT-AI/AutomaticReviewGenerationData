[1] "The poisoning experiments have supplied considerable information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites, Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[2] "Water caused some poisoning, but its effect was small compared with the devastating effect of COz."
[3] "An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between am- 
monia and the alumina surface, but this interaction (if it did occur) did not affect the exchange rate."
[4] "The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the re- action mechanism."
[5] "Carbon dioxide was clearly the most effective poison tested. I f one assumes a 1:1 = site-poison molecule ratio, the poisoning intercept in Figure 3 gives a site density of about 15 X loL2 sites/cm2 for both the DZ exchange and the redistribution reactions."

The poisoning experiments revealed that carbon dioxide was the most effective poison, causing significant deactivation. The site density, estimated from the poisoning intercept, was around 15 × 10^12 sites/cm² for both deuterium exchange and intermolecular hydrogen redistribution reactions. Water caused some poisoning but had a lesser impact compared to carbon dioxide. Ammonia did not cause significant poisoning, suggesting no direct chemical interaction with the alumina surface affecting the exchange rate. The absence of poisoning from nitrogen oxides (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), oxygen (O₂), and ammonia (NH₃) indicates that these compounds likely do not interact chemically with the active sites. Furthermore, the lack of change in exchange reaction characteristics upon full deuteration of the catalyst implies that the majority of the catalyst's hydrogen atoms (approximately 2 × 10^14/cm²) are not involved in the reaction mechanism.

中毒实验显示，二氧化碳是效果最明显的毒物，造成显著的失活。从中毒截距估算的活性位点密度约为15×10^12个/cm²，适用于两者之间的脱氘交换和间分子氢重分布反应。水导致了一些中毒，但其影响远小于二氧化碳。氨没有引起显著的中毒，这表明这些化合物可能与活性位点之间没有直接的化学相互作用，不影响交换率。氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、过氧化氢（H₂O₂）、氧气（O₂）和氨（NH₃）都没有引起显著的中毒现象，表明这些化合物可能不与活性表面发生化学反应。此外，催化剂全氘化后交换反应特性未发生变化，表明大多数催化剂的氢原子（约2×10^14/cm²）不参与反应机制。
