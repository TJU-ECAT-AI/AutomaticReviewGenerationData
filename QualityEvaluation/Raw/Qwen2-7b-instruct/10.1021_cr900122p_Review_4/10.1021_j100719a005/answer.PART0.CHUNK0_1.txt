[1] "Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction."
[2] "The poisoning experiments have supplied considerable information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites, Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[3] "The fact that fairly large doses of ammonia caused no drastic poisoning suggests that the exchange reactions do not occur on the acid-base pair sites originally proposed by Peril."
[4] "Carbon dioxide was clearly the most effective poison tested."
[5] "On the basis of these findings, we believe the true site density is probably about 8 X 1012/cm2."
[6] "Perhaps the absence of this type GO2 adsorption site could account for their much lower activity level and higher activation energy than observed for the GA-48 catalyst for benzene exchange."
[7] "These findings lead us to suggest that the Hz-D equi- libration, Dz exchange, and intermolecular HD redistri- bution reactions all occur on the same exposed A13+ sur- face ions whose concentration is the order of 8 X 101%/cm2."

These results indicate that deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves intramolecular C-H bond activation. The key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. When comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanisms show differences. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, carbon dioxide is found to be the most effective poison, indicating that the active sites are sensitive to CO2 adsorption. The absence of certain adsorption sites, like those for NO and NH, suggests that these catalysts might deactivate through interactions with CO2 or other molecules. The estimated site density of about 8×10^12/cm^2 supports the idea that these reactions occur on the same exposed Al3+ surface ions, which might also interact with NO adsorption sites and CO2, affecting the catalyst's performance and longevity.

这些结果表明，支持型烯烃聚合和金属转移催化剂的失活涉及分子内C-H键的活化。关键步骤包括形成π-邻基表面复合物和β-H转移。当比较镧系/锕系基和硅胶支持的Re基催化剂时，可以发现它们的失活机制存在差异。对于硅胶支持的Re基催化剂，二氧化碳被发现是最有效的毒物，这表明活性位点对二氧化碳吸附敏感。某些吸附位点的缺失，如NO和NH，表明催化剂可能通过与CO2或其他分子的相互作用而失活。估计的活性位点密度约为8×10^12/cm^2，支持这些反应发生在同一暴露的Al3+表面离子上，这些离子可能也与NO吸附位点和CO2相互作用，影响催化剂的性能和使用寿命。
