[1] "Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction."
[2] "Water caused some poisoning, but its effect was small compared with the devastating effect of COz."
[3] "The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the reaction mechanism."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The compounds NO, CO, O2, HzO, and 3 had minimal impact on the exchange reaction, whereas water had a lesser but still noticeable effect compared to COz.
2. The deuterated catalyst did not show any substantial alterations in its exchange reaction characteristics, suggesting that the vast majority of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, with a concentration around 2 X 1014/cm2, do not participate in the reaction mechanism.
3. Carbon dioxide was identified as the most effective poison among the tested compounds. The site density for both deuterium exchange and intermolecular hydrogen redistribution reactions was estimated to be around 15 X 1012 sites/cm2 based on poisoning intercepts.
4. Carbon dioxide interacts with alumina in various ways, as evidenced by infrared spectroscopy studies conducted by Peril4 and others like Little and Amberg, Parkyns, and Gregg and Ramsay.
5. There was an unexpected finding that none of the compounds NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 , and NHs caused significant poisoning.
6. The poisoning experiments provided substantial insights into the concentration and chemical characteristics of the active sites on the catalyst.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1.NO、CO、O2、HzO和3等化合物对交换反应的影响较小，相比之下，水的作用虽然较弱但仍然存在，尤其是与COz相比。
2.当催化剂完全去氢化后，其交换反应特性未表现出任何显著变化，这表明催化剂表面大约2 X 1014/cm2的氢原子中，绝大多数并不参与反应机制。
3.二氧化碳被确认为最有效的毒剂。基于中毒截距，推测交换反应和分子间氢分布反应的活性位点密度约为15 X 1012个位点/cm2。
4.二氧化碳以多种方式与氧化铝相互作用，这一结论通过Peril4和其他研究者如Little和Amberg、Parkyns、Gregg和Ramsay的红外光谱研究得到证实。
5.令人意外的是，NO、CO、HzO、0 2 和NHs等化合物并未引起显著的中毒现象。
6.中毒实验提供了大量关于催化剂上活性位点浓度和化学性质的信息。
