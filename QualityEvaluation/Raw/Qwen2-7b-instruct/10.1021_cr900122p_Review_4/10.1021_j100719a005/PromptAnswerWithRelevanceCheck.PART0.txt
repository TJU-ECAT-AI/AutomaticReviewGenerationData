[1] "The purpose of this report is to describe some of the finer details of the exchange of Dz with benzene7 carried out over the same y-, ?-alumina catalyst used in the methanel arid olefin3-5 reactions."
[2] "The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques."
[3] "All investigators2-416 have observed that the re- action multiplicity, M ,  is unity and have concluded that the exchange reactions are all stepwise."
[4] "Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[5] "The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the re- action mechanism."
[6] "Peril4 has shown by ir measurements that COz is held in a variety of ways on alumina, and most of the bands he observed have also been observed by Little and Am- berg," Parkyns,lB and Gregg and Ramsay.lQ"

The document discusses the finer details of deuteration exchange with benzene over alumina catalysts. The catalyst is characterized by its ability to activate CH bonds under mild conditions. The exchange reaction with Dz is faster than that with CH, indicating a stepwise dissociative mechanism. The presence of NO, CO, HzO, O2, and NHs has little impact on the exchange reaction, suggesting they do not interact significantly with the active sites. The concentration of active sites is estimated to be around 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2, and the exchange reactions are observed to occur on exposed Al3+ surface ions. The absence of poisoning by these gases suggests that the active sites are not the same ones which catalyze isomerization in olefins.

该文档讨论了苯在氧化铝催化剂上的氘交换细节。催化剂能够在温和条件下激活CH键。与Dz的交换反应比与H的快，表明存在步进式解离机制。NO、CO、HzO、O2和NHs对交换反应影响不大，这表明它们与活性位点的相互作用不强。活性位点的浓度估计为每平方厘米6-15 x 1012个位点，交换反应发生在暴露的Al3+表面离子上。这些气体的缺乏毒性表明催化烯烃异构化反应的活性位点可能不同。

[1] "Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction."
[2] "The poisoning experiments have supplied considerable information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites, Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[3] "The fact that fairly large doses of ammonia caused no drastic poisoning suggests that the exchange reactions do not occur on the acid-base pair sites originally proposed by Peril."
[4] "Carbon dioxide was clearly the most effective poison tested."
[5] "On the basis of these findings, we believe the true site density is probably about 8 X 1012/cm2."
[6] "Perhaps the absence of this type GO2 adsorption site could account for their much lower activity level and higher activation energy than observed for the GA-48 catalyst for benzene exchange."
[7] "These findings lead us to suggest that the Hz-D equi- libration, Dz exchange, and intermolecular HD redistri- bution reactions all occur on the same exposed A13+ sur- face ions whose concentration is the order of 8 X 101%/cm2."

These results indicate that deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts involves intramolecular C-H bond activation. The key steps include the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer. When comparing lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, the deactivation mechanisms show differences. For silica-supported Re-based catalysts, carbon dioxide is found to be the most effective poison, indicating that the active sites are sensitive to CO2 adsorption. The absence of certain adsorption sites, like those for NO and NH, suggests that these catalysts might deactivate through interactions with CO2 or other molecules. The estimated site density of about 8×10^12/cm^2 supports the idea that these reactions occur on the same exposed Al3+ surface ions, which might also interact with NO adsorption sites and CO2, affecting the catalyst's performance and longevity.

这些结果表明，支持型烯烃聚合和金属转移催化剂的失活涉及分子内C-H键的活化。关键步骤包括形成π-邻基表面复合物和β-H转移。当比较镧系/锕系基和硅胶支持的Re基催化剂时，可以发现它们的失活机制存在差异。对于硅胶支持的Re基催化剂，二氧化碳被发现是最有效的毒物，这表明活性位点对二氧化碳吸附敏感。某些吸附位点的缺失，如NO和NH，表明催化剂可能通过与CO2或其他分子的相互作用而失活。估计的活性位点密度约为8×10^12/cm^2，支持这些反应发生在同一暴露的Al3+表面离子上，这些离子可能也与NO吸附位点和CO2相互作用，影响催化剂的性能和使用寿命。

[1] "It is entirely possible that no single type of site is responsible for all reactions and that in some cases different sites must work in coordination to produce the desired catalysis."
[2] "The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques."
[3] "Although their absolute activities varied markedly with outgassing temperature, Flockhart,et al. found a still higher activation energy (8.7 kcal/mol) for propane exchange with D2 over a catalyst similar to that used by McCosh and Kemball."
[4] "The poisoning experiments have supplied considerable information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites."
[5] "An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between ammonia and the alumina surface."

These results indicate that the active sites on alumina catalysts are diverse and play distinct roles in various chemical reactions. The concentration of these sites is estimated to be around 8 × 10^12/cm^2. Different compounds exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in poisoning the reactions, suggesting the presence of multiple types of active sites. The lack of poisoning by certain compounds might imply that the exchange reactions occur on exposed aluminum ions. The mechanism for the exchange reactions is likely stepwise, involving the dissociative mechanism with the slow step being the cleavage of CH bonds. The high activity of vinyl or aromatic CH bonds compared to paraffinic CH bonds indicates that the initial interaction with the surface might involve the attraction of the π-system in the molecule. It is hypothesized that two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent aluminum ions could undergo the redistribution reaction. The strong adsorption of the π-system in benzene might inhibit the adsorption of hydrogen on these same sites, explaining why benzene poisons the H2-D2 equilibrium.

这些结果表明，铝氧化物催化剂上的活性位点种类多样，并在不同化学反应中扮演不同的角色。估计这些位点的浓度约为每平方厘米8×10^12个。不同的化合物在中毒反应中的效果各不相同，这表明存在多种类型的活性位点。某些化合物未能引起中毒可能意味着交换反应发生在暴露的铝离子上。氨与氧化铝表面发生化学相互作用的可能性得到了肯定的回答。这些发现提供了关于活性位点浓度和化学性质的重要信息。高活性的乙烯或芳香族C-H键与烷基C-H键相比，这可能表明分子与表面的初始相互作用可能涉及π系统对的吸引。推测两个π键连接到同一或相邻铝离子的分子可能会经历重分配反应。苯对π系统的强烈吸附可能抑制了氢原子在这些相同位点上的吸附，解释了为什么苯能毒害H2-D2平衡的原因。

1. The compounds NO, CO, O2, HzO, and 3 had minimal impact on the exchange reaction, whereas water had a lesser but still noticeable effect compared to COz.
2. The deuterated catalyst did not show any substantial alterations in its exchange reaction characteristics, suggesting that the vast majority of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, with a concentration around 2 X 1014/cm2, do not participate in the reaction mechanism.
3. Carbon dioxide was identified as the most effective poison among the tested compounds. The site density for both deuterium exchange and intermolecular hydrogen redistribution reactions was estimated to be around 15 X 1012 sites/cm2 based on poisoning intercepts.
4. Carbon dioxide interacts with alumina in various ways, as evidenced by infrared spectroscopy studies conducted by Peril4 and others like Little and Amberg, Parkyns, and Gregg and Ramsay.
5. There was an unexpected finding that none of the compounds NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 , and NHs caused significant poisoning.
6. The poisoning experiments provided substantial insights into the concentration and chemical characteristics of the active sites on the catalyst.

1.NO、CO、O2、HzO和3等化合物对交换反应的影响较小，相比之下，水的作用虽然较弱但仍然存在，尤其是与COz相比。
2.当催化剂完全去氢化后，其交换反应特性未表现出任何显著变化，这表明催化剂表面大约2 X 1014/cm2的氢原子中，绝大多数并不参与反应机制。
3.二氧化碳被确认为最有效的毒剂。基于中毒截距，推测交换反应和分子间氢分布反应的活性位点密度约为15 X 1012个位点/cm2。
4.二氧化碳以多种方式与氧化铝相互作用，这一结论通过Peril4和其他研究者如Little和Amberg、Parkyns、Gregg和Ramsay的红外光谱研究得到证实。
5.令人意外的是，NO、CO、HzO、0 2 和NHs等化合物并未引起显著的中毒现象。
6.中毒实验提供了大量关于催化剂上活性位点浓度和化学性质的信息。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The poisoning experiments revealed that carbon dioxide was the most effective poison, causing significant deactivation. The site density, estimated from the poisoning intercept, was around 15 × 10^12 sites/cm² for both deuterium exchange and intermolecular hydrogen redistribution reactions. Water caused some poisoning but had a lesser impact compared to carbon dioxide. Ammonia did not cause significant poisoning, suggesting no direct chemical interaction with the alumina surface affecting the exchange rate. The absence of poisoning from nitrogen oxides (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), oxygen (O₂), and ammonia (NH₃) indicates that these compounds likely do not interact chemically with the active sites. Furthermore, the lack of change in exchange reaction characteristics upon full deuteration of the catalyst implies that the majority of the catalyst's hydrogen atoms (approximately 2 × 10^14/cm²) are not involved in the reaction mechanism.

中毒实验显示，二氧化碳是效果最明显的毒物，造成显著的失活。从中毒截距估算的活性位点密度约为15×10^12个/cm²，适用于两者之间的脱氘交换和间分子氢重分布反应。水导致了一些中毒，但其影响远小于二氧化碳。氨没有引起显著的中毒，这表明这些化合物可能与活性位点之间没有直接的化学相互作用，不影响交换率。氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、过氧化氢（H₂O₂）、氧气（O₂）和氨（NH₃）都没有引起显著的中毒现象，表明这些化合物可能不与活性表面发生化学反应。此外，催化剂全氘化后交换反应特性未发生变化，表明大多数催化剂的氢原子（约2×10^14/cm²）不参与反应机制。
