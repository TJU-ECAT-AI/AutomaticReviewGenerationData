[1] "It is entirely possible that no single type of site is responsible for all reactions and that in some cases different sites must work in coordination to produce the desired catalysis."
[2] "The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques."
[3] "Although their absolute activities varied markedly with outgassing temperature, Flockhart,et al. found a still higher activation energy (8.7 kcal/mol) for propane exchange with D2 over a catalyst similar to that used by McCosh and Kemball."
[4] "The poisoning experiments have supplied considerable information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites."
[5] "An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between ammonia and the alumina surface."

These results indicate that the active sites on alumina catalysts are diverse and play distinct roles in various chemical reactions. The concentration of these sites is estimated to be around 8 × 10^12/cm^2. Different compounds exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in poisoning the reactions, suggesting the presence of multiple types of active sites. The lack of poisoning by certain compounds might imply that the exchange reactions occur on exposed aluminum ions. The mechanism for the exchange reactions is likely stepwise, involving the dissociative mechanism with the slow step being the cleavage of CH bonds. The high activity of vinyl or aromatic CH bonds compared to paraffinic CH bonds indicates that the initial interaction with the surface might involve the attraction of the π-system in the molecule. It is hypothesized that two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent aluminum ions could undergo the redistribution reaction. The strong adsorption of the π-system in benzene might inhibit the adsorption of hydrogen on these same sites, explaining why benzene poisons the H2-D2 equilibrium.
