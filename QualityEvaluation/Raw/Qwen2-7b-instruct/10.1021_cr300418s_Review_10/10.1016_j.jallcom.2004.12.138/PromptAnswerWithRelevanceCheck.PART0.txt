[1] "The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, La located at the A-site, was prepared by the alkoxide method. Pd located at the B-site of the perovskite lattice in the oxidative atmosphere, and segregated out to form small metallic particles in the reductive atmosphere."
[2] "The self-regenerative function of Pd occurs even at 200 C, unexpectedly low temperature, in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst."
[3] "Since the high catalytic activity is maintained, the great reduction of Pd loading has been achieved."
[4] "The intelligent catalyst is expected as a new application of the rare earth, and then the technology is expected in the same way in the global standard of the catalyst designing."
[5] "It was also reported that Pd containing LaCeFeCoO3 showed the excellent three-way catalytic activity for automotive emissions control."
[6] "But it is required to remove cobalt (Co), which has been singled out by TA-luft as a carcinogenic, for the industrialization of the perovskite catalyst as the practical intelligent catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The self-regenerative function of the Pd in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst allows it to move reversibly between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the metallic particle lattice. This function enables the catalyst to maintain high catalytic activity even at low temperatures, resulting in a significant reduction of Pd loading. The catalyst is considered a new application of rare earth metals and is expected to contribute to the global standard of catalyst design by addressing the supply and demand issues of precious metals.

The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, named the intelligent catalyst, has been developed to have a self-regenerative function of the precious metal in the inherent fluctuations of automotive exhaust-gas. This allows for the maintenance of high catalytic activity while reducing the loading of Pd. The intelligent catalyst is expected to be a new application of rare earth metals, contributing to global standard catalyst design. The perovskite structure containing rare earth metals at A-site makes it an interesting material for catalytic applications. The presence of Pd in LaCeFeCoO3 demonstrated excellent three-way catalytic activity for automotive emissions control. However, it is necessary to remove Co, identified as a carcinogenic by TA-luft, for the industrialization of the perovskite catalyst as a practical intelligent catalyst. The paper investigates the self-regenerative function and its temperature dependency of the Co-free perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3.

The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, known as the intelligent catalyst, possesses a self-regenerative function for precious metals in the fluctuations of automotive exhaust gases. Throughout the redox cycle of the exhaust-gas, the catalyst maintains its perovskite structure, allowing for a completely reversible change in the local structure around the Pd atoms. The movement of Pd atoms between the perovskite lattice and metallic particles suppresses the agglomeration and growth of Pd particles, even under severe environmental conditions. Remarkably, this self-regenerative function of Pd occurs at an unexpectedly low temperature of 200°C, resulting in high catalytic activity while significantly reducing the Pd loading. This technology is anticipated to be a novel application of rare earth elements and is expected to contribute to the global standard of catalyst design.
