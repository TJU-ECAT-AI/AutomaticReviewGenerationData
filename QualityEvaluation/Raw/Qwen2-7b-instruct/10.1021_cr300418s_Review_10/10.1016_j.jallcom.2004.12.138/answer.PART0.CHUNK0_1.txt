1. "An innovative LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, named the intelligent catalyst, has been developed, and which has a new self-regenerative function of the precious metal in the inherent fluctuations of automotive exhaust-gas."
2. "Since the high catalytic activity is maintained, the great reduction of Pd loading has been achieved."
3. "It is revealed that the self-regenerative function of Pd occurs even at 200 C, unexpectedly low temperature, in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst."
4. "Self-regenerative function suppresses the grain growth of precious metals."
5. "Light-off performance of the intelligent catalyst is much better than that of the contemporary catalyst due to the suppression of Pd grain growth."
6. "Rare earth metal containing LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst has been industrialized for SULEV (super ultra low emission vehicle)."
