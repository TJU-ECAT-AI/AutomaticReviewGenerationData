The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, named the intelligent catalyst, has been developed to have a self-regenerative function of the precious metal in the inherent fluctuations of automotive exhaust-gas. This allows for the maintenance of high catalytic activity while reducing the loading of Pd. The intelligent catalyst is expected to be a new application of rare earth metals, contributing to global standard catalyst design. The perovskite structure containing rare earth metals at A-site makes it an interesting material for catalytic applications. The presence of Pd in LaCeFeCoO3 demonstrated excellent three-way catalytic activity for automotive emissions control. However, it is necessary to remove Co, identified as a carcinogenic by TA-luft, for the industrialization of the perovskite catalyst as a practical intelligent catalyst. The paper investigates the self-regenerative function and its temperature dependency of the Co-free perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3.
