[1] "The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, La located at the A-site, was prepared by the alkoxide method. Pd located at the B-site of the perovskite lattice in the oxidative atmosphere, and segregated out to form small metallic particles in the reductive atmosphere."
[2] "The self-regenerative function of Pd occurs even at 200 C, unexpectedly low temperature, in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst."
[3] "Since the high catalytic activity is maintained, the great reduction of Pd loading has been achieved."
[4] "The intelligent catalyst is expected as a new application of the rare earth, and then the technology is expected in the same way in the global standard of the catalyst designing."
[5] "It was also reported that Pd containing LaCeFeCoO3 showed the excellent three-way catalytic activity for automotive emissions control."
[6] "But it is required to remove cobalt (Co), which has been singled out by TA-luft as a carcinogenic, for the industrialization of the perovskite catalyst as the practical intelligent catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The self-regenerative function of the Pd in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst allows it to move reversibly between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the metallic particle lattice. This function enables the catalyst to maintain high catalytic activity even at low temperatures, resulting in a significant reduction of Pd loading. The catalyst is considered a new application of rare earth metals and is expected to contribute to the global standard of catalyst design by addressing the supply and demand issues of precious metals.
