[1] "The synthesis of perovskites following the nanocasting pathway did not allow the preparation of solids with specific surface areas higher than 50 m2/g that was attributed to the calcination conditions to generate the perovskite phase,which required the use of high temperatures (up to 800 8C) and air atmosphere."
[2] "The improvement in the catalytic behavior of the nanocast LaFeO3 was attributed to the increase in their specific surface area, which allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites."
[3] "However, the effect of the increase of the perovskite specific surface area in the catalytic activity must also be related with the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities, which were pointed as the responsible that impeded a more significantly increase in the activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, in despite of its improved textural properties."

1. The specific surface area of perovskites synthesized through the nanocasting process was limited to less than 50 m2/g due to the high temperature and air atmosphere conditions used during the calcination process, which facilitated sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles and reduced the template effect.

2. The enhanced catalytic performance of the nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite was attributed to the larger number of accessible active sites resulting from the increased specific surface area of the material.

3. The increase in specific surface area of the perovskite did not significantly improve the catalytic activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, partly due to the presence of impurities and the perovskite composition. These factors hindered a more substantial enhancement in activity, despite the improved textural properties.

1. 使用纳米铸造过程合成的钙钛矿的特定表面积限制在每克小于50平方米，这是由于在煅烧过程中使用的高温和空气气氛条件，这促进了形成钙钛矿纳米颗粒的聚集，并减少了模板效应。

2. 纳米铸造镧铁氧体的增强催化性能归因于材料的更大表面积带来的更多活性位点。

3. 尽管具有改进的纹理特性，但镧铁钴氧化物纳米铸造的特定表面面积的增加并未显著提高其催化活性，部分原因在于存在的杂质和钙钛矿组成。这些因素阻碍了活性的更大幅度提升，尽管其纹理性质有所改善。
