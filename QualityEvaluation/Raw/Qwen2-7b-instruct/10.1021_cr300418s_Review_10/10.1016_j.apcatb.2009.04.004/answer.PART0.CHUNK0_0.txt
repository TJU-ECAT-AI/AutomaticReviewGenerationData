[1] "The present study demonstrates that the specific surface area of perovskites can be substantially improved using in their synthesis a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as hard template."
[2] "Nevertheless, the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities can reduce the effect of the improvement of the textural properties."

The specific surface area of perovskites can be significantly enhanced through their synthesis using a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as a hard template. However, the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities can diminish the impact of these improvements in textural properties.

[1] "As verified by the XRD data (Fig. 7) and the results of the Rietveld refinement (Fig. 8 and Table 2), the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite presented as contaminant the non-active La2O3 outside of their structure, which in despite of their low content (2.7 wt%) could partially be blocking the perovskite active sites, then diminishing their catalytic activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As confirmed by the XRD data (Figure 7) and the Rietveld refinement results (Figures 8 and Table 2), the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite contained inactive La2O3 as a contaminant outside of its structure. Despite its low content (2.7 wt%), this La2O3 could partly obstruct the active sites of the perovskite, thereby reducing its catalytic activity.
