[1] "As verified by the XRD data (Fig. 7) and the results of the Rietveld refinement (Fig. 8 and Table 2), the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite presented as contaminant the non-active La2O3 outside of their structure, which in despite of their low content (2.7 wt%) could partially be blocking the perovskite active sites, then diminishing their catalytic activity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As confirmed by the XRD data (Figure 7) and the Rietveld refinement results (Figures 8 and Table 2), the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite contained inactive La2O3 as a contaminant outside of its structure. Despite its low content (2.7 wt%), this La2O3 could partly obstruct the active sites of the perovskite, thereby reducing its catalytic activity.

[1] "The synthesis of perovskites following the nanocasting pathway did not allow the preparation of solids with specific surface areas higher than 50 m2/g that was attributed to the calcination conditions to generate the perovskite phase,which required the use of high temperatures (up to 800 8C) and air atmosphere."
[2] "The improvement in the catalytic behavior of the nanocast LaFeO3 was attributed to the increase in their specific surface area, which allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites."
[3] "However, the effect of the increase of the perovskite specific surface area in the catalytic activity must also be related with the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities, which were pointed as the responsible that impeded a more significantly increase in the activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, in despite of its improved textural properties."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The specific surface area of perovskites synthesized through the nanocasting process was limited to less than 50 m2/g due to the high temperature and air atmosphere conditions used during the calcination process, which facilitated sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles and reduced the template effect.

2. The enhanced catalytic performance of the nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite was attributed to the larger number of accessible active sites resulting from the increased specific surface area of the material.

3. The increase in specific surface area of the perovskite did not significantly improve the catalytic activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, partly due to the presence of impurities and the perovskite composition. These factors hindered a more substantial enhancement in activity, despite the improved textural properties.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 使用纳米铸造过程合成的钙钛矿的特定表面积限制在每克小于50平方米，这是由于在煅烧过程中使用的高温和空气气氛条件，这促进了形成钙钛矿纳米颗粒的聚集，并减少了模板效应。

2. 纳米铸造镧铁氧体的增强催化性能归因于材料的更大表面积带来的更多活性位点。

3. 尽管具有改进的纹理特性，但镧铁钴氧化物纳米铸造的特定表面面积的增加并未显著提高其催化活性，部分原因在于存在的杂质和钙钛矿组成。这些因素阻碍了活性的更大幅度提升，尽管其纹理性质有所改善。

The synthesis of perovskites using the nanocasting technique did not yield solids with specific surface areas exceeding 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g due to the calcination conditions employed. High temperatures up to 800 °C and air atmosphere were necessary to transform the inorganic precursors into oxides, a process that concurrently led to the oxidation of the carbon template. This oxidation facilitated the sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles, reducing the effectiveness of the template and consequently limiting the increase in specific surface area.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The synthesis of perovskites using nanocasting with a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as a hard template leads to an improvement in their specific surface area. The nanocast carbon forms mesopores with diameters of 28 nm and micropores, contributing to the enhanced surface area. The nanocast perovskites, despite having a specific surface area between 30 and 50 m2/g, show no significant intraparticle porosity. The perovskites are composed of 97 wt% of the perovskite phase, with agglomerates smaller than 100 nm consisting of nanocrystallites with diameters of about 6 nm. High temperatures and air atmosphere during calcination limit the increase of the specific surface area by promoting the sintering of the perovskite nanoparticles. The nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite shows greater catalytic activity in the reduction of NO to N2 and the oxidation of CO to CO2 compared to its conventional citrate method-prepared counterpart. The improvement in activity is attributed to the increased specific surface area, which exposes more active sites. However, the presence of impurities and the perovskite composition limit the increase in activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3. Despite this, the nanocast perovskites exhibit high thermal and catalytic stability, supporting their potential as catalysts for the studied reaction.

使用纳米铸造技术，以二氧化硅气凝胶200为硬模板的碳铸件合成氧化物，可以显著提高它们的比表面积。所制备的碳铸件形成直径约为28 nm的介孔结构和微孔结构，从而提高了比表面积。虽然纳米铸造氧化物的比表面积在30至50 m2/g之间，但它们没有显着的内部孔隙。这些氧化物由至少97 wt%的氧化物相组成，其聚集体小于100 nm，由直径约6 nm的纳米晶粒组成。在高温和空气气氛下进行煅烧时，限制了比表面积的增加，因为这会促进形成的氧化物纳米颗粒的烧结。纳米铸造的LaFeO3氧化物在将NO还原为N2和将CO氧化为CO2方面显示出比通过柠檬酸盐方法制备的同种氧化物更高的催化活性。活性的提高归因于增加了比表面积，这暴露了更多的活性位点。然而，杂质的存在和氧化物的组成限制了纳米铸造的LaFe0.6Co0.4O3的活性增加。尽管如此，纳米铸造的氧化物表现出良好的热稳定性和催化稳定性，支持它们作为研究反应催化剂的潜力。
