<p>The synthesis of perovskites following the nanocasting pathway did not allow the preparation of solids with specific surface areas higher than 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g that was attributed to the calcination conditions to generate the perovskite phase, which required the use of high temperatures (up to 800 °C) and air atmosphere.</p>
<p>In such conditions the transformation of the inorganic precursors to oxides simultaneously occurred with the removal of the carbon by oxidation that facilitates the subsequently sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles, thus, diminishing the template effect and limiting the increase of the specific surface area.</p>

The synthesis of perovskites using the nanocasting technique did not yield solids with specific surface areas exceeding 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g due to the calcination conditions employed. High temperatures up to 800 °C and air atmosphere were necessary to transform the inorganic precursors into oxides, a process that concurrently led to the oxidation of the carbon template. This oxidation facilitated the sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles, reducing the effectiveness of the template and consequently limiting the increase in specific surface area.

使用纳米铸造技术合成的钙钛矿未能制备出比50 m<sup>2</sup>/g更高的特定表面积，这是因为所采用的煅烧条件。高达800°C的高温和空气气氛是将无机前体转化为氧化物的必要条件，同时这也会导致碳模板的氧化。这种氧化促进了形成钙钛矿纳米颗粒的烧结，减少了模板的有效性，从而限制了特定表面积的增加。
