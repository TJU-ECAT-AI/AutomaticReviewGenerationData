[1] "The present study demonstrates that the specific surface area of perovskites can be substantially improved using in their synthesis a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as hard template."
[2] "Nevertheless, TEM images, XRD and Rietveld refinement data showed that those solids are constituted at least by 97 wt% of perovskite phase and by agglomerates smaller than 100 nm, which are composed by nanocrystallites with diameters of about 6 nm."
[3] "The improvement in the catalytic behavior of the nanocast LaFeO3 was attributed to the increase in their specific surface area, which allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites."

1. The specific surface area of perovskites can be significantly enhanced by incorporating a carbon cast from Silica Aerosil 200 into their synthesis as a hard template.
2. The synthesized perovskites are composed of at least 97% perovskite phase along with agglomerates smaller than 100 nm, consisting of nanocrystallites approximately 6 nm in diameter.
3. The enhanced catalytic performance of the nanocasted LaFeO3 is attributed to the increase in its specific surface area, enabling the exposure of a greater number of active sites.

1. 通过在合成过程中将Silica Aerosil 200作为硬模板的碳铸件引入，可以显著提高钙钛矿的比表面积。
2. 合成的钙钛矿至少由97%的钙钛矿相组成，以及直径小于100nm的聚集体，其中包含大约6nm的纳米晶粒。
3. 纳米铸造的LaFeO3催化性能的改善归因于其比表面积的增加，这使得更多活性位点暴露。
