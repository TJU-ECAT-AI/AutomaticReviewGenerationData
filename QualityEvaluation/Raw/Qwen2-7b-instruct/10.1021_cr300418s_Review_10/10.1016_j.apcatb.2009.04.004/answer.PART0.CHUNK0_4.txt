<p>The present study demonstrates that the specific surface area of perovskites can be substantially improved using in their synthesis a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as hard template.</p>
<p>After the silica removal from the prepared silica/carbon composite, N2 sorption measurements evidenced that the nanocast carbon is formed by mesopores with diameter in the range of 28 nm. A significant amount of micropores was also verified.</p>
<p>Other hand, the nanocast perovskites did not show significantly intraparticle porosity in despite of their enhanced specific surface area with values between 30 and 50 m2/g.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, TEM images, XRD and Rietveld refinement data showed that those solids are constituted at least by 97 wt% of perovskite phase and by agglomerates smaller than 100 nm, which are composed by nanocrystallites with diameters of about 6 nm.</p>
<p>The synthesis of perovskites following the nanocasting pathway did not allow the preparation of solids with specific surface areas higher than 50 m2/g that was attributed to the calcination conditions to generate the perovskite phase,which required the use of high temperatures (up to 800 °C) and air atmosphere.</p>
<p>In such conditions the transformation of the inorganic precursors to oxides simultaneously occurred with the removal of the carbon by oxidation that facilitates the subsequently sintering of the formed perovskite nanoparticles, thus, diminishing the template effect and limiting the increase of the specific surface area.</p>
<p>The nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite prepared by nanocasting was substantially more active in the reduction of NO to N2 with CO and in the oxidation of the last compound to CO2 than that with the same composition conventionally prepared by the citrate method.</p>
<p>The improvement in the catalytic behavior of the nanocast LaFeO3 was attributed to the increase in their specific surface area, which allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites.</p>
<p>However, the effect of the increase of the perovskite specific surface area in the catalytic activity must also be related with the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities, which were pointed as the responsible that impeded a more significantly increase in the activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, in despite of its improved textural properties.</p>
<p>The nanocast perovskites also showed high thermal and catalytic stability during long time on stream, corroborating their high potential as catalysts for the studied reaction.</p>

The synthesis of perovskites using nanocasting with a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as a hard template leads to an improvement in their specific surface area. The nanocast carbon forms mesopores with diameters of 28 nm and micropores, contributing to the enhanced surface area. The nanocast perovskites, despite having a specific surface area between 30 and 50 m2/g, show no significant intraparticle porosity. The perovskites are composed of 97 wt% of the perovskite phase, with agglomerates smaller than 100 nm consisting of nanocrystallites with diameters of about 6 nm. High temperatures and air atmosphere during calcination limit the increase of the specific surface area by promoting the sintering of the perovskite nanoparticles. The nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite shows greater catalytic activity in the reduction of NO to N2 and the oxidation of CO to CO2 compared to its conventional citrate method-prepared counterpart. The improvement in activity is attributed to the increased specific surface area, which exposes more active sites. However, the presence of impurities and the perovskite composition limit the increase in activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3. Despite this, the nanocast perovskites exhibit high thermal and catalytic stability, supporting their potential as catalysts for the studied reaction.

使用纳米铸造技术，以二氧化硅气凝胶200为硬模板的碳铸件合成氧化物，可以显著提高它们的比表面积。所制备的碳铸件形成直径约为28 nm的介孔结构和微孔结构，从而提高了比表面积。虽然纳米铸造氧化物的比表面积在30至50 m2/g之间，但它们没有显着的内部孔隙。这些氧化物由至少97 wt%的氧化物相组成，其聚集体小于100 nm，由直径约6 nm的纳米晶粒组成。在高温和空气气氛下进行煅烧时，限制了比表面积的增加，因为这会促进形成的氧化物纳米颗粒的烧结。纳米铸造的LaFeO3氧化物在将NO还原为N2和将CO氧化为CO2方面显示出比通过柠檬酸盐方法制备的同种氧化物更高的催化活性。活性的提高归因于增加了比表面积，这暴露了更多的活性位点。然而，杂质的存在和氧化物的组成限制了纳米铸造的LaFe0.6Co0.4O3的活性增加。尽管如此，纳米铸造的氧化物表现出良好的热稳定性和催化稳定性，支持它们作为研究反应催化剂的潜力。
