[1] "Density functional theory calculations for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu show that the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by presence of the dopant."
[2] "In CO oxidation, doping of CeO2 with Au allows the oxide to react readily with CO and make carbonates."
[3] "The vacancy adsorbs oxygen from the gas and weakens its bond, so that it reacts with CO to form a carbonate, which decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy."
[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst, a doped oxide must achieve a balance between two conflicting requirements: It must make surface oxygen reactive but not so much that it will hinder the healing of the oxygen vacancies created by the oxidation reaction."

1. The bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by the presence of the dopant according to density functional theory calculations for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu.
2. The doping of CeO2 with Au enables the oxide to readily react with CO and form carbonates during CO oxidation.
3. The oxygen vacancy created during CO oxidation adsorbs oxygen from the gas, weakening its bond. This leads to the reaction of the oxygen with CO to form a carbonate, which decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.
4. For a doped oxide to be an effective oxidation catalyst, it must strike a balance between making the surface oxygen reactive and not hindering the healing of the oxygen vacancies generated during the oxidation process.

1. 根据对CeO2(111)表面掺杂Au、Ag和Cu的密度泛函理论计算，氧原子与氧化物之间的键在掺杂剂存在时被削弱。
2. CeO2掺杂Au后，氧化物能够易于与CO反应并形成碳酸盐。
3. 在CO氧化过程中生成的氧空位从气体中吸附氧，使氧原子与其的键变弱。这导致氧原子与CO反应形成碳酸盐，碳酸盐分解释放CO2并修复氧空位。
4. 对于掺杂的氧化物要成为有效的氧化催化剂，必须在使表面氧活性的同时，不阻碍由氧化过程生成的氧空位的修复。

[1] "In favorable cases, doping improves the thermal stability of the catalyst; Pd-doped perovskite is more stable than Pd supported on an oxide."
[2] "Doped oxides are of interest for low-temperature oxidation reactions, and thus their stability may not be a critical issue."

5. In favorable circumstances, doping can enhance the thermal stability of the catalyst; for instance, Pd-doped perovskite is more stable compared to Pd supported on an oxide.
6. Doped oxides are particularly relevant for low-temperature oxidation reactions, which implies that their stability might not be a decisive factor.

5. 在有利的情况下，掺杂可以提高催化剂的热稳定性；例如，Pd掺杂的钙钛矿比Pd支持在氧化物上的更稳定。
6. 掺杂氧化物特别适用于低温氧化反应，这意味着它们的稳定性可能不是关键因素。
