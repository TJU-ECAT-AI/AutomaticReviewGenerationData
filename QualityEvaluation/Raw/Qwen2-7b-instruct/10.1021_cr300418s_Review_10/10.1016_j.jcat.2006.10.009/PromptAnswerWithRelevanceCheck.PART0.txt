[1] "In favorable cases, doping improves the thermal stability of the catalyst; Pd-doped perovskite is more stable than Pd supported on an oxide [5053]."

[3] "We find that the system has lower energy when the dopant is located in the surface layer."
[4] "Bera et al. also found that the doped material has more vacancies than the undoped one, consistent with the substantial weakening of the oxygen oxide bond found in our calculations."
[5] "Our calculations and several experimental studies have shown that doping lowers this threshold substantially."
[6] "This means that a concerted process by which two O atoms in the oxide will come together to form an O2 molecule (which des- orbits) and two vacancies will require a large activation energy."
[7] "We speculate that this occurs be- cause the reducing agent removes oxygen atoms located near the dopant and this will make the dopant less positive."
[8] "Unfortunately, the XPS experiments probe some of the Cu atoms in the bulk. These may lose oxygen on reduction with hydrogen and not have sufficient mobility to lose the site in which they are located."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Doping can enhance the thermal stability of catalysts, such as when palladium is incorporated into perovskites, leading to increased stability compared to palladium supported on an oxide.

2. The impact of doping is observable through the altered distances between oxygen atoms and the cerium atoms in the doped oxide.

3. The system tends to have lower energy when the dopant resides in the surface layer.

4. Doped materials often exhibit more oxygen vacancies than their undoped counterparts, aligning with the significant weakening of the oxygen oxide bond observed in calculations.

5. Doping reduces the threshold temperature for oxidation reactions, as seen in multiple experimental studies.

6. The formation of an oxygen molecule and two vacancies through a concerted process requires a substantial activation energy.

7. The reduction of the dopant can lead to a decrease in its positive charge due to the removal of nearby oxygen atoms, potentially facilitating its transformation into a metallic state.

8. The XPS experiments can only assess some of the Cu atoms in the bulk, suggesting that these may lose oxygen upon reduction and remain anchored in their original locations.

1. 添加掺杂剂可以提高催化剂的热稳定性，例如将钯掺入钙钛矿中，使其稳定性高于氧化物支持的钯。

2. 掺杂对氧原子和铈原子之间距离的影响可以观察到。

3. 当掺杂剂位于表面层时，系统倾向于具有较低的能量。

4. 掺杂材料往往比未掺杂的材料具有更多的氧空位，这与计算中观察到的氧氧化物键显著减弱相一致。

5. 掺杂减少了氧化反应的阈值温度，这是多个实验研究的结果。

6. 形成一个氧分子和两个空位通过一个协同过程需要一个显著的活化能。

7. 降低掺杂剂的正电荷可能是由于附近氧原子的去除导致的，这可能使掺杂剂转变为金属状态。

8. XPS实验只能评估部分铜原子在基质中的位置，这意味着这些原子在还原过程中可能会失去氧，并且无法移动离开它们所在的原始位置。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The distances between the oxygen atoms and the dopant or cerium atoms they bind to are affected by the type of dopant used. In Au and Ag compounds, the oxygen atoms maintain three-fold symmetry around the dopant. However, in the Cu compound, this symmetry is broken. The distances between the oxygen atoms and the cerium atoms in the Cu compound are significantly larger than in the Cu oxide itself. Removing an oxygen atom from the surface of Au-doped ceria releases the least amount of energy (0.36 eV), while removing an oxygen atom from the surface of Cu-doped ceria releases the most amount of energy (0.83 eV).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
掺杂类型对氧原子与掺杂剂或它们结合的铈原子之间的距离有影响。在Au和Ag化合物中，氧原子围绕掺杂剂保持三重对称性。然而，在Cu化合物中，这种对称性被打破。Cu化合物中的氧原子与铈原子之间的距离远大于其自身的Cu氧化物。从Au掺杂的氧化铈表面去除一个氧原子释放的能量最少（0.36 eV），而从Cu掺杂的氧化铈表面去除一个氧原子释放的能量最多（0.83 eV）。

[1] "The calculations were performed using the VASP 4.5 program [9093] with PAW pseudopotentials and the rPBE functional."
[2] "The surface was modeled by a slab with six atomic layers, separated by 15 Å of vacuum."
[3] "We examined the energy changes caused by various process- es that we consider likely participants in the reaction mecha- nism."
[4] "We found three important processes: (1) CO forms several carbonates by reacting with different pairs of oxygen atoms on the AuxCe1xO2 surface; some of these carbonates are fairly stable and will be present on the surface during the catalytic reaction; (2) other carbonates readily de- compose to produce CO2 and form an oxygen vacancy on the surface; and (3) the oxygen vacancies adsorb O2, and this re- acts with CO to form a carbonate that decomposes into CO2 and leaves an oxygen atom behind to heal the oxy- gen vacancy."

The study focused on the computational modeling of CO oxidation on the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu. It highlighted the destabilization of surface oxygen atoms by dopants, leading to their reactivity. The key findings were:
1. CO reacts with oxygen atoms near the dopant to form a carbonate, causing an oxygen vacancy.
2. Some carbonates are stable and present on the surface during catalysis.
3. Other carbonates decompose to release CO2 and form an oxygen vacancy.
4. Oxygen vacancies adsorb O2, which reacts with CO to form a carbonate, and this carbonate decomposes to CO2, healing the oxygen vacancy.

[1] "Density functional theory calculations for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu show that the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by presence of the dopant."
[2] "In CO oxidation, doping of CeO2 with Au allows the oxide to react readily with CO and make carbonates."
[3] "The vacancy adsorbs oxygen from the gas and weakens its bond, so that it reacts with CO to form a carbonate, which decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy."
[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst, a doped oxide must achieve a balance between two conflicting requirements: It must make surface oxygen reactive but not so much that it will hinder the healing of the oxygen vacancies created by the oxidation reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by the presence of the dopant according to density functional theory calculations for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu.
2. The doping of CeO2 with Au enables the oxide to readily react with CO and form carbonates during CO oxidation.
3. The oxygen vacancy created during CO oxidation adsorbs oxygen from the gas, weakening its bond. This leads to the reaction of the oxygen with CO to form a carbonate, which decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.
4. For a doped oxide to be an effective oxidation catalyst, it must strike a balance between making the surface oxygen reactive and not hindering the healing of the oxygen vacancies generated during the oxidation process.

2. CeO2掺杂Au后，氧化物能够易于与CO反应并形成碳酸盐。
3. 在CO氧化过程中生成的氧空位从气体中吸附氧，使氧原子与其的键变弱。这导致氧原子与CO反应形成碳酸盐，碳酸盐分解释放CO2并修复氧空位。
4. 对于掺杂的氧化物要成为有效的氧化催化剂，必须在使表面氧活性的同时，不阻碍由氧化过程生成的氧空位的修复。
