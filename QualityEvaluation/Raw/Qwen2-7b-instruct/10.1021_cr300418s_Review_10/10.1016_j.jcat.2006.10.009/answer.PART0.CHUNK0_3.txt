[1] "The calculations were performed using the VASP 4.5 program [9093] with PAW pseudopotentials and the rPBE functional."
[2] "The surface was modeled by a slab with six atomic layers, separated by 15 Å of vacuum."
[3] "We examined the energy changes caused by various process- es that we consider likely participants in the reaction mecha- nism."
[4] "We found three important processes: (1) CO forms several carbonates by reacting with different pairs of oxygen atoms on the AuxCe1xO2 surface; some of these carbonates are fairly stable and will be present on the surface during the catalytic reaction; (2) other carbonates readily de- compose to produce CO2 and form an oxygen vacancy on the surface; and (3) the oxygen vacancies adsorb O2, and this re- acts with CO to form a carbonate that decomposes into CO2 and leaves an oxygen atom behind to heal the oxy- gen vacancy."

The study focused on the computational modeling of CO oxidation on the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu. It highlighted the destabilization of surface oxygen atoms by dopants, leading to their reactivity. The key findings were:
1. CO reacts with oxygen atoms near the dopant to form a carbonate, causing an oxygen vacancy.
2. Some carbonates are stable and present on the surface during catalysis.
3. Other carbonates decompose to release CO2 and form an oxygen vacancy.
4. Oxygen vacancies adsorb O2, which reacts with CO to form a carbonate, and this carbonate decomposes to CO2, healing the oxygen vacancy.

研究集中在对掺杂Au、Ag和Cu的CeO2(111)表面CO氧化的计算模拟。它强调了掺杂剂对表面氧原子的破坏性，导致其活性。主要发现如下：
1.COO在掺杂剂附近与氧原子反应形成碳酸盐，造成氧空位。
2.一些碳酸盐稳定存在，并在催化过程中附着在表面上。
3.其他碳酸盐分解产生CO2并形成氧空位。
4.氧空位吸附O2，与CO反应形成碳酸盐，该碳酸盐分解产生CO2，修复氧空位。

[1] "We conclude that the rate-limiting step in CO oxidation by CeO2(111) is the initial reaction of CO with the surface to form either a CO2 molecule or a carbonate."
[2] "We find that the system has lower energy when the dopant is located in the surface layer."

The study concluded that the rate-limiting step in CO oxidation on CeO2(111) is the initial CO reaction with the surface, resulting in either CO2 or carbonate formation. It was observed that the system has lower energy when the dopant is situated in the surface layer. Moreover, the model incorporates several simplifications and uncertainties.

The key conclusion was that the initial CO reaction with the CeO2(111) surface determines the rate-limiting step in CO oxidation. The system configuration with the dopant in the surface layer exhibited lower energy. The model acknowledges the presence of simplifications and uncertainties.

我们得出结论，在CeO2(111)上的CO氧化中，决定性步骤是初始CO与表面的反应，形成CO2或碳酸盐。观察到系统能量较低时，掺杂剂位于表面层。此外，模型包含了许多简化和不确定性。
