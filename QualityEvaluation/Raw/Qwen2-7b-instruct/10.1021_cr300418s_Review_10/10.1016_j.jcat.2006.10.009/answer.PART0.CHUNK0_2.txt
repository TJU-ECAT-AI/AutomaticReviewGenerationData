[1] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive."
[2] "The disturbance caused by doping is reflected by the distance between the six oxygen atoms shown in Fig. 6 and the Ce and dopant atoms they bind to."
[3] "By comparing the effects of various elements on the energy of vacancy formation in doped TiO2 or CeO2, we have found that two factors are the most important."
[4] "We find that the system has lower energy when the dopant is located in the surface layer."

1. Doped oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, where the dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms, making them more reactive.
2. The effect of doping on the oxide can be observed by measuring the distance between the six oxygen atoms and the dopant atoms they bind to.
3. Two significant factors determine the impact of various elements on the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in doped TiO2 or CeO2.
4. The system exhibits lower energy when the dopant is situated in the surface layer of the oxide.
