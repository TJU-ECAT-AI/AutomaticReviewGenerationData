The distances between the oxygen atoms and the dopant or cerium atoms they bind to are affected by the type of dopant used. In Au and Ag compounds, the oxygen atoms maintain three-fold symmetry around the dopant. However, in the Cu compound, this symmetry is broken. The distances between the oxygen atoms and the cerium atoms in the Cu compound are significantly larger than in the Cu oxide itself. Removing an oxygen atom from the surface of Au-doped ceria releases the least amount of energy (0.36 eV), while removing an oxygen atom from the surface of Cu-doped ceria releases the most amount of energy (0.83 eV).

掺杂类型对氧原子与掺杂剂或它们结合的铈原子之间的距离有影响。在Au和Ag化合物中，氧原子围绕掺杂剂保持三重对称性。然而，在Cu化合物中，这种对称性被打破。Cu化合物中的氧原子与铈原子之间的距离远大于其自身的Cu氧化物。从Au掺杂的氧化铈表面去除一个氧原子释放的能量最少（0.36 eV），而从Cu掺杂的氧化铈表面去除一个氧原子释放的能量最多（0.83 eV）。
