[1] "Depending on the formulation of typical perovskite-type oxide oxidation catalysts Pd can be found in the form of supported PdO particles or incorporated in the octahedral B-sites."
[2] "The state of Pd in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 appeared to be dependent on the calcination temperature."
[3] "Calcination at 800 C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3."
[4] "In the case of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, the state of Pd appears to be calcination temperature dependent."
[5] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
[6] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
[7] "The absence of any reflection of the PdO phase is however not conclusive about the actual state of Pd."
[8] "Moreover, this difference also characterizes the reducibility of the existing PdO particles on La(Mn,Pd)O3."
[9] "The activity of the catalysts strongly depends on the state of Pd, since typically PdO is considered the active phase for the reaction."
[10] "The data also suggest that the formation of a solid solution between Pd and common perovskite-type oxidation catalysts needs to be carefully ascertained and strongly depends on the composition of the perovskite oxide."

1. Palladium can exist in the form of supported PdO particles or incorporated in octahedral B-sites within perovskite-type oxide oxidation catalysts.
2. The state of palladium in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 is influenced by the calcination temperature.
3. At 800°C, palladium in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 forms cationic particles with strong interaction in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3.
4. The state of palladium in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 is temperature-dependent.
5. Differences in palladium states are explained through ionic radius arguments.
6. The small size of manganese ions disfavors palladium occupancy in octahedral sites.
7. The absence of PdO reflections does not definitively determine the palladium state.
8. The difference in reducibility characterizes the palladium particles on La(Mn,Pd)O3.
9. The catalytic activity largely depends on the palladium state, with PdO typically being the active phase.
10. The formation of a palladium solid solution with common perovskite-type catalysts is temperature-dependent and requires careful consideration of the perovskite oxide composition.
