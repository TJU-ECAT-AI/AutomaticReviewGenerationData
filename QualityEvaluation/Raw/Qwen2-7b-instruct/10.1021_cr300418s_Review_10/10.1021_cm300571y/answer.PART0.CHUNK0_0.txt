[1] "Incorporation of palladium within the perovskite-type lattice is a valuable strategy to prevent sintering phenomena that reduce the performance of automotive catalysts."
[2] "The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen."
[3] "Calcination at 700 C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3."
[4] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
[5] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
[6] "In the typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co) where the coordination geometry of the B-site is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is generally assumed that a doping element such as Pd adopts the same coordination state."
[7] "Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment of the B-site can be tentatively rationalized on the base of ionic radii arguments and on the electronic structure of the cations considered in this work."
[8] "Therefore, while the short-range coordination environment of Pd may be very similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 varies, most likely depending on the crystallinity of the support oxide."
[9] "The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200900 C."

The diverse properties of palladium, including its ability to occupy different coordination states within the perovskite-type lattice, influence its catalytic behavior in automotive catalysts. The state of palladium, whether as supported particles or integrated within the lattice, impacts its activity for reactions like methane oxidation. The size of the B-site cation and the coordination environment play crucial roles in determining the palladium state within the perovskite structure, affecting its catalytic performance. The crystallinity of the support oxide also influences the degree of interaction between palladium and the oxide, impacting the overall catalytic activity.

钯的不同性质，包括其在钙钛矿型晶格中占据不同配位状态的能力，影响了其在汽车催化剂中的催化行为。钯的状态，无论是作为支持颗粒还是集成在晶格内，都影响着甲烷氧化等反应的活性。B位阳离子的大小和配位环境在决定钯在钙钛矿结构中的状态方面起着关键作用，从而影响其催化性能。支持氧化物的结晶性也会影响钯与氧化物之间的相互作用程度，进而影响整体催化活性。
