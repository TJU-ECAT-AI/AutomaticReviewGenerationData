[1] "In the case of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, the state of Pd appears to be calcination temperature dependent. When YFeO3 is largely still amorphous, a strong interaction between Pd and the support is observed that is similar in terms of influence on catalytic activity to that exhibited by La(Fe,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3. The improved crystallinity of YFeO3 after higher calcination temperature forces Pd to form PdO particles, which strongly promotes catalytic activity."

The state of palladium in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 catalysts depends on the calcination temperature. At lower temperatures, the interaction between palladium and the support is strong, similar to that in La(Fe,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3. Upon higher calcination temperatures, the crystallinity of YFeO3 improves, forcing palladium to form palladium oxide particles. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity.

钯在Y(Fe,Pd)O3催化剂中的状态依赖于煅烧温度。在较低温度下，钯与支撑物之间的相互作用很强，类似于La(Fe,Pd)O3和La(Co,Pd)O3。随着较高煅烧温度的提高，YFeO3的结晶性改善，迫使钯形成钯氧化物颗粒。这导致催化活性增强。

[1] "The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200900 C. The activity of the catalysts strongly depends on the state of Pd, since typically PdO is considered the active phase for the reaction. Therefore, exposed PdO particles make La(Mn,Pd)O3 more active than La(Co,Pd)O3 and La(Fe,Pd)O3."

The condition of palladium has been linked to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation within the temperature range of 200 to 900 degrees Celsius. The catalysts' activity is significantly influenced by the palladium state, as palladium oxide (PdO) is usually regarded as the active component in the reaction. Consequently, exposed PdO particles enhance the activity of La(Mn,Pd)O3 compared to La(Co,Pd)O3 and La(Fe,Pd)O3.

钯的状态与200到900度摄氏度范围内的甲烷氧化反应的催化活性有关。催化剂的活性主要受到钯状态的影响，因为通常认为钯氧化物(PdO)是反应中的活性成分。因此，暴露的PdO颗粒使La(Mn,Pd)O3的活性更高，与La(Co,Pd)O3和La(Fe,Pd)O3相比。

[1] "The observed palladium states differently affected the catalytic activity for CH4 oxidation of the La(B,Pd)O3 (B = Mn, Fe, Co) series and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 samples. Catalysts with Pd predominantly in the form of PdO particles reveal highest catalytic activity (La(Mn,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, Pd2+, square planar) because supported PdO nanoparticles are highly active for methane oxidation."

The different palladium states significantly influenced the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the La(B,Pd)O3 (B = Mn, Fe, Co) series and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 samples. Catalysts featuring palladium primarily in the form of PdO particles showed the highest catalytic activity (La(Mn,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, Pd2+, square planar) due to the high reactivity of supported PdO nanoparticles in methane oxidation.

观察到的不同钯状态对La(B,Pd)O3（B = Mn，Fe，Co）系列和Y(Fe,Pd)O3样本的甲烷氧化催化活性产生了不同影响。主要以PdO颗粒形式存在的钯催化剂表现出最高的催化活性（La(Mn,Pd)O3和Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800，Pd2+，平面四边形），因为支持的PdO纳米颗粒在甲烷氧化中表现出高活性。
