[1] "Among all rocksalt oxides, NiO is most easily cleaved along the (100) plane."
[2] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds."
[3] "According to the rules we proposed, as a result of calculations on a variety of systems, a high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[4] "Our calculations show that when the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the NbO2 cluster gains energy by reacting with 1/2O2 and forming the NbO3 cluster shown in Figure 9."
[5] "It is not clear whether such differences persist for a long time: one might think that under steady-state reaction conditions catalysts prepared differently, but having the same elemental content, are likely to evolve and end up having the same structure and surface composition."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The flexibility of niobium in combining with oxygen allows for the formation of multiple stable oxides, each with unique chemical properties. These properties enable niobium to act as a dopant, affecting the binding strength of surface oxygen atoms and the overall reactivity of the catalyst. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limitations in experimental methods to accurately characterize the catalyst's surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions. Theoretical calculations help in understanding the chemical behavior of dopant-oxide pairs and guide the search for better catalysts, but they are limited by the approximations inherent in the models used.

尼氧化物的不同特性，包括它们稳定的氧化态形式和结合能力，显著影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。铌的灵活性使其能够与氧结合形成多种稳定的氧化物，每种氧化物具有独特的化学性质。这些特性使铌能够作为掺杂剂作用，影响表面氧原子的结合强度和催化剂的整体反应性。在理论预测与实验观察之间存在挑战，这是由于催化系统的复杂性和实验方法无法准确在反应条件下表征催化剂表面的原子水平限制。理论计算有助于理解掺杂氧化物对的化学行为，并指导寻找更好的催化剂，但它们受到用于计算的模型固有近似性的限制。
