19 Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Ethylene Catalyzed by Nb-Doped NiO

We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant. Niobium is a flexible atom when it combines with oxygen. It makes three stable oxides, Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO, as well as compounds with the stoichiometry Nb3n+1O8n2 with 5 ≤ n ≤ 8. Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide. It has a sodium chloride structure, just like NiO, except that 25% of the NaCl lattice sites are unoccupied; occasionally the formula Ni0.75O0.75 is used to draw attention to this fact.

19.2 Computational Results on Nb-Doped NiO

Among all rocksalt oxides, NiO is most easily cleaved along the (100) plane. (159) This suggests that the (100) plane is likely to be the least reactive face of the oxide, and this is what the calculations find. Therefore, we report here only results for the Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base. According to the rules we proposed, as a result of calculations on a variety of systems, (141, 142, 145, 221, 262, 271) a high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 

However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex. Calculations on a variety of systems show three possible scenarios.

(a) A high-valence dopant may adsorb O2 from the gas phase and it may activate it. (359) Ethane may react dissociatively with the adsorbed O2 to make an ethoxide and a hydroxyl. We rule out this mechanism for Nb-doped NiO(011) because our calculations find that the adsorption energy of O2 on top of the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. The distance between the two oxygen atoms is much longer than any reasonable O2 bond length, and therefore the NbO2 group contains two O atoms (not a weakened O2 molecule).

(b) Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2. This changes the formal electron counting. If we assume that the formal charge on each O adsorbed on Nb is 2, then binding two oxygen atoms from the gas phase uses four of the Nb electrons and only one is left for making bonds with the oxide.

(c) Nb has a high affinity for oxygen and a propensity to make compounds in which it is pentavalent. Because of this, we investigated whether in contact with a gas-phase oxygen the dopant may come out of the Ni lattice site and form an oxide cluster on top of the surface. Our calculations show that when the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the NbO2 cluster gains energy by reacting with 1/2O2 and forming the NbO3 cluster shown in Figure 9. In this final state, there is a NbO3 cluster on the surface (bound to the oxygen atoms on the surface of NiO) and a Ni vacancy in the surface layer.

19.3 The Preparation of NiO and Nb-Doped NiO

Experiments have found that the catalytic activity of NiO and Nb-doped NiO depends substantially on the method of preparation. It is not clear whether such differences persist for a long time: one might think that under steady-state reaction conditions catalysts prepared differently, but having the same elemental content, are likely to evolve and end up having the same structure and surface composition.

19.4 Catalytic Performance of NiO for ODH of Ethane to Ethylene

There are no widely accepted methods for ranking catalysts even when we disregard some of the practical factors such as heat management, equipment cost, and separation cost. Because conversion and selectivity are very important, we compare the ODH catalysts based on the conversion of C2H6 and the yield of ethene (the percent of the converted ethane that produces ethene).

19.5 Catalytic Performance of Nb-Doped NiO for Ethane ODH

In Millets experiments, adding a very small amount of Nb (to make Nb0.03Ni0.97O) improves dramatically both the ethane conversion and the ethylene yield as compared to the performance of NiO (see Table 3). However, such a small amount of Nb makes no difference in the experiments reported by Caps. Increasing the amount of Nb to make Nb0.15Ni0.85O increases ethane conversion and ethylene yield in the case of Millet and decreases them for the catalyst made by Caps.

19.6 NbOx Clusters Supported on NiO

Millet et al. (441) performed an important experiment, which should become standard in research on catalysis by doped oxides. Our calculations suggest that, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, Nb is likely to segregate and make niobium oxide clusters on the NiO surface. The binding energy in the XPS spectrum of Nb atom in the material will be different from that of Nb in Nb2O5 for any of the following: for NbOx supported on NiO, for the substitutional Nb dopant in the surface of NiO, or for NbO2 that substitutes a Ni atom in the surface. Therefore, the shift in the XPS spectrum cannot be used to distinguish between these three possibilities.

19.7 Long-Term Stability of the Nb-Doped NiO Catalyst

Lemonidou (438) found that Nb0.15Ni0.85O is stable on stream for 20 h at 350 C. The conversion of the doped catalyst prepared by Caps (440) drops slowly and steadily for 70 h, while selectivity increases. The change is most rapid in the first 5 h.

19.8 The Influence of Doping and of the Method of Preparation on Surface Area per Gram

We have compared the performance of NiO and the Nb-doped NiO catalysts prepared by various methods without taking into account their specific area. It is often preferable to know the conversion per unit area rather than the conversion per gram of catalyst. The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu. The specific areas of the other NiO preparations mentioned here are between these values.

19.9 Chemical Characterization of Nb-Doped NiO

Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake. (438, 440, 441) Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO. These observations are consistent with the fact that Nb is a high-valence dopant that reduces the reactivity of surface oxygen and increases the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.

19.10 Ethane ODH by NiO Doped with Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Ta, or Nb

Heracelous and Lemonidou (127) prepared NiO doped with Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, and Nb. These dopants were chosen because their ionic radius is similar to that of Ni and their valence in their stable oxides varies from one to five. All doped oxides were prepared under identical conditions, and all had the same nominal dopant to Ni ratio of 0.176 (the stoichiometry is Me0.15Ni0.85O, where Me stands for the dopant). The ODH of ethane was investigated in the temperature range from 300 to 425 C, with a W/F ratio of 0.54 g s/cm3 and a feed containing 9.1% ethane, 9.1% O2, and 81.8% He. Ethane conversion, per gram of catalyst, decreased in the order: Here, the symbol MeNi (where Me is the dopant) stands for Me0.15Ni0.85O. According to this metric, NiO doped with Nb is the most efficient catalyst for breaking the CH bond in ethane.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in several ways. NbO2, with its stable sodium chloride structure and low heat of formation, acts as a strong Lewis base, affecting the surface chemistry of the catalyst. The high valence state of Nb in the NbO2 cluster allows it to bind oxygen strongly, altering the reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms. This binding can hinder oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, impacting the catalyst's performance. Moreover, the tendency of Nb to form pentavalent compounds suggests that it may segregate to the surface upon contact with gas-phase oxygen, forming NbO3 clusters, which can lead to the formation of Ni vacancies in the surface layer. The method of preparation of the catalyst significantly affects its activity, with differences observed even among catalysts prepared using the same elemental content, suggesting that the catalyst evolves over time under steady-state reaction conditions.

Experimental observations and computational results are in harmony in predicting the behavior of high- and low-valence dopants differently. High-valence dopants tend to increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms, potentially hindering oxidation, while low-valence dopants may enhance reactivity. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations remains challenging, especially concerning the complex catalytic systems involved in ODH processes. The uncertainty in the characterization methods, the model gaps in computational studies, and the limitations in experimental techniques contribute to the ongoing difficulties in understanding and optimizing the performance of Nb-doped NiO catalysts for ethane ODH.
