19.1 Background Information about Nb and Its Oxides
"We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant. Niobium is a flexible atom when it combines with oxygen. It makes three stable oxides, Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO, as well as compounds with the stoichiometry Nb3n+1O8n2 with 5  n  8. Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
19.2 Computational Results on Nb-Doped NiO
"Calculations on a variety of systems show three possible scenarios. (a) A high-valence dopant may adsorb O2 from the gas phase and it may activate it. (b) Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2. (c) Nb has a high affinity for oxygen and a propensity to make compounds in which it is pentavalent. Because of this, we investigated whether in contact with a gas-phase oxygen the dopant may come out of the Ni lattice site and form an oxide cluster on top of the surface."
19.3 The Preparation of NiO and Nb-Doped NiO
"The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
19.4 Catalytic Performance of NiO for ODH of Ethane to Ethylene
"There are no widely accepted methods for ranking catalysts even when we disregard some of the practical factors such as heat management, equipment cost, and separation cost. Because conversion and selectivity are very important, we compare the ODH catalysts based on the conversion of C2H6 and the yield of ethene (the percent of the converted ethane that produces ethene)."
19.5 Catalytic Performance of Nb-Doped NiO for Ethane ODH
"In Millets experiments, adding a very small amount of Nb (to make Nb0.03Ni0.97O) improves dramatically both the ethane conversion and the ethylene yield as compared to the performance of NiO."
19.6 NbOx Clusters Supported on NiO
"Millet et al. (441) performed an important experiment, which should become standard in research on catalysis by doped oxides. Our calculations suggest that, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, Nb is likely to segregate and make niobium oxide clusters on the NiO surface."
19.7 Long-Term Stability of the Nb-Doped NiO Catalyst
"Lemonidou (438) found that Nb0.15Ni0.85O is stable on stream for 20 h at 350 C. The conversion of the doped catalyst prepared by Caps (440) drops slowly and steadily for 70 h, while selectivity increases."
19.8 The Influence of Doping and of the Method of Preparation on Surface Area per Gram
"It is often preferable to know the conversion per unit area rather than the conversion per gram of catalyst. The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
19.9 Chemical Characterization of Nb-Doped NiO
"Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake. (438, 440, 441) Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
19.10 Ethane ODH by NiO Doped with Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Ta, or Nb
"Heracelous and Lemonidou (127) prepared NiO doped with Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, and Nb. These dopants were chosen because their ionic radius is similar to that of Ni and their valence in their stable oxides varies from one to five."
19.11 Ethane ODH on Doped NiO: Conclusions
"This detailed examination of ethane ODH by doped NiO illustrates the difficulties encountered by both theory and experiments when studying catalysis by doped oxides."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways. These properties lead to different adsorption behaviors of oxygen, which can affect the reactivity of the catalyst surface. Specifically, niobium has a high affinity for oxygen and can form compounds in which it is pentavalent. This tendency allows it to potentially form clusters on the surface of the NiO when exposed to oxygen in the gas phase. Moreover, niobium oxides exhibit distinct chemical behaviors, such as varying heats of formation and reactivity, which can impact the catalyst's performance. The computational results suggest that niobium dopants can adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, activate it, or form clusters, depending on the specific conditions and interactions within the catalyst system. These complex behaviors challenge the reconciliation of theoretical predictions with experimental observations, as the outcomes can be sensitive to subtle variations in the catalyst preparation, reaction conditions, and the nature of the dopant itself. The study highlights the intricate interplay between the dopant's chemical properties and the overall catalytic performance, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of these systems to optimize catalyst design and functionality.

铌氧化物的不同性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化态，对作为镍氧化物催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为产生了多种影响。这些性质导致氧吸附行为的不同，从而影响催化剂表面的反应性。具体而言，铌具有强烈的氧亲和力，并且可以在与氧接触时形成五价化合物。这种倾向允许它在暴露于气体相中的氧气时在NiO表面形成簇。此外，铌氧化物表现出不同的化学行为，如不同的热形成和活性，这可以影响催化剂的性能。计算结果表明，铌掺杂剂可以吸附气体相中的氧、激活它或形成簇，具体取决于特定条件和催化剂体系内的相互作用。这些复杂的行为挑战了理论预测与实验观察之间的协调，因为结果可能对催化剂制备方法、反应条件和掺杂剂本身的性质的微妙变化敏感。这项研究强调了理解这些系统之间复杂交互的重要性，以优化催化剂设计和功能。
