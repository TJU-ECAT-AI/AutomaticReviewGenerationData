[1] "Among all rocksalt oxides, NiO is most easily cleaved along the (100) plane."
[2] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds."
[3] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
[4] "Our calculations show that when the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the NbO2 cluster gains energy by reacting with 1/2O2 and forming the NbO3 cluster shown in Figure 9."
[5] "It is not clear whether such differences persist for a long time: one might think that under steady-state reaction conditions catalysts prepared differently, but having the same elemental content, are likely to evolve and end up having the same structure and surface composition."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The calculations predict that niobium (Nb) dopants, especially in the form of NbO2, can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at neighboring oxygen sites, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of NiO. The Nb dopant's valence electrons, when substituted for a divalent cation like nickel (Ni), lead to the formation of a strong Lewis base, potentially altering the surface chemistry and reactivity. Experimental observations, however, are challenging to reconcile with theoretical predictions due to uncertainties in synthesis methods, limitations in characterization techniques, and the complexity of modeling surface morphology and catalytic performance. These discrepancies highlight the need for further exploration, including computational studies that systematically vary surface morphology and experimental methods that can accurately characterize the surface composition and structure under reaction conditions.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，显著影响其作为镍氧化物催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂行为。计算预测，铌（Nb）掺杂剂，特别是NbO2的形式，可以降低相邻氧空位形成能，从而增强NiO的催化活性。Nb掺杂剂的价电子，在取代二价阳离子如镍（Ni）时，形成一个强Lewis碱，可能改变表面化学和反应性。实验观察与理论预测之间的不一致主要是由于合成方法的不确定性、表征技术的限制以及对表面形态和催化性能模型的复杂性。这些差异强调了进一步探索的必要性，包括系统地变化表面形态的计算研究，以及能够准确表征在反应条件下表面组成和结构的实验方法。
