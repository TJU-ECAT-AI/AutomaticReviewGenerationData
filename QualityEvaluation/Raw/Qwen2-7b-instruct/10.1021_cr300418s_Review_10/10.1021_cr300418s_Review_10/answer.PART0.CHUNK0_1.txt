[1] "Among all rocksalt oxides, NiO is most easily cleaved along the (100) plane."
[2] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds."
[3] "If we assume that the formal charge on each O adsorbed on Nb is 2, then binding two oxygen atoms from the gas phase uses four of the Nb electrons and only one is left for making bonds with the oxide."
[4] "Our calculations show that when the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the NbO2 cluster gains energy by reacting with 1/2O2 and forming the NbO3 cluster shown in Figure 9."
[5] "It is well-known (8, 9) that submonolayers of an oxide A (a generic name) supported on an oxide B (another generic name) are often better catalysts than the bulk oxide A or bulk oxide B."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium, being a flexible atom when it combines with oxygen, forms multiple stable oxides, each with distinct characteristics that affect their role in catalysis. For instance, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation and is very unreactive, while NbO has the lowest heat of formation and is stable, akin to NaCl structure with 25% of the lattice sites unoccupied. These properties determine the electronic configuration and bonding characteristics of Nb within the NiO matrix, impacting the surface reactivity and oxygen adsorption capabilities. The challenge lies in aligning theoretical predictions with experimental observations, particularly given the complexity of surface chemistry and the limitations in accurately characterizing the atomic-level composition and structure of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions. This discrepancy necessitates further exploration through a combination of computational modeling and experimental validation to better understand and predict the effectiveness of niobium dopants in enhancing ethane oxidative dehydrogenation catalysis.

尼鲍姆氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，显著影响其作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢作用的掺杂剂的角色。当与氧结合时，铌表现出灵活性，形成多种稳定的氧化物，每种氧化物具有独特的特性，这些特性影响催化作用。例如，Nb2O5的能量形成最高且非常不反应，而NbO的热能形成最低且是稳定的，类似于NaCl结构，其中25％的晶格位点未占用。这些属性决定了Nb在NiO矩阵中的电子配置和键合特性，从而影响表面反应性和氧吸附能力。挑战在于将理论预测与实验观察相匹配，特别是考虑到表面化学的复杂性和在反应条件下准确表征催化剂表面组成和结构的限制。这需要进一步探索通过计算建模和实验验证的组合来更好地理解并预测铌掺杂剂在增强乙烷氧化脱氢催化作用方面的有效性。
