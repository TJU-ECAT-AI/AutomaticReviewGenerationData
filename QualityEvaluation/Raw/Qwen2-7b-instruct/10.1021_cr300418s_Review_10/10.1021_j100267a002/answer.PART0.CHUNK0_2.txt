[1] "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
[2] "Previous reports, from this laboratory, have shown that EPR matrix isolation is a very sensitive and versatile technique for detecting the formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals."
[3] "The results described here clearly demonstrate that the ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends upon the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or to undergo further surface reactions."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the reactivity of oxide ions towards hydrogen atom abstraction. The ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends on factors such as the strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of specific radical-forming sites on the surface, and the likelihood of radicals to desorb or undergo further surface reactions. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex nature of these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，通过影响氧离子对氢原子提取的活性，影响铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂行为。生成气体相烃基自由基的能力取决于最弱C-H键的强度、表面特定自由基形成位点的存在以及自由基脱附或进一步在表面上反应的可能性。理论预测与实验观察之间的整合存在挑战，这是由于这些催化系统的复杂性。
