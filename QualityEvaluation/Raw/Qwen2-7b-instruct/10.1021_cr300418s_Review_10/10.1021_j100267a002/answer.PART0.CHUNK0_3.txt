[1] "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
[2] "The importance of gas-phase radical coupling reactions is evident in the catalytic conversion of propylene to 1,4-hexadiene over Bi2O3 and the conversion of methane to ethane and ethylene over Li/MgO."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting their reactivity towards hydrogen atom abstraction. This impacts the ability of these oxides to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex catalytic systems involved, where the reactivity of the oxide ions plays a crucial role in the formation and fate of gas-phase radicals. The behavior of these oxides in catalytic conversions, such as the conversion of propylene to 1,4-hexadiene over Bi2O3 and the conversion of methane to ethane and ethylene over Li/MgO, highlights the importance of gas-phase radical coupling reactions in these processes.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，这影响了这些氧化物对氢原子抽象的活性。这影响了生成气相烃基自由基的能力。在理论预测与实验观察之间找到平衡的挑战源于这些复杂催化系统的特性，其中氧化物离子的活性对自由基的形成和命运起着关键作用。铌氧化物在催化转换过程中的行为，如Bi2O3上的丙烯转化为1,4-己二烯和Li/MgO上的甲烷转化为乙烯和乙烷，强调了气相自由基耦合反应在这些过程中的重要性。
