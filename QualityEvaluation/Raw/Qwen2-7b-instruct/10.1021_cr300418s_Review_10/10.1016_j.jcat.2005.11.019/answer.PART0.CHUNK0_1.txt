[1] "The catalytic performance over LaFeO3 is poor but can be improved significantly by incorporating Cu into its lattice, resulting in N2 yields over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 of 81% at 450 C and 97% at 700 C with a reactant mixture containing 3000 ppm NO, 3000 ppm C3H6, and 1% O2 in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1."
[2] "The enhanced NO reduction after Cu substitution is attributed to the easy formation of nitrate species, which have high reactivity toward C3H6."
[3] "Great catalytic performance at low temperature was also achieved over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 with a N2 yield of 67% and C3H6 conversion of 68% at 350 C corresponding to the outstanding redox properties of this catalyst."
[4] "O2 can act as a promoter to oxidize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, and also can accelerate the transformation of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate to get the desired products."
[5] "In contrast, at higher concentrations O2 has a detrimental effect, leading to consumption of the reducing agent by the complete oxidation of C3H6."

1. Incorporating Cu into the lattice of LaFeO3 can significantly improve its catalytic performance, enhancing N2 yields up to 97% at 700°C. The reason for this improvement is attributed to the easy formation of nitrate species, which exhibit high reactivity towards C3H6.
   
2. At lower temperatures, LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 demonstrates outstanding catalytic performance with a N2 yield of 67% and a C3H6 conversion of 68% at 350°C. This is due to the catalyst's exceptional redox properties.

3. Oxygen can function as a promoter to oxidize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, thereby accelerating the transformation of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate to achieve desired products.

4. However, at higher oxygen concentrations, the detrimental effect is observed, leading to the consumption of the reducing agent through the complete oxidation of C3H6.

1. 将铜融入LaFeO3晶格中可以显著提高其催化性能，使其在700°C时的N2产率最高可达97%。这种改善的原因归因于易于形成对C3H6具有高反应性的硝酸盐物种。

2. 在较低温度下，LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3表现出出色的催化性能，在350°C时的N2产率为67%，C3H6转化率为68%。这归因于催化剂的卓越还原氧化性。

3. 氧可以作为促进剂，将NO氧化为强吸附的硝酸盐物种，从而加速有机氮化合物和异氰酸酯的转化以获得所需产物。

4. 然而，在较高的氧浓度下，观察到的不利影响导致还原剂的消耗，通过完全氧化C3H6。
