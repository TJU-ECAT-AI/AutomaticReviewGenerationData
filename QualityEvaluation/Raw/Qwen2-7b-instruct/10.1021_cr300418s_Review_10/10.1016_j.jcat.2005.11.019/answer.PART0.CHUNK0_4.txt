1. Incorporating copper into the lattice of LaFeO3 significantly improves its catalytic performance, achieving N2 yields of 81% at 450°C and 97% at 700°C with a reactant mixture of 3000 ppm NO, 3000 ppm C3H6, and 1% O2 in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1.

2. Fe-based mixed oxides were synthesized using a reactive grinding method similar to previous studies.

3. H2-TPR experiments were conducted to investigate the reducibility of the samples.

4. Tiny particles of PdO or CuO, undetectable by XRD, might form during synthesis.

5. The substitution of 3% B-site ions by Pd2+ can significantly enhance the β-O2 content.

6. Nitrate species, highly reactive towards C3H6, can be formed through the oxidation of NO by α-O2.

7. Palladium incorporation enhances the mobility of lattice oxygen and the reducibility of Fe-based perovskites.

8. No relevant quotes exist for the questions asked.

1. 将铜掺杂到LaFeO3晶格中显著提高了其催化性能，实现了在3000 ppm NO、3000 ppm C3H6和1% O2的氦气混合物中，450°C时81%和700°C时97%的N2产率，在50,000 h1的空间速度下。

2. 使用与先前研究类似的反应研磨方法合成了Fe基混合氧化物。

3. 进行了H2-TPR实验来研究样品的可还原性。

4. XRD检测不到可能形成的PdO或CuO微粒。

5. 只有3%的B位离子被Pd2+取代，可以显著增强β-O2的含量。

6. 通过α-O2氧化NO，可以形成对C3H6高度反应性的硝酸盐物种。

7. 钯的掺杂显著提高了晶格氧的流动性以及Fe基尖晶石的可还原性。
