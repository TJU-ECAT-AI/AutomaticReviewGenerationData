[1] "A series of Fe-based mixed oxides was synthesized by re- active grinding in a manner similar to that reported previ- ously [1315]."
[2] "The specific surface area of the samples calcined at 500 C for 5 h was determined using an automated gas sorption system (NOVA 2000; Quantachrome) through nitrogen adsorption equilibrium at 196 C."
[3] "The results show a surface area about 30 m2/g for the LaFeO3 catalyst even after calcination at 500 C."
[4] "For LaFeO3, three reduction peaks are detectable, suggesting a multiple-step reduction."
[5] "The amount of O2 released from perovskites was calculated after deconvolution of the O2 desorption curve and are listed in Table 2."

0.055
Fe3+
0.945O3.013 based on above ascription of Fen+ reduction and elemental analysis (see Table 1), showing 5.5% Fe4+ and little overstoichiometric oxygen present in LaFeO3."
[7] "The lowest α- and β-O2 desorption was obtained over LaFeO3 among the three Fe-based perovskites, implying poor molecular O2 coverage and lattice oxygen reducibility of lanthanum ferrite, in accordance with previous reports [37,38]."
[8] "The formation of nitrate species, which is highly reactive toward C3H6 according to TPSR tests, can be realized via oxidation of NO by α-O2."
[9] "Incorporation of Pd into B sites significantly improves the mobility of lattice O2 and the reducibility of Fe-based perovskites."
[10] "NO reduction by propene over Fe-based perovskites is con- trolled mainly by a mechanism involving organo nitrogen com- pounds, likely generated from the interaction between nitrate species and adsorbed C3H6."

1. A series of Fe-based mixed oxides were synthesized using reactive grinding, as described in previous studies [1315].
2. The specific surface area of the samples calcined at 500°C for 5 hours was measured using a gas sorption system at 196°C.
3. Even after calcination at 500°C, the LaFeO3 catalyst had a surface area of about 30 m²/g.
4. Three reduction peaks were detectable for LaFeO3, indicating a multi-step reduction process.
5. The amount of O2 released from perovskites was calculated through deconvolution of the O2 desorption curve.
6. The formula of the parent Fe-based perovskite was determined to be La0.99Fe4+0.055Fe3+0.945O3.013, showing 5.5% Fe4+ and slight overstoichiometry in LaFeO3.
7. LaFeO3 exhibited the lowest α- and β-O2 desorption, indicating poor O2 coverage and lattice oxygen reducibility, consistent with prior reports [37,38].
8. Nitrate species, highly reactive towards C3H6, can be formed through the oxidation of NO by α-O2.
9. Incorporation of Pd into the B sites enhances the mobility of lattice O2 and the reducibility of Fe-based perovskites.
10. The mechanism controlling NO reduction by propene over Fe-based perovskites involves organo nitrogen compounds generated from the interaction between nitrate species and adsorbed C3H6.

2. 使用气体吸附系统在196°C下通过氮吸附平衡测量了在500°C下煅烧5小时后的样品的特定表面面积。
3. 即使在500°C下煅烧后，LaFeO3催化剂的表面面积约为30 m²/g。
4. 对于LaFeO3，检测到了三个还原峰，表明存在多步还原过程。
5. 通过解卷积O2脱附曲线计算了从氧化石墨烯释放的O2量。
6. 父亲Fe基氧化物的公式被确定为La0.99Fe4+0.055Fe3+0.945O3.013，显示LaFeO3中含有5.5%的Fe4+和轻微过量氧。
7. LaFeO3的α-和β-O2脱附最低，表明了较差的O2覆盖和晶格氧可逆性，与先前报告一致[37,38]。
