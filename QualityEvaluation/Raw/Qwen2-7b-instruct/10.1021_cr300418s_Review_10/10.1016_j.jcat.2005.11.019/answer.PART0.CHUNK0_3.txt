1. Incorporating Cu into the lattice of LaFeO3 can significantly improve its catalytic performance, achieving N2 yields of 81% at 450°C and 97% at 700°C with a reactant mixture of 3000 ppm NO, 3000 ppm C3H6, and 1% O2 in helium, at a space velocity of 50,000 h1.

2. A proposed mechanism includes the formation of nitrate species as the initial step, followed by the production of organo nitrogen compounds as key intermediates.

3. The introduction of Pd into the B sites notably enhances the mobility of lattice oxygen and the reducibility of Fe-based perovskites.

4. Achieving outstanding catalytic performance at low temperatures, with N2 yields of 67% and a C3H6 conversion rate of 68% at 350°C over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3, can be attributed to its exceptional redox properties.

5. Oxygen acts as a promoter, oxidizing NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, and accelerating the conversion of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate into desired products.

1. 将Cu引入LaFeO3的晶格中可以显著提高其催化性能，实现450°C时81%和700°C时97%的N2产率，使用含有3000 ppm NO、3000 ppm C3H6和1% O2的氦气混合物，空间速度为50,000 h1。

2. 提出的机制包括形成硝酸盐物种作为第一步，随后产生有机氮化合物作为关键中间体。

3. 将Pd引入B位点显着提高了晶格氧的流动性和Fe基氧化物的还原性。

4. 在350°C下，通过LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3获得出色的低温催化性能，N2产率为67%，C3H6转化率为68%，这可归因于其卓越的还原性。

5. 氧作为促进剂，氧化NO成强吸附的硝酸盐物种，并加速有机氮化合物和异氰酸酯的转换，以获得所需产物。
