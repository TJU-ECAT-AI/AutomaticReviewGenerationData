[1] "A series of Fe-based mixed oxides was synthesized by re- active grinding in a manner similar to that reported previ- ously [1315]."
[2] "The specific surface area of the samples calcined at 500 C for 5 h was determined using an automated gas sorption system (NOVA 2000; Quantachrome) through nitrogen adsorption equilibrium at 196 C."
[3] "The results show a surface area about 30 m2/g for the LaFeO3 catalyst even after calcination at 500 C."
[4] "For LaFeO3, three reduction peaks are detectable, suggesting a multiple-step reduction."

Fe3+
0.945O3.013 based on above ascription of Fen+ reduction and elemental analysis (see Table 1), showing 5.5% Fe4+ and little overstoichiometric oxygen present in LaFeO3."
[7] "The lowest α- and β-O2 desorption was obtained over LaFeO3 among the three Fe-based perovskites, implying poor molecular O2 coverage and lattice oxygen reducibility of lanthanum ferrite, in accordance with previous reports [37,38]."
[8] "The formation of nitrate species, which is highly reactive toward C3H6 according to TPSR tests, can be realized via oxidation of NO by α-O2."
[9] "Incorporation of Pd into B sites significantly improves the mobility of lattice O2 and the reducibility of Fe-based perovskites."

[1] "The catalytic performance over LaFeO3 is poor but can be improved significantly by incorporating Cu into its lattice, resulting in N2 yields over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 of 81% at 450 C and 97% at 700 C with a reactant mixture containing 3000 ppm NO, 3000 ppm C3H6, and 1% O2 in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1."
[2] "The enhanced NO reduction after Cu substitution is attributed to the easy formation of nitrate species, which have high reactivity toward C3H6."
[3] "Great catalytic performance at low temperature was also achieved over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 with a N2 yield of 67% and C3H6 conversion of 68% at 350 C corresponding to the outstanding redox properties of this catalyst."
[4] "O2 can act as a promoter to oxidize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, and also can accelerate the transformation of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate to get the desired products."
[5] "In contrast, at higher concentrations O2 has a detrimental effect, leading to consumption of the reducing agent by the complete oxidation of C3H6."

1. Incorporating Cu into the lattice of LaFeO3 can significantly improve its catalytic performance, enhancing N2 yields up to 97% at 700°C. The reason for this improvement is attributed to the easy formation of nitrate species, which exhibit high reactivity towards C3H6.
   
2. At lower temperatures, LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 demonstrates outstanding catalytic performance with a N2 yield of 67% and a C3H6 conversion of 68% at 350°C. This is due to the catalyst's exceptional redox properties.

3. Oxygen can function as a promoter to oxidize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, thereby accelerating the transformation of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate to achieve desired products.

4. However, at higher oxygen concentrations, the detrimental effect is observed, leading to the consumption of the reducing agent through the complete oxidation of C3H6.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, such as their different stable forms and oxidation states, affect their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The complexities in aligning theoretical forecasts with real-world experimental outcomes stem from the intricate interactions between the dopants and the base material, alongside the dynamic aspects of the catalytic process.
