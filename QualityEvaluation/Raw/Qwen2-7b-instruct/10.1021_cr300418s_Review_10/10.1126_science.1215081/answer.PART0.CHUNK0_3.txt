The interaction between EDS1 and AvrRps4, as well as the direct binding of AvrRps4 to EDS1, indicates that these proteins play crucial roles in plant immunity. EDS1 is identified as a co-receptor in a surveillance complex, suggesting its involvement in both basal resistance and effector-triggered immunity. The findings imply that pathogens target EDS1 to interfere with the plant's defense mechanisms, potentially leading to the evolution of new resistance mechanisms in plants.

These studies contribute to our understanding of how plant immune surveillance proteins perceive pathogen effectors and activate downstream responses. The targeting of EDS1 by pathogens and its subsequent co-option for effector-triggered immunity highlights the dynamic nature of plant-pathogen interactions and the adaptability of plant defense mechanisms.

EDS1与AvrRps4的相互作用，以及AvrRps4直接与EDS1结合的结果表明，这些蛋白质在植物免疫中扮演着关键角色。EDS1被认定为一个共受体，在监视复合体中发挥作用，这暗示其在基础抵抗力和效应器触发免疫中的参与。研究结果表明，病原体通过靶向EDS1干扰植物的防御机制，可能促使植物进化出新的抗性机制。

这些研究有助于我们理解植物免疫监控蛋白如何感知病原体效应器并激活下游反应。病原体对EDS1的靶向及其随后的利用来支持效应器触发免疫，凸显了植物-病原体相互作用的动态性和植物防御机制的适应性。
