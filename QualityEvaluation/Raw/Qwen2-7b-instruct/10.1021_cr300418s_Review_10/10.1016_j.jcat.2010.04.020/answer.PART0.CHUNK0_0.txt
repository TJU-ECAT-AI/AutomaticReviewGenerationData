[1] "Despite its low surface area and lack of porosity, crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is competent for CO oxidation in both lean and rich reaction conditions."
[2] "The lower activation energy of the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism for Pd-doped BaCeO3 relative to Pd/c-Al2O3 is ascribed to the lower CO binding energy on Pd(II) compared to Pd(0)."
[3] "When CO is present in excess, oxygen vacancies are created in the BaCeO3 surface, allowing O2 activation to occur independent of CO adsorption."
[4] "The similarity of the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism to a previously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism leads us to propose that the perovskite be considered a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2."
[5] "The high thermal stability of the perovskite is potentially advantageous because of the demanding thermal transients experienced by automotive emissions catalysts."
