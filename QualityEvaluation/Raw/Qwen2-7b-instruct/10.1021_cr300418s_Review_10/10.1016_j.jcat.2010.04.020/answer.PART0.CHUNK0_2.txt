[1] "Despite its low surface area and lack of porosity, crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is competent for CO oxidation in both lean and rich reaction conditions."
[2] "The Arrhenius activation energy for this mechanism is surprisingly low, (7.8  0.3) kcal/mol. It is attributed to weak adsorption of CO on ionic surface Pd(II) sites."
[3] "When O2 is limiting, the reaction orders for both CO and O2 show a strong dependence on P(CO)/P(O2), and eventually become independent of both P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO)."
[4] "Both mechanisms contribute significantly for P(CO)/P(O2)  1."
[5] "The similarity of the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism to a previously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism leads us to propose that the perovskite be considered a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2."

1. Crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is effective for CO oxidation in both lean and rich conditions despite its low surface area and lack of porosity.
2. The low activation energy of 7.8 kcal/mol for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is attributed to weak CO adsorption on ionic surface Pd(II) sites.
3. Under O2 limitation, the reaction orders for CO and O2 strongly depend on the ratio of P(CO)/P(O2), becoming independent of both P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO).
4. Both the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and BaCeO3-mediated mechanisms contribute significantly when P(CO)/P(O2) is greater than 1.
5. Considering the similarity to a previously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism, BaCeO3 can be viewed as a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2.

1. 尽管其比表面积低且无孔隙，但结晶态Ba(Ce,Pd)O3在贫氧和富氧反应条件下均能有效进行CO氧化。
2. 该机制的低活化能（7.8 kcal/mol）归因于表面Pd(II)位点上CO的弱吸附。
3. 当氧气受限时，CO和O2的反应级数强烈依赖于P(CO)/P(O2)比例，并在高P(CO)时最终与两者都无关。
4. 当P(CO)/P(O2)大于1时，Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制和BaCeO3介导的机制都做出了显著贡献。
5. 考虑到与先前报道的CeO2介导机制的相似性，BaCeO3可以被视为BaO稳定化的CeO2形式。
