[1] "Despite its low surface area and lack of porosity, crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is competent for CO oxidation in both lean and rich reaction conditions."
[2] "When CO is present in excess, oxygen vacancies are created in the BaCeO3 surface, allowing O2 activation to occur independent of CO adsorption."
[3] "Since the activation barrier for the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism is slightly higher than for the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, its contribution increases with temperature."
[4] "Pd(II) cations are present in the bulk of the BaCeO3 host as PdO4 square-planes, separated from an adjacent, tilted CeO5 square pyramid by an oxygen vacancy."
[5] "The high thermal stability of the perovskite is potentially advantageous because of the demanding thermal transients experienced by automotive emissions catalysts."

1. Despite having a low surface area and lacking porosity, the crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is capable of catalyzing CO oxidation effectively in both lean and rich reaction conditions.
2. When there is an excess of CO, oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface of BaCeO3, enabling the activation of O2 without competing with CO adsorption.
3. As the activation barrier for the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism is slightly greater than for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, its proportion in the overall reaction increases with rising temperature.
4. The Pd(II) ions are found in the bulk of the BaCeO3 host as PdO4 square-planes, positioned between a tilted CeO5 square pyramid and an oxygen vacancy.
5. The high thermal stability of the perovskite could be beneficial for automotive emissions catalysts, which experience challenging thermal fluctuations.

1. 尽管其比表面积低且无孔隙，但晶态Ba(Ce,Pd)O3仍能在贫氧和富氧反应条件下有效催化CO氧化。
2. 当存在过量的CO时，在BaCeO3表面会产生氧空位，使O2激活无需与CO吸附竞争。
3. 由于BaCeO3介导的机制的活化能略高于Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制，因此在温度升高时其对整体反应的贡献增加。
4. 在BaCeO3主体中，Pd(II)离子以PdO4平面形式存在，位于倾斜的CeO5平面与氧空位之间。
5. 对于经历剧烈热波动的汽车排放催化剂而言，该钙钛矿的高热稳定性可能具有优势。
