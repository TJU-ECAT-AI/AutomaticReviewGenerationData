[1] "Despite its low surface area and lack of porosity, crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is competent for CO oxidation in both lean and rich reaction conditions."
[2] "The Arrhenius activation energy for this mechanism is surprisingly low, (7.8  0.3) kcal/mol. It is attributed to weak adsorption of CO on ionic surface Pd(II) sites."
[3] "When O2 is limiting, the reaction orders for both CO and O2 show a strong dependence on P(CO)/P(O2), and eventually become independent of both P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO)."
[4] "Both mechanisms contribute significantly for P(CO)/P(O2)  1."
[5] "The similarity of the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism to a previously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism leads us to propose that the perovskite be considered a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2."

1. Crystalline Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is capable of CO oxidation in both lean and rich reaction conditions, despite its low surface area and lack of porosity.
2. The low activation energy of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism for Pd-doped BaCeO3 is attributed to the weak adsorption of CO on ionic surface Pd(II) sites.
3. When oxygen is in limiting supply, the reaction orders for both CO and O2 show a strong dependence on the ratio of P(CO) to P(O2), and eventually become independent of both P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO).
4. Both the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism contribute significantly to the overall reaction for P(CO)/P(O2) greater than 1.
5. Considering the similarity to a previously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism, BaCeO3 can be regarded as a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2.

1. 尽管其比表面积低且无孔隙，但晶态Ba(Ce,Pd)O3在稀氧和富氧反应条件下都能进行CO氧化。
2. 对于Pd掺杂的BaCeO3而言，Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制的低活化能归因于CO在表面Pd(II)离子位点上的弱吸附。
3. 当氧气供应有限时，CO和O2的反应级数强烈依赖于P(CO)与P(O2)的比值，并在高P(CO)时最终不再依赖于两者。
4. 对于P(CO)/P(O2)大于1的情况，Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制和BaCeO3介导的机制对整体反应都做出了显著贡献。
5. 考虑到与先前报道的CeO2介导机制的相似性，BaCeO3可以被视为BaO稳定化的CeO2形式。
