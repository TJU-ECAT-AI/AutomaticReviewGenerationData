<p>Although one universal smart chemical probe molecule does not exist, the desired information can usually be obtained by the use of at least two chemical probe molecules.</p>
<p>The CH3OH chemical probe molecule, however, appears to be emerging as the smart chemical probe molecule for metal oxide surfaces since it can readily provide information about items 13.</p>
<p>For example, methanol oxidation over oxide surfaces primarily forms H2CO over the surface redox sites, dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) over surface acidic sites and primarily COx and some H2CO over surface basic sites.</p>
<p>Furthermore, methyl formate (MF, CH3OOCH) forms on adjacent surface redox-basic sites and dimethoxy methane (DMM, (CH3O)2CH2) on adjacent surface redox-acidic sites.</p>

To determine the number of exposed catalytic active sites, discriminate among different types of surface catalytic active sites (redox, acidic and basic), provide quantitative information about the relative reaction rates on different types of surface catalytic sites, discriminate between surface Lewis and Bronsted sites, and rank the strength or catalytic rates of different acidic and basic sites, at least two smart chemical probe molecules are usually needed. Methanol oxidation to formaldehyde over metal oxide surfaces can provide information about items 1-3. Methyl formate can form on adjacent surface redox-basic sites, and dimethoxy methane can form on adjacent surface redox-acidic sites. While there isn't a universal smart chemical probe molecule, methanol appears to be emerging as a versatile probe for metal oxide surfaces.

为了确定暴露的催化活性位点的数量，区分不同类型的表面催化活性位点（氧化还原、酸性和碱性），提供不同表面催化位点相对反应速率的定量信息，区分表面Lewis和Bronsted位点，并对不同酸性和碱性位点的催化速率进行排名，通常至少需要两种智能化学探针分子。甲醇在金属氧化物表面上的氧化可以提供关于项目1-3的信息。甲基醋酸酯可以在相邻的表面氧化还原-碱性位点上形成，二甲氧基甲烷可以在相邻的表面氧化还原-酸性位点上形成。虽然没有一种通用的智能化学探针分子，但甲醇似乎正在成为金属氧化物表面的多功能探针。
