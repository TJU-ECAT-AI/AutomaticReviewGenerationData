[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored."
[2] "Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information."
[3] "This situation began to change 30 years ago as more powerful characterization techniques became available that could provide information about amorphous metal oxide phases, as well as crystalline nanophases, under different environmental conditions."
[4] "The first major breakthrough was the discovery and subsequent confirmation that amorphous surface species exist for supported metal oxide catalysts, which opened up an entirely new area of catalysis research."
[5] "More recent studies demonstrated that the same metal oxide catalytic active sites are present for crystalline siliceous molecular sieves and their corresponding amorphous SiO2-supported metal oxide analogs."
[6] "Furthermore, the same catalytic properties are exhibited by both the crystalline molecular sieves and the amorphous SiO2-based catalysts revealing the importance of local environment over long range order in mixed metal oxides."
[7] "Most recently, the discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials."
[8] "Thus, the presence of amorphous surface species and phases in mixed metal oxide catalytic materials and their electronic/ molecular structures-catalytic activity/selectivity relationships are now at the forefront of the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide materials."

1. The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the electronic structure and surface chemistry of the catalyst. These factors can alter the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst, thus impacting the efficiency of ethane dehydrogenation. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complexity of these interactions and the difficulty in accurately modeling the multi-component systems. Theoretical models often struggle to capture the full range of effects that arise from the interplay between niobium dopants, the NiO matrix, and the reaction conditions.

2. The evolution in the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts has significantly impacted the understanding of how such materials function as selective oxidation catalysts. The paradigm shift has led to the recognition of the importance of surface species and phases in mixed metal oxides, particularly amorphous surfaces. This has changed the focus of research from solely considering the bulk crystalline phases to understanding the role of surface chemistry and electronic structure. The discovery of amorphous surface species in bulk mixed metal oxides has opened new avenues for exploring their catalytic activity and selectivity, challenging traditional models and highlighting the need for advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the complex behavior of these materials.

1. 钼氧化物的不同性质，包括它们稳定的多种形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，通过影响催化剂的电子结构和表面化学。这些因素可以改变催化剂的反应性、选择性和稳定性，从而影响乙烷脱氢的效率。理论预测与实验观察之间的整合挑战源于这些相互作用的复杂性以及在多组分系统中准确建模的困难。理论模型往往难以捕捉从钼掺杂剂、NiO基体和反应条件之间交互作用产生的全面影响。

2. 混合金属氧化物催化材料的催化科学的发展已经显著改变了我们对这类材料如何作为选择性氧化催化剂工作的理解。这种范式转变导致了对混合金属氧化物表面物种和相态重要性的认识，特别是表面的非晶态。这改变了研究焦点，从仅仅考虑晶态基质转向理解表面化学和电子结构的作用。发现混合金属氧化物表面包含非晶态表面物种对材料的催化活性和选择性有重大影响，挑战了传统模型，并强调了需要先进的表征技术来阐明这些复杂材料行为的需求。
