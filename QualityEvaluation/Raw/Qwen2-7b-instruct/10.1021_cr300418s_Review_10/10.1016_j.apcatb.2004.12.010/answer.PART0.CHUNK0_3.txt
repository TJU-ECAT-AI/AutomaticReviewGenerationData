<p>LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 were tested for their oxygen storage capacity at different temperatures. By this method, a variety of reduction processes was clearly observed. Depending on the OSC test temperature, only surface, or surface and bulk, can be activated. Then, for LaCoO3, it was observed that at 180 8C, only the Co3+ surface ions are activated and reduced. At 330 8C, all the Co3+ of the solid were found to be reduced to Co2+.</p>
<p>However, no reduction of Co2+ into Co0 was observed at this temperature. This reduction to the metal began only when the test was performed at 480 8C, after the complete reduction of Co3+ into Co2+. The manganese-based perovskite presents reduction processes different from those observed for LaCoO3. At 180 8C, the LaMnO3 sample showed a very low oxygen mobility in comparison to the LaCoO3 sample. The oxygen involved was associated to the reduction of surface Mn4+ ions. At 330 8C, the reduction process observed was attributed to the slow reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+, and a LaMn3+O3 compound is obtained at the end of the reduction cycle. At 480 8C, it was observed that all the Mn4+ reduced immediately into Mn3+</p>

The behavior of LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by their distinct properties, including their various stable forms and oxidation states. The ability of niobium oxides to act as dopants is contingent on their ability to alter the electronic structure and promote catalytically active sites in NiO. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations can be challenging due to the complexity of these systems. The literature provides insights into how the properties of niobium oxides, such as their ability to induce surface and bulk redox processes, impact their effectiveness as dopants. 

Specifically, for LaCoO3, the literature reveals that the oxygen storage capacity varies with temperature. At 180°C, only surface Co3+ ions are reduced, indicating selective activation of the surface. As the temperature rises to 330°C, all Co3+ ions are reduced to Co2+, demonstrating enhanced surface and bulk activation. Yet, no reduction to Co0 (metallic cobalt) occurs at 330°C, necessitating further reduction at 480°C. 

In contrast, the manganese-based perovskite (LaMnO3) exhibits a different set of redox behaviors. At 180°C, it displays low oxygen mobility compared to LaCoO3, with reduction primarily occurring on the surface Mn4+ ions. At 330°C, the reduction process involves the slow conversion of Mn4+ to Mn3+, resulting in the formation of a LaMn3+O3 compound. At 480°C, all Mn4+ ions are rapidly reduced to Mn3+, highlighting a more efficient surface and bulk reduction process. 

These findings suggest that the nature of the dopant (LaCoO3 vs. LaMnO3) influences the extent and mechanism of oxygen storage and reduction, which in turn affects their performance as dopants in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental outcomes can stem from factors such as the specific interactions between the dopants and the NiO lattice, the effect of dopant concentration and distribution, and the dynamic nature of redox processes under reaction conditions. Overcoming these challenges requires a deeper understanding of the fundamental redox chemistry and the ability to predict and control the desired catalytic behavior through tailored dopant selection and optimization strategies.

对于NiO催化剂中作为掺杂剂的Nb氧化物的行为，其不同的性质，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，产生了影响。Nb氧化物作为掺杂剂的能力取决于它们改变NiO的电子结构并促进催化活性位点的能力。然而，在理论预测与实验观察之间达成一致的挑战源于这些系统的复杂性。文献提供了关于Nb氧化物的性质如何影响其作为掺杂剂的有效性的见解，特别是它们在表面和内部引发还原过程的能力。

具体而言，对于LaCoO3，在180°C时仅表面Co3+离子被还原，表明表面的选择性激活。当温度升至330°C时，所有Co3+离子都被还原为Co2+，表明表面和内部激活增强。然而，在330°C时，没有发生向Co0（金属钴）的还原，需要在480°C时进一步还原。

相比之下，锰基perovskite（LaMnO3）表现出不同的还原行为。在180°C时，它在与LaCoO3相比具有较低的氧流动性，主要是在表面Mn4+离子上进行还原。在330°C时，还原过程涉及缓慢将Mn4+转换为Mn3+，形成LaMn3+O3化合物。在480°C时，所有Mn4+离子都迅速还原为Mn3+，强调了表面和内部更有效的还原过程。

这些发现表明，掺杂物的性质（LaCoO3与LaMnO3）影响氧存储和还原的程度和机制，从而影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性能。理论模型与实验结果之间的差异可能源自掺杂物与NiO晶格之间的特定相互作用、掺杂物浓度和分布的影响以及在反应条件下还原过程的动态性质。克服这些挑战需要对基本还原化学有更深的理解，并能够通过选择和优化策略来预测和控制所需的催化行为。
