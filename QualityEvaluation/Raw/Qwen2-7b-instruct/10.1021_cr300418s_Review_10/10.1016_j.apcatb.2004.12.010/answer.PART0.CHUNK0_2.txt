Because of the supposed redox oxidation mechanism (Mars-Van-Krevelen), this agrees well with the OSC results obtained for the reducibility of the manganese on these samples, by which it was observed that substitution does not clearly affect the immediate reduction of the manganese.

It was observed that for temperatures between 330 °C and 500 °C, all the Mn4+ ions can be reduced to Mn3+ (slow reduction at 330 °C (OSCC) and immediate reduction at 480 °C (OSC), see in Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 7).

The Sr- and Ce- substituted samples (La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15) were tested in OSC at 480 °C. It was observed that the substitution affects the pulse reduction profile. However, no real effect of the substitution was observed on the immediate amount of oxygen available (OSC value), showing that Sr- and Ce- substitutions do not strongly modify the amount of manganese immediately reduced.

6. The Sr- and Ce- substituted samples (La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15) were tested for oxygen storage capacity (OSC) at 480 °C. It was noted that the substitution alters the pulse reduction pattern. Yet, no substantial change in the immediate oxygen availability (OSC value) was detected, indicating that Sr- and Ce- substitutions do not significantly adjust the amount of immediately reduced manganese.
