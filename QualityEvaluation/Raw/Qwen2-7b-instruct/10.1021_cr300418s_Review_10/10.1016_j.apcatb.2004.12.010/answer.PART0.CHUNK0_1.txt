[1] "In this work, LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 were tested for their oxygen storage capacity at different temperatures. By this method, a variety of reduction processes was clearly observed."
[2] "Depending on the OSC test temperature, only surface, or surface and bulk, can be activated."
[3] "For LaCoO3, it was observed that at 180 8C, only the Co3+ surface ions are activated and reduced."
[4] "At 330 8C, all the Co3+ of the solid were found to be reduced to Co2+."
[5] "However, no reduction of Co2+ into Co0 was observed at this temperature."
[6] "This reduction to the metal began only when the test was performed at 480 8C, after the complete reduction of Co3+ into Co2+."
[7] "The manganese-based perovskite presents reduction processes different from those observed for LaCoO3."
[8] "At 180 8C, the LaMnO3 sample showed a very low oxygen mobility in comparison to the LaCoO3 sample."
[9] "The oxygen involved was associated to the reduction of surface Mn4+ ions."
[10] "At 330 8C, the reduction process observed was attributed to the slow reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+, and a LaMn3+O3 compound is obtained at the end of the reduction cycle."
[11] "At 480 8C, it was observed that all the Mn4+ reduced immediately into Mn3+ (the amount of CO2 produced in the first reducing pulse (OSC value) corresponded to the reduction of all the Mn4+)."
[12] "At this temperature, a slow reduction of the Mn3+ into Mn2+ followed."
[13] "The Sr- and Ce- substituted samples (La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15) were tested in OSC at 480 8C."
[14] "It was observed that the substitution affects the pulse reduction profile."
[15] "However, no real effect of the substitution was observed on the immediate amount of oxygen available (OSC value), showing that Sr- and Ce- substitutions do not strongly modify the amount of manganese immediately reduced."

1. The oxygen storage capacity of LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 was assessed at various temperatures.
2. The oxygen storage capacity exhibited varied reduction processes contingent on temperature.
3. At 180°C, only the surface Co3+ ions of LaCoO3 were activated and reduced.
4. At 330°C, all Co3+ ions within the LaCoO3 sample were reduced to Co2+.
5. No reduction of Co2+ into Co0 occurred at 330°C.
6. Reduction to Co0 started only at 480°C, following the complete reduction of Co3+ to Co2+.
7. Manganese-based perovskites displayed distinct reduction processes compared to LaCoO3.
8. At 180°C, LaMnO3 showed significantly lower oxygen mobility relative to LaCoO3.
9. The reduction process involved the surface Mn4+ ions.
10. At 330°C, the reduction process was attributed to the slow conversion of Mn4+ to Mn3+, culminating in the formation of LaMn3+O3.
11. At 480°C, all Mn4+ ions were rapidly reduced to Mn3+, with the amount of CO2 produced in the first pulse reflecting the reduction of all Mn4+ ions.
12. Following this, a gradual reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ took place.
13. Substituted samples La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15 were examined for their oxygen storage capacity at 480°C.
14. The substitution impacted the pulse reduction pattern.
15. No substantial alteration in the immediate oxygen availability (OSC value) was observed due to substitution, indicating that Sr- and Ce- substitutions do not significantly change the amount of Mn4+ immediately reduced.

1. 对LaMnO3和LaCoO3在不同温度下的氧存储容量进行了测试。
2. 根据温度的不同，氧存储容量显示出不同的还原过程。
3. 在180°C时，只有LaCoO3表面的Co3+离子被激活并被还原。
4. 在330°C时，LaCoO3样本中的所有Co3+离子都被还原为Co2+。
5. 在330°C时，并没有观察到Co2+还原成Co0。
6. 只有在480°C时，Co3+完全还原为Co2+后，才开始Co2+还原为Co0的过程。
7. 钼基氧化物的还原过程与LaCoO3不同。
8. 在180°C时，LaMnO3的氧流动性远低于LaCoO3。
9. 所涉及的氧与表面Mn4+离子的还原相关。
10. 在330°C时，还原过程归因于Mn4+缓慢转化为Mn3+，最终形成LaMn3+O3化合物。
11. 在480°C时，所有Mn4+离子立即被还原为Mn3+，第一脉冲中产生的CO2量对应于所有Mn4+离子的减少。
12. 然后，Mn3+逐渐转化为Mn2+。
13. 样品La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15在480°C下被测试以评估其氧存储容量。
14. 替代影响了脉冲还原模式。
15. 由于替代并未显著改变即时氧气可用性（OSC值），观察到Sr-和Ce-替代并没有明显改变Mn4+即时减少的数量，说明Sr-和Ce-替代对锰的直接减少量影响不大。
