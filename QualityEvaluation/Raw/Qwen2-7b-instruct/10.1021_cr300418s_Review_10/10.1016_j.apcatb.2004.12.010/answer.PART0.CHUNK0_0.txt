[1] "In this work, LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 were tested for their oxygen storage capacity at different temperatures. By this method, a variety of reduction processes was clearly observed. Depending on the OSC test temperature, only surface, or surface and bulk, can be activated."
[2] "At 180 8C, the LaMnO3 sample showed a very low oxygen mobility in comparison to the LaCoO3 sample."
[3] "The Sr- and Ce- substituted samples (La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15) were tested in OSC at 480 8C. It was observed that the substitution affects the pulse reduction profile."
[4] "All these samples were also tested in the CH4 oxidation reaction. It was observed that the pure cobalt-based perovskite was more active than the manganese-based perovskite, even if its specific surface area was lower."

1. In the study, LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 were evaluated for their oxygen storage capacity at varying temperatures. Different reduction processes were discerned depending on the testing temperature, with some involving only the surface and others also affecting the bulk.

2. The LaMnO3 sample exhibited notably lower oxygen mobility compared to LaCoO3 at 180 8C.

3. The substitution of Sr and Ce in LaMnO3 at 480 8C led to modifications in the pulse reduction pattern.

4. The pure cobalt-based perovskite outperformed the manganese-based perovskite in the CH4 oxidation reaction, despite having a smaller specific surface area.

1. 在研究中，通过不同温度测试了LaMnO3和LaCoO3的氧存储容量。根据测试温度的不同，可以观察到不同的还原过程，有些仅涉及表面，而有些还影响到了内部。

2. 在180 8C时，LaMnO3样品的氧流动性显著低于LaCoO3。

3. 在480 8C下，Sr和Ce在LaMnO3中的替换导致了脉冲还原模式的变化。

4. 纯钴基氧化物在甲烷氧化反应中的活性高于锰基氧化物，尽管其表面积较小。
