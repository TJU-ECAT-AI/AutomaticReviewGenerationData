"Nickel oxide (NiO) is a very important material extensively used in catalysis, battery cathodes, gas sensors, electrochromic films, and magnetic materials [611]."
"Nanosized NiO material was prepared by four different methods."
"The results indicated that NiO nanoparticles synthesized by different methods have variant diameters, shape and distribution."
"Therein nanosized NiO prepared by sol gel method exhibits strong adsorptive property and good low temperature catalytic behavior."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The sol gel method of synthesis leads to nanosized NiO particles with a larger specific surface area and better particle distribution, enhancing their adsorptive property and catalytic behavior for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the physical properties of the niobium oxides and their catalytic performance.
