[1] "In this paper NiO nanoparticles were prepared by some of solid and liquid phase preparation techniques."
[2] "Therein NiO-SG and NiO-ME have larger special surface area and better particle distribution."
[3] "The special surface area of NiO nanoparticles influences the adsorptive property, which has intimate connection with their catalytic behavior."
[4] "However, due to the fact that the surfactant can't be decomposed completely at 400 C, it has covered the partial surface area of NiO-ME nanoparticles, which restrains the adsorption of oxygen."
[5] "Thus, NiO-SG nanoparticles have good adsorptive property and best catalytic behavior for ODHE reaction."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE). These properties impact the catalyst's adsorptive capacity and, consequently, its catalytic efficiency. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations stem from the complex interactions between the dopants and the NiO matrix. Theoretical models often fail to capture the nuanced effects of dopant concentration, particle size, and surface area on the catalyst's performance. Experimental discrepancies may arise due to variations in synthesis conditions, post-synthesis treatments, or the intrinsic limitations of the theoretical frameworks employed.

The literature demonstrates that the synthesis method profoundly affects the size, shape, and distribution of NiO nanoparticles, which in turn modulates their surface properties and catalytic activity. Specifically, the sol-gel method (NiO-SG) yields nanoparticles with the largest surface area and superior dispersion, leading to enhanced adsorptive capacity and catalytic performance for ODHE reactions. Conversely, the presence of unreacted surfactant residues on the NiO-ME nanoparticles inhibits oxygen adsorption, thereby impacting their catalytic efficacy.

To reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations, researchers must carefully consider the synthesis conditions and post-processing steps that influence nanoparticle morphology and surface chemistry. Advanced modeling techniques that incorporate detailed information about the synthesis parameters and the resulting nanoparticle properties could help bridge the gap between theory and practice. Additionally, developing more sophisticated experimental methods to accurately measure and control nanoparticle characteristics is essential for refining theoretical models and enhancing the predictive capabilities of computational tools.

铌氧化物的各种稳定形式和氧化状态的多样特性，显著影响其作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。这些特性影响催化剂的吸附能力，并进而影响其催化效率。理论预测与实验观察之间的调和挑战来自于复杂催化剂与NiO基质之间相互作用的细节。理论模型往往未能充分捕捉掺杂剂浓度、颗粒大小和表面积对催化剂性能的影响。实验差异可能源于合成条件的变化、后处理步骤的不同或所采用理论框架的内在局限性。

文献表明，不同的合成方法对NiO纳米粒子的尺寸、形状和分布产生深远影响，进而调节它们的表面特性和催化活性。具体而言，溶胶-凝胶方法（NiO-SG）产生的纳米粒子具有最大的表面积和最佳的分散性，从而提高吸附能力并增强ODHE反应的催化性能。相反，NiO-ME纳米粒子上的未反应表面活性剂残留物限制了氧吸附，从而影响其催化效果。

为了在理论预测与实验观察之间找到调和，研究人员必须仔细考虑影响纳米粒子形态和表面化学的合成条件和后续处理步骤。结合详细信息的高级建模技术，以及更精确测量和控制纳米粒子特性的实验方法，对于细化理论模型和增强计算工具的预测能力至关重要。
