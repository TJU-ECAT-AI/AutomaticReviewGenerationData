[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."
[2] "Promotion of the catalysts also did not cause significant variations in the surface area, except in the case of the NiNb and NiTa catalysts, where an increase was recorded."
[3] "Thermogravimetric analysis in the presence of a reduc-tive atmosphere (TGA-H2) was used to assess the reduction behavior of the prepared catalysts."
[4] "For all un-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, a single broad reduction peak in the 490-560 C range was recorded, with the T max of reduction shifting to lower temperature with increasing Ni loading."

The introduction of niobium as a promoter significantly boosts the reactivity of the catalysts towards ethane in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, enhancing the ethane conversion by over 50% while causing a minor decrease in ethene selectivity. This enhancement was observed without substantial changes in the surface area of the catalysts, except for those promoted with niobium and tantalum, which showed increased surface area. Thermogravimetric analysis in a reducing atmosphere was utilized to evaluate the reduction behavior of the catalysts. The reduction temperature maximum shifted to lower temperatures with increased nickel loading for the un-promoted catalysts, indicating a stronger interaction between nickel and alumina.

铌的引入显著提高了催化剂对乙烷的反应性，在氧化脱氢过程中，乙烷转化率提高超过50%，同时乙烯选择性下降较小（约10%）。这种提升在催化剂表面面积基本不变的情况下观察到，除了添加铌和钽的催化剂，这些催化剂的表面面积有所增加。在还原气氛下进行的热重分析用于评估催化剂的还原行为。随着镍负载量的增加，未促进催化剂的还原温度最大值向更低温度移动，这表明镍与氧化铝之间更强的相互作用。
