[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."
[2] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

1.Niobium significantly improved the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction, enhancing reactivity by over 50% compared to other promoters, albeit with a minor decrease in ethene selectivity of about 10%.

2.The NiNb catalyst displayed two clear reduction peaks in the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiment, with the peaks located at 335 and 510 degrees Celsius.
