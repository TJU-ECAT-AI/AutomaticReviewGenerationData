[1] "Nickel was found to interact strongly with alumina, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, whereas NiO crystallites formed on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages."
[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."
[4] "Many authors have postulated the existence of a surface spinel on the interface of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts."
[5] "According to Wu and Hercules [21], tetrahedrally coordinated nickel ions are hard to reduce, whereas octahedral nickel ions are readily reduced species, with the Nitetr/Nioct ratio decreasing with increasing loading."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The introduction of niobium notably enhances the reactivity towards ethane, increasing its conversion by more than 50% while only slightly reducing ethene selectivity. This improvement in catalytic performance contrasts with theoretical predictions, which often struggle to reconcile the complex interplay between dopant properties and their actual effects in complex catalytic systems. The challenge lies in understanding how the specific properties of niobium, such as its ability to modify the crystal structure and electronic environment of nickel, lead to these enhanced catalytic activities. The experimental observations highlight the importance of considering not just the stoichiometry but also the detailed physical and chemical properties of the catalysts in predicting their performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，显著影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为。在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中，铌的引入显著提高了乙烷的反应性，使其转化率提高超过50%，同时仅轻微降低了乙烯的选择性。这种催化性能的改善与理论预测形成对比，理论预测往往难以准确预测复杂催化系统中的实际效应。挑战在于理解铌的具体属性如何导致这些增强的催化活性，例如其改变镍晶体结构和电子环境的能力。实验观察强调了不仅考虑组成，而且考虑催化剂的详细物理和化学性质的重要性，在预测其性能时预测它们的表现。
