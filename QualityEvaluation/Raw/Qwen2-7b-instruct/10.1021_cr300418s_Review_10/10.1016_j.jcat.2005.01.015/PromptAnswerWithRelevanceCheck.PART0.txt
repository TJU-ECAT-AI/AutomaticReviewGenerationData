<quotes>
[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."
[2] "Promotion of the catalysts also did not cause significant variations in the surface area, except in the case of the NiNb and NiTa catalysts, where an increase was recorded."
[3] "Thermogravimetric analysis in the presence of a reduc-tive atmosphere (TGA-H2) was used to assess the reduction behavior of the prepared catalysts."
[4] "For all un-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, a single broad reduction peak in the 490-560 C range was recorded, with the T max of reduction shifting to lower temperature with increasing Ni loading."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of niobium as a promoter significantly boosts the reactivity of the catalysts towards ethane in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, enhancing the ethane conversion by over 50% while causing a minor decrease in ethene selectivity. This enhancement was observed without substantial changes in the surface area of the catalysts, except for those promoted with niobium and tantalum, which showed increased surface area. Thermogravimetric analysis in a reducing atmosphere was utilized to evaluate the reduction behavior of the catalysts. The reduction temperature maximum shifted to lower temperatures with increased nickel loading for the un-promoted catalysts, indicating a stronger interaction between nickel and alumina.

铌的引入显著提高了催化剂对乙烷的反应性，在氧化脱氢过程中，乙烷转化率提高超过50%，同时乙烯选择性下降较小（约10%）。这种提升在催化剂表面面积基本不变的情况下观察到，除了添加铌和钽的催化剂，这些催化剂的表面面积有所增加。在还原气氛下进行的热重分析用于评估催化剂的还原行为。随着镍负载量的增加，未促进催化剂的还原温度最大值向更低温度移动，这表明镍与氧化铝之间更强的相互作用。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The introduction of niobium notably enhances the reactivity towards ethane, increasing its conversion by more than 50% while only slightly reducing ethene selectivity. This improvement in catalytic performance contrasts with theoretical predictions, which often struggle to reconcile the complex interplay between dopant properties and their actual effects in complex catalytic systems. The challenge lies in understanding how the specific properties of niobium, such as its ability to modify the crystal structure and electronic environment of nickel, lead to these enhanced catalytic activities. The experimental observations highlight the importance of considering not just the stoichiometry but also the detailed physical and chemical properties of the catalysts in predicting their performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，显著影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为。在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中，铌的引入显著提高了乙烷的反应性，使其转化率提高超过50%，同时仅轻微降低了乙烯的选择性。这种催化性能的改善与理论预测形成对比，理论预测往往难以准确预测复杂催化系统中的实际效应。挑战在于理解铌的具体属性如何导致这些增强的催化活性，例如其改变镍晶体结构和电子环境的能力。实验观察强调了不仅考虑组成，而且考虑催化剂的详细物理和化学性质的重要性，在预测其性能时预测它们的表现。
