[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."
[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

1. The introduction of niobium notably enhanced the reactivity of the catalysts towards ethane in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, increasing it by over 50% compared to other promoters. However, this improvement was accompanied by a relatively minor decrease in ethene selectivity, about 10%.

2. Promoting the catalysts with various metals such as vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), cobalt (Co), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta) led to significant modifications in both the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts used in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profile of the NiNb catalyst displayed two clear peaks with maximum temperatures at 335 and 510 degrees Celsius, indicating distinct stages of reduction for the catalyst.

1. 钽的引入显著提高了催化剂对乙烷的活性，使其反应提高超过50%，与其它促进剂相比。然而，这种改进伴随着相对较小的乙烯选择性下降，大约为10%。

2. 通过使用各种金属如钒（V）、钼（Mo）、钴（Co）、钽（Ta）和铌（Nb）对催化剂进行改性，显著改变了催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢化过程中的结构和催化性能。

3. 钽改性的催化剂的温度程序化还原（TPR）谱图显示了两个清晰的峰值，最大温度分别为335和510摄氏度，表明催化剂存在不同的还原阶段。
