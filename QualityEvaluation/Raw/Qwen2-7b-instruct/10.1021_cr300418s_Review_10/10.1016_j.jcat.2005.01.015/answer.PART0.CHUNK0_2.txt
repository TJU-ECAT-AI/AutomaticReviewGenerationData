[1] "Nickel was found to interact strongly with alumina, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, whereas NiO crystallites formed on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages."
[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

1. Nickel shows a strong interaction with alumina, creating surface nickel aluminate-like species at low coverage, while forming NiO crystallites atop the nickel/alumina interface at higher coverages.
2. The addition of various metals like vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt, niobium, and tantalum notably alters the structure and catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
3. Introducing niobium into the catalyst system significantly boosts ethane reactivity, enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation process by over 50% compared to other promoters, albeit with a slight decrease in ethene selectivity, approximately 10%.

1. 镍与氧化铝之间表现出强烈的相互作用，在低覆盖度下形成表面镍铝酸盐类似物，而在高覆盖度下，在镍/氧化铝界面顶部形成NiO晶粒。
2. 各种金属如钒、钼、钴、铌和钽的添加显著改变了镍基催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构和催化性能。
3. 在催化剂体系中引入铌显著提高了乙烷的反应活性，与其它促进剂相比，该过程的氧化脱氢效率提高了超过50%，尽管乙烯的选择性略有下降，大约为10%。
