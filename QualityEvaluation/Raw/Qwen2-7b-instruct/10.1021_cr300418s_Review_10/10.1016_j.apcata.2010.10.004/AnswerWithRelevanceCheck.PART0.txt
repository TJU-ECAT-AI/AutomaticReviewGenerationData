          [1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1."
          [3] "The addition of niobium oxide has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remaining more isolated O species which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
          [5] "At loading higher than 37% the active sites are not modified anymore since a maximum of interaction between the two oxides is obtained but since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the total conversion of ethane increases."
          [6] "The results obtained show that surface interaction with niobium oxide is not the only way to lower the O concentration at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be considered."
          [7] "Contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored."

          NiNbO catalysts have been investigated for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, showing an optimal conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene at 15% Nb loading at 350°C. The addition of niobium oxide affects the surface interaction with NiO, leading to selective ethane conversion. Partial reduction of NiO with oxalic acid during preparation is also considered as a method to lower oxygen concentration. Contrary to expectations, oxygen adsorption at a surface with excess oxygen is favored due to the ease of extraction work from such surfaces.

          已研究了NiNbO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢，显示在350°C下15% Nb加载时，最佳转化率为33%，乙烯选择性为78%。铌氧化物的添加影响了NiO表面的相互作用，导致乙烷选择性转化。在准备过程中，使用草酸盐部分还原NiO也被考虑作为降低氧气浓度的方法。相反地，预期氧气倾向于接受电子，但在氧气过剩的表面上，氧气的吸附因其表面提取工作易于进行而受到偏好。

          [1] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time."
          [2] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]."
          [3] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and corners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [5] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
          [6] "When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts."

          The stability of the catalysts has been examined over different time periods, observing a consistent decline in activity. Lemonidou and colleagues studied the stability of NiNbO catalysts for 24 hours at 350°C. After deactivation, only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound, which likely correspond to strongly adsorbed defects on the surface. The use of ammonium oxalato niobate as a precursor led to the thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, reducing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and affecting catalytic properties. The specific surface area increase for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound can be attributed to a mutual protective effect reported in literature. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) altered the intrinsic ethane conversion rate but significantly enhanced selectivity to ethylene, reaching the best value observed on NiNbO catalysts.

          催化剂的稳定性已被研究了不同的时间周期，观察到所有催化剂的活性持续单调下降。Lemonidou及其同事在350°C下研究了NiNbO催化剂的稳定性24小时。在失活后，仅在Nb/NiO复合物上观察到了新的氧物种，这可能对应于表面缺陷（位错、边缘和角落）上强烈吸附的物种的数量可能会在与失活相关的表面转变后增加。使用铵盐草酸盐铌酸盐作为前体导致草酸盐离子的热分解，减少了NiO的过量氧，并影响了催化性质。Ni0.85Nb0.15O复合物的特定表面积增加可以归因于文献中报道的已知的互保效应。在NiO-OA-2/1（Nb/NiO）上沉积铌氧化物没有改变固体的纹理，但降低了乙烷转化率的内在速率，同时显著增加了对乙烯的选择性，达到了NiNbO催化剂上观察到的最佳值。

          [1] "The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]."

          The catalytic results of NiNbO catalysts align well with those published in literature, exhibiting similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene for catalysts with comparable compositions tested under the same conditions. The addition of niobium oxide at low loading affects the surface of the NiO phase, reducing the accessible oxygen. The remaining active sites, which are more isolated, become highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The specific surface area increase for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound can be attributed to a mutual protective effect reported in literature. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) does not alter the solid's texture but decreases the intrinsic ethane conversion rate while significantly increasing selectivity to ethylene, reaching the best value obtained on NiNbO catalysts.

          NiNbO催化剂的催化结果与文献中发表的结果很好地吻合，显示出在相同条件下测试的具有相似组成的催化剂具有相似的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。在低负载下添加铌氧化物会影响NiO相的表面，减少可接触的氧。剩余的活性位点，即更为孤立的位点，成为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的高选择性催化剂。Ni0.85Nb0.15O复合物的特定表面积增加可以归因于文献中报道的已知的互保效应。在NiO-OA-2/1（Nb/NiO）上沉积铌氧化物没有改变固体的纹理，但降低了乙烷转化率的内在速率，同时显著提高了对乙烯的选择性，达到了NiNbO催化剂上获得的最佳值。
