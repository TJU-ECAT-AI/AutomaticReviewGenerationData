[1] "Upon addition of niobium oxide, the NiO oxide phase, which is active for ethane oxidation but mainly selective to CO2, loses partially its activity but gains a high selectivity to ethylene."
[2] "The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remain- ing more isolated Ospecies which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "Contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored."
[4] "A treatment in air at 450 C for 30 min did not allow to regenerate the catalysts."
[5] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time."

1. Niobium oxides, when added to NiO catalysts, partly reduce the activity of the NiO phase towards ethane oxidation but significantly increase its selectivity towards ethylene.
2. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads on the surface of NiO, decreasing the accessibility of oxygen and enhancing ethane oxidative dehydrogenation selectivity. At higher loading, the active sites remain unchanged, but the specific surface area increases, boosting ethane conversion.
3. Oxygen adsorption on a surface with an excess of oxygen is favored due to the reduced extraction work, which is advantageous for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
4. A treatment at 450°C in air for 30 minutes was ineffective in regenerating the catalysts.
5. Continuous degradation in catalyst activity was observed over extended periods, attributed to the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO.

1. 当铌氧化物添加到NiO催化剂中时，NiO相部分降低了对乙烷氧化的活性，但显著提高了对乙烯的选择性。
2. 在低负载下，铌氧化物在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接近的氧量，从而增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的选择性。在较高负载下，活性位点保持不变，但由于特定表面积的增加，乙烷转化率提高。
3. 氧在具有过剩氧的表面上的吸附被优先考虑，因为从这种表面提取的工作减少，这有利于乙烷氧化脱氢。
4. 在450°C的空气中进行30分钟的处理未能使催化剂再生。
5. 观察到催化剂活性连续递减的现象，持续了各种时间周期，这是由于形成了热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相以及NiO上的氧过饱和度降低导致的。
