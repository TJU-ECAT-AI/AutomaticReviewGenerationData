[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1."
[3] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
[4] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
[5] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
[6] "Contrary to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored."

1. Various niobium oxide catalysts have been studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. An optimal ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene was achieved with a catalyst containing 15% Nb at 350°C and a weight to flow ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1.
3. Thermal decomposition of oxalate ions from the niobium precursor resulted in a reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, impacting the catalyst's properties.
4. Only a small percentage of Nb was required to achieve optimal catalytic activity, which was attributed to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.
5. Over time, the catalysts showed a slow and systematic deactivation due to the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.
6. The adsorption of O2 at a surface with excess oxygen is favored because the extraction work from such a surface is easier.

1. 已研究了不同铌含量的NiNbO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢。
2. 在350°C和质量流速比为0.54 g s mL−1的条件下，含15% Nb的催化剂实现了33%的乙烷转化率和78%的乙烯选择性。
3. 热分解自铌前体的草酸盐离子导致NiO氧过量减少，影响了催化剂的性质。
4. 只有少量的Nb就能达到最佳催化活性，这归因于由非晶态Nb2O5相引起的活性相颗粒尺寸的减小。
5. 随着时间的推移，催化剂表现出缓慢而系统的失活，这是由于反应条件下的NiO氧过量减少和在催化反应温度下热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相的形成。
6. 氧2在氧过剩表面的吸附受到青睐，因为从这种表面上提取的工作更容易。
