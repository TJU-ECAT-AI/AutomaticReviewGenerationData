[1] "NiNbO catalysts have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
[3] "The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."
[4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
[5] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
[6] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."

1.NiNbO catalysts were explored for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
2.The best performance was achieved with a 15% Nb content at 350°C and a W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1, yielding 33% ethane conversion and 78% ethylene selectivity.
3.Catalyst efficiency was linked to the interaction between NiO and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase.
4.Oxalate ions from the niobium precursor led to NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry reduction and influenced catalytic properties.
5.Long-term tests revealed a gradual catalyst deactivation.
6.Deactivation was attributed to ongoing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry reduction and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.

1.NiNbO催化剂被研究用于乙烷氧化脱氢。
2.在350°C和W/F比为0.54 g s mL−1的情况下，通过添加15%的Nb，实现了33%的乙烷转化率和78%的乙烯选择性。
3.催化剂效率与NiO和无定形Nb2O5相之间的相互作用有关。
4.从铌前体中释放的草酸根离子导致NiO过氧化物减少，并影响了催化性质。
5.长期测试显示催化剂存在逐渐失活现象。
6.失活归因于NiO过氧化物持续减少以及在催化反应温度下形成热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相。
