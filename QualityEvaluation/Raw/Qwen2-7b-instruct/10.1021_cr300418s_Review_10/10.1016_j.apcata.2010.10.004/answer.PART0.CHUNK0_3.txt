[1] "The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]."
[2] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
[3] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
[4] "When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts."
[5] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and corners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
[6] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]. Because it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial development of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature where the catalysts may present conversions with potential interest namely 380 C."

1. The catalytic results of NiNbO catalysts match those reported in previous literature, with similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene observed for catalysts with comparable compositions tested under identical conditions.

2. At low Nb content, up to 37%, there's a decrease in apparent activation energy and intrinsic ethane conversion rate, indicating a modification of the active sites' nature and number, which leads to increased reactivity but fewer sites, slowing down ethane conversion.

3. The rise in specific surface area for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalyst might be explained by a mutual protective effect documented in the literature, where one oxide inhibits the crystallization or growth of another, enhancing catalytic activity.

4. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) doesn't alter the solid's texture but decreases the intrinsic ethane conversion rate while significantly boosting selectivity to ethylene, achieving the highest ethylene yield on NiNbO catalysts.

5. Post-deactivation, new high-temperature oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound, suggesting they're not involved in the reaction and likely correspond to strongly adsorbed defects on the surface, whose number might increase due to surface transformations during deactivation.

6. The stability of NiNbO catalysts was initially studied by Lemonidou et al. for 24 hours at 350°C. Given its significance for potential industrial applications, this study was expanded to longer durations and temperatures where catalysts could exhibit interesting conversions, specifically 380°C.

1. NiNbO催化剂的催化结果与文献中报道的一致，具有相似的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性，对于具有类似组成的催化剂，在相同条件下进行测试时观察到。

2. 在Nb含量低至37%的情况下，显着的活化能和乙烷转化率内在速率持续下降，这与活性位点的性质和数量的修改相一致。催化位点显得更活跃但更少，从而减慢了乙烷转化速度。

3. 尼0.85Nb0.15O催化剂的特定表面面积的增加可能由文献中记录的互保效应解释，其中一种氧化物抑制另一种氧化物的结晶或生长，从而增强催化活性。

4. 在NiO-OA-2/1（Nb/NiO）上沉积铌氧化物不会改变固体的纹理，但降低乙烷转化率的内在速率同时显著提高乙烯选择性，达到NiNbO催化剂的最佳乙烯产率。

5. 催化剂在失活后，仅在Nb/NiO化合物上观察到新的高温氧物种，推测它们不参与反应，并且似乎对应于表面缺陷（位错、边缘和角落）上强烈吸附的物种，其数量可能由于失活过程中表面的转变而增加。

6. Lemonidou等人的研究最初对NiNbO催化剂进行了24小时的稳定性测试，温度为350°C。鉴于其对于潜在工业应用的重要性，该研究扩展了更长时间和温度的测试，这些温度下催化剂可以表现出有趣的转化，特别是380°C。
