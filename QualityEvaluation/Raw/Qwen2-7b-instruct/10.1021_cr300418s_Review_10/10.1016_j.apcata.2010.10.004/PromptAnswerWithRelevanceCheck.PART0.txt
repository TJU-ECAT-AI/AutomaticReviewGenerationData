<quotes>
[1] "Upon addition of niobium oxide, the NiO oxide phase, which is active for ethane oxidation but mainly selective to CO2, loses partially its activity but gains a high selectivity to ethylene."
[2] "The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remain- ing more isolated Ospecies which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "Contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored."
[4] "A treatment in air at 450 C for 30 min did not allow to regenerate the catalysts."
[5] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time."

1. Niobium oxides, when added to NiO catalysts, partly reduce the activity of the NiO phase towards ethane oxidation but significantly increase its selectivity towards ethylene.
2. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads on the surface of NiO, decreasing the accessibility of oxygen and enhancing ethane oxidative dehydrogenation selectivity. At higher loading, the active sites remain unchanged, but the specific surface area increases, boosting ethane conversion.
3. Oxygen adsorption on a surface with an excess of oxygen is favored due to the reduced extraction work, which is advantageous for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
4. A treatment at 450°C in air for 30 minutes was ineffective in regenerating the catalysts.
5. Continuous degradation in catalyst activity was observed over extended periods, attributed to the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 当铌氧化物添加到NiO催化剂中时，NiO相部分降低了对乙烷氧化的活性，但显著提高了对乙烯的选择性。
2. 在低负载下，铌氧化物在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接近的氧量，从而增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的选择性。在较高负载下，活性位点保持不变，但由于特定表面积的增加，乙烷转化率提高。
3. 氧在具有过剩氧的表面上的吸附被优先考虑，因为从这种表面提取的工作减少，这有利于乙烷氧化脱氢。
4. 在450°C的空气中进行30分钟的处理未能使催化剂再生。
5. 观察到催化剂活性连续递减的现象，持续了各种时间周期，这是由于形成了热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相以及NiO上的氧过饱和度降低导致的。

[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1."
[3] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
[4] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
[5] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
[6] "Contrary to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored."

[1] "The addition of niobium oxide has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remaining more isolated O species which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "At loading higher than 37% the active sites are not modified anymore since a maximum of interaction between the two oxides is obtained but since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the total conversion of ethane increases."
[3] "The results obtained show that surface interaction with niobium oxide is not the only way to lower the O concentration at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be considered."
[4] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more O active species were present at the surface of NiO."

1. The addition of niobium oxide at low loading reduces the amount of accessible oxygen at the surface of NiO, which leads to more isolated oxygen species becoming highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 
2. At higher loading, the active sites are not modified, but the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, resulting in a higher total conversion of ethane. 
3. Partial reduction of NiO with oxalic acid, along with surface interaction with niobium oxide, are both effective ways to lower the oxygen concentration at the surface of NiO. 
4. The continuous decrease in activity over time on stream is due to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to the point where no active oxygen species are present at the surface of NiO.

2. 在更高负载下，活性位点未改变，但催化剂的特定表面积继续增加，导致乙烷的总转化率提高。  
3. 将NiO部分还原与铌氧化物的表面相互作用都是有效降低NiO表面氧浓度的方式。  
4. 随着时间的持续增加而活动连续下降的原因是NiNb2O6相的形成和NiO氧过量系数的减少，直到表面NiO上不再存在活性氧物种。

[1] "The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]."
[2] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."
[3] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
[4] "When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts."
[5] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and corners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
[6] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]. Because it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial development of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature where the catalysts may present conversions with potential interest namely 380 C."

1. The catalytic results of NiNbO catalysts match those reported in previous literature, with similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene observed for catalysts with comparable compositions tested under identical conditions.

2. At low Nb content, up to 37%, there's a decrease in apparent activation energy and intrinsic ethane conversion rate, indicating a modification of the active sites' nature and number, which leads to increased reactivity but fewer sites, slowing down ethane conversion.

3. The rise in specific surface area for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalyst might be explained by a mutual protective effect documented in the literature, where one oxide inhibits the crystallization or growth of another, enhancing catalytic activity.

4. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) doesn't alter the solid's texture but decreases the intrinsic ethane conversion rate while significantly boosting selectivity to ethylene, achieving the highest ethylene yield on NiNbO catalysts.

5. Post-deactivation, new high-temperature oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound, suggesting they're not involved in the reaction and likely correspond to strongly adsorbed defects on the surface, whose number might increase due to surface transformations during deactivation.

6. The stability of NiNbO catalysts was initially studied by Lemonidou et al. for 24 hours at 350°C. Given its significance for potential industrial applications, this study was expanded to longer durations and temperatures where catalysts could exhibit interesting conversions, specifically 380°C.

1. NiNbO催化剂的催化结果与文献中报道的一致，具有相似的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性，对于具有类似组成的催化剂，在相同条件下进行测试时观察到。

2. 在Nb含量低至37%的情况下，显着的活化能和乙烷转化率内在速率持续下降，这与活性位点的性质和数量的修改相一致。催化位点显得更活跃但更少，从而减慢了乙烷转化速度。

3. 尼0.85Nb0.15O催化剂的特定表面面积的增加可能由文献中记录的互保效应解释，其中一种氧化物抑制另一种氧化物的结晶或生长，从而增强催化活性。

4. 在NiO-OA-2/1（Nb/NiO）上沉积铌氧化物不会改变固体的纹理，但降低乙烷转化率的内在速率同时显著提高乙烯选择性，达到NiNbO催化剂的最佳乙烯产率。

5. 催化剂在失活后，仅在Nb/NiO化合物上观察到新的高温氧物种，推测它们不参与反应，并且似乎对应于表面缺陷（位错、边缘和角落）上强烈吸附的物种，其数量可能由于失活过程中表面的转变而增加。

6. Lemonidou等人的研究最初对NiNbO催化剂进行了24小时的稳定性测试，温度为350°C。鉴于其对于潜在工业应用的重要性，该研究扩展了更长时间和温度的测试，这些温度下催化剂可以表现出有趣的转化，特别是380°C。
