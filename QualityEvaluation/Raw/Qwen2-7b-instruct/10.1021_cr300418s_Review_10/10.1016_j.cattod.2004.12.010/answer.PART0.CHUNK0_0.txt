[1] "However, it recently appears that the progress of catalytic science and technology is slower and epoch- making innovations in catalytic technology are fewer,particularly in heterogeneous catalysts, although the number of papers maintains a high rate of increase."
[2] "Recent progress of mixed oxide catalysts has been surveyed briefly, and future opportunities of catalytic technology are discussed, taking for example solid heteropolyacid and perovskite catalysts, where some promising signs for the future are noted."
[3] "Much more efforts should be directed to develop useful catalysts in practical applications, in order to accelerate the progress of catalytic science and technology."
[4] "It has been demonstrated that the catalytic activities for surface-type reactions are correlated proportionally to the surface acidity and those for the reactions in pseudoliquid to the bulk acidity."
[5] "In industry, remarkable improvement was reported for the process of ethyl acetate production catalyzed by HPA (Showa Denko), although the plant already started several years ago."
[6] "Recently the locations and dynamic behavior of acidic protons have been spectroscopically clarified."
[7] "Precise control of pore size was made possible for Cs and K salts through the understanding of their nanostructures."
[8] "Efficient solid catalysts are very desirable in the wide range of applications in the syntheses of fine chemicals."
[9] "Cs2.5 nanoparticles bound to the amino group of a coupling reagent, 3-aminopropyltetraethoxysilane (APTS), that is chemically bonded to the surface of silica (APTS:silica = 14:86) (Fig. 2), showed only a loss of less than 0.02% and were easily separable, maintaining more than 90% of the catalytic activity of Cs2.5."
[10] "Cs2.5 shows a high catalytic activity for organic reactions in water like hydration of alkenes and hydrolysis of oligosugars (Table 1)."
[11] "Crystalline bulk HPA catalysts (without supports or additives) are very talented catalysts for various organic reactions."
[12] "The structure and acidic properties of supported HPA are very important for practical applications, but they have little been clarified."
[13] "Control of acidity is one possible solution. In certain reaction systems, these problems are not serious and those reactions have been commercialized."
[14] "Regrettably, this appears still true, although some improvements were reported recently."
[15] "One of the reasons of the difficulty is thermal instability, particularly of Mo-polyanions having mixed addenda atoms."
[16] "Another serious problems often encountered for solid HPA catalysts are deactivation caused by by-products."
[17] "In my previous account [2], it was stated that in spite of extensive attempts using HPA for alkane oxidation, the performance was considerably below the level of commer- cialization."
[18] "Perovskite catalyst was commercia- lized for the first time for the catalytic removal of odor and smoke from cooking table in the kitchen."
[19] "Utilizing this property, the sintering of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of perovskite is greatly suppressed under the working conditions of automobile exhaust, where the oxidizing atmosphere and reducing atmosphere alternate rapidly."
[20] "Since the growth of particle size is the major cause of catalyst deactivation of the three-way catalyst (TWC), Pd combined with perovskite developed by Tanaka et al. (Daihatsu Motor) exhibited a dramatically prolonged catalyst life."
[21] "According to Daihatsu, the amount of Pd usage was decreased to 30% (saving of 70%)."
[22] "They did not detect Pd particles by X-ray diffraction after a long-time use, while Pd(0) was detected by XPS, demonstrating that Pd is present as very fine particles."
[23] "They called this catalyst an intelli- gent catalyst, since it recovers its initial atomic dispersion by itself by sensing the change of atmosphere."
[24] "In the world of mixed oxides, there are many kinds of fundamental structures (of double oxides and salts of oxoacids) and numerous compositions for each structure,and those mixed oxides exhibit various valuable functions derived from a variety of electronic, magnetic and chemical properties."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways. These properties can affect the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems. For instance, the specific structure of the niobium oxide, its interaction with NiO, and the resulting electronic properties play crucial roles in determining the catalytic performance. Theoretical models might predict certain behaviors, but experimental results can sometimes deviate due to unforeseen interactions or limitations in the model's scope. To reconcile these discrepancies, researchers often employ a combination of theoretical simulations, detailed kinetic studies, and careful experimental design to gain a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's behavior. This process involves continuous refinement of both theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques to better capture the complexities of real-world catalytic systems.

In the context of mixed oxide catalysts, the various fundamental structures and compositions offer a wide array of catalytic functions. These catalysts can exhibit properties related to electronic, magnetic, and chemical behavior, which contribute to their effectiveness in various applications. The potential for future innovations in catalytic technology lies in the exploration and optimization of these properties, as well as the development of novel mixed oxide compositions that can enhance the performance of existing catalysts or enable new applications. The key challenges in this area include understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the catalytic activity, improving the predictability of catalyst performance, and developing strategies to tailor the catalyst properties for specific reaction conditions and desired outcomes.
