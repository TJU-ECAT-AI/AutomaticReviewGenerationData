[1] "In my previous account [2], it was stated that in spite of extensive attempts using HPA for alkane oxidation, the performance was considerably below the level of commercialization."
[2] "Regrettably, this appears still true, although some improvements were reported recently [12]."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst. These properties can lead to variations in the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of the interactions between the dopants and the matrix material, as well as the dynamic nature of the catalytic processes involved in oxidative dehydrogenation. Theoretical models may not fully capture the intricacies of these interactions, leading to discrepancies between predicted and observed catalytic behaviors.
