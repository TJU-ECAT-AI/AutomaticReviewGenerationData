[1] "However, it recently appears that the progress of catalytic science and technology is slower and epoch- making innovations in catalytic technology are fewer,particularly in heterogeneous catalysts, although the number of papers maintains a high rate of increase."
[2] "The reason why the progress of catalytic science and technology is recently slow is probably because sufficient efforts are not devoted to develop novel catalysts for practical applications."
[3] "Recent progress of mixed oxide catalysts has been surveyed briefly, and future opportunities of catalytic technology are discussed, taking for example solid heteropolyacid and perovskite catalysts, where some promising signs for the future are noted."
[4] "In the world of mixed oxides, there are many kinds of fundamental structures (of double oxides and salts of oxoacids) and numerous compositions for each structure,and those mixed oxides exhibit various valuable functions derived from a variety of electronic, magnetic and chemical properties."

Mixed oxide catalysts, including solid heteropolyacids and perovskites, show promise for future catalytic technology advancements. The progress in mixed oxide catalysts has been reviewed, highlighting their diverse electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties which contribute to various functions. However, the development of novel catalysts for practical applications requires more efforts, as the progress in catalytic science and technology is currently slower, with fewer epoch-making innovations, especially in heterogeneous catalysts despite a high rate of paper publications.
