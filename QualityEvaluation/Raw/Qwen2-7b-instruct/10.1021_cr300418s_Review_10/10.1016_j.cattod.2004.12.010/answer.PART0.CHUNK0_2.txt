[1] "Recent progress of mixed oxide catalysts has been surveyed briefly, and future opportunities of catalytic technology are discussed, taking for example solid heteropolyacid and perovskite catalysts, where some promising signs for the future are noted."
[2] "This equation is conceptual, just indicating that the value, V,increases with the impact, I, and decreases with the distance, D."
[3] "For example, due to the pseudoliquid behavior that we first reported in 1979 and summarized in 1987 [5], not only very high catalytic activities are obtained, but also reaction mechanisms are elucidated at the molecular level."
[4] "Recently, according to the principle (e) of catalyst design described in the previous section, a new automobile catalyst was successfully developed by Daihatsu Motor [19]."
[5] "Utilizing this property, the sintering of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of perovskite is greatly suppressed under the working conditions of automobile exhaust, where the oxidizing atmosphere and reducing atmosphere alternate rapidly [19]."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties of the catalyst. These properties can alter the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst, which in turn affects the efficiency of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation process. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex interactions between the niobium oxides and the NiO matrix, as well as the dynamic nature of the catalytic environment during the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Understanding these interactions requires detailed studies of the catalyst's structure, composition, and activity under various operating conditions.
