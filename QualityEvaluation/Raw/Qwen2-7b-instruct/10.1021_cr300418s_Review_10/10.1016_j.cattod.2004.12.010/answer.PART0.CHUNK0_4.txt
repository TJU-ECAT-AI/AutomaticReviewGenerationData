<p>Recent progress of mixed oxide catalysts has been surveyed briefly, and future opportunities of catalytic technology are discussed, taking for example solid heteropolyacid and perovskite catalysts, where some promising signs for the future are noted.</p>
<p>It was stressed that much more efforts should be directed to develop useful catalysts in practical applications, in order to accelerate the progress of catalytic science and technology.</p>
<p>Our basic concept is that mixed oxides having well characterized structure, at least in the solid bulk, are suitable for the catalyst design at the atomic/molecular level.</p>
<p>First, several groups including our group showed that the molecular nature of heteropolyanion is maintained in the solid state, if necessary caution is paid, and that their acid and redox properties can be controlled in a regular way by changing the atomic composition.</p>
<p>Second, we found that the presence of hierarchical structures (primary, secondary and tertiary structures) and three different modes of catalysis (surface-type, pseudoliquid (bulk-type I), and bulk-type II) are the indispensable basic concepts for the understanding and design of solid HPA catalysts.</p>
<p>Recently the locations and dynamic behavior of acidic protons have been spectroscopically clarified.</p>
<p>In addition, precise control of pore size was made possible for Cs and K salts through the understanding of their nanostructures.</p>
<p>There are already more than seven large-scale industrial processes using HPA catalysts, mostly in Japan.</p>
<p>Efficient solid catalysts are very desirable in the wide range of applications in the syntheses of fine chemicals.</p>
<p>Okuhara et al. found that Cs2.5 nanoparticles bound to the amino group of a coupling reagent, 3-aminopropyltetraethoxysilane (APTS), that is chemically bonded to the surface of silica (APTS:silica = 14:86), showed only a loss of less than 0.02% and were easily separable, maintaining more than 90% of the catalytic activity of Cs2.5.</p>
<p>Owing to the moderate hydrophobicity, Cs2.5 shows a high catalytic activity for organic reactions in water like hydration of alkenes and hydrolysis of oligosugars.</p>
<p>(a) Selection of transition element at B-site of perovskite structure (ABO3), that primarily determines the catalytic behavior.</p>
<p>(b) Valency control of B-site elements (and vacancy control at B site and of oxygen).</p>
<p>(c) Synergistic effect of two different B site ions.</p>
<p>(d) Enhancement of surface area by forming thin layers or nanoparticles of perovskite on support materials.</p>
<p>(e) Combination of noble metals with perovskites.</p>
<p>The reason was that isolated Pd ion in HZSM-5 is active for NO reduction and is stabilized in oxidizing atmosphere, because Pd metal clusters can be redispersed to Pd ions under the oxidizing conditions.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by Eq. (3) and in Fig. 4 Pd0 on perovskite ! O2 H2 Pd 3 in perovskiteLaFePdO3 (3)</p>
<p>Since the growth of particle size is the major cause of catalyst deactivation of the three-way catalyst (TWC), Pd combined with perovskite developed by Tanaka et al. (Daihatsu Motor) exhibited a dramatically prolonged catalyst life.</p>
<p>Important examples that are not discussed in the above reviews may be CeO2ZrO2 used as the promoter of three-way automobile catalysts and NOx storage and reduction catalysts for lean-burn automobile exhausts.</p>
<p>Although the performances of those catalysts have gradually been improved, fundamental understanding of catalytic function is still poor and the R&D very much depend on trial and error.</p>
<p>We also note that, although the performances of those catalysts have gradually been improved, fundamental understanding of catalytic function is still poor and the R&D very much depend on trial and error.</p>
