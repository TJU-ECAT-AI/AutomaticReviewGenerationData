[1] "Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films for hydrogen evolution."
[2] "The promotional effects of Fe, Co, and Ni ions exist under both acidic and neutral conditions, but the effects are more pronounced under neutral conditions."
[3] "Up to a 12-fold increase in exchange current density and a 10-fold increase in the current density at an overpotential of 150 mV are observed at pH 7."
[4] "Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 films, resulting in a high surface area and a higher catalyst loading."
[5] "However, at pH 7, Fe, Co, and Ni ions appear to also increase the intrinsic activity of the MoS3 film."
[6] "The most active ternary catalysts were prepared from solutions where the concentration ratios of MCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4] were 1 : 3."
[7] "The promotional effect has the order of Co > Ni > Fe."
[8] "Under these conditions, the Fe, Co and Ni ions also increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of MoS3."

1. Iron, cobalt, and nickel ions enhance the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films for hydrogen evolution.
2. The enhancement effects of iron, cobalt, and nickel ions are noticeable under both acidic and neutral conditions, particularly more so under neutral conditions.
3. At a pH of 7, there can be a 12-fold increase in exchange current density and a 10-fold increase in current density at an overpotential of 150 mV.
4. Iron, cobalt, and nickel ions facilitate the growth of MoS3 films, increasing their surface area and catalyst loading.
5. At a pH of 7, in addition to enhancing the surface area and catalyst loading, iron, cobalt, and nickel ions also increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of the MoS3 film.
6. The most effective ternary catalysts were synthesized from solutions where the ratios of metal chloride to (NH4)2[MoS4] were 1:3.
7. The promotional effects follow the order of cobalt > nickel > iron.
8. Under these conditions, iron, cobalt, and nickel ions increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of the MoS3 film.
