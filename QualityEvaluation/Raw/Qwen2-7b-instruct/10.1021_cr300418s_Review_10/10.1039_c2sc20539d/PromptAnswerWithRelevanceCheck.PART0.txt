<p>Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films for hydrogen evolution.</p>
<p>Molybdenum sulfide materials have been shown as promising non-precious catalysts for hydrogen evolution. This paper describes the study of the promotional effects of certain transition metal ions on the activity of amorphous MoS3 films.</p>
<p>Whereas the Mn, Cu, and ZnMoS3 films show similar or only slightly higher catalytic activity as the MoS3 film, the Fe, Co, and NiMoS3 films are significantly more active.</p>
<p>Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 films, resulting a high surface area and a higher catalyst loading. These changes are the main contributors to the enhanced activity at pH  0.</p>
<p>At pH  7, Fe, Co, and Ni ions appear to also increase the intrinsic activity of the MoS3 film.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document explains how certain transition metal ions, specifically iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni), can significantly improve the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) films when incorporated into them. This improvement is observed under both neutral and acidic conditions, with the effects being more pronounced under neutral conditions. The enhancement in activity is attributed to the changes in morphology and composition of the MoSx films caused by the presence of Fe, Co, and Ni ions, which lead to an increase in surface area and catalyst loading. However, at pH 7, the increase in activity is not solely explained by the increase in surface area or catalyst loading, suggesting that these ions also increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of the MoSx films under these conditions. This promotional effect of Fe, Co, and Ni ions is attributed to their interaction with unsaturated sulfur atoms in the MoSx films, thereby enhancing their activity towards hydrogen evolution.

文档说明了特定的过渡金属离子，即铁（Fe）、钴（Co）和镍（Ni），可以显著提高钼化物硫化物（MoSx）薄膜的催化活性，当它们被整合到这些薄膜中时。这种改善在中性和酸性条件下都存在，但在中性条件下效果更为明显。活性的增加归因于Fe、Co和Ni离子对MoSx薄膜形态和组成的改变，导致表面面积和催化剂负载的增加。然而，在pH 7下，活性的增加不仅仅是由于表面面积或催化剂负载的增加，这表明这些离子也增加了MoSx薄膜在这些条件下的内在催化活性。Fe、Co和Ni离子对促进效果的解释是它们与MoSx薄膜中的未饱和硫原子的相互作用，从而增强其氢演化活性。
