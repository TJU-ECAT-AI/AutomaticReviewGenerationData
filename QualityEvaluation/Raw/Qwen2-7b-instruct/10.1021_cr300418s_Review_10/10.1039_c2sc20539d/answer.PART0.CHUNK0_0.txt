<p>Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films for hydrogen evolution.</p>
<p>Molybdenum sulfide materials have been shown as promising non-precious catalysts for hydrogen evolution. This paper describes the study of the promotional effects of certain transition metal ions on the activity of amorphous MoS3 films.</p>
<p>Whereas the Mn, Cu, and ZnMoS3 films show similar or only slightly higher catalytic activity as the MoS3 film, the Fe, Co, and NiMoS3 films are significantly more active.</p>
<p>Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 films, resulting a high surface area and a higher catalyst loading. These changes are the main contributors to the enhanced activity at pH  0.</p>
<p>At pH  7, Fe, Co, and Ni ions appear to also increase the intrinsic activity of the MoS3 film.</p>
