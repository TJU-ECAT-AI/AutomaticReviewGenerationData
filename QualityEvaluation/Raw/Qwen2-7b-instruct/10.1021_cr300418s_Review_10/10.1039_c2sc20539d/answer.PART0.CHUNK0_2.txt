[1] "The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "These properties can lead to a variety of effects on the catalytic performance, such as altering the surface structure, modifying the electronic properties, or changing the acidity of the catalyst."
[3] "The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations often stem from the complexity of the interactions between the dopants and the host material, as well as the dynamic nature of the catalytic processes."
