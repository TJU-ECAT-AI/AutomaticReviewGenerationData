Molybdenum sulfide materials have been shown as promising non-precious catalysts for hydrogen evolution. This paper describes the study of the promotional effects of certain transition metal ions on the activity of amorphous MoS3 films. Ternary metal sulfide films, MMoS3 (M  Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), have been prepared by cyclic voltammetry of aqueous solutions containing MCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4]. Whereas the Mn, Cu, and ZnMoS3 films show similar or only slightly higher catalytic activity as the MoS3 film, the Fe, Co, and NiMoS3 films are significantly more active. The promotional effects of Fe, Co, and Ni ions exist under both acidic and neutral conditions, but the effects are more pronounced under neutral conditions. Up to a 12-fold increase in exchange current density and a 10-fold increase in the current density at an overpotential of 150 mV are observed at pH  7. It is shown that Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 films, resulting a high surface area and a higher catalyst loading. These changes are the main contributors to the enhanced activity at pH  0.
However, at pH  7, Fe, Co, and Ni ions appear to also increase the intrinsic activity of the MoS3 film.

Introduction Solar energy is one of the most desirable renewable energy resources owing to its unparalleled capacity.1 The intermittent nature of solar energy, however, necessitates storage methods.
Storing sunlight energy in the form of chemical fuels is attractive because fuels have much higher energy densities than batteries.2 In this context, sunlight-driven water splitting to make hydrogen and oxygen becomes an important scheme for solar energy conversion and storage.15 Water splitting might be achieved in one step via photoelectrochemistry, or in two steps via photo- voltaics and electrolyzers.
One key step in water splitting is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), i.e. the reduction of protons to form dihydrogen (2H+ + 2e / H2). The reaction has a thermodynamic potential of 0 V vs. SHE. However, without a catalyst, a high overpotential (h) is required for the reaction to take place with a significant rate. To lower the overpotential, and hence to improve the energy efficiency, good HER catalysts need to be employed.
Under acidic or neutral conditions, platinum metal is the best catalyst. Compared to Ni-based catalysts that are used in commercial alkaline electrolyzers, Pt appears to be more compatible with the conditions envisioned for one-step photo- electrochemical water splitting.6 While being highly active and giving high current densities at low overpotentials, Pt is scarce and expensive, which could be prohibitive for large scale appli- cations. The limited availability of Pt prompts the search for non-precious HER catalysts.2,4,7,8 A growing number of hetero- geneous catalysts5,912 have been developed.
There is now increasing interest in using molybdenum sulfide materials as HER catalysts.8,13,14 Bulk MoS2 crystals were known to be poor HER catalysts,15 however, nanocrystals of MoS2 with unsaturated edge sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity.11,13,1618 Except in a solvothermal synthesis,17 the MoS2 nanocrystals were normally prepared by sulfidization using H2S, either under ultra- high vacuum or using thermal treatments. The sulfidization temperature was 400550 C. These harsh conditions not only resulted in a high cost for the catalysts, but also limited the choices of substrate support. We recently reported the discovery that amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx, x  2 and 3) films are highly active HER catalysts.8,12 Whereas the precatalysts could be either MoS2 or MoS3, the active catalyst in the film was proposed to be a reduced molybdenum sulfide species, probably amorphous MoS2.12 Unlike MoS2 nanoparticles which are prepared under elevated temperature, pressure, or vacuum, the amorphous MoSx films can be prepared by simple solution electrochemistry under ambient conditions. As a result, these amorphous materials are easy to make, less costly, and amenable to large scale applications. Shortly after, a solution method to deposit amorphous MoS3 catalysts on CdSe-seeded CdS nano- rods under similarly mild conditions (90 C),19 and a method for sulfidization at about 200 C18 were reported.

The catalysts are characterized by XPS, electron microscopy, ICP, and capacitance measurements, and the elec- trode kinetics are studied by Tafel analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Results and discussion Cobalt promoted amorphous MoS3 film We earlier reported that amorphous MoSx (x  2 and 3) films were deposited on a working electrode, e.g. ITO or glassy carbon, when an aqueous solution of (NH4)2[MoS4] was subject to consecutive cyclic voltammetry experiments.12 The MoSx films were active HER catalysts. We then observed that a thin film was also deposited from an aqueous solution of (NH4)2[Co(MoS4)2] (1) in a similar electropolymerization procedure. Complex 1 is a well-defined Co complex that was previously made as a nitrogenase model.22 Analysis by XPS indicated that the film contains Co, Mo, and S (vide infra). Thus,complex 1 serves as a molecular precursor for the ternary metal sulfide film. Furthermore, it is possible to use in situ prepared 1,formed immediately upon the mixing of CoCl2 with (NH4)2[MoS4], as the precursor. The ratio of Co to Mo is not limited to 1 : 2 in the deposition bath.
The CoMoS films are active HER catalysts. To identify the optimal ratio of Co to Mo in the deposition bath, a number of films were prepared on a glassy carbon electrode from solutions in which the concentration ratios of CoCl2 to (NH4)2[MoS4] varied between 1 : 200 and 1 : 2. When the ratio exceeded 1 : 2,a precipitation was observed upon mixing of CoCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4], so no attempt was made to deposit films from such mixtures. Fig. 1 shows the polarization curves of the Co MoS films at pH  7 and 0. The Co2+ ion promotes the catalytic activity of amorphous MoS3.
The CoMoS film prepared from a solution where the concentration ratio of Co to Mo is 1 : 3 exhibits the highest activity. The promotion is more profound at pH  7 (Fig. 1, A).
The binary MoS3 film has a current density of 0.1 mA cm2 at h  176 mV. The best CoMoS ternary film reaches the same current density at h  84 mV, resulting in a 92 mV decrease in overpotential. At h  200 mV, the current density of the Co- promoted film (1.04 mA cm2) is five times of that of the unpromoted film (0.19 mA cm2). The effect of Co-promotion is less pronounced but still visible at pH  0. To reach a current density of 1.0 mA cm2, the unpromoted film requires an over- potential of 170 mV, whereas the best CoMoS film requires an overpotential of 135 mV. At h  200 mV, the current density of the best CoMoS film (17.5 mA cm2) is three times of that of the unpromoted film (5.5 mA cm2). Even though the optimal ratio of Co to Mo in the deposition bath is 1 : 3, a significant promotional effect is already observed with a small amount of Co (1 : 200) at both pHs.
The CoMoS film was studied by X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy (XPS). The analysis was performed on a film deposited on FTO, with the optimal Co to Mo ratio of 1 : 3 in the deposition bath. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S1 A, ESI) confirms the presence of cobalt ion in the film. The Co 2p region of the spectrum (Fig. 2, A) shows an intense peak at ca. 779 eV and a broad peak at ca. 795 eV. These signals are attributed to the transitions from the Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. A similar spectrum was obtained in a previous XPS study of cobalt sulfide film by Valiu- liene et al.23 The Co signals are absent in the XPS spectra of the unpromoted MoSx films.12 The S 2p region of the XPS spectrum (Fig. 2 B) exhibits two bands. In addition to the broad and intense band centered around 163 eV, which was also observed in the MoSx films, a smaller band at ca. 169 eV is found. This signal might arise from sulfur atoms interacting with Co ions. Valiuliene et al. observed a similar signal and attributed it to cobalt sulfite (CoSO3).23 The XPS spectrum in the Mo 3d region (Fig. S1 B, ESI) is very similar to the spectrum of the unpromoted MoSx films. The two central and more intense peaks are attributed to the transitions from Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, respectively. The binding energy indicates a +4 oxidation state for the molybdenum.

View Article Online We previously showed that a freshly prepared MoS3 film was reduced to amorphous MoS2 which was responsible for HER.12 This was evidenced by the change in the XPS spectra of the film before and after electrolysis. The S 2p spectrum of the MoS3 film consists of two doublets (Fig. S2 A, ESI), indicating the pres- ence of both S2 and S2 2 ligands.20,24 A different XPS spectrum was observed on the film that was subjected to electrolysis at h 200 mV for several minutes. The S 2p spectrum is much narrower (Fig. S2 B, ESI), and consists of one doublet, similar to the spectrum of MoS2. To probe whether the same pre-activation process exists for the Co-MoS3 film, this film was subjected to electrolysis at h  200 mV for five minutes. A significant change was observed in the S 2p XPS spectrum of the resulting film (Fig. S3, ESI). The spectrum is much narrower. While the spectrum could not be fit with one doublet probably due to the presence of some CoSx species, it suggests that the CoMoS3 is activated prior to HER, likely to CoMoS2.
We showed earlier that MoSx films were stable in acidic solutions. The stability of the CoMoS3 film was tested in an electrolysis measurement. The catalytic current remained similar during 1 h (Fig. S4, ESI), indicating a high stability under HER conditions. The film could be oxidized and dissolved at ca. 0.7 V vs. SHE though (Fig. S5, ESI).
MoS3 films promoted with other first-row transition metals The influence of several other first-row transition metal ions (M2+, M  Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the HER activity of MoS3 was also investigated. Since the Co-promoted MoS3 film showed optimal catalytic activity when the initial M : Mo ratio was about 1 : 3, the initial MCl2 to (NH4)2[MoS4] ratio was set to this ratio in the deposition bath. The catalytic activities of these ternary MMoS3 films towards HER were measured using linear sweep voltammetry (Fig. 3 A and B). Fe2+ appears to significantly promote the activity of MoS3 film at both acidic and neutral pHs,and Ni2+ has a pronounced promotional effect at pH  7. The other ions have a much smaller or no influence on the activity.
Comparison of the promotional effects of different metal ions Fig. 4 shows the current densities of MoS3 and MMoS3 films (M  Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) at h  150 mV and 200 mV. It appears that Fe, Co and Ni ions are all effective promoters. At pH  7, the best promoter is Co2+, which gives amorphous MoS3 film a five fold increase in the current density (1.05 mA cm2 vs.
0.19 mA cm2) at h  200 mV. At pH  0, the best promoter is
Fe2+, which gives MoS3 a two fold increase of activity at both h 200 mV and h  150 mV (24.9 mA cm2 vs. 13.6 mA cm2 and
1.55 mA cm2 vs. 0.81 mA cm2). On the other hand, Mn, Cu,
and Zn ions give no or only a small promotion to the activity of MoS3 films.

View Article Online Tafel analysis and HER mechanism Tafel analysis was carried out on the polarization curves of MoS3 and MMoS3 films measured at pH  0. The results are summarized in Table 1. The Tafel slopes were all found to be between 3943 mV dec1. The best three promoters, Fe, Ni and Co, significantly increase the exchange current densities (J0). The CoMoS3 film has the highest J0 (5.0  104 mA cm2), which is a four fold increase from MoS3. Since this film yields a slightly higher Tafel slope, the current densities at higher overpotentials (e.g., h  200 mV) are slightly lower than those of the FeMoS3 film (Fig. 4). Mn, Cu, and Zn, on the other hand, do not bring much change to J0 or the Tafel slopes, and as a result, their promotional effects are small, if any.
In acidic solutions, hydrogen evolution on a metal surface mainly involves three reactions (eqn (1)(3)).25 The common first step is the discharge reaction (1), which is followed by either combination or ion + atom reaction to give H2. Tafel analysis has been used to distinguish different mechanistic pathways.
Assuming a small surface coverage of hydrogen, a fast discharge reaction (1) followed by a rate-determining combination reaction (2) results in a theoretical Tafel slope of 29 mV dec1 at 25 C (2.303RT/2F). This value is found experimentally for Pt. When (1) is fast and is followed by a slow ion + atom reaction (3), the Tafel slope shall be 38 mV dec1 (2  2.303RT/3F). If (1) is rate- determining or the surface coverage is close to one, the Tafel slope shall be 116 mV dec1 (2  2.303RT/F). Indeed, for many metal electrodes, Tafel slopes of about 29, 38, or 116 mV dec1 have been observed. However, deviations from these values are also common. Many factors may be the origins of the deviation;for example, the surface coverage of hydrogen might be inter- mediate and potential dependent, or the discharge reaction may have a significant activation barrier.18,26 discharge reaction (Volmer step): H3O+ + e + cat # catH + H2O (1) combination reaction (Tafel step):catH + catH # 2 cat + H2 (2) ion + atom reaction (Heyrovsky step): H3O+ + e + catH # cat + H2 + H2O (3) The correlation between the Tafel slopes and the mechanism of HER was developed for metal surfaces, on which the Volmer step could be observed by cyclic voltammetry. The molybdenum sulfide catalysts are non-metallic, and the Volmer step is not observed by cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. 5, vide infra). However, Tafel analysis is still a useful tool here because the experimentally observed Tafel slopes indeed approach a limiting value of 38 mV dec1. Furthermore, Noskov et al. showed earlier by DFT calculations that the hydrogen adsorption step on the edge of MoS2 was thermally uphill,13 and therefore it should not be observed at an underpotential as in the case of Pt. Following these considerations, HER catalyzed by amorphous MoS3 and MMoS3 (M  Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) in acidic solutions seems to occur via a fast discharge reaction and then a rate-determining ion + atom reaction. The slightly higher Tafel slopes observed for Co and NiMoS3 are probably due to a variation in surface coverage of hydrogen rather than a different mechanistic pathway. This hypothesis is supported by the similar electro- chemical impedance responses of these films (vide infra).
Tafel analysis was carried out on the polarization curves of MoS3 and MMoS3 films measured at pH  7 as well (Table 2).
The Tafel slopes were all found to be between 86 and 96 mV Fig. 4 Current densities of unpromoted and M-promoted (M  Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) MoS3 films on glassy carbon in pH  7 (A) and pH 0 (B) at 150 mV and 200 mV overpotential. The M promoted films were deposited in aqueous solutions of M2+ (0.67 mM) and MoS4 2 (2 mM).
The current densities were extracted from the respective polarization curves.

View Article Online dec1. Compared to the unpromoted film, the Fe, Co, and Ni- promoted films again have much larger exchange current densi- ties. The cobalt promotion resulted in a 12 fold increase in J0.
The significant increase in Tafel slopes, from about 38 mV dec1 at pH  0 to about 90 mV dec1 at pH  7, indicates a change in the mechanism of hydrogen evolution. We suspect that under the neutral conditions, the rates of the discharge reaction and the ion + atom reaction become comparable, which results in a Tafel slope that is intermediate between 39 and 116 mV dec1.
Morphology and thickness of MMoS3 films The morphology and thickness of the MoS3 and MMoS3 (M Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S6, ESI). The incorporation of Fe, Co,or Ni ions resulted in an appreciable change to the morphology of the MoS3 film, making them more porous. The Mn, Cu and Zn-promoted MoS3 films, on the other hand, exhibit a similar morphology to the unpromoted MoS3 film.
The thickness of binary and ternary MoS3 films was also determined by SEM. The thickness was measured either at the cross-section of the whole electrode assembly (film/FTO/glass),or at places where the film partially peeled off from the FTO coating (see Fig. S7, ESI for cross-section images of the Co- promoted MoS3 film). The CoMoS3 film is the thickest (400 500 nm), followed by the FeMoS3 (200300 nm) and NiMoS3 (150190 nm) films. The unpromoted MoS3 (100140 nm), Mn MoS3 (100140 nm), CuMoS3 (100150 nm), and ZnMoS3 (100130 nm) films have similar thickness. It should be noted that without a promoter such as Fe, Ni, or Co, the maximum thickness for unpromoted MoS3 film is below 150 nm, regardless the number of scan cycles applied in the electro-deposition.
Composition of MMoS3 films The above data show that MoS3, MnMoS3, CuMoS3, and Zn MoS3 films have similar morphology, thickness, and activity.
This might originate from a lack of promotional effects of Mn, Cu, and Zn ions, or it could be simply due to the fact that these metal ions are not incorporated into the MoS3 films. To verify the latter hypothesis, the ratios of M : Mo were probed using XPS (Table 3). Indeed, only 15% of Mn, Cu, and Zn ions are present in the respective MMoS3 films. On the other hand, the ratios of M : Mo are between 1 : 3 and 1 : 4 for the Fe, Co, and NiMoS3 films.
These results indicate that the electro- polymerization procedures are not efficient in incorporating Mn, Cu, and Zn ions. It was shown earlier that [M(MoS4)2]2 complexes were formed by reactions of MCl2 with [MoS4]2 only when M  Fe, Co, and Ni, but not when M  Mn, Cu or Zn.22 The formation of [M(MoS4)2]2 complexes thus appears to be important for the incorporation of M into the MoS3 films.
In order to determine the bulk composition, the films were dissolved in aqua regia and subjected to ICP-OES measurements.
As the films contained very little material, only Fe, Co, and Ni MoS3 films could be measured within the detection limit of ICP-
OES. The Mo content was about 14 mg cm2 for all these three
films (Table 3). While the Mo content of the MoS3 film could not be measured using this method, earlier work showed that it was about 5 mg cm2 in the thickest film.8 Therefore, Fe, Co, and Ni Fig. 5 Cyclic voltammograms at E  0.10.2 V vs. RHE (top) and scan- rate dependence of the current density at E  0.15 V vs. RHE (bottom) for the CoMoS3 film on FTO in pH  0.

Capacitance measurements The capacitance of the double layer Cdl can be used to estimate the effective surface area (Aeff) of the solidliquid interface,assuming that the two quantities are linearly proportional. Cyclic voltammetry can be used as a simple method to determine the Cdl.27 Thus, CV measurements were carried out on MoS3, Fe MoS3, CoMoS3, and NiMoS3 films, in the region of 0.10.2 V vs. RHE, where the currents are mostly due to the charging of the double layer. The capacitance of the films can be calculated from the scan rate dependence of charging current density at E
0.15 V vs. RHE, where the slope of the DJ vs. scan rate curve is
twice the Cdl.27 Fig. 5 shows the CV responses and scan rate dependence of current densities for the CoMoS3 film. Those of the MoS3, FeMoS3, and NiMoS3 films can be found in Fig. S8S10 (ESI). Table 4 lists the capacitance values for the four films.
The area-averaged capacitance depends on the electrode materials. It is about 20 mF/cm2 for a mercury electrode at the point of zero charge,28 and up to 50 mF/cm2 for carbon mate- rials.29 Due to the similarity of MoS3 and MMoS3 electrodes,the area-averaged capacitance of these electrodes should be similar. This value is not known, so the effective surface area of these electrodes could not be calculated. However, the relative surface areas of these films could be estimated by comparing their overall Cdl (Table 4). It appears that the NiMoS3 film is slightly rougher, and the FeMoS3 and CoMoS3 films have an area that is about three times of that of the MoS3 film. It is interesting to note that the relative surface areas do not correlate with the amount of Mo in the films (compare Tables 3 and 4).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy10,30 (EIS) study is a useful tool to study the electrode kinetics in HER. EIS was carried out on unpromoted and M-promoted (M  Fe, Co, Ni) MoS3 films. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of the EIS response of the CoMoS3 film at various overpotentials at pH
0. The plots for MoS3, Fe, and NiMoS3 films are shown in
Fig. S11 (ESI). In the Nyquist plots of all these films, semicircles were observed at higher overpotentials (h > 100 mV). Only one semicircle is observed in each Nyquist plot, indicating that the equivalent circuit for the electrocatalysis is characterized by one time constant. Thus, there is one unit of resistor and capacitor in parallel. The absence of Warburg impedance indicates that mass- transport is rapid enough so that the reaction is kinetically controlled. The dependence of the phase angle f on the frequency (Bode plot) suggests an additional resistor element in series with the above-mentioned two elements. The similarity among the response of all films suggests a similar mechanism for hydrogen evolution (see also section Tafel Analysis).
Thus, the catalytic system is described by a simple equivalent electrical circuit shown in Fig. 7 A. The EIS data were fitted with this circuit model using the program EIS Spectrum Analyzer.31 Fig. 7 B shows the experimental data and the fitted curve from the EIS response of the CoMoS3 film at h  150 mV. The resistance element R1 is attributed to the uncompensated solu- tion resistance Rs. The resistance element R2 is attributed to the charge transfer resistance Rct. The fitting includes a constant- phase element (CPE) which represents the double-layer capaci- tance under HER conditions C*dl. The impedance of a CPE is ZCPE  Q(ju)n, where Q is a constant representative for the CPE (with the unit of F1 s1n), j is the imaginary unit, u is the frequency, and n is a dimensionless parameter that has a value between zero and unity.32,33 If n equals unity, the CPE behaves as an ideal capacitor. In the present case, n is smaller than 1, indi- cating that the C*dl does not behave as an ideal capacitor.

View Article Online et al. proposed that this type of non-ideality arises from uneven charging of the double layer due to microscopic surface rough- ness.32 The parameter n is lower than 1 when the electrode surface is not perfectly flat, but relatively rough. Tables S1S4 (ESI) list the values for Rs, Rct, Q1 and n for unpromoted and M- promoted MoS3 films (M  Fe, Co, Ni).
With values between 3 and 4 U, the uncompensated solution resistance Rs is low for all films (Table 5). As expected,this resistance is overpotential independent. The charge transfer resistance Rct is related to the kinetics of electrocatalysis, and a lower value corresponds to a faster reaction rate. Rct depends strongly on overpotential (Fig. 8). At h  60 mV, Rct is higher than 15 000 U for all catalysts. However, Rct decreases remark- ably at higher overpotentials. At h  160 mV, Rct falls below 150 U for all catalysts (Table 5).
The capacitance C*dl is obtained using the relation C*dl [Q1$(Rs 1 + Rct 1)n1]1/n.32 The calculated values for C*dl are listed in Tables S1S4 (ESI). The C*dl values determined from EIS are all bigger than the Cdl values determined from CV. This is an indication that the C*dl contains contributions from pseudo-capacitance, probably arising from the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface.29 The EIS data were also fitted using an electrical equivalent circuit with an ideal capacitor instead of a CPE. Fig. S12 (ESI) shows the experimental data and the fitted curve from the EIS response of the CoMoS3 film at h 150 mV. Table S5 (ESI) lists the values for Rs, Rct, and C*ideal (double-layer capacitance, using an ideal capacitor) for the same film. As expected, the capacitance C*ideal is slightly higher than C*dl.32 Hypothesis on the origin of the promotional effects of Fe, Co, and Ni ions SEM, capacitance, and EIS data indicate a significant composi- tion and morphological change when Fe, Co, or Ni is incorpo- rated into the amorphous MoS3 film. Clearly, Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 film, increasing its surface area and catalyst loading. These changes correlate positively with the enhanced catalytic HER activity. The question is then whether these changes are the sole contributors to the improve- ment in activity. The intrinsic activity of this series of catalysts is perhaps best described by their exchange current densities (J0).
Table 6 compares the relative exchange current densities with the relative catalyst loadings and surface areas. There is a poor correlation between the relative amount of Mo and the activity,especially among the promoted films. The Fe, Co, and Ni- promoted films have similar content in Mo, but they have different activity. There is also no clear correlation between the relative surface areas and the activity. Nevertheless, the data in Table 6 show that at pH  0, the increase in HER activity is in Fig. 7 (A) Electrical equivalent circuit used to model the system of all films investigated with EIS.

View Article Online the same magnitude as the increase in surface area or catalyst loading. At pH  7, however, the increase in the activity is significantly higher than the increase in either surface area or catalyst loading. Under these conditions, Fe, Co, and Ni ions seem to increase the intrinsic activity of MoS3.
Similar promotional effects have been found for the hydro- desulfurization (HDS) reaction of natural gas and refined petroleum products,34 where the activity of MoS2 particles is promoted by Co.35,36 The origin of the promotion is illustrated in Fig. 9, using crystalline MoS2 as a model catalyst.35,37 Bulk MoS2 crystals are hexagonal, and exhibit two types of edge sites: Mo (10 10) and S ( 1010) edges. The Mo-edges are partially covered by absorbed sulfur atoms, and are the catalytically active sites. The sulfur edges are not catalytically active. Unpromoted MoS2 nanocrystals have the shape of truncated triangles, and the pre- dominating edges are the Mo-edges. Nevertheless, S-edges are still present. In Co-promoted MoS2 nanocrystals, the incorpo- ration of Co ions leads to a hexagonal morphology. The Co ions are located at the S-edges, and the Co-binding S-edges are now catalytically active. As a result, there are more active sites in the Co-promoted MoS2 nanocrystals, and these catalysts therefore are more active. In other words, the incorporation of Co ions changes both the morphology of MoS2 crystals (from truncated triangle to hexagonal) and the intrinsic activity of MoS2 (turning catalytically inactive sites S-edges into active Co-binding S-edges). The promotional effect of Co on MoS2 nanocrystals was also observed in HER.16 DFT calculations were employed to validate the hypothesis shown in Fig. 9.16 The Gibbs free energy of adsorbed atomic hydrogen, DGH, was used as the descriptor for the catalytic efficiency in HER. A smaller absolute value of DGH, close to zero, shall result in a higher activity, e.g. higher exchange current density. For MoS2 crystals, the DFT-calcu- lated DGH is 0.08 eV for the Mo-edge, and 0.18 eV for S edge.13,16 Thus, HER occurs predominately at the Mo-edge. Incorporation of Co does not affect DGH for the Mo-edge, but lowers the DGH for the S-edge to 0.10 eV.16 The DFT results suggest that the model in Fig. 9 is also valid for HER catalysts.
The MoS3 and MMoS3 films described here are amorphous,not crystalline. However, the origin of the promotional effects of Fe, Ni and Co ions might be analogous to that of crystalline MoS2. There are defect sites in the amorphous materials. These sites can be considered as unsaturated Mo and S sites where HER may take place. The presence of certain promoter ions can enhance the activity of these unsaturated sites, leading to higher intrinsic activity. This type of promotion is significant at pH  7,but not at pH  0. The reason for this is not clear. It might be that at pH  0, HER catalysis is dominated by the activity of the Mo sites. At pH  7, however, the activity of the promoted S sites contribute significantly to the overall catalysis.

View Article Online amount of Mn2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+ ions, could be incorporated into the MoS3 films. The Fe, Ni, and CoMoS3 films exhibit significantly higher HER activity than the previously reported unpromoted MoS3 film. The Mn, Cu, and ZnMoS3 films, on the other hand, show similar or slightly higher activity to the MoS3 film. The most active ternary catalysts were prepared from solutions where the concentration ratios of MCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4] were 1 : 3. The promotional effects exist under both neutral and acidic conditions. Judging from exchange current density, the promotional effect has the order of Co > Ni > Fe. At pH  0, the increase in exchange current density is
4.1, 2.3, and 1.7 fold, respectively, compared to unpromoted
MoS3. However, the increase of the current density at a given overpotential (e.g. 150 or 200 mV) is attenuated due to larger Tafel slopes for Co and NiMoS3 films. Practically speaking,the most active catalyst at pH  0 is FeMoS3 at both h 150 mV (1.9 fold increase over MoS3) and h  200 mV (1.8 fold increase over MoS3). At pH  7, a more significant promotional effect of Fe, Co, and Ni ions are found. The most active catalyst at pH  7 is CoMoS3, which is 9.6 fold more active at h 150 mV and 5.4 fold more active at h  200 mV than unpro- moted MoS3.
SEM, XPS, ICP-OES, and capacitance studies show that the Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the growth of the MoS3 film,increasing its surface area and catalyst loading. These morpho- logical and composition changes result in an enhanced HER catalytic activity. At pH  0, these changes are the main contributors to the promotional effects of Fe, Co, and Ni ions.
At pH  7, the increase in catalyst loading or effective surface area is not enough to account for the increase in the catalytic activity. Under these conditions, the Fe, Co and Ni ions also increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of MoS3. It is possible that these metal ions interact with unsaturated sulfur atoms in MoS3,thereby enhancing its activity toward HER.
Due to their amorphous nature, the MMoS3 films contain many defect sites, which may out-number the available edge sites in well-defined MoS2 nanocrystals. As a result, the amor- phous films exhibit higher activity than crystalline nanoparticles.
For example, according to polarization measurements, the Co MoS3 film gives a current density of ca. 18 mA cm2 at h  200 mV and pH  0. The corresponding CoMoS2 nanoparticles on carbon give a current density of ca. 1 mA cm2 at h  300 mV and pH  0.16 Thanks to their ease of synthesis, low cost, and high activity, the promoted amorphous MoS3 films and their analogues appear to be promising HER catalysts for photo- electrochemical water splitting. This application is being inves- tigated in our lab.

Experimental section Chemicals and reagents All manipulations were carried out under an inert N2(g) atmo- sphere using glovebox techniques unless otherwise mentioned.
Iron(II) chloride was prepared by dissolving pure iron metal in a solution of 4.0 M HCl under nitrogen. The excess acid was removed by vacuum and the solid was transferred and stored in a glovebox. Unless noted, all other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification.
Physical methods SEM secondary electron (SE) images were taken on a Philips (FEI) XLF-30 FEG scanning electron microscope. The distances in SEM images were measured with the program ImageJ.38 Electrochemical measurements were recorded by an IviumStat electrochemical analyzer. A three-electrode configuration was used. For polarization and EIS measurements, a platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl (KCl satu- rated) electrode was used as the reference electrode. The refer- ence electrode was placed in a position very close to the working electrode with the aid of a Luggin tube. As shown previously,platinum contamination of the working electrode can be ruled out.8,12 1.0 M H2SO4 (pH  0) or a standard phosphate buffer from Metrohm (pH  7), respectively, were used as electrolyte solutions. Double layer capacitance of the films was obtained by cyclic voltammetry experiments in the potential range of 0.100 to
0.200 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M H2SO4. Scan rates from 20 to 200 mV
s1 were chosen. The total current obtained from the addition of the absolute values in the cathodic and anodic wave at 0.150 V vs.
RHE was plot against the scan rate. The slope of the curve obtained is twice the value of the double layer capacitance. The parameters of the EIS experiments were fixed for all measure- ments: 100 points were recorded in the frequency range between
0.1 and 106 Hz (14 points per decade) with the amplitude of the
sinusoidal perturbation fixed at 30 mV. Potentials from 50 to 250 mV vs. RHE were applied, with steps of 10 mV. A pre- treatment was performed at 0 V vs. RHE for 20 s before each experiment and an equilibration time of 5 s was set at the respective potential in order to stabilize the system before the measurement. Experimental EIS data were analyzed and fitted with the software EIS Spectrum Analyzer.31 The values obtained at the frequency 11.23 Hz were not integrated in the Bode plots,because they deviated largely, probably due to an electronic error. For Tafel analysis, polarization curves were measured at pH  0 with a scan rate of 1 mV s1. Auxiliary, reference elec- trode and working electrode were in the same compartment. The logarithm of the absolute current density of the resulting polar- ization curve was plotted as a function of overpotential. Tafel analysis was made on the portion of data that showed linear behavior. Therefore, the range of overpotential taken for Tafel analysis varied slightly between different samples. In case of electrochemical film deposition, a fresh titanium wire was used as the auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl (NaCl saturated) elec- trode was used as the reference electrode. Potentials were refer- enced to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by adding a value of (0.197 + 0.059 pH) V. The polarization curves measured under one atmosphere of H2 are nearly identical to those collected in the absence of external H2, indicating that the potentials measured in the latter experiments are close to the thermody- namically-calibrated values. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected by Axis Ultra (Kratos analytical, Manchester, UK) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<108 Torr), using a monochromatic Al Ka X-ray source (1486.6 eV), in the Surface Analysis Laboratory of CIME at EPFL. The source power was maintained at 150 W (10 mA, 15kV). Gold (Au 4f7/2) and copper (Cu 2p3/2) lines at 84.0 and 932.6 eV, respectively,were used for calibration, and the adventitious carbon 1s peak at 285 eV as an internal standard to compensate for any charging This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Chem.

For quantification, relative sensitivity factors from the supplier were used. ICP-OES analysis was performed with an Optima 2000 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). The metal contents were determined using the intensity of the following emission lines: Mo - 203.845; Fe - 239.562; Co - 238.892; Ni - 221.648.Metal standards TraceCERT were purchased from Aldrich and were used for calibration.Film deposition The films were deposited on two different types of electrodes: FTO-coated glass plates 15 U/sq) and glassy carbon disk elec- trodes (ALS). The glassy carbon disk electrodes were polished with two different Alpha alumina powder (1.0 and 0.3 micron from CH Instruments) suspended in distilled water on a Nylon polishing pad (CH Instruments) and with Gamma alumina powder (0.05 micron from CH Instruments) suspended in distilled water on a Microcloth polishing pad (CH Instruments). Before going to the next smaller powder size and at the end of polishing,the electrodes were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water. FTO- coated glass was cut down to rectangular plates of 9  25 mm.The plates were thoroughly cleaned and washed with ethanol. An adhesive tape with a hole of 5 mm diameter was attached on each plate in such a way that a circle of 5 mm diameter in the bottom part and a small strip at the top of the plate remained uncovered.The film will be deposited in the area of the circle only and the uncovered strip serves as electrical contact.In a typical procedure, 2 mL of an aqueous solution of MCl2 (2.67 mM; M  Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) in 0.1 M NaClO4 was added dropwise and under stirring to 6 mL of an aqueous solution of (NH4)2MoS4 (2.67 mM) in 0.1 M NaClO4.
