[1] "Fe, Co, and Ni ions promote the catalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films for hydrogen evolution"
[2] "The promotional effects of Fe, Co, and Ni ions exist under both acidic and neutral conditions, but the effects are more pronounced under neutral conditions."
[3] "The most active ternary catalysts were prepared from solutions where the concentration ratios of MCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4] were 1 : 3."
[4] "The increase in catalyst loading or effective surface area is not enough to account for the increase in the catalytic activity. Under these conditions, the Fe, Co and Ni ions also increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of MoS3."

1. Iron, cobalt, and nickel ions enhance the catalytic performance of amorphous molybdenum sulfide films in hydrogen evolution.
2. The promotion of Fe, Co, and Ni ions is more noticeable under neutral conditions.
3. The most effective ternary catalysts were synthesized using a concentration ratio of 1:3 for MCl2 and (NH4)2[MoS4].
4. The rise in catalyst loading or effective surface area is insufficient to explain the increase in catalytic activity. Under neutral conditions, Fe, Co, and Ni ions also elevate the intrinsic catalytic activity of MoS3.

1. 铁、钴和镍离子可以促进莫桑比克硫化物薄膜在氢气生成中的催化活性。
2. 在中性条件下，Fe、Co和Ni离子的促进效果更为显著。
3. 最有效的三元催化剂是在MCl2和(NH4)2[MoS4]浓度比为1:3的情况下合成的。
4. 催化剂负载或有效表面积的增加不足以解释催化活性的提升。在中性条件下，Fe、Co和Ni离子还能提高MoS3的内在催化活性。
