<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Photocatalyst materials, particularly oxides with metal cations in d0 and d10 configurations, metal (oxy)sulfides, and metal (oxy)nitrides, have been extensively studied due to their potential in water splitting into H2 and O2, or their role in evolving H2 or O2 from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents. These materials offer crucial insights into factors influencing photocatalytic performance and guide the development of novel catalyst designs.
