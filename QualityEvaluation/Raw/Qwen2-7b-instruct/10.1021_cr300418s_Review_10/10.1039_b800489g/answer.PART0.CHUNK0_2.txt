The diversity of properties among niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influences their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties affect the electronic structure, reactivity, and stability of the catalysts. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations often arise due to the complexity of the interactions between the dopants and the host material, as well as the intricate mechanisms involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
