The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned,based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species.

The distribution of isotopic exchange products depends on the relative rates of the dissociation, incorporation, and diffusion steps. Hence, a faster incorporation reaction and subsequent diffusion results in 16O2 as the dominant product. In contrast,faster dissociation of oxygen compared with oxygen incorpo- ration leads to formation of 16O18O.

Ethylene oxidation was best fitted assuming a reaction order of 2 with respect to the concentration of oxidized sites (reaction 3 in Table 3) and a 0.5-order rate equation with respect to oxygen in the reoxidation of reduced sites (reaction 5 in Table 3).

The estimated parameters for a certain kinetic model can also be evaluated by analyzing the conditional joint parameter likelihood regions, as suggested previously [50,51].

The estimated kinetic parameters, with the 95% confidence intervals, obtained for the MVc2 model are tabulated in Table 5.
