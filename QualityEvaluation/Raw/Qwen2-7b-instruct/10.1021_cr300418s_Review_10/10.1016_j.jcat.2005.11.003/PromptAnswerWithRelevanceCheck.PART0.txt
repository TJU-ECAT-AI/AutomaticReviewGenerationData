The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned,based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species.

The distribution of isotopic exchange products depends on the relative rates of the dissociation, incorporation, and diffusion steps. Hence, a faster incorporation reaction and subsequent diffusion results in 16O2 as the dominant product. In contrast,faster dissociation of oxygen compared with oxygen incorpo- ration leads to formation of 16O18O.

Ethylene oxidation was best fitted assuming a reaction order of 2 with respect to the concentration of oxidized sites (reaction 3 in Table 3) and a 0.5-order rate equation with respect to oxygen in the reoxidation of reduced sites (reaction 5 in Table 3).

The estimated parameters for a certain kinetic model can also be evaluated by analyzing the conditional joint parameter likelihood regions, as suggested previously [50,51].

The estimated kinetic parameters, with the 95% confidence intervals, obtained for the MVc2 model are tabulated in Table 5.

[1] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

1.Niobium doping in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation leads to a decrease in activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species that are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

2.The ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on both NiO and Nb-doped NiO catalysts follows a Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism involving the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the methods for replenishing surface oxygen differ between the two catalysts, resulting in distinct oxygen species on their surfaces and influencing the product distribution.

3.On pure NiO, oxygen replenishment happens quickly through the dissociation of gaseous oxygen on cation vacancies, followed by slower incorporation and diffusion, which results in a high concentration of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface.

4.Niobium doping fills the cationic vacancies, reducing the number of active sites available for oxygen dissociation. This makes diffusion the fast step of the process, leading to the presence of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst.

5.These nucleophilic oxygen species, which are selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the surface of the Nb-doped NiO catalyst.

6.Kinetic modeling of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO catalysts reveals that the process occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, involving two types of active sites: type I sites responsible for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II sites active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

1.Niobium doping decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, leading to reduced total oxidation of ethane to CO2. It eliminates nonstoichiometric active oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation.

2.Niobium doping changes the oxygen exchange kinetics, making diffusion the fast step instead of dissociation. This results in less active oxygen species and different product distributions in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

3.Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst follows a MVK mechanism involving the participation of catalyst oxygen. The reaction proceeds via a redox parallel-consecutive pathway, involving two types of active sites: type I for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

The doping of NiO with niobium leads to a reduction in the activation energy and the exchange rate of labeled oxygen. This is indicative of the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species that are responsible for the complete oxidation of ethane to CO2. By filling the cationic vacancies, niobium reduces the number of active sites available for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step of the process. Consequently, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, which are selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the surface of the catalyst. These oxygen species are associated with two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethylene overoxidation reactions, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

掺杂到NiO中的铌导致标记氧的活化能和交换速率显著降低，这表明非化学计量的电亲性活性氧物种已被消除，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化为CO2。通过填充阳离子空位，铌减少了可用于解离的活性位点的数量，使得扩散成为过程的快速步骤。因此，在催化剂表面上存在大量的牢固结合、相对不活泼的亲核氧物种，这些物种对将乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。这些氧物种与两种类型的活性位点相关联：I型位点，负责乙烷氧化脱氢和乙炔过氧化反应；II型位点，用于直接氧化乙烷至CO2。
