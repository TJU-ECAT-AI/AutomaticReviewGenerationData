[1] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."
[2] "The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a MVK mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction."
[3] "On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface."
[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process."
[5] "Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."
[6] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

1.Niobium doping in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation leads to a decrease in activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species that are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

2.The ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on both NiO and Nb-doped NiO catalysts follows a Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism involving the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the methods for replenishing surface oxygen differ between the two catalysts, resulting in distinct oxygen species on their surfaces and influencing the product distribution.

3.On pure NiO, oxygen replenishment happens quickly through the dissociation of gaseous oxygen on cation vacancies, followed by slower incorporation and diffusion, which results in a high concentration of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface.

4.Niobium doping fills the cationic vacancies, reducing the number of active sites available for oxygen dissociation. This makes diffusion the fast step of the process, leading to the presence of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst.

5.These nucleophilic oxygen species, which are selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the surface of the Nb-doped NiO catalyst.

6.Kinetic modeling of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO catalysts reveals that the process occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, involving two types of active sites: type I sites responsible for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II sites active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

1.铌掺杂在NiO催化剂中的乙烷氧化脱氢反应导致标记氧的活化能和交换速率显著降低，表明非化学计量的电负性活性氧物种被消除，这些物种负责乙烷到二氧化碳的完全氧化。

2.乙烷氧化脱氢反应在NiO和铌掺杂NiO两种氧化物上都遵循马斯万克列恩（MVK）机制，涉及催化剂氧的参与。然而，两种催化剂表面氧补充途径的不同导致它们表面具有不同氧物种，并影响产物分布。

3.在纯NiO中，氧补充快速发生在阳离子空位上的气体氧分解后，随后是较慢的整合和扩散，这导致表面高浓度的电负性氧物种。

4.铌掺杂填充阳离子空位，减少了可用于氧分解的活性位点数量。这使得扩散成为过程的快步骤，导致表面存在强键合、较不活泼的亲核氧物种。

5.这些亲核氧物种对乙烷到乙烯的转换具有选择性，在铌掺杂NiO催化剂的表面大量存在。

6.铌/NiO催化剂上的乙烷氧化脱氢反应的动态模型显示，该过程通过一个红移并联连续反应网络发生，涉及两种活性位点：负责乙烷氧化脱氢和乙稀过氧化的类型I位点，以及直接氧化乙烷到二氧化碳的类型II位点。
