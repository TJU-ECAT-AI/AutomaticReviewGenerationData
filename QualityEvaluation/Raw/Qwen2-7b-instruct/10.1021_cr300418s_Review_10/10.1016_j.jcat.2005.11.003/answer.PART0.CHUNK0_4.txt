Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.
Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation,thus making diffusion the fast step of the process.
Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2 species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric Ospecies remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium.

The doping of NiO with niobium leads to a reduction in the activation energy and the exchange rate of labeled oxygen. This is indicative of the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species that are responsible for the complete oxidation of ethane to CO2. By filling the cationic vacancies, niobium reduces the number of active sites available for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step of the process. Consequently, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, which are selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the surface of the catalyst. These oxygen species are associated with two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethylene overoxidation reactions, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

掺杂到NiO中的铌导致标记氧的活化能和交换速率显著降低，这表明非化学计量的电亲性活性氧物种已被消除，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化为CO2。通过填充阳离子空位，铌减少了可用于解离的活性位点的数量，使得扩散成为过程的快速步骤。因此，在催化剂表面上存在大量的牢固结合、相对不活泼的亲核氧物种，这些物种对将乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。这些氧物种与两种类型的活性位点相关联：I型位点，负责乙烷氧化脱氢和乙炔过氧化反应；II型位点，用于直接氧化乙烷至CO2。
