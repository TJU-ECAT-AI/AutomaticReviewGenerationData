[1] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."
[2] "The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a MVK mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction."
[3] "On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation,thus making diffusion the fast step of the process."
[4] "Finally, a kinetic model able to successfully predict the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst in considerably different experimental conditions than the kinetic experiments, was developed."
[5] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

1.Niobium doping significantly reduces the activation energy and oxygen exchange rate, eliminating nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species that cause ethane total oxidation to CO2.
2.The ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via a MVK mechanism on both materials, but the different routes for oxygen replenishment lead to distinct oxygen species and product distributions.
3.On NiO, oxygen is replenished quickly by dissociation on cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, creating high concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species. Niobium reduces active sites for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step.
4.A kinetic model accurately predicts the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst under varied experimental conditions.
5.Kinetic modeling reveals that ethane oxidative dehydrogenation on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving two types of active sites: those responsible for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and those active for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

1.铌掺杂显著降低了激活能和标记氧的交换速率，消除了导致乙烷全氧化为CO2的非等计量电负性活性氧物种。
2.在两种氧化物上，乙烷氧化脱氢反应通过MVK机制进行，但不同的氧补充途径导致表面不同氧物种的存在，并进而产生不同的产物分布。
3.在NiO上，氧气通过快速的离子空位上的解离以及较慢的整合和扩散来补充，产生了高浓度的电负性氧物种。铌填充了离子空位并减少了用于解离的活性位点，从而使扩散成为快速步骤。
4.开发了一种能够准确预测Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂在广泛实验条件下的催化性能的热力学模型。
5.热力学建模揭示了NiO上乙烷氧化脱氢通过红ox平行连续反应网络进行，涉及两种活性位点：负责乙烷氧化脱氢和乙烯过氧化反应的位点，以及直接负责乙烷氧化为CO2的位点。
