[1] "Doping with Nb possibly reduces the active sites available for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step of the process, leading to a lower exchange rate and production of larger amounts of doubly exchanged species."

[2] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a MVK mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2 species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric Ospecies remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

1.Niobium doping decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, leading to reduced total oxidation of ethane to CO2. It eliminates nonstoichiometric active oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation.

2.Niobium doping changes the oxygen exchange kinetics, making diffusion the fast step instead of dissociation. This results in less active oxygen species and different product distributions in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

3.Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst follows a MVK mechanism involving the participation of catalyst oxygen. The reaction proceeds via a redox parallel-consecutive pathway, involving two types of active sites: type I for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

4.Type I sites are associated with strongly bonded lattice O2 species, while type II sites are related to the residual nonstoichiometric Ospecies on the surface after niobium incorporation.

1.铌掺杂降低激活能和氧交换速率，导致乙烷完全氧化到二氧化碳减少。它消除了负责完全氧化乙烷到二氧化碳的非等量活性氧物种。

2.铌掺杂改变了氧交换动力学，使扩散成为快步骤而不是解离。这导致更少的活性氧物种和不同的产品分布于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。

3.乙烷氧化脱氢在Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂上的反应遵循MVK机制，涉及催化剂氧的参与。该反应通过一个还原性平行连续途径进行，涉及两种活性位点：I型用于乙烷氧化脱氢和乙烯过氧化，II型用于直接乙烷氧化到CO2。

4.I型位点与紧密结合的晶格O2物种相关联，而II型位点与掺入铌后表面剩余的非等量O物种有关。
