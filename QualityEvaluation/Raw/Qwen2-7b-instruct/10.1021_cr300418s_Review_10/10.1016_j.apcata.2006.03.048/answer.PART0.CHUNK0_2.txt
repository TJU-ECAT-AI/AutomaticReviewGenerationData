[A] "Reducibility of the perovskites was studied by means of the oxygen release capacity measurement in which a TAP reactor system was used to perform the CO pulse or alternate COO2 pulse experiments."
[B] "An incorporation of Pd in replacement of 5 mol% of Fe into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d caused a significant decrease of reduction temperature and an enhancement of reducibility."
[C] "It was found that the reducibility was strongly affected by the calcination temperatures."
[D] "We therefore concluded that the defects of perovskite structure were most important while the surface area played a less pronounced role on the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d."

1. The oxygen release capacity measurement using a TAP reactor system was utilized to assess the reducibility of the perovskites through CO pulse or alternate COO2 pulse experiments.
2. Incorporating Palladium (Pd) in place of 5 mol% of Iron (Fe) into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d resulted in a notable decrease in reduction temperature and enhancement of reducibility.
3. The reducibility of the perovskites was significantly influenced by the calcination temperatures.
4. The defects within the perovskite structure were identified as the most critical factor affecting the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, whereas the surface area played a less dominant role.

1. 使用TAP反应器系统进行CO脉冲或交替COO2脉冲实验，通过氧气释放容量测量方法研究了掺杂剂的可还原性。
2. 将钯（Pd）取代铁（Fe）的5摩尔%放入La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d中导致了降低的还原温度和增强的可还原性。
3. 掺杂剂的还原性受到煅烧温度的显著影响。
4. 对于La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d而言，缺陷在决定其可还原性方面起着最关键的作用，而表面积的作用则相对较小。
