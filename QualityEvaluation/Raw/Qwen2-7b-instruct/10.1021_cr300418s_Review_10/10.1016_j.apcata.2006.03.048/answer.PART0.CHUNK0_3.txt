[A] "The partial substitution of La by Sr enhanced the red- ucibility of La1xSrxFeO3d. Among La1xSrxFeO3d, La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d with pure perovskite crystalline structure exhibited the highest OSC at 500 8C."
[B] "The substitution of Pd for Fe in La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d improved reducibility and thermal stability."
[C] "The calcination temperatures strongly affected the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95 Pd0.05O3d. The highest reducibility was observed on La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 1000 8C although the calcination at this temperature caused aggregation of perovskite particles and resulted in a very low surface area."

1. The substitution of Sr for La in La1xSrxFeO3d increased the reducibility, and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d demonstrated the highest oxygen storage capacity (OSC) at 500 °C among the samples tested. 
2. Replacing Fe with Pd in La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d led to improvements in both reducibility and thermal stability. The presence of Pd caused a reduction in the activation energy for the reduction process.
3. The reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d was significantly influenced by the calcination temperature. The highest reducibility was achieved with La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d after being calcined at 1000 °C, despite the formation of aggregated particles and a low surface area.

1. 将La部分替换为Sr增强了La1xSrxFeO3d的可还原性。在La1xSrxFeO3d中，La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d具有纯层状结构，在500°C时表现出最高的氧存储容量(OSC)。
2. 在La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d中用Pd替代Fe提高了可还原性和热稳定性。Pd的存在降低了还原过程的活化能。
3. La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d和La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d的可还原性受到煅烧温度的影响。在1000°C下煅烧后，La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d表现出最高的可还原性，尽管形成了聚集颗粒并导致了较低的比表面积。
