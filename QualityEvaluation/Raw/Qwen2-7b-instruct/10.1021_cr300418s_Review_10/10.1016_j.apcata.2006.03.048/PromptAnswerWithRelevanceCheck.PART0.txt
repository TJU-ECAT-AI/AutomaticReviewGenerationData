<p>In order to obtain useful information about the effect of Sr, Pd promotion and calcination temperature on the reducibility of La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d perovskites, CO-TAP in combination with XRD, BET, TG-DTA, and SEM were employed to characterise the perovskite oxides prepared by the method of solgel auto-combustion.</p>

<p>An incorporation of Pd in replacement of 5 mol% of Fe into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d caused a significant decrease of reduction temperature and an enhancement of reducibility.</p>
<p>It was found that the reducibility was strongly affected by the calcination temperatures.</p>
<p>Extremely high reducibility (ca. 650 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSC and ca. 800 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSCC) was observed on the 1000 8C calcined La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d although its BET specific surface area was very low.</p>
<p>We concluded that calcination of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d at relatively high temperatures was favourable of creating more lattice defects and the lattice defects instead of surface area were mainly responsible for the reducibility.</p>

1. The study aimed to understand how strontium (Sr), palladium (Pd) addition, and calcination temperature impact the reducibility of La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d perovskites. Techniques like CO-Time-Resolved Product Analysis (CO-TAP), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG), and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) were utilized to characterize the perovskite oxides synthesized via the solgel auto-combustion method. 

2. The reducibility of the perovskites was assessed through oxygen release capacity measurements using a CO-TAP reactor system, which enabled CO pulse or alternating COO2 pulse experiments.

3. Substituting lanthanum (La) with strontium (Sr) in LaFeO3 notably increased the reducibility, with La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d demonstrating the highest reducibility among the La1xSrxFeO3d perovskites.

4. Incorporating palladium (Pd) into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d by replacing 5 mol% of iron (Fe) led to a significant reduction in the reduction temperature and an enhancement of reducibility.

5. The reducibility was significantly influenced by the calcination temperatures.

6. Remarkably high reducibility (around 650 mmol-CO2 g1 of Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC) and around 800 mmol-CO2 g1 of Oxygen Storage Complete Capacity (OSCC)) was observed on the 1000°C calcined La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, despite its low BET specific surface area.

7. It was concluded that the high temperature calcination of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d favored the creation of more lattice defects, which were primarily responsible for the enhanced reducibility, rather than surface area.

1. 研究旨在理解Sr、Pd添加和煅烧温度对La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d钙钛矿的还原性的影响。使用了包括CO-TAP时间分辨产品分析（CO-TAP）、X射线衍射（XRD）、布拉斯—埃米特—泰勒（BET）表面积测量、热重分析（TG）和差示热分析（DTA）在内的技术来表征通过溶胶自动燃烧法合成的钙钛矿氧化物。

2. 通过CO-TAP反应系统进行CO脉冲或交替COO2脉冲实验，评估了钙钛矿的还原性通过氧气释放能力测量。

3. 在LaFeO3中用Sr部分替换La显著增强了钙钛矿的还原性，La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d在La1xSrxFeO3d钙钛矿中显示出最高还原性。

4. 将Pd部分替代La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d中的Fe（5摩尔%）导致了降低的还原温度和增强的还原性。

5. 煅烧温度强烈影响了La1xSrxFeO3d的还原性。

6. 对于在1000°C煅烧的La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d，尽管其BET特定表面积非常低，但观察到了极高的还原性（约650 mmol-CO2 g1的氧气存储容量(OSC)和约800 mmol-CO2 g1的氧气完全存储容量(OSCC)）。

7. 结论是，La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d的高温度煅烧有利于产生更多晶格缺陷，这些晶格缺陷而不是表面积主要负责增强的还原性。

The diverse properties of perovskites, particularly their ability to form high temperature oxide phases, influence their behavior as dopants in catalysts like La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d. Higher calcination temperatures enhance the formation of perovskite structure, leading to increased reducibility. Defects within the perovskite structure are deemed more crucial for high reducibility than the surface area. The surface area plays a less significant role compared to the presence of defects in determining the reducibility of these materials.
