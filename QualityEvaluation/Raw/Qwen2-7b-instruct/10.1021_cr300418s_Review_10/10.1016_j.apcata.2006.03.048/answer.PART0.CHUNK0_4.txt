[A] "Perovskites are essentially high temperature oxide phases."
[B] "In the temperature range 5001000 8C, the higher the calcination temperature, the more completely the perovskite forms of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, and the higher the reducibility was."
[C] "The reason is that perovskites are essentially high temperature oxide phase."
[D] "We therefore concluded that the defects of perovskite structure were most important while the surface area played a less pronounced role on the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d."

The diverse properties of perovskites, particularly their ability to form high temperature oxide phases, influence their behavior as dopants in catalysts like La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d. Higher calcination temperatures enhance the formation of perovskite structure, leading to increased reducibility. Defects within the perovskite structure are deemed more crucial for high reducibility than the surface area. The surface area plays a less significant role compared to the presence of defects in determining the reducibility of these materials.
