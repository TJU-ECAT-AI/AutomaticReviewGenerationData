[A] "Reducibility of the perovskites was studied by means of the oxygen release capacity measurement in which a TAP reactor system was used to perform the CO pulse or alternate COO2 pulse experiments."
[B] "The highest OSC value was observed on La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d."
[C] "The incorporation of Pd in replacement of 5 mol% of Fe into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d caused a significant decrease of reduction temperature and an enhancement of reducibility."
[D] "We therefore concluded that the defects of perovskite structure were most important while the surface area played a less pronounced role on the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d."

1. The reducibility of the perovskites was assessed through measuring the oxygen release capacity using a TAP reactor system, involving CO pulse or alternate COO2 pulse experiments.
2. Among the samples, La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d showed the highest OSC value.
3. Incorporating 5 mol% of Pd into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d resulted in a notable decrease in the reduction temperature and an improvement in reducibility.
4. We concluded that the defects within the perovskite structure were of paramount importance, whereas the surface area played a less significant role in determining the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d.

1. 对于这些钙钛矿，通过使用TAP反应器系统进行CO脉冲或交替COO2脉冲实验来测量氧释放能力来评估其可还原性。
2. 其中，La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d显示出最高的OSC值。
3. 在La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d中加入5摩尔%的Pd导致了降低的还原温度和增强的可还原性。
4. 我们得出结论，钙钛矿结构中的缺陷最为重要，而表面积在确定La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d的可还原性时扮演的角色较小。
