<p>The Self-regenerative Intelligent Catalyst for Automotive Emissions Control</p>
<p>Co-free LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst with the self-regenerative function of Pd was developed.</p>
<p>This technology was named the intelligent catalyst.</p>
<p>Suppression capacity for Pd particle growth and catalytic activity of the Co-free perovskite LaFePdO3 were compared with those of LaFeCoPdO3.</p>
<p>Pd particles on LaFePdO3 maintained a nano-particle size by the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C.</p>
<p>Further, the design configuration for LaFePdO3 in the washcoat was investigated to maximize the self-regenerative function under practical conditions.</p>
<p>LaFePdO3 showed the fastest light-off performance of all samples.</p>
<p>Even though the precious metal loading of the intelligent catalyst is lower than that of the conventional one, the intelligent catalyst reduced the amount of cold HC emissions by 23% compared to the conventional catalyst even after aging at 1050C for 40 h.</p>
<p>We confirmed that the improved intelligent catalyst could function well under actual conditions, and note that the intelligent catalyst gave an excellent light-off performance.</p>
