<p>The Self-regenerative Intelligent Catalyst for Automotive Emissions Control</p>
<p>A Co-free Pd-perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, catalyst was found to demonstrate excellent light off performance and suppression of the particle growth of Pd even after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C for 100 h.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that Pd particles on LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 maintained the small size of 1 nm or less in diameter by the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation.</p>
<p>This practical intelligent catalyst, designed to maximize its self-regenerative function, maintained excellent catalytic activity even after accelerated aging reaching up to 1050 C.</p>
<p>The intelligent catalyst was successfully adapted for practical use, meeting the Japan SU-LEV, as well as U-LEV standards while using much less precious metals than conventional catalysts prepared without a self-regenerative function.</p>

1. 含有0.95份La、0.05份Pd的Co-free Pd-perovskite催化剂在900°C的发动机排气气体中老化100小时后，仍表现出卓越的点火性能和Pd颗粒生长的抑制。
2. XAFS分析和TEM观察证实，LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3上的Pd颗粒即使经过老化也保持在1nm或更小的微小尺寸。
3. 这种旨在实现自我再生功能最大化的智能催化剂，在高达1050°C的加速老化过程中仍能保持高催化活性。
4. 这种智能催化剂成功满足了日本SU-LEV和U-LEV标准，使用了远少于传统没有自再生功能的催化剂所需的贵金属。
