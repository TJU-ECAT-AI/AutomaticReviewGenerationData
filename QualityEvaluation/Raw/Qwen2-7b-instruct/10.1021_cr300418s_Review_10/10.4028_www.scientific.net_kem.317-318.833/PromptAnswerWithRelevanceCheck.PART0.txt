[1] "Suppression capacity for Pd particle growth and catalytic activity of the Co-free perovskite LaFePdO3 were compared with those of LaFeCoPdO3."
[2] "It was confirmed that Pd particles on LaFePdO3 maintained a nano-particle size by the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C."
[3] "Further, the design configuration for LaFePdO3 in the washcoat was investigated to maximize the self-regenerative function under practical conditions."
[4] "This practical intelligent catalyst, designed to maximize its self-regenerative function, maintained excellent catalytic activity even after accelerated aging reaching up to 1050 C."
</quotes>

Answer: The Co-free perovskite LaFePdO3 catalyst demonstrated superior capabilities in suppressing Pd particle growth and maintaining catalytic activity compared to the LaFeCoPdO3 counterpart. After aging in engine exhaust gas at 900°C for 100 hours, the Pd particles on LaFePdO3 remained in a nanoscale size, as evidenced by XAFS analysis and TEM observation. This unique property was crucial in designing the catalyst's washcoat configuration to optimize its self-regenerative function, ensuring its performance even under accelerated aging conditions up to 1050°C. Consequently, this intelligent catalyst was effectively adapted for practical use, meeting the Japan SU-LEV and U-LEV standards while significantly reducing the reliance on precious metals compared to conventional catalysts lacking self-regenerative functionality.

该无钴钙钛矿型LaFePdO3催化剂在抑制钯颗粒生长和保持催化活性方面表现出优于LaFeCoPdO3的性能。在900°C的发动机排气气体中老化100小时后，LaFePdO3上的钯颗粒保持在纳米级大小，这通过XAFS分析和TEM观察得到了证实。这种独特的性质对于设计催化剂的涂层配置至关重要，以优化其自再生功能，并确保其在加速老化条件下（最高达1050°C）的性能。因此，这种智能催化剂成功地适应了实际使用，符合日本SU-LEV和U-LEV标准，同时显著减少了与没有自再生功能的传统催化剂相比对贵金属的依赖。
