[1] "In order to prevent this excess use of precious metals, we have been developing a LaFeCoPdO3 perovskite catalyst so as to maximize a function whereby catalysts can regenerate themselves during the lifetime of a vehicle without any auxiliary treatment. This technology was named the intelligent catalyst."
[2] "It was confirmed that Pd particles on LaFePdO3 maintained a nano-particle size by the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C, and LaFePdO3 demonstrated an excellent light-off performance."
[3] "This practical intelligent catalyst, designed to maximize its self-regenerative function, maintained excellent catalytic activity even after accelerated aging reaching up to 1050 C."
[4] "The intelligent catalyst was successfully adapted for practical use, meeting the Japan SU-LEV, as well as U-LEV standards while using much less precious metals than conventional catalysts prepared without a self-regenerative function."

The Co-free LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst with self-regenerative function of Pd, named the intelligent catalyst, was developed to reduce the excess use of precious metals. The catalyst maintained nano-sized Pd particles and demonstrated excellent light-off performance even after aging at 900°C for 100 hours. After aging at 1,050°C for 40 hours, the intelligent catalyst maintained its excellent catalytic activity. This intelligent catalyst was successfully adapted for practical use, meeting the Japan SU-LEV and U-LEV standards while using much less precious metals compared to conventional catalysts without a self-regenerative function.

无Co的LaFePdO3钙钛矿催化剂，具有Pd的自再生功能，被称为智能催化剂，被开发以减少贵金属的过度使用。该催化剂保持了纳米级的Pd颗粒，并在900°C老化100小时后显示出出色的点火性能。即使在1050°C加速老化40小时后，智能催化剂也保持了其出色的催化活性。这种智能催化剂成功地应用于实际使用中，符合日本SU-LEV和U-LEV标准，同时使用的贵金属比没有自再生功能的传统催化剂少得多。
