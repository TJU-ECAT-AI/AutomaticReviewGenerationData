The study found that the Co-free perovskite catalyst LaFePdO3 exhibited superior resistance to Pd particle growth compared to LaFeCoPdO3. After aging in engine exhaust gas at 900°C, Pd particles on LaFePdO3 remained at a nanoscale size, maintaining its catalytic activity. The practical design of LaFePdO3 in the washcoat maximized its self-regenerative function. Furthermore, LaFePdO3 showed the fastest light-off performance among all samples tested. Even after accelerated aging up to 1050°C, the intelligent catalyst met the Japan SU-LEV and U-LEV standards with significantly reduced precious metal usage.

研究发现，无Co的钙钛矿催化剂LaFePdO3在与LaFeCoPdO3相比时，在发动机排气气体中于900°C老化后，Pd颗粒在LaFePdO3上保持纳米级尺寸，显示出了优越的抗Pd颗粒生长性能。其催化活性得到了保持。在实际应用条件下，LaFePdO3的设计最大化了其自再生功能。此外，LaFePdO3表现出所有测试样品中最快的光熄灭性能。即使经过加速老化达到1050°C，这种智能催化剂也符合日本SU-LEV和U-LEV标准，并且使用了大量的稀有金属。
