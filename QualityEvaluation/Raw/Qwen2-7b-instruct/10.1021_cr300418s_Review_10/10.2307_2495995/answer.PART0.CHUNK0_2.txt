The Soviet Russian State and The Soviet State: An Aging Revolution are textbooks authored by Robert G. Wesson. The Soviet Russian State is designed for undergraduate courses on Soviet politics, while The Soviet State is a more concise version suitable for introductory comparative government courses. These books offer balanced coverage of various aspects of the Soviet system with commendable depth, but they also expose the hypocrisy of the Soviet state.
