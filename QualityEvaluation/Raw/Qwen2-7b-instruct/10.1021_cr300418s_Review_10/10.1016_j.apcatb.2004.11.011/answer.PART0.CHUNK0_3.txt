[1] "In order to elucidate the superior start-up activity of LaFePdOx catalysts in practical automotive emission control, the redox property of Pd species in a Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 8C using X-ray spectroscopic techniques."
[2] "At temperatures higher than 100 8C, reductive segregation of Pd0 begins near the surface of catalysts. At temperatures higher than 200 8C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+."
[3] "The surface Pd2+ partially dissolves into the Perovskite-type LaFeOx framework to occupy the B-site."
[4] "Owing to the easy reducibility of the catalyst, the fine Pd0 deposits at the surface can be regenerated in the redox fluctuation of automotive exhaust even at low temperatures."
[5] "This surface Pd0 plays a key role in the start-up activity of practical automobile emission control and promises the minimization of Pd usage."

The redox property of palladium (Pd) species in Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts was investigated at various temperatures between 100 to 400°C. At temperatures above 100°C, Pd0 species segregates from the B-site of the Perovskite matrix and appears on the catalyst surface. When temperatures exceed 200°C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized to Pd2+. The surface Pd2+ dissolves into the Perovskite matrix, occupying the B-site. The ease of reducing the catalyst allows for regeneration of the surface Pd0 in the redox fluctuations of automotive exhaust, even at low temperatures. This surface Pd0 contributes significantly to the start-up activity of the catalysts, potentially reducing the need for palladium usage.

在100至400°C之间，对LaFePdOx催化剂中Pd物种的氧化还原性质进行了研究。当温度高于100°C时，Pd0物种从Perovskite晶格的B位点分离并出现在催化剂表面。当温度超过200°C时，表面Pd0被重新氧化为Pd2+。表面Pd2+溶解到Perovskite晶格中，占据B位点。催化剂的可还原性使得在汽车尾气的氧化还原波动中，即使在低温下也能再生表面Pd0。这种表面Pd0对于催化剂的启动活性起着关键作用，可能有助于减少钯的使用量。
