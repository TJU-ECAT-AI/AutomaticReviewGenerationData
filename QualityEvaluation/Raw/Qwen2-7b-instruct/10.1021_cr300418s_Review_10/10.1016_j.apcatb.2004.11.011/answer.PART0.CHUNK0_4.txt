[1] "Reductive segregation of Pd0 begins near the surface of catalysts. At temperatures higher than 200 8C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+."
[2] "The reaction begins on the pre-oxidized catalyst (800-O) at temperatures higher than 150 8C."
[3] "These results strongly suggest that the fine Pd0 species at the surface is engendered by the reducing atmosphere of the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gas and that it acts as the active center for start-up emission control in practical LaFePdOx catalysts."

The redox property of palladium in Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts shows that reductive segregation of Pd0 starts at temperatures above 100 8C, and the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+ at temperatures above 200 8C. This process allows for a quasi-reversible redox reaction between surface Pd0 and cationic Pd in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 matrix. The formation of the surface Pd0 species is believed to be triggered by the reducing atmosphere of the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gas, acting as the active center for start-up emission control in practical LaFePdOx catalysts.

钯在普鲁士蓝型LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3催化剂中的还原性分层开始于100 8C以上的温度，表面钯0在200 8C以上的温度被重新氧化为钯2+。这一过程在LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3矩阵中表面钯0和正离子钯之间的可逆还原反应。表面钯0物种的形成被认为是由汽车排气气体红ox波动中的还原气氛触发的，作为实用LaFePdOx催化剂启动排放控制的活性中心。
