[1] "Reductive segregation of Pd0 begins near the surface of catalysts."
[2] "At temperatures higher than 200 8C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+."
[3] "The surface Pd2+ partially dissolves into the Perovskite-type LaFeOx framework to occupy the B-site."
[4] "Though the usual crystallization temperature of Perovskite is around 700 8C, this oxidative dissolution requires temperatures of about 400 8C."
[5] "When both the surface Pd2+ and the Pd3+ or 4+ in the Perovskite- type framework co-exist in the LaFePdOx catalysts under the oxidative atmosphere, quasi-reversible redox of the Pd species takes place at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 8C."
[6] "The original LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 is recovered in the oxidative atmosphere at 800 8C, the temperature of engine operation at a steady state."
[7] "Pd reduction of Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts occurs at wide temperature range."
[8] "It could be envisaged that the part of Pd of Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 for activity is deposited and the other part of Pd is protected in the Perovskite-type framework."
[9] "Owing to the easy reducibility of the catalyst, the fine Pd0 deposits at the surface can be regenerated in the redox fluctuation of automotive exhaust even at low temperatures."
[10] "This surface Pd0 plays a key role in the start-up activity of practical automobile emission control and promises the minimization of Pd usage."

The redox behavior of palladium in the Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts, particularly the segregation of Pd0 species, re-oxidation into Pd2+, and the reversible redox reactions between Pd0 and cationic Pd, significantly influence the catalyst's performance in automotive emission control. These processes allow for the regeneration of Pd0 species at low temperatures, which is crucial for the start-up activity of the catalysts, potentially leading to minimized Pd usage.

钯在普鲁士蓝型LaFePdOx催化剂中的氧化还原行为，特别是钯0物种的分离、氧化成钯2+以及表面钯0和钯离子之间的可逆氧化还原反应，显著影响汽车排放控制中的催化剂性能。这些过程允许在低温下再生钯0物种，这对于催化剂的启动活性至关重要，可能有助于减少钯的使用量。
