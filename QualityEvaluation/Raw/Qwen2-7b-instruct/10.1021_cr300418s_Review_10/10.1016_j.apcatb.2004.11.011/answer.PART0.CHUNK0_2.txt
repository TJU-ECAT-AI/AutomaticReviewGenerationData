[1] "In order to elucidate the superior start-up activity of LaFePdOx catalysts in practical automotive emission control, the redox property of Pd species in a Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 8C using X-ray spectroscopic techniques."
[2] "In a reductive atmosphere, and even at temperatures as low as 100 8C, Pd0 species is partially segregated out onto the catalyst surface from the B-site of the Perovskite-type matrix of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3."
[3] "Passing through successive oxidizing atmospheres, the segregated Pd0 species is re-oxidized into Pd2+ at 200300 8C."
[4] "The start-up activity of LaFePdOx catalysts can be attributed to Pd0 that segregates under the reductive atmosphere which is a natural part of the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gases at 100200 8C."

Answer: The redox behavior of palladium in Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts is crucial for their superior start-up activity in automotive emission control. At temperatures as low as 100°C, palladium species segregate onto the catalyst surface from the B-site of the Perovskite-type matrix. These segregated Pd0 species are re-oxidized into Pd2+ at temperatures around 200-300°C. This quasi-reversible redox reaction between surface Pd0 and cationic Pd in the LaFePdOx matrix contributes to the catalyst's start-up activity, particularly at low temperatures where the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gases occurs naturally.

1. 对于LaFePdOx催化剂在实际汽车排放控制中的出色启动活性，研究了Perovskite型LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3催化剂中Pd物种的氧化还原性质。在100至400°C的温度范围内使用X射线光谱技术进行了研究。
2. 在还原气氛中，甚至在100°C这样的低温下，Pd0物种从Perovskite型矩阵的B位点分离出来并部分沉积在催化剂表面上。
3. 经过一系列氧化气氛处理，分离出的Pd0物种在200-300°C被重新氧化为Pd2+。
4. LaFePdOx催化剂的启动活性归因于在还原气氛下分离出的Pd0，这是汽车排气中自然发生的氧化还原波动的一部分，尤其是在100-200°C的低温区域。
