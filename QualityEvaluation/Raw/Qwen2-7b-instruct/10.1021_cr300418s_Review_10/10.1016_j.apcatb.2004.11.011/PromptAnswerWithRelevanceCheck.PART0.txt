Redox behavior of palladium at start-up in the Perovskite-type LaFePdOx automotive catalysts showing a self-regenerative function Mari Uenishia,*
</literature>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study investigates the redox properties of palladium species in Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts used in automotive emissions control, particularly focusing on their behavior during start-up processes. Palladium species segregate from the B-site of the Perovskite matrix under a reductive atmosphere, forming a metallic alloy of PdCo. These segregated Pd0 species are re-oxidized at temperatures around 200-300°C, leading to a reversible redox reaction between surface Pd0 and cationic Pd in the matrix. This process contributes to the catalyst's superior start-up activity by providing active sites for catalytic reactions at low temperatures.

这项研究探讨了在汽车排放控制中使用的Perovskite-type LaFePdOx催化剂中的钯物种的氧化还原性质，特别是关注其在启动过程中的行为。在还原气氛下，钯物种从Perovskite矩阵的B位点分离，形成PdCo的金属合金。这些分离出的Pd0物种在约200-300°C下被重新氧化，导致表面Pd0和矩阵中阳离子Pd之间的可逆氧化还原反应。这一过程通过提供低温条件下的活性中心，有助于催化剂的快速启动活动。

[1] "Reductive segregation of Pd0 begins near the surface of catalysts."
[2] "At temperatures higher than 200 8C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+."
[3] "The surface Pd2+ partially dissolves into the Perovskite-type LaFeOx framework to occupy the B-site."
[4] "Though the usual crystallization temperature of Perovskite is around 700 8C, this oxidative dissolution requires temperatures of about 400 8C."

The redox behavior of palladium in the Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts, particularly the segregation of Pd0 species, re-oxidation into Pd2+, and the reversible redox reactions between Pd0 and cationic Pd, significantly influence the catalyst's performance in automotive emission control. These processes allow for the regeneration of Pd0 species at low temperatures, which is crucial for the start-up activity of the catalysts, potentially leading to minimized Pd usage.

Answer: The redox behavior of palladium in Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts is crucial for their superior start-up activity in automotive emission control. At temperatures as low as 100°C, palladium species segregate onto the catalyst surface from the B-site of the Perovskite-type matrix. These segregated Pd0 species are re-oxidized into Pd2+ at temperatures around 200-300°C. This quasi-reversible redox reaction between surface Pd0 and cationic Pd in the LaFePdOx matrix contributes to the catalyst's start-up activity, particularly at low temperatures where the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gases occurs naturally.

The redox property of palladium (Pd) species in Perovskite-type LaFePdOx catalysts was investigated at various temperatures between 100 to 400°C. At temperatures above 100°C, Pd0 species segregates from the B-site of the Perovskite matrix and appears on the catalyst surface. When temperatures exceed 200°C, the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized to Pd2+. The surface Pd2+ dissolves into the Perovskite matrix, occupying the B-site. The ease of reducing the catalyst allows for regeneration of the surface Pd0 in the redox fluctuations of automotive exhaust, even at low temperatures. This surface Pd0 contributes significantly to the start-up activity of the catalysts, potentially reducing the need for palladium usage.

在100至400°C之间，对LaFePdOx催化剂中Pd物种的氧化还原性质进行了研究。当温度高于100°C时，Pd0物种从Perovskite晶格的B位点分离并出现在催化剂表面。当温度超过200°C时，表面Pd0被重新氧化为Pd2+。表面Pd2+溶解到Perovskite晶格中，占据B位点。催化剂的可还原性使得在汽车尾气的氧化还原波动中，即使在低温下也能再生表面Pd0。这种表面Pd0对于催化剂的启动活性起着关键作用，可能有助于减少钯的使用量。

The redox property of palladium in Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts shows that reductive segregation of Pd0 starts at temperatures above 100 8C, and the surface Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+ at temperatures above 200 8C. This process allows for a quasi-reversible redox reaction between surface Pd0 and cationic Pd in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 matrix. The formation of the surface Pd0 species is believed to be triggered by the reducing atmosphere of the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gas, acting as the active center for start-up emission control in practical LaFePdOx catalysts.
