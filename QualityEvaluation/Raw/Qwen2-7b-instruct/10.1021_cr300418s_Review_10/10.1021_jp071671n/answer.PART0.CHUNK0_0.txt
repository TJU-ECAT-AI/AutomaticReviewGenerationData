[1] "The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The model used in the study has limitations regarding highly dispersed catalysts, as it only accounts for the flat facets of oxide surfaces and does not consider the complex morphological features such as steps, kinks, mesas, which are present on the surfaces of these catalysts.

该研究中使用的模型存在局限性，因为它仅适用于此类氧化物表面的平坦区域，并未考虑高度分散催化剂上存在的复杂形态特征，如台阶、折痕和丘陵等。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

Answer: The model used in the study focuses solely on flat facets of oxide surfaces and does not account for the intricate surface morphology of highly dispersed catalysts. This limitation means that the model's calculations are relevant only to the flat areas of such surfaces and might not accurately represent the behavior of the catalysts in real-world applications.
