[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[2] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[3] "These calculations lead us to conclude that doping an oxide is an efficient method of modifying its oxidative power."
[4] "We have chosen ZnO for two reasons. First, it allows us to study many dopants that have a larger formal charge than the Zn ions they substitute; we have not yet examined such a situation in our previous work. Second, Ti and Ce can switch from a +4 oxidation state to a +3 one and are able to compensate for the disruption caused by doping."

The study demonstrates that doping an oxide can significantly modify its oxidative power. Specifically, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, and cadmium decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE), making them suitable dopants for enhancing the oxidative power of zinc oxide (ZnO). On the contrary, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, cerium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, cobalt, aluminum, gallium, tin, and lead increase OVFE. Notably, calcium, strontium, barium, lanthanum, cerium, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, cobalt, tin, and lead tend to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO, while the rest prefer to substitute a Zn atom in the bulk. The authors conclude that doping an oxide can effectively modify its oxidative power, offering a promising approach for catalytic oxidation processes.

The choice of ZnO for the study was based on two key factors. Firstly, it enables the investigation of numerous dopants that have a higher formal charge than the zinc ions they replace, a scenario not explored in previous research. Secondly, titanium and cerium can switch from a +4 oxidation state to a +3 state, which aids in compensating for the disruptions caused by doping. These factors collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of how doping influences the reactivity of the surface oxygen in oxides.

研究显示，掺杂氧化物可以显著改变其氧化性。具体而言，锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金和镉降低氧空位形成能（OVFE），使它们成为增强锌氧化物（ZnO）氧化性的适宜掺杂剂。相反，镁、钙、锶、钡、钪、钇、镧、钛、锆、铪、铈、钒、铌、钽、铬、钼、钨、锰、铼、铁、钌、钴、铝、镓、锡和铅增加OVFE。值得注意的是，钙、锶、钡、镧、铈、铼、铁、钌、钴、锡和铅倾向于在ZnO表面替换一个Zn原子，而其余则倾向于在内部替换一个Zn原子。作者得出结论，掺杂氧化物可以有效地改变其氧化性，为催化氧化过程提供了一种有前景的方法。

选择ZnO进行研究基于两个关键因素。首先，它允许研究许多具有比它们取代的锌离子更高的形式电荷的掺杂剂，这是以前的研究中没有探索的情况。其次，钛和铈可以从+4的氧化状态转换到+3的氧化状态，这有助于补偿掺杂引起的破坏。这些因素共同促进了对如何掺杂影响氧化物表面氧活性的更深入理解。
