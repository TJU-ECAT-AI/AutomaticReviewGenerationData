[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[2] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."

The document reveals that lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), osmium (Os), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), and cadmium (Cd) decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) of zinc oxide (ZnO). They prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Conversely, most dopants that increase OVFE tend to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), rhenium (Re), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. The document concludes that doping an oxide is an effective strategy to modify its oxidative power.

文档显示，锂（Li）、钠（Na）、钾（K）、铷（Rb）、铯（Cs）、锇（Os）、铑（Rh）、铱（Ir）、镍（Ni）、钯（Pd）、铂（Pt）、铜（Cu）、银（Ag）、金（Au）和镉（Cd）减少了锌氧化物（ZnO）的氧空位形成能（OVFE）。它们倾向于在ZnO的表面替换一个Zn原子。相反，大多数增加OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于在内部替换Zn原子，除了钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、铼（Re）、铁（Fe）、钌（Ru）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），这些倾向于在表面替换一个Zn原子。文档得出结论，掺杂氧化物是修改其氧化性的一种有效方法。

[1] "All alkaline earth dopants, except Mg, prefer to be at the surface even though their bond with oxygen is strong. This is primarily due to their large size, as is evident from their structure, which is similar to that of Cs."
[2] "As the dopants from group 3 to group 7 form strong oxygen bonds leading to increase in OVFE, it is not surprising that they prefer to substitute Zn in the bulk rather than in the surface."
[3] "Conclusions The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface."

The document indicates that all alkaline earth dopants, except magnesium (Mg), prefer to be located at the surface despite their strong bond with oxygen. This preference is primarily due to their large size, as evidenced by their structure, which is similar to that of cesium (Cs). The document explains that dopants from groups 3 to 7 form strong oxygen bonds, causing an increase in oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE), which leads to their preference for substituting Zn atoms in the bulk rather than at the surface. The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides involves two critical steps: the oxide must be a good oxidant, ready to supply oxygen to the reactant and generate oxygen vacancies on the surface.

文档指出，所有碱土族掺杂剂，除了镁（Mg），更倾向于位于表面，尽管它们与氧的结合力很强。这种偏好主要是由于它们的尺寸较大，这从它们的结构中可以明显看出，该结构类似于铯（Cs）。文档解释，来自第3组到第7组的掺杂剂形成了强大的氧键，导致氧空位形成能（OVFE）的增加，这使得它们更倾向于在内部而不是表面替代Zn原子。火星van Krevelen机制对于氧化物的催化氧化涉及两个关键步骤：氧化物必须是一个好的氧化剂，能够向反应物提供氧气并在表面上生成氧空位。
