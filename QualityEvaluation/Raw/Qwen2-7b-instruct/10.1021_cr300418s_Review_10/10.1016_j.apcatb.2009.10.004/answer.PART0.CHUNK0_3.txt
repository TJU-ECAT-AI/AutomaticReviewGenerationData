The diverse properties of the palladium-integrated perovskites significantly influence their behavior as catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx under lean conditions. The phase composition of the catalysts is altered by small variations in the iron-to-cobalt ratio, affecting the structure and stability of the perovskite lattice. The presence of cobalt oxide and palladium oxide in the catalysts modifies the state of palladium, impacting the surface characteristics and reactivity. The perovskites demonstrate good NOx-reduction activity under simple gas mixtures, with the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd showing improved NOx-conversion in the presence of water vapor. The N2-selectivity of the catalysts depends on the composition, particularly the ratio of A- and B-site components and the type of precious metal present. The state(s) of palladium, including the crystal phase(s) and crystal planes, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. The perovskites display different behaviors in the presence of CO in the feed, with the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd showing slightly better NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities compared to the catalyst with less cobalt content. The complex interplay between the perovskite structure, the precious metal content, and the presence of impurities or additives requires further investigation to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize the catalyst performance for practical applications.
