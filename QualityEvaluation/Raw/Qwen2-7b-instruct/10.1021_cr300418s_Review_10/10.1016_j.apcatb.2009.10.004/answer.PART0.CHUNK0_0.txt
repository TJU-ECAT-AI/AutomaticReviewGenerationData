<p>The present study addresses the compositional phase changes with the variation of Fe/Co-ratio and the catalyst properties of Pd- integrated perovskites under H2-SCR of NOx conditions. The catalysts presented here are synthesized by employing a citrate route, in this synthesis method alternative precursors are employed to reduce the amount of nitrates, and nitrogen oxides formed during catalyst calcination.</p>
<p>In the investigated perovskite-based catalysts LaFex-Co(1xy)PdyO3, only the lanthanum atoms shall occupy the A-site as the other three elements (Fe, Co, Pd) share the B-site. The Fe/Co- ratio of the perovskite was intentionally modified by increasing the Fe-content and keeping the La and Pd contents constant. Table 1 summarises the perovskites compositions synthesized in the present study.</p>
<p>The effect of these changes and modifications on the H2-SCR of NOx reactions is discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>Both perovskites LFC(0.475)-Pd and LFC(0.3)-Pd displayed very good NOx-reduction activity under simple gas mixtures (NO + O2 + H2 + He) (see Fig. 8). Maximum NOx-conversion values of about 79% were observed between 180 and 230 8C with the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd. These NOx-conversion values are slightly higher than those measured within the same temperature window with the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd which yields a maximum NOx- conversion of 74% at 200 8C.</p>
<p>The perovskite LFC(0.3)-Pd reduced less NOx than the perovskite with higher cobalt content LFC(0.475)-Pd. This suggests that either cobalt (i.e. or the cobalt species) may be involved in the creation of active sites for participation in the NOx-reduction and/or the bimetallic particles containing Pd and Co are involved in diverse reactions (i.e. NO- chemisorption and -dissociation, H2-chemisorption, and N2O formation).</p>
<p>The perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd shows the best catalytic performance yielding 54% N2-selectivity at 180 8C and 46% N2-selectivity at 210 8C as remains almost constant up to about 290 8C (see graph (b) in Fig. 11). Increase of Fe at the expense of Co-content in the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd (Fe/Co-ratio from 1 to 2.2) leads to a slightly negative impact on the NOx-reduction performance at approx. 225 8C and above (see graph (a) in Fig. 11).</p>
<p>Under these conditions, excess cobalt oxide in the high Co-content LFC(0.475)-Pd, and the segregated PdO present in both perovskite compositions were completely reduced. On the other hand, under lean reaction conditions, the catalysts were stable even after the NOx reaction. The XRD measurements showed no changes in the phase composition. If some local changes happened, these may be observed only by TEM or can be made visible by means of similar analytical techniques.</p>

The diverse properties of the perovskites, including the variation of Fe/Co-ratio, influence their behavior as catalysts for H2-SCR of NOx. Cobalt content affects the NOx-reduction activity and N2-selectivity. The presence of cobalt oxide and segregated PdO in the perovskite compositions contribute to the catalytic performance. The state(s) of palladium, i.e. the crystal phase(s), and the crystal planes, play a crucial role in the H2-SCR of NOx reaction. The perovskites' phase composition changes with the modification of Fe/Co-ratio, which impacts their catalytic performance. The perovskite with higher cobalt content shows better NOx-reduction activity and N2-selectivity.
