[1] "In the presence of CO in the feed, the NOx-conversions on both perovskites are modified probably due to the co-adsorption of both gases at the same active sites."
[2] "However the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd displays slightly better NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities, when compared to the catalyst with less cobalt LFC(0.3)-Pd."

The perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd shows enhanced performance in terms of NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities compared to the catalyst with lower cobalt content, LFC(0.3)-Pd. This improvement might be attributed to the presence of both orthorhombic and cubic perovskite phases, which potentially stabilize the palladium more effectively, leading to better catalytic activity. Additionally, the excess cobalt in the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd might facilitate the formation of palladium-rich regions or alloys on the surface, contributing to its superior performance.

与钴含量较低的催化剂LFC(0.3)-Pd相比，LFC(0.475)-Pd的性能有所提升，体现在更高的NOx转化率和N2选择性上。这种改善可能归因于正交相和立方相的混合存在，这些相态可能更有效地稳定了钯，从而提高了催化活性。此外，LFC(0.475)-Pd中过量的钴可能促进表面形成富含钯的区域或合金，从而导致其优越的性能。
