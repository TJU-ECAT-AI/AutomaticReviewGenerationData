[1] "The present study addresses the compositional phase changes with the variation of Fe/Co-ratio and the catalyst properties of Pd-integrated perovskites under H2-SCR of NOx conditions."
[2] "The effect of Fe/Co-ratio on the phase composition of Pd-integrated perovskites and its H2-SCR of NOx performance."
[3] "The XRD measurements showed no changes in the phase composition."
[4] "It can be said by considering the catalytic performance of the perovskites that the NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities and consequently the N2O formation on the perovskites strongly depend on the catalyst composition."
