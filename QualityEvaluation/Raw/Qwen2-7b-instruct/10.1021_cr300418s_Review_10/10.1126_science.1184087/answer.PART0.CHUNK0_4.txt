The diverse properties of niobium oxides, such as their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties enable them to store entropy in strikingly distinctive ways due to their unique topological structures. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in studying these complex catalytic systems presents challenges.
