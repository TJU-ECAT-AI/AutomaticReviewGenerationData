The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The different topology of niobium oxides allows for unique storage of entropy, which affects their catalytic efficiency. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations often stem from the complexity of these catalytic systems and the intricate interplay between the dopant's structure and the host material's properties.
