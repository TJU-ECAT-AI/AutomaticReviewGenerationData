The document does not provide specific details on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it mentions that the different topology of niobium oxides can lead to strikingly distinctive ways of storing entropy. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying complex catalytic systems may arise due to the complexity and variability of the materials involved.
