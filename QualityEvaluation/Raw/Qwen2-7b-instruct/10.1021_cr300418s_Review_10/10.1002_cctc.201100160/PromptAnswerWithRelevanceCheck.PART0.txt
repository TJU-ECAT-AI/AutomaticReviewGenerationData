[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as an additive to stabilize active RuO2 and/or IrO2 anodes,3 and it has also been studied as a catalyst for the photoelectrolysis of water."
[2] "The reason why TiO2 can be used as a photocatalyst is because it has a high band gap and, therefore, a high free energy of the holes, which can be used for water splitting."
[3] "Numerous studies show that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide."
[4] "Our theoretical analysis suggests that doped TiO2 catalysts would be interesting candidates as low-cost (photo-)electrocatalysts."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The high band gap and the resulting high free energy of the holes in titanium dioxide (TiO2) enable its use as a photocatalyst for water splitting. Numerous studies demonstrate that doping enhances the catalytic activity of host oxides. The theoretical analysis indicates that doped TiO2 catalysts might serve as low-cost alternatives to other transition-metal oxides used as electrocatalysts.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们不同的稳定形式和氧化状态，显著影响了它们作为尼古丁氧化脱氢催化剂中NiO掺杂剂的行为。钛酸盐（TiO2）的高带隙和由此产生的空穴高自由能使其能够用作水裂解的光催化剂。许多研究表明，掺杂可以提高氧化物的催化活性。理论分析表明，掺杂的TiO2催化剂可能是其他过渡金属氧化物作为电催化剂的低成本替代品。

The document does not contain any information related to niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. It focuses on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the surfaces of doped rutile TiO2(110) catalysts and their potential as low-cost alternatives to expensive catalysts like RuO2.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, do not directly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, these properties could potentially affect their role in enhancing the catalytic activity of NiO. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations typically stem from factors such as the complexity of the catalytic systems, variations in experimental conditions, and the limitations of theoretical models in accurately predicting the behavior of complex catalysts. The document focuses on the effect of transition metal doping on TiO2 for oxygen evolution reactions, rather than niobium oxides in NiO catalysts.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，不会直接影响它们作为乙烷氧化脱氢催化剂中NiO掺杂剂的行为。然而，这些性质可能会影响NiO的催化活性。理论预测与实验观察之间的不一致通常源自复杂催化体系的复杂性、实验条件的变化以及在准确预测复杂催化剂行为方面的理论模型局限性。文档主要关注TiO2掺杂对氧演化反应的影响，而不是铌氧化物在NiO催化剂中的作用。
