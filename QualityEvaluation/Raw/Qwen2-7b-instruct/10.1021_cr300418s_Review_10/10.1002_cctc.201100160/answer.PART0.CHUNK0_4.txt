[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as an additive to stabilize active RuO2 and/or IrO2 anodes,3 and it has also been studied as a catalyst for the photoelectrolysis of water."
[2] "Our theoretical analysis suggests that doped TiO2 catalysts would be interesting candidates as low-cost (photo-)electrocatalysts."
[3] "Doped TiO2 with Cr, Mo, Fe, Ni, V, Mn, and Cu have been experimentally synthesized and tested for photoelectrochemical water splitting."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, do not directly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, these properties could potentially affect their role in enhancing the catalytic activity of NiO. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations typically stem from factors such as the complexity of the catalytic systems, variations in experimental conditions, and the limitations of theoretical models in accurately predicting the behavior of complex catalysts. The document focuses on the effect of transition metal doping on TiO2 for oxygen evolution reactions, rather than niobium oxides in NiO catalysts.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，不会直接影响它们作为乙烷氧化脱氢催化剂中NiO掺杂剂的行为。然而，这些性质可能会影响NiO的催化活性。理论预测与实验观察之间的不一致通常源自复杂催化体系的复杂性、实验条件的变化以及在准确预测复杂催化剂行为方面的理论模型局限性。文档主要关注TiO2掺杂对氧演化反应的影响，而不是铌氧化物在NiO催化剂中的作用。
