Tailoring the Activity for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis on Rutile TiO2(110) by Transition-Metal Substitution Graphical Abstract Save the prize: The activity of doped TiO2 toward oxygen evolution reaction is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to that of TiO2. Given that TiO2 is extremely cheap, some of the systems considered here serve as candidates for inexpensive alternatives to the expensive RuO2 catalyst.
Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the rutile MTiO2(110) (M=V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Ru, Ir, Ni) surfaces was investigated by using density functional theory calculations. The stability of different doped TiO2 systems was analyzed. The scaling relationship between the binding energies of OER intermediates (HOO* versus HO*) is found to follow essentially the same trend as for undoped oxides. Our theoretical analysis shows a lower overpotential associated with OER on the doped MTiO2(110) than on the undoped TiO2(110). The theoretical activity of Cr-, Mo-, Mn-, and Ir-doped TiO2 is found to be close to that of RuO2(110) for some of the configurations in consideration.
Introduction Electrochemical water splitting is of considerable interest as a key process in hydrogen production from sunlight and other sources of electricity.1 If the electrical energy is provided by sustainable sources, such as wind, water, or sun, the hydrogen produced is a clean and CO2-free energy carrier, which can be used in connection with fuel cells to produce energy for a range of applications.2 Unfortunately, electrochemical water splitting is associated with substantial energy loss mainly because of the high overpotential at the oxygen-evolving anode.35 Therefore, it is important to find the optimal oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst to minimize the energy loss. The most common catalysts used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are IrO2 and RuO2, which leaves ample room for improvement in terms of price. Co oxides have been suggested as a cheaper alternative, but all these materials have quite a large overpotential for OER.4 Recently, Marshall etal. developed an IrxRuyTazO2 system used as the anode electrocatalyst for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems.6 The lowest overpotential achieved was 0.4V at 1Acm2.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as an additive to stabilize active RuO2 and/or IrO2 anodes,3 and it has also been studied as a catalyst for the photoelectrolysis of water.7 Theoretical work suggests that rutile TiO2(110) has a very high overpotential for the OER. The reason why TiO2 can be used as a photocatalyst is because it has a high band gap and, therefore, a high free energy of the holes, which can be used for water splitting.8 Numerous studies show that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide. For example, doping RuO2 with Zn increases the selectivity toward OER in the presence of chlorides by selective suppression of the chlorine evolution reaction.9 A well-chosen doped rutile TiO2(110) catalyzes the CO oxidation,10 and TiO2 doped with Li, Na, K, and Cs catalyzes acetone oligomerization.11 Impurity doping is also one of the most promising techniques for improving the activity of TiO2-based photoelectrolysis cells.12 However, the doping effect on the oxygen evolution electrocatalysis has not been explored previously. This is the aim of the present theoretical study.
Computational Methods Calculation details The effect on the OER overpotential by doping the rutile TiO2(110) surface was investigated by using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model.13 The grid-based projector-augmented wave method (GPAW) code was employed,14 with the revised PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (RPBE) exchange-correlation functional.15 Inner cores were replaced by using projector-augmented wave method (PAW) pseudopotentials,16 and a uniform real-spaced grid with a spacing of 0.2Å was used for the representation of the electronic wave functions. The slabs contained four Ti layers in a (1×2)supercell and were separated by more than 16Å of vacuum. The k-point sampling consisted of 4×4×1 MonkhorstPack points.17 The adsorbates (O*, HO*, and HOO*, in which the asterisk corresponds to an active site on the oxide) together with the two top layers were allowed to relax, whereas the lowest layers were kept frozen at their bulk positions. Spin-polarized calculations were performed. The magnetic moment of the isolated dopant was used as the initial guess of the magnetic moment of the dopant in the doped TiO2(110). The magnetic moment was relaxed during the self-consistency cycles. A dipole correction was applied. All calculations were performed using the ASE simulation package.18 Structures of the doped rutile TiO2(110) surfaces The doped rutile TiO2(110) surfaces were simulated by using a substitutional model with 6.25% transition-metal impurities relative to the host Ti atoms in the slab, that is, MTi15O32. We considered the transition metals M=V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Ru, Ir, and Ni as dopants at four different substitutional sites (Figure1). In the topmost surface layer, either a five-coordinated (5c-M) or a six-coordinated (6c-M) Ti atom was replaced by the dopant M. The substitution of a six-coordinated Ti atom in two different positions in the second surface layer was also considered. Most of the transition-metal oxides were stable under the rutile form.19 The doped TiO2 surfaces considered here did not show any substantial surface reconstruction.

The bridging oxygen atoms, the five-coordinated atoms (5c-Ti), and the six-coordinated titanium atoms (6c-Ti) are indicated in the figure. On the right hand side, the side views of the two topmost layers of the modeled-doped MTi15O32 surface are shown. The dopant M is substituting an a)five-coordinated Ti atom (5c-M) and b)six-coordinated Ti atom (6c-M) in the surface layer. Two possible substitutions of a six-coordinated Ti atom are considered in the subsurface layer, denoted as 6c-Ms1 (c) and 6c-Ms2 (d).
The active site on the doped surfaces was the five-fold coordinately unsaturatedsite (CUS). If the dopant is five-coordinated (5c-M), (Figure 1a), the adsorption of the species on the dopant was found to be favored as compared to the adsorption on-top of the fivefold coordinated Ti (see TableS3 in the Supporting Information). In this case, the dopant was considered to be the active site.
Results and Discussion Free-energy diagram The water splitting reaction can be written as Equation(1):((1)) Hydrogen is produced at the cathode and oxygen evolves at the anode. We consider the following four-electron reactions [Eqs.(1a), , to (1d)] for the OER in an acidic environment:((1a)) ΔG1OER=ΔGHO*eU+kBTlna ((1b)) ΔG2OER=ΔGO*ΔGHO*eU+kBTlna ((1c)) ΔG3OER=ΔGHOO*ΔGO*eU+kBTlna ((1d)) ΔG4OER=4.92ΔGHOO*eU+kBTlna A more detailed derivation of these expressions can be found in Ref.8. The free-energy differences ΔG14OER are calculated by using the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).13 The sum of the free energy of the reaction steps equals the formation energy of O2 (4.92eV). At standard conditions (pH0, P=0.1MPa, T=298K) and U=0V vs. SHE, a proton and an electron are replaced by half a hydrogen molecule. The free energy of the intermediates along the reaction path, ΔGHO*, ΔGO*, and ΔGHOO*, are calculated relative to H2O and H2 in the gas phase at U=0V, standard conditions, and a fixed standard coverage of half of the adsorbate species. The free-energy diagrams do not include the barriers between the intermediates. Our analysis can be viewed as a first step toward a complete picture of the reaction path. Calculations for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, the reverse reaction of the OER) also indicate that additional barriers are small and independent of potential.20 A very important parameter, which can be deduced from the free-energy diagram, is the size of the potential-determining step. This concept was developed and reviewed in previous papers for OER and ORR.8,13,2123 The potential-determining step is the highest free-energy step (GOER) in the process and, therefore, the last step to become downhill in free energy as the potential increases. The theoretical overpotential (ηOER) at standard conditions is defined as Equation(2):((2)) Linear relations and OER activity on undoped oxides In a previous study, trends in the electrocatalytic activity of the OER were investigated on the basis of a large database of HO* and HOO* adsorption energies on oxide surfaces.21,24 There is an almost constant difference between the binding energies of the two intermediates: ΔGHOO*ΔGHO*3.2eV (Figure2a). An ideal catalyst with zero theoretical overpotential for each step would have ΔGHOO*ΔGHO*=2×1.23eV=2.46eV. Therefore, either step2 or 3 [reactions given by Equations(1b) and (1c), respectively] is likely the potential determining step. That implies that the variation in ηOER from one oxide surface to another is determined by the O* adsorption energy, since that determines ΔG2OER and ΔG3OER [Eq.(3)]:((3)) Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)Adsorption energies of HOO* as a function of adsorption energies of HO* on rutile (), perovskites (), anatase (), MnxOy (), Co3O4 (+), and NiO (+) oxides. Open and solid symbols represent the adsorption energies on clean surfaces and on high-coverage surfaces, respectively. The star represents the binding energies required for an ideal electrocatalyst. The dotted line represents the relationship between ΔEHOO and ΔEHO* for an ideal catalyst, which is given by ΔEHOO*=ΔEHO*+2.44eV. The data are taken from Ref.24. b)Activity trends toward oxygen evolution for rutile oxides (), Co3O4 (+), and MnxOy (). Open and solid symbols represent the same surface coverage as Figure2a. The negative value of the theoretical overpotential is plotted as a function of the standard free energy of ΔGO*ΔGHO*. The data are taken from Ref.24. c)Standard free-energy diagram for the OER on O*-covered RuO2 at three different potentials: U=0, 1.23, and 1.60V. The data are taken from Ref.22b.
The energy ΔGO*ΔGHO* is, therefore, a descriptor for the OER activity, and the theoretical overpotential at standard conditions is given by Equation(4):((4)) By plotting ηOER as a function of ΔGO*ΔGHO*, a volcano relationship is established for oxides (Figure2b). A lower limit for the theoretical OER overpotential of 0.40.2eV is found for the classes of materials considered (the value 0.2eV stems from the standard deviation of the population from ΔGHOO*ΔGHO*3.2eV). RuO2 has an OER overpotential of 0.4V, with the formation of the intermediate HOO* being the potential-determining step (Figure2c). Experimental overpotentials depend on the current density, but it was shown in Ref.24 that they are proportional to the theoretical overpotential. This strongly supports the notion that trends in the electrochemical activity for OER are determined to a first approximation by thermodynamics. As regards the accuracy of generalized gradient approximation GGA) DFT calculations for oxide chemistry, we are aware that many recent articles have suggested that GGA-DFT does not provide the correct electronic structure for the titanium oxides.25 The current opinion is that a Hubbard U correction improves the description of the band gap of TiO2.26 In spite of the uncertainty surrounding the GGA method, we suggest that, until better methods are applicable, this provides the best method to study the trends in the electrocatalytic activity of OER for doped oxides.
Linear relations and OER activity on doped TiO2(110) Using the approach described above, the theoretical overpotentials of the MTi15O32(110) surfaces (M=V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Ru, Ir, Ni) are calculated. The binding energies of O* (ΔEO), HO* (ΔEHO), and HOO* (ΔEHOO) on the surfaces are calculated relative to H2O and H2 in the gas phase, because these are well described within DFT (see TableS3 in the Supporting Information). We have considered that only half of the coordinately unsaturated sites are occupied by O*, HO*, or HOO*. We are aware that the binding energies of the species may depend fairly strongly on the concentration; this issue is not addressed here because we are mostly interested in trends. The analysis of the relative stability of different surface coverages relevant to electrolysis will be discussed in future work.
We find that the introduction of dopants leads to a stronger interaction of the adsorbate species with the surface as compared to that on pure TiO2 for most of the systems under consideration (Figure3a). The strength is determined by the type of the transitional metal and also by its position in the lattice. The scaling relationship between the binding energies of the OER-intermediates HOO* and HO* follows essentially the same trend as for undoped oxides (Figure3a). The mean absolute error of the scaling relation including both doped and undoped oxides is 0.17 eV, which is the same as for undoped oxides.

The small black circles correspond to ΔEHOO as a function of ΔEHO on pure oxides (data taken from Ref.24). The red star indicates where the binding energies need to be for an ideal electrocatalyst. b)Calculated theoretical overpotentials plotted as a function of ΔGO*ΔGHO* for MTi15O32. The volcano curve is established by using the scaling relation between ΔGHOO*ΔGO* and ΔGO*ΔGHO* as described in Ref.24. Green circles stand for configurations in which the dopant is five-fold coordinated. Triangles stand for configurations in which the dopant is six-fold-coordinated: 6c-M (blue), 6c-Ms1 (red), and 6c-Ms2 (yellow).
Our theoretical analysis indicates a lower theoretical overpotential associated with OER on the doped MTi15O32(110) compared to on the undoped TiO2 (Figure3b). Either the formation of O* or the formation of the intermediate HOO* is the potential-determining step for OER for most of the systems under consideration. The only exception is the MnTi15O32 alloy with the dopant in the five-coordinated site for which the formation of HO* is the potential-determining step. The correlation found between ΔEHOO* and ΔEHO* allows us to use ΔGO*ΔGHO* as an activity descriptor of MTi15O32(110) surfaces as in the case of undoped oxides (Figure3b). The catalytic activity of some configurations of TiO2 doped with Cr, Mo, Mn, or Ir is close to that of RuO2 (Table1). We found that these are stable configurations with the exception of IrTiO2.

[a]Only configurations that have a ηOER lower than 0.8V are compiled in this table. The position of the dopant in the TiO2 lattice is indicated (see labels in Figure1). Formation energies (ΔEform) were calculated by using Eq.(5).
To assess the stability of the doped oxides, the formation energies ΔEform have been calculated according to Equation(5):((5)) E is the energy of the slab with one substituted M atom and E is the energy of the undoped slab. E and EM(bulk) are the bulk energies of TiO2 and of the dopant, respectively. μ is the chemical potential of the O2 molecule in the gas phase at standard conditions (T=298K and P=0.1MPa). Substitutional doping is energetically more favorable the smaller the ΔEform value is. The trend in the formation energy of doped TiO2 can be understood by considering the electronegativity of the metal that is introduced into the TiO2 lattice.10b,27 In most cases, a strong MO bond is associated with low-electronegativity dopants . Experimentally, the location and the quantity of the dopants in TiO2 are difficult to predict.28 A theoretical analysis of segregation and migration effects of the host atom toward the most stable positions caused by different applied potentials and pH is out of the scope of this study.
Our theoretical analysis suggests that doped TiO2 catalysts would be interesting candidates as low-cost (photo-)electrocatalysts. Doped TiO2 with Cr, Mo, Fe, Ni, V, Mn, and Cu have been experimentally synthesized and tested for photoelectrochemical water splitting.12 The observed enhanced photoelectrochemical activity was suggested to be attributable to a better photoresponse of TiO2 in the visible spectrum because of the additional energy levels that emerge in the band gap of TiO2. Our calculations suggest that the enhanced photoelectrochemical activity could actually (also) be an effect of increased catalytic activity. We suggest that doped TiO2, for instance as thin layers (so that electrical conductivity is not an issue), may be a cheap alternative to other transition-metal oxides used as electrocatalysts.
Conclusions In the present paper, we have performed a study of the effect of doped rutile MTi15O32(110) (M=V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Ru, Ir, Ni) on the (OER) activity. The correlation between the HOO* and HO* energies essentially follow the same trend as the one found for undoped oxides. We have found that transition-metal-doped TiO2 has a lower overpotential than the undoped TiO2. The OER activity is considerably enhanced for Cr-, Mo-, Mn- and Ir-doped TiO2(110). The systems considered herein provide no better catalysts than known catalysts, but given that TiO2 is extremely cheap they may serve as candidates for inexpensive alternatives, if it is possible to synthesize and couple them to an electrode or a suitable photon absorber.
