[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge, as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[3] "The reduction of structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."
[4] "The study of the materials catalytic performance clearly demonstrated that introducing even small amounts of Nb in NiO convert nickel oxide from an effective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature with very high selectivity ODH catalyst [11]."
[5] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."
[6] "Further increase of the Nb/Ni ratio results in extended segregation and separation of the pure NiO and Nb2O5 phases [11]."
[7] "The contribution of the second Nb-rich structural feature to the catalytic performance still remains unclear, since it is almost impossible to isolate this phase and evaluate independently its catalytic function."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways. When niobium ions react with cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, they substitute nickel atoms and fill the cationic vacancies. This leads to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, decreasing the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. Charge compensation phenomena occur due to the substitution of Ni2+ by Nb5+, contributing to the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in ethane ODH reactions. Even small amounts of niobium can convert nickel oxide from an ineffective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient catalyst with high selectivity for ethylene production. The niobium-induced effects correlate with the reduction of structural defects in NiO, enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards ethylene. However, the precise role of the second niobium-rich structural feature in the catalytic performance remains unclear, as isolating and evaluating its function independently is challenging.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，以多种方式影响其作为镍氧化物催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂。当铌离子与非化学计量的镍氧化物表面结构中的空位反应时，它们替换镍原子并填充阳离子空位。这导致材料的非化学计量性的减少，减少了电负性氧物种（O）的数量，这些物种负责乙烷到二氧化碳的完全氧化。由于Ni2+被Nb5+替换，发生了电荷补偿现象，促进了镍铌氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的高选择性。即使少量的铌也可以将镍氧化物从有效的总氧化催化剂转化为具有极高乙烯选择性的低温催化剂。铌诱导效果与NiO结构缺陷的减少相关，提高了催化剂对乙烯的选择性。然而，第二个铌富集结构特征在催化性能中的确切作用仍然不清楚，因为单独隔离和评估其功能是具有挑战性的。
