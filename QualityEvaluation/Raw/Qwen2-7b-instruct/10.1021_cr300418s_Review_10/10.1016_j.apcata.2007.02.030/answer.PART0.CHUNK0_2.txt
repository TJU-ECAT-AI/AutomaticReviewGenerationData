[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge, as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[3] "The excellent catalytic behavior of the NiNbO nano-oxides in ethane ODH is related to the electronic and structural rearrangement induced by the incorporation of niobium cations in the NiO lattice."
[4] "The reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies leads to rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, thus increasing the surface area and consequently the per weight activity of the samples in the ethane ODH reaction."
[5] "Therefore, the excellent catalytic behavior of the NiNbO nano-oxides in ethane ODH is related to the electronic and structural rearrangement induced by the incorporation of niobium cations in the NiO lattice."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their ability to substitute nickel atoms and fill cationic vacancies in the non-stoichiometric NiO structure, lead to a reduction in the material's non-stoichiometry. This reduction decreases the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. The incorporation of niobium cations into the NiO lattice also facilitates charge compensation, enhancing the catalytic performance of NiNbO nano-oxides. The rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones by niobium, which increases surface area, further improves the per weight activity of the materials in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The overall catalytic behavior is attributed to the electronic and structural rearrangements induced by niobium incorporation.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们能够替换镍原子并填充非化学计量NiO结构中的阳离子空位，导致材料非化学计量性的减少。这减少了活性氧物种（O）的数量，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化为二氧化碳。铌离子在NiO晶格中的掺杂也促进了电荷补偿，提高了NiNbO纳米氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。铌的破裂作用使得较大的晶体破碎成较小的晶体，从而增加了表面积，进而提高了材料的单位质量活性。整体催化行为归因于铌掺杂引起的电子和结构重排。
