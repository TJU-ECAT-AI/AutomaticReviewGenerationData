[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge,as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[3] "The reduction of non-stoichiometry leads to elimination of the unselective oxygen species, resulting in the high ethylene selectivity and enhanced ethane ODH activity observed over the NiNbO mixed oxides."
[4] "The reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies leads to rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, thus increasing the surface area and consequently the per weight activity of the samples in the ethane ODH reaction."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, niobium's ability to substitute nickel atoms and fill cationic vacancies within the defective non-stoichiometric NiO structure leads to a reduction in non-stoichiometry. This reduction eliminates unselective oxygen species, enhancing ethylene selectivity and ethane ODH activity. Additionally, niobium's incorporation disrupts the crystalline structure, increasing surface area and catalytic activity. However, the precise mechanisms linking these structural changes to catalytic performance require further investigation.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括其不同的稳定形式和氧化状态，显著影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。具体来说，铌能够替代镍原子并填充非晶态NiO结构中的阳离子空位，导致非晶度的减少。这种减少消除了非选择性氧物种，提高了乙二醇的选择性和乙烷ODH活性。此外，铌的掺入破坏了晶体结构，增加了表面积和催化活性。然而，这些结构变化与催化性能之间的精确机制需要进一步研究。
