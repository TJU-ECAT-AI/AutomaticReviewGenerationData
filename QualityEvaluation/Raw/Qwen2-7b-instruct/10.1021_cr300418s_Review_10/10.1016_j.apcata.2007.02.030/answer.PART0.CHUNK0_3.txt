[1] "Calcination at low temperatures leads to the formation of a highly non-stoichiometric oxidic phase,with visible extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies (i.e., nickel deficiency)."
[2] "On the areas of low-density population of cationic vacancies, a small amount of Nb is incorporated in the NiO host lattice, causing distortion of the crystallographic planes and rupture of the larger crystallites that consequently leads to significantly lower crystal size (in the nanorange) and contributes to the higher surface area (see Table 1) of the NiNbO catalysts."
[3] "Therefore, the excellent catalytic behavior of the NiNbO nano-oxides in ethane ODH is related to the electronic and structural rearrangement induced by the incorporation of niobium cations in the NiO lattice."
[4] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge,as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[5] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

To understand how the diverse properties of niobium oxides influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, we must consider the role of niobium in modifying the structure and reactivity of NiO. Low-temperature treatment of NiO creates a highly reactive non-stoichiometric phase with extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies. When niobium is introduced into NiO, it reacts with these vacancies, forming two distinct structural phases. One phase retains the NiO crystal structure with niobium incorporated into the lattice, while the other forms a highly distorted phase that acts as a precursor for the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The niobium dopant reduces the crystallite size, enhancing the surface area and per-weight activity of the materials. This reduction of defects and the subsequent modification of the surface chemistry, particularly through the elimination of electrophilic oxygen species (O), leads to the high selectivity of NiNbO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The precise balance between the niobium content and the resulting structural modifications is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

要理解铌氧化物作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂时的复杂行为，我们需考虑铌如何通过改变结构和反应性来影响镍氧化物。在低温下处理镍氧化物会形成一个高度非化学计量的氧化相，其中含有明显的结构缺陷，这些缺陷源于阳离子空位（即镍缺乏）。当铌被引入到镍氧化物中时，它会与这些空位反应，形成两种不同的结构相。一种相保留了镍氧化物的晶体结构，并将铌融入到了晶格之中，而另一种形成了一个高度失稳的相，作为混合镍铌2氧6化合物前驱体。铌掺杂减少了晶粒尺寸，增加了比表面积和单位质量活性。这种对缺陷的减少和随后的表面化学性质的修改，特别是通过消除富电子氧物种（O），导致了镍铌氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中对乙烯的高选择性。实现最佳催化性能的关键在于精确控制铌含量和由此产生的结构变化之间的平衡。
