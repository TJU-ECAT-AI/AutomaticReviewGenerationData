[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry."
[2] "The reduction of non-stoichiometry leads to elimination of the unselective oxygen species, resulting in the high ethylene selectivity and enhanced ethane ODH activity observed over the NiNbO mixed oxides."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, when used as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, influence their behavior by reducing the non-stoichiometry of the NiO lattice. This reduction eliminates unselective oxygen species, enhancing the selectivity for ethylene and improving the overall activity of the catalysts. Challenges arise in understanding the precise mechanisms behind these effects, as theoretical predictions may not fully align with experimental observations.

[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge, as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[3] "The reduction of structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."
[4] "The study of the materials catalytic performance clearly demonstrated that introducing even small amounts of Nb in NiO convert nickel oxide from an effective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature with very high selectivity ODH catalyst [11]."
[5] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."
[6] "Further increase of the Nb/Ni ratio results in extended segregation and separation of the pure NiO and Nb2O5 phases [11]."
[7] "The contribution of the second Nb-rich structural feature to the catalytic performance still remains unclear, since it is almost impossible to isolate this phase and evaluate independently its catalytic function."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways. When niobium ions react with cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, they substitute nickel atoms and fill the cationic vacancies. This leads to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, decreasing the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. Charge compensation phenomena occur due to the substitution of Ni2+ by Nb5+, contributing to the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in ethane ODH reactions. Even small amounts of niobium can convert nickel oxide from an ineffective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient catalyst with high selectivity for ethylene production. The niobium-induced effects correlate with the reduction of structural defects in NiO, enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards ethylene. However, the precise role of the second niobium-rich structural feature in the catalytic performance remains unclear, as isolating and evaluating its function independently is challenging.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，以多种方式影响其作为镍氧化物催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂。当铌离子与非化学计量的镍氧化物表面结构中的空位反应时，它们替换镍原子并填充阳离子空位。这导致材料的非化学计量性的减少，减少了电负性氧物种（O）的数量，这些物种负责乙烷到二氧化碳的完全氧化。由于Ni2+被Nb5+替换，发生了电荷补偿现象，促进了镍铌氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的高选择性。即使少量的铌也可以将镍氧化物从有效的总氧化催化剂转化为具有极高乙烯选择性的低温催化剂。铌诱导效果与NiO结构缺陷的减少相关，提高了催化剂对乙烯的选择性。然而，第二个铌富集结构特征在催化性能中的确切作用仍然不清楚，因为单独隔离和评估其功能是具有挑战性的。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their ability to substitute nickel atoms and fill cationic vacancies in the non-stoichiometric NiO structure, lead to a reduction in the material's non-stoichiometry. This reduction decreases the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. The incorporation of niobium cations into the NiO lattice also facilitates charge compensation, enhancing the catalytic performance of NiNbO nano-oxides. The rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones by niobium, which increases surface area, further improves the per weight activity of the materials in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The overall catalytic behavior is attributed to the electronic and structural rearrangements induced by niobium incorporation.

[1] "Calcination at low temperatures leads to the formation of a highly non-stoichiometric oxidic phase,with visible extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies (i.e., nickel deficiency)."
[2] "On the areas of low-density population of cationic vacancies, a small amount of Nb is incorporated in the NiO host lattice, causing distortion of the crystallographic planes and rupture of the larger crystallites that consequently leads to significantly lower crystal size (in the nanorange) and contributes to the higher surface area (see Table 1) of the NiNbO catalysts."

To understand how the diverse properties of niobium oxides influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, we must consider the role of niobium in modifying the structure and reactivity of NiO. Low-temperature treatment of NiO creates a highly reactive non-stoichiometric phase with extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies. When niobium is introduced into NiO, it reacts with these vacancies, forming two distinct structural phases. One phase retains the NiO crystal structure with niobium incorporated into the lattice, while the other forms a highly distorted phase that acts as a precursor for the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The niobium dopant reduces the crystallite size, enhancing the surface area and per-weight activity of the materials. This reduction of defects and the subsequent modification of the surface chemistry, particularly through the elimination of electrophilic oxygen species (O), leads to the high selectivity of NiNbO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The precise balance between the niobium content and the resulting structural modifications is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

要理解铌氧化物作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂时的复杂行为，我们需考虑铌如何通过改变结构和反应性来影响镍氧化物。在低温下处理镍氧化物会形成一个高度非化学计量的氧化相，其中含有明显的结构缺陷，这些缺陷源于阳离子空位（即镍缺乏）。当铌被引入到镍氧化物中时，它会与这些空位反应，形成两种不同的结构相。一种相保留了镍氧化物的晶体结构，并将铌融入到了晶格之中，而另一种形成了一个高度失稳的相，作为混合镍铌2氧6化合物前驱体。铌掺杂减少了晶粒尺寸，增加了比表面积和单位质量活性。这种对缺陷的减少和随后的表面化学性质的修改，特别是通过消除富电子氧物种（O），导致了镍铌氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中对乙烯的高选择性。实现最佳催化性能的关键在于精确控制铌含量和由此产生的结构变化之间的平衡。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, niobium's ability to substitute nickel atoms and fill cationic vacancies within the defective non-stoichiometric NiO structure leads to a reduction in non-stoichiometry. This reduction eliminates unselective oxygen species, enhancing ethylene selectivity and ethane ODH activity. Additionally, niobium's incorporation disrupts the crystalline structure, increasing surface area and catalytic activity. However, the precise mechanisms linking these structural changes to catalytic performance require further investigation.
