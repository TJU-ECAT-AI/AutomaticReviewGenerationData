[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry."
[2] "The reduction of non-stoichiometry leads to elimination of the unselective oxygen species, resulting in the high ethylene selectivity and enhanced ethane ODH activity observed over the NiNbO mixed oxides."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, when used as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, influence their behavior by reducing the non-stoichiometry of the NiO lattice. This reduction eliminates unselective oxygen species, enhancing the selectivity for ethylene and improving the overall activity of the catalysts. Challenges arise in understanding the precise mechanisms behind these effects, as theoretical predictions may not fully align with experimental observations.

铌氧化物在镍氧化物催化剂中的不同性质，作为掺杂剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢反应，通过减少NiO晶格的非化学计量性影响其行为。这种减少消除了非选择性氧物种，提高了乙烯的选择性和增强催化剂的整体活性。在理论预测与实验观察之间可能存在不完全匹配的挑战，理解这些效应的具体机制仍存在困难。
