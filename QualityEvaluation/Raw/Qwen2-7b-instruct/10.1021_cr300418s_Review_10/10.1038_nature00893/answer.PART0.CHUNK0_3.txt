The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting their reactivity, stability, and the ability to modulate the catalytic surface. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of the interactions between the niobium oxide dopants and the NiO matrix, as well as the dynamic nature of the catalytic process itself. Theoretical models often fail to capture the full range of effects, such as the precise role of dopant concentration, the formation of interfacial structures, and the influence on the electronic properties of the catalyst, leading to discrepancies between predicted and observed catalytic activities and selectivities.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢作用的掺杂剂的行为，这通过影响其反应性、稳定性以及调节催化表面的能力。在理论预测与实验观察之间达成一致的挑战来自于掺杂物与NiO基质之间的复杂相互作用，以及催化过程本身的动态性。理论模型往往未能捕捉到全部效果，例如掺杂剂浓度的确切作用、界面结构的形成以及对催化剂电学性质的影响，导致预测的催化活性和选择性与实际观测结果之间存在差异。
