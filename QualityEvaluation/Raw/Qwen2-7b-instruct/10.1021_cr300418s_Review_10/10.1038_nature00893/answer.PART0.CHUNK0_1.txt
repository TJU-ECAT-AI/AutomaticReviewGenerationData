The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. These properties can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and improved efficiency in the conversion of ethane to olefins. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations presents several challenges. These include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the catalytic process, accounting for the complex interactions between niobium oxides and the NiO matrix, and accurately predicting the impact of dopant concentration and composition on the overall performance of the catalyst system. Additionally, discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental results may arise due to limitations in computational methods, experimental techniques, and the complexity of the catalytic environment.
