1. The perovskites showed two crystal systems based on XRD patterns, orthorhombic for xCo less than 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo 0.5 or greater. 

2. Perovskites with xCo = 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 had significant intrinsic CO conversion, linked to the presence of segregated metallic Co.

3. The xCo = 0.2 perovskite had the highest CO intrinsic conversion due to highly dispersed, segregated Co species.

4. The lack of segregated Co species in the xCo = 0.3 and 0.4 perovskites led to low activity.

5. This was because of the high stability in reducing atmospheres due to the presence of a mix of orthorhombic and rhombohedral structures, as seen through FTIR.

6. The decreased CH4 selectivity with increased xCo and increased selectivity for longer chain hydrocarbons with decreased xCo were attributed to changes in the average Co particle size.

1. 根据X射线衍射图谱，这些钙钛矿显示两种晶系，当xCo小于0.5时为斜方晶系，而当xCo等于或大于0.5时为三斜晶系。

2. xCo=0.1、0.2和1.0的钙钛矿具有显著的内源性CO转化，这与分散的金属Co的存在有关。

3. xCo=0.2的钙钛矿由于高度分散的分散Co物种而具有最高的CO内源性转化。

4. xCo=0.3和0.4的钙钛矿中缺乏分离的Co物种导致了低活性。

5. 这是因为在还原气氛下具有混合的斜方晶系和三斜晶系结构的高稳定性，如通过傅里叶变换红外光谱所示。

6. 随着xCo的增加，CH4选择性降低，而对于较短链长可凝结烃的选择性则随着xCo的减少而增加，这归因于Co物种平均颗粒尺寸的变化。
