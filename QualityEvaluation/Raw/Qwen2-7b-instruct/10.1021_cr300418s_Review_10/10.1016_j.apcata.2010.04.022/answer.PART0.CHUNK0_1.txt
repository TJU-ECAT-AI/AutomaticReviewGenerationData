[1] "The perovskites were found to display two crystal systems determined by XRD patterns, orthorhombic for xCo < 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo 0.5."
[2] "The xCo = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0 perovskites display a significant intrinsic CO conversion, which is related to the amount of segregated metallic Co."
[3] "The xCo = 0.2 perovskite displays the highest CO intrinsic conversion due to the formation of highly dispersed, segregated Co species."
[4] "The absence of segregated Co species in the xCo = 0.3 and 0.4 perovskites explains the low activity of these perovskites."
[5] "This result is a consequence of the high stability in reducing atmospheres due to the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures as shown by FTIR."
[6] "The decreasing selectivity towards CH4 with increasing xCo and the increasing selectivity to longer chain length condensable hydrocarbons with decreasing xCo were attributed to changes in the average particle size of Co segregates."

1. The perovskites showed two crystal systems based on XRD patterns, orthorhombic for cobalt content less than 0.5 and rhombohedral for cobalt content 0.5 and above.
2. Perovskites with cobalt content of 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 demonstrated significant intrinsic CO conversion, linked to the presence of segregated metallic cobalt.
3. The perovskite with 0.2 cobalt content had the highest CO intrinsic conversion due to the formation of highly dispersed, segregated cobalt species.
4. The lack of segregated cobalt species in perovskites with 0.3 and 0.4 cobalt content led to their low activity.
5. This low activity resulted from the high stability of these perovskites in reducing atmospheres, owing to the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures as indicated by FTIR.
6. The decline in methane selectivity with increasing cobalt content and the rise in selectivity for longer chain length condensable hydrocarbons with decreasing cobalt content were attributed to changes in the average particle size of cobalt segregates.

1. 根据X射线衍射图谱，这些钙钛矿显示了两种晶系，当钴含量小于0.5时为斜方晶系，当钴含量为0.5或更高时为三斜晶系。
2. 含有0.1、0.2和1.0钴含量的钙钛矿显示出显著的内源性CO转化，这与分离的金属钴的存在有关。
3. 含有0.2钴含量的钙钛矿具有最高的CO内源性转化，由于形成了高度分散且分离的钴物种。
4. 含有0.3和0.4钴含量的钙钛矿缺乏分离的钴物种，导致它们的低活性。
5. 这种低活性是由于在还原气氛中具有混合的斜方晶系和三斜晶系结晶结构的结果，这是由傅里叶变换红外光谱法所揭示的。
6. 随着钴含量的增加，甲烷选择性的下降以及随着钴含量的减少，长链长度可凝缩烃选择性的增加被归因于钴分离颗粒大小的变化。
