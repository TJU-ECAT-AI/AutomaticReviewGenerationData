The crystal structure of the perovskites determines their catalytic activity. Specifically, perovskites with a rhombohedral structure (for xCo ≥ 0.5) exhibit lower activity compared to those with an orthorhombic structure (for xCo < 0.5). The presence of segregated metallic Co species, especially in higher quantities for perovskites with xCo = 0.2, leads to improved CO conversion. The stability of perovskites in reducing atmospheres is influenced by the coexistence of orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures, which affects the dispersion of Co species. As the concentration of Co increases, the selectivity towards shorter chain hydrocarbons (such as C8C9) increases, while the selectivity for longer chain hydrocarbons decreases. Smaller particle sizes of Co segregates in the perovskites favor the formation of longer chain hydrocarbons.

晶体结构决定了这些钙钛矿的催化活性。特别是对于xCo ≥ 0.5时具有菱面体结构的钙钛矿，其活性低于xCo < 0.5时具有正交晶系结构的钙钛矿。在xCo = 0.2的钙钛矿中，以较高量存在的分散金属Co物种导致了更好的CO转化率。在还原气氛下，钙钛矿的稳定性受到正交晶系和菱面体晶系共存结构的影响，这影响了Co物种的分散性。随着Co含量的增加，对较短链烃（如C8C9）的选择性增加，而对较长链烃的选择性则降低。较小的Co分离颗粒大小的钙钛矿有利于形成较长链烃。
