[1] "The FischerTropsch synthesis reaction using a simulated gas mixture, comparable to that obtained from biomass transformation (biosyngas), was studied over LaFe1xCoxO3 perovskites."
[2] "The perovskites were prepared using the amorphous citrate precursor method and the FTS reaction was carried out in a stainless steel fixed bed reactor at 300 C and 1 MPa."
[3] "The highest CO intrinsic conversion was obtained for perovskites with a substitution degree of xCo = 0.2."
[4] "The liquid product distribution was related to the average size of iron particles."
[5] "The increase of cobalt particle size favours the formation of hydrocarbons centred in C89 chain length."
[6] "The perovskites display two crystal systems determined by XRD patterns, orthorhombic for xCo < 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo 0.5."
[7] "The xCo = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0 perovskites display a significant intrinsic CO conversion, which is related to the amount of segregated metallic Co."
[8] "This result is a consequence of the high stability in reducing atmospheres due to the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures as shown by FTIR."
[9] "The decreasing selectivity towards CH4 with increasing xCo and the increasing selectivity to longer chain length condensable hydrocarbons with decreasing xCo were attributed to changes in the average particle size of Co segregates."

1. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was studied over LaFe1xCoxO3 perovskites using a simulated gas mixture akin to that derived from biomass transformation.
2. The synthesis was conducted within a stainless steel fixed bed reactor at 300 degrees Celsius and 1 MPa pressure.
3. The perovskites with a substitution degree of xCo = 0.2 showed the highest intrinsic CO conversion.
4. The distribution of liquid products was linked to the average size of iron particles.
5. Increasing the size of cobalt particles favored the formation of hydrocarbons centered in C8-C9 chain length.
6. XRD patterns revealed two crystal systems for the perovskites: orthorhombic for xCo < 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo ≥ 0.5.
7. The xCo = 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 perovskites demonstrated significant intrinsic CO conversion, attributed to the presence of segregated metallic Co.
8. The high stability in reducing atmospheres was due to the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures, as indicated by FTIR.
9. Decreasing CH4 selectivity with increasing xCo and increased selectivity for longer chain hydrocarbons with decreasing xCo were attributed to changes in the average Co particle size.

1. 使用模拟生物质转化气体（生物合成气）的气相，对LaFe1xCoxO3钙钛矿进行了费希尔-特罗斯合成反应的研究。
2. 反应是在300摄氏度和1兆帕的压力下，在不锈钢固定床反应器中进行的。
3. 替换度为xCo=0.2的钙钛矿表现出最高的内源性CO转化率。
4. 液体产品的分布与铁颗粒的平均大小有关。
5. 增加钴颗粒的尺寸有利于形成以C8-C9链长为中心的烃类化合物。
6. X射线衍射图案显示了两种晶体系统：对于xCo<0.5为斜方晶系，对于xCo≥0.5为三斜晶系。
7. 替换度为xCo=0.1、0.2和1.0的钙钛矿表现出显著的内源性CO转化率，这归因于分离的金属Co的存在。
8. 高稳定性在还原气氛下的原因是存在由FTIR显示的正交和三斜晶系混合结构。
9. 随着xCo增加而减少的CH4选择性和随着xCo减少而增加的更长链长度可凝结烃的选择性，被归因于Co颗粒平均尺寸的变化。
