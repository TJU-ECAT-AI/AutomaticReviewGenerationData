1. The perovskites showed two crystal systems based on their XRD patterns: orthorhombic for xCo less than 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo greater than or equal to 0.5.
2. The perovskites with xCo values of 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 demonstrated significant intrinsic CO conversion, linked to the presence of segregated metallic Co.
3. The xCo = 0.2 perovskite had the highest CO intrinsic conversion because of the formation of highly dispersed, segregated Co species on its surface.
4. Pure LaCoO3 perovskite showed the greatest extent of poorly dispersed segregated Co, leading to the formation of shorter chain hydrocarbons (C8C9).

1. 根据X射线衍射图谱，这些钙钛矿显示了两种晶系：xCo小于0.5时为斜方晶系，xCo大于等于0.5时为三斜晶系。
2. xCo值为0.1、0.2和1.0的钙钛矿表现出显著的内在CO转化率，这与钙金属团簇的存在有关。
3. xCo = 0.2的钙钛矿由于表面形成高度分散的钙金属团簇，具有最高的CO内在转化率。
4. 纯LaCoO3钙钛矿显示出最差的分散性，富含分散的Co，导致形成较短链烃（C8C9）。
