Catalytic converters are widely used to reduce the amounts of
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons
in automotive emissions. The catalysts are ﬁnely divided pre-
cious-metal particles dispersed on a solid support. During
vehicle use, the converter is exposed to heat, which causes the
metal particles to agglomerate and grow, and their overall surface
area to decrease. As a result, catalyst activity deteriorates. The
problem has been exacerbated in recent years by the trend to
install catalytic converters closer to the engine, which ensures
immediate activation of the catalyst on engine start-up, but also
places demanding requirements on the catalyst’s heat resistance.
Conventional catalyst systems thus incorporate a sufﬁcient excess
of precious metal to guarantee continuous catalytic activity for
vehicle use over 50,000 miles (80,000 km). Here we use X-ray
diffraction and absorption to show that LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3,
one of the perovskite-based catalysts investigated1–4 for catalytic
converter applications since the early 1970s, retains its high metal
dispersion owing to structural responses to the ﬂuctuations in
exhaust-gas composition that occur in state-of-the-art petrol
engines5. We ﬁnd that as the catalyst is cycled between oxidative
and reductive atmospheres typically encountered in exhaust gas,
palladium (Pd) reversibly moves into and out of the perovskite
lattice. This movement appears to suppress the growth of met-
allic Pd particles, and hence explains the retention of high
catalyst activity during long-term use and ageing.
A state-of-the-art automotive petrol engine is operated close to
the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (by using an oxygen sensor and a
sophisticated feedback control system linked to the catalyst) in
order to convert simultaneously three pollutant emissions—carbon
monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides (NOx)5—into
carbon dioxide (CO2) water (H2O) and nitrogen (N2). A time lag
associated with adjusting the air-to-fuel ratio results in a redox
ﬂuctuation in the exhaust gas. We designed our catalyst system to
react to this ﬂuctuation, to achieve greater efﬁciency and to conserve
precious metals.
The conversion of CO and NOx is equal at the CO–NOx cross-
over point (see Methods for catalytic evaluation), and the conver-
sion at this point is generally accepted as a useful indicator of
catalytic activity6. Figure 1 compares the activity of two catalysts
using this indicator; one is LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 (Pd-perovskite,
our ‘intelligent’ catalyst), and the other is Pd-impregnated g-Al2O3
(Pd/alumina, the conventional catalyst; see Methods for catalyst
preparation and testing). The Pd-perovskite catalyst maintains its
high activity during ageing, whereas the activity of the Pd/alumina
catalyst deteriorates by about 10%. (See Supplementary Infor-
mation Fig. 1 for details on the conversion of different pollutants
during the sweep test.) Imaging of the aged catalysts by transmission
electron microscopy showed that the Pd particles on alumina
reached sizes of up to 120 nm, whereas only small metallic particles
about 1–3 nm in diameter were found on the perovskite surface (see
Supplementary Information Fig. 2). X-ray energy dispersion analy-
sis indicated that the small particles contain not only Pd, but also

the CO–NOx cross-over point conversion for LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 (Pd-perovskite
catalyst) and Pd-impregnated g-Al2O3 (Pd/alumina catalyst). The conversion efﬁciency
was evaluated three times for each sample by the sweep test (see Methods). The median
of the CO–NOx cross-over point conversion (see Methods) is plotted as the symbol,
together with the maximum and the minimum as error bars.

Co. The remarkable suppression of metallic particle growth directly
affects the capability of the Pd-perovskite catalyst to maintain high
catalytic activity.
To investigate why the growth of Pd particles is suppressed on the
Pd-perovskite catalyst, we conducted X-ray anomalous diffraction
(XAD)7 and X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS)8 measurements
on oxidized, reduced and re-oxidized catalysts. The measurements
were not conducted in situ or on samples treated in the presence of
petrol exhaust; instead, the samples were simply oxidized in air,
reduced by treatment in a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture, and re-
oxidized in air. We expect that the structural changes seen in these
samples will be similar to those occurring in the catalysts exposed to
exhaust emissions in principle, but some differences may exist.
Figure 2a shows the powder diffraction pattern for the three
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 samples, for the limited range of momen-
tum transfer Q that allows us to infer structural changes. Two Bragg
peaks from the perovskite catalyst are assigned to the pseudocubic
cell of the perovskite structure ABO3, where A and B cations are in
12-fold and 6-fold coordination, respectively. The positions of the
Bragg reﬂections (100) and (110) for the reduced catalyst occur at
lower angles than do the corresponding reﬂections for the oxidized
catalyst, indicating expansion of the crystal lattice. Five additional
peaks appeared in the spectrum of the reduced catalyst, which were
assigned to lanthanum oxide (La2O3) and lanthanum hydroxide
(La(OH)3). The spectrum indicates that the perovskite crystal
structure is predominant, and that the material has partially
transformed into La(OH)3 through La2O3. The fraction of trans-
formed material is difﬁcult to estimate, but the X-ray absorption
near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Co K-edge imply that
about half the Co, and thus about 20% of the perovskite, was
transformed (see Supplementary Information Fig. 3). This quantity
should depend on the reduction conditions. In the spectrum of the
re-oxidized catalyst, the (100) and (110) reﬂections appear again at
the same position as seen in the spectrum of the oxidized sample,
while the extra peaks assigned to La2O3 and La(OH)3 have dis-
appeared completely. These results indicate that the catalyst retains
a predominantly perovskite structure throughout the oxidation,
reduction and re-oxidation cycle, and that similar structural
changes are likely to occur during the ageing experiment.
XAD was used to determine the distribution of Pd in the catalyst.
The structure factors for the pseudocubic cell are expressed approxi-
mately in the form: Fð100Þ / jf A 2 f B 2 f Oj and Fð110Þ / jf A þ
f B 2 f Oj; where fA, fB and fO are atomic scattering factors for the A-
site, B-site and oxygen atoms, respectively. Figure 2b and c rep-
resents the energy dependence of the reﬂection intensity for the
oxidized catalyst. The cusp of the intensity of these reﬂections at the
Pd K-edge indicates that Pd forms a solid solution with the
perovskite crystal. Furthermore, by considering the structure factors
involved, the increase of (100) and the decrease of (110) reﬂection
intensities at the edge energy prove that Pd occupies the B-site. On
the other hand, the cusp of the intensity was not observed for the
reduced catalyst, implying that Pd does not occupy any site in the
perovskite lattice of the reduced catalyst.
The valence state of Pd can be estimated from the XANES
spectrum. Figure 3a shows the XANES spectra for Pd-perovskite
samples after oxidation, reduction and re-oxidation, together with
the XANES spectra of PdO and a Pd foil as reference materials.
Compared to the PdO spectrum, the two oxidized samples show a
chemical shift of about 1.7 eV, indicating that the valence of the Pd

in these materials is higher than the normal bivalence seen in PdO.
The edge position of the reduced sample is identical to that of the Pd
foil, suggesting that Pd is in a metallic state.
To elucidate the electronic state of Pd, we have performed ﬁrst-
principles electronic band structure calculations for Pd metal and
an ordered La2PdCoO6 perovskite (the model material for our
catalyst and based on LaCoO3), by using the full-potential linearized
augmented plane wave method in the local density approxi-
mation9,10. The calculation shows that the empty Pd 5p density of
states is lowered and broadened on going from La2PdCoO6 to Pd
metal, which explains the change of the experimental XANES
proﬁle among the three catalysts. In La2PdCoO6, the Pd 4d eg
band is ﬁlled partially by just one electron; like Co, Pd at the B-site is
therefore trivalent. Metal ions are known to be able to exist in
such unusual oxidation states in the perovskite structure by ion
substitution11–13.
The radial structure function around Pd was calculated by
Fourier transform of extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) oscillations (Fig. 3b). The local structure parameters
concerning the ﬁrst nearest neighbour of Pd were evaluated by
nonlinear least squares ﬁtting (Table 1). The interatomic distance
between Pd and O for the oxidized catalyst sample is close to half the
lattice constant for the pseudocubic cell (1.94 A
˚ ). The ionic radii of
Pd2þ, Pd3þ and Pd4þ with six-fold coordination were reported to be
0.86 A
˚ , 0.76 A
˚ and 0.62 A
˚ , respectively14. As the ionic radius of O22 is
1.40 A
˚ (ref. 14), trivalent or tetravalent Pd is expected from
consideration of the interatomic distance in Table 1. This is also
consistent with the observed chemical shift of the absorption edge
for the oxidized sample. The XAFS data thus support our con-
clusion that Pd occupies the B-site in the oxidized sample. For the
reduced catalyst, the XAD and XANES measurements suggested the
segregation of metallic Pd from the perovskite crystal, while the
segregation of Co was implied by X-ray energy dispersion analysis.
XAFS data at the Co K-edge also indicated that about half the Co left
the perovskite crystal lattice and existed in a metallic state, while the
remainder kept occupying the B-site (Supplementary Information
Fig. 3). The ﬁtting model for the metallic material suggests a
disordered face-centred cubic (f.c.c.) lattice containing Pd and
Co, as Pd is known to form a solid solution with Co in the f.c.c.
structure15 over a wide concentration range.
This model is essentially a two-shell model, consisting of Pd–Co
and Pd–Pd bonds having the same length and thermal parameter
(Debye–Waller factor). As seen from the interatomic distances
(Table 1), the average length given by the two-shell model, which
should fall between the Pd–Co and Pd–Pd bond lengths, is com-
parable with the sum of the atomic radii of Pd (1.376 A
˚ ) and Co
(1.253 A
˚ )16. The local structure of the re-oxidized sample is essen-
tially the same as that of the oxidized sample, indicating that it can
be changed in a completely reversible manner. This evidence for Pd
movement suggests that Pd might also move back and forth
between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the metal particle
lattice site in the ‘real’ catalyst, when exposed to ﬂuctuations in the
redox characteristics of the emission exhaust.

Methods
Preparation and rapid ageing of monolithic catalysts
Our Pd-perovskite catalyst, LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3, was prepared by the alkoxide
method17,18. This involved dissolving metal ethoxyethylates M3þ(OC2H4OC2H5)3
(M ¼ La, Fe and Co) in toluene. To prepare 1 mol of perovskite oxides, metal
ethoxyethylates M3þ (OC2H4OC2H5)3 (M ¼ La, Fe and Co) were dissolved in 200 cm3 of
toluene. Precipitates containing Pd were obtained by hydrolysis with a diluted Pd(NO3)2
aqueous solution (50.89 mg cm23 as Pd metal). After drying, the precursor was calcined at
700 8C for 4 h in air to obtain a perovskite powder catalyst containing Pd homogeneously.
A Pd-impregnated g-Al2O3 (Pd/alumina catalyst) was also prepared as a conventional
standard. Each catalyst was coated on the inner walls of a monolithic honeycomb substrate
(80 mm in diameter and 95 mm in length, with a grid of 64 cells per cm2), containing the
same amounts of Pd (3.24 mg cm23). In order to investigate overall lifetime performance,
the two monolithic catalysts were attached to each side bank in the exhaust system of an
automotive 4,000-cm3 V8 engine for the simultaneous ageing experiment. Then the
catalysts were exposed to the high-temperature exhaust gas at 900 8C for 100 h. During
exposure, two exhaust gas conditions were alternated; an atmosphere with large redox
ﬂuctuations (Dl ¼ ^4% at 0.6 Hz; see below) around the stoichiometric point was
applied for 870 s, then an oxidizing atmosphere for 30 s. This ageing procedure is accepted
as appropriate for the simulation of a driving strategy to achieve higher fuel economy by
introducing fuel cut-off during deceleration5,6. The parameter l is used to deﬁne the redox
atmospheres: l ¼ (the present air-to-fuel ratio) / (the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio),
where l ¼ 1 shows the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio, l , 1 means a reducing
atmosphere, and l . 1 means a oxidizing atmosphere.
Evaluation of catalytic activity
The sweep test was carried out so as to evaluate conversion of the three pollutant emissions
by shifting the mean value of l from 0.890 to 1.096 with the ﬂuctuation Dl ¼ ^3.4% at
0.5 Hz at 400 8C in a space velocity of 35,000 h21. Conversion of CO is improved in the lean
region (l . 1), whereas the NOx reduction occurs readily in the rich region (l , 1). The
conversion is equal for CO and NOx near the stoichiometric point (l ¼ 1), which is
referred as the CO–NOx cross-over point conversion. As a state-of-the-art automotive
petrol engine is operated around the stoichiometric point within an operating window5,
the CO–NOx cross-over point conversion is an indicator for the activity of the automotive
catalyst.
Thermal treatment of catalyst for X-ray measurements
This was carried out in three steps: the powdered catalyst was oxidized in air at 800 8C for
1 h, then reduced in an atmosphere of 10% H2/90% N2 at 800 8C for 1 h, and ﬁnally re-
oxidized in air at 800 8C for 1 h. After each step, the sample was mixed with a binder of BN,
and pressed to form into pellets. X-ray diffraction and XAFS measurements near the Pd K-
edge (24.350 keV) were carried out at bending-magnet beamline BL14B1 of the 8-GeV
synchrotron radiation source, SPring-8.

The parameters marked with an asterisk were ﬁxed. The sum of each shell coordination number for the reduced catalyst was ﬁxed to 12 in consideration of a disordered f.c.c. structure. The coordination
number of Pd–Pd bonding is larger than expected from the concentration of Pd and Co in the sample. This implies that all of the Co atoms did not segregate out from the perovskite crystal, or that Pd atoms
associate preferentially with other Pd atoms. The discrepancy factor is deﬁned as Pðk3xobs 2 k3xcalcÞ2=Pðk3xobsÞ2; where k, xobs and xcalc are the wavenumber of a photoelectron excited from the X-
ray absorbing atom, experimental and theoretical EXAFS functions, respectively.

A satellite geodetic survey of large-
scale deformation of volcanic centres
in the central Andes

.............................................................................................................................................................................
Surface deformation in volcanic areas usually indicates move-
ment of magma or hydrothermal ﬂuids at depth. Stratovolcanoes
tend to exhibit a complex relationship between deformation and
eruptive behaviour1. The characteristically long time spans
between such eruptions requires a long time series of obser-
vations to determine whether deformation without an eruption
is common at a given ediﬁce. Such studies, however, are logisti-
cally difﬁcult to carry out in most volcanic arcs, as these tend to
be remote regions with large numbers of volcanoes (hundreds to
even thousands). Here we present a satellite-based interfero-
metric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) survey of the remote
central Andes volcanic arc, a region formed by subduction of
the Nazca oceanic plate beneath continental South America.
Spanning the years 1992 to 2000, our survey reveals the back-
ground level of activity of about 900 volcanoes, 50 of which have
been classiﬁed as potentially active2,3. We ﬁnd four centres of
broad (tens of kilometres wide), roughly axisymmetric surface
deformation. None of these centres are at volcanoes currently
classiﬁed as potentially active, although two lie within about
10 km of volcanoes with known activity. Source depths inferred
from the patterns of deformation lie between 5 and 17 km. In
contrast to the four new sources found, we do not observe any
deformation associated with recent eruptions of Lascar, Chile4,5.
We have created radar interferograms imaging about 900 of the
approximately 1,100 catalogued volcanic ediﬁces in the central
Andes2 (Fig. 1). Included in our study are several silicic calderas
and geothermal ﬁelds. Temporal coverage is variable—for some
locations, ERS 1 and 2 (European Space Agency remote-sensing
satellites) radar data are available from 1992 to 2000, but only four
years of data are available for a few volcanoes.
We infer four major sources of deformation from the InSAR data.
We ﬁnd that Uturuncu, a stratovolcano in Bolivia, has a maximum
deformation rate in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction, ULOS,
of 1–1.5 cm yr21 (Fig. 2). An area in southern Peru about 2.5 km
east of the volcano Hualca Hualca and 7 km north of the active
volcano Sabancaya is inﬂating with ULOS of about 2 cm yr21. A third
inﬂationary source (with ULOS ¼ 1 cm yr21) is not associated with
a volcanic ediﬁce. This third source is located 11.5 km south of
Lastarria and 6.8 km north of Cordon del Azufre on the border
between Chile and Argentina, and is hereafter called ‘Lazufre’.
Robledo caldera, in northwest Argentina, is subsiding with ULOS
of 2–2.5 cm yr21. Because the inferred sources are more than a few
kilometres deep, any complexities in the source region are damped
such that the observed surface deformation pattern is smooth. We
ﬁnd no measurable deformation at volcanoes with small eruptions
or fumarolic activity during the period when radar observations
were made—Ubinas (in Peru) or Guallatiri, Irruputuncu and Ojos

It is possible that other volcanoes are deforming at rates below
our detection threshold. We quantify our sensitivity to deformation
by comparing temporally overlapping interferograms, and by con-
sideration of previous analyses of InSAR accuracy7. We estimate that
we can detect a signal of 1–2 cm amplitude that is at least 10 km in
spatial extent. Differentiating such a signal from atmospheric noise
within a single interferogram is difﬁcult, but is possible by compar-
ing multiple interferograms, as well as multiple ediﬁces within an
interferogram. Owing to decorrelation of the radar signal near many
of the volcano summits, our survey is not very sensitive to localized
near-surface deformation, as seen for example in the Galapagos8.
Because the longest interferograms that we can form for most
regions span about 5 yr (limited by data availability and maintain-
ing interferometric coherence), we can detect average deformation
rates exceeding 4 mm yr21.
We model the observed surface deformation as resulting from a
spherical point-source of volume change, embedded in either a
homogeneous or layered elastic crust. For each volcano, we simul-
taneously invert data from as many different time periods and
satellite tracks as possible, assuming a single source location. We
solve for the volume change in each interferogram separately. For
our inversions, we use the Neighbourhood Algorithm global search
approach, which can ﬁnd multiple local minima and a range of
acceptable models9. The misﬁt function is usually peaked near the
best estimate, but because of the data noise and non-uniqueness of
the problem, we instead choose to use the width of the misﬁt
function to estimate a range of acceptable values.
We consider how three different seismically derived one-dimen-
sional layered elastic models10,11 affect estimates of source param-
eters. We incorporate the effects of topography upon source depth
by using a different source depth for each pixel depending upon
local elevation12. Our experiments with different elastic structures,
topography, and the trade-off between source depth and volume
change indicate a range of possible source depths for each centre of
deformation spanning a few kilometres.
From north to south, the inferred source depths (below sea level)
are: 11–13 km at Hualca Hualca; 15–17 km for Uturuncu; 6–8 km
for Lazufre; and 4.5–6 km at Robledo. Thus, we ﬁnd no obvious
pattern in source depth within this volcanic arc. The ﬁt of the
models to the data is generally good (root mean square,
r.m.s. , 1 cm, Fig. 2), although a consistent residual northeast of
Hualca Hualca might indicate localized subsidence, and the oblong
shape of the Lazufre deformation pattern suggests the need for a
non-spherical source.
The rate of volume change seems to be time-dependent at
Uturuncu, Lazufre and Robledo, whereas the deformation rate at
Hualca Hualca seems constant within measurement error (Fig. 3).
At Lazufre, no deformation is apparent before early 1998 in two
averaged interferograms, but there is a clear signal in three later
interferograms. The temporal coverage is insufﬁcient to resolve
whether the start of deformation was abrupt or gradual. At
Uturuncu, there is also a slight increase in inﬂation rate after early
letters to nature
