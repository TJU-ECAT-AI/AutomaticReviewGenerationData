Strontium-Doped Perovskites Rival
Platinum Catalysts for Treating NOx in
Simulated Diesel Exhaust
Chang Hwan Kim, Gongshin Qi, Kevin Dahlberg, Wei Li*
The high cost and poor thermal durability of current lean nitrogen oxides (NOx) aftertreatment
catalysts are two of the major barriers to widespread adoption of highly fuel-efficient diesel
engines. We demonstrated the use of strontium-doped perovskite oxides as efficient platinum
substitutes in diesel oxidation (DOC) and lean NOx trap (LNT) catalysts. The lanthanum-based
perovskite catalysts coated on monolith substrates showed excellent activities for the NO
oxidation reaction, a critical step that demands heavy usage of platinum in a current diesel
aftertreatment system. Under realistic conditions, La1-xSrxCoO3 catalysts achieved higher
NO-to-NO2 conversions than a commercial platinum-based DOC catalyst. Similarly, a
La0.9Sr0.1MnO3-based LNT catalyst achieved NOx reduction performance comparable to that
of a commercial platinum-based counterpart. The results show promise for a considerably
lower-cost diesel exhaust treatment system.
T
here is a recognized need to lower green-
house gas emissions from mobile sources
in order to address concerns regarding
global climate change. Diesel engines offer supe-
rior fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction
potential; however, one of the technical obstacles
to their broad implementation is the requirement
for a lean nitrogen oxide (NOx) (NO + NO2)
aftertreatment system, a key contributor to the
high cost premium for diesel vehicles. Unlike
conventional gasoline engine exhaust, in which
equal amounts of oxidants (O2 and NOx) and
reductants (CO, H2, and hydrocarbons) are avail-
able because of stoichiometric combustion, diesel
engine exhaust contains excessive O2 from com-
bustion with much higher air-to-fuel ratios (>20).
This oxygen-rich environment makes the remov-
al of NOx much more difficult. A typical diesel
aftertreatment system includes a diesel oxidation
catalyst, which oxidizes hydrocarbons, CO, and
NO, followed by a NOx reduction catalyst. Two
of the most promising technologies for reducing
NOx under the oxygen-rich environment are am-
monia selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and lean
NOx trap (LNT). In an SCR system, urea solution
is injected into the diesel exhaust and decomposes
to form ammonia, which then reacts selectively
with NOx to form N2 and water. However, urea
SCR systems require a secondary fluid tank with
an injection system, resulting in added system
complexity. Other concerns about urea SCR
include urea infrastructure, the potential freezing
of urea solution, and the need for drivers to peri-
odically fill the urea solution reservoir. In an
LNT-based aftertreatment system, the catalysts
contain alkali or alkaline earth components (Ba,
K, etc.) that store NOx in the diesel exhaust to
form metal nitrates and nitrites. Once the NOx
storage capacity in the LNT catalyst is saturated,
the engine must run rich of stoichiometry (fuel-
rich combustion) to generate excess reductants in
the exhaust to remove the stored NOx on the
LNT catalysts and regenerate the NOx storage
capacity. However, the NOx-absorbing compo-
nents also react readily with sulfur oxides in the
exhaust to form more stable metal sulfates, thus
reducing the NOx storage capacity. Treatment
in a reducing environment at high temperatures
(>650°C) is required to remove the S from LNT
catalysts and recover the NOx storage capacity.
Many reports have suggested that NO oxi-
dation to NO2 is an important step in lean NOx
reduction (1–3), because NO2 enhances the ac-
tivities of ammonia SCR and LNT. For SCR
catalysts, a NO: NO2 ratio of 1:1 is most effective
for NOx reduction at lower temperatures (<250°C).
For LNT catalysts, NO must be oxidized to NO2
before adsorption on the storage components.
Because NO2 constitutes less than 10% of NOx
in the diesel engine-out exhaust, an oxidation
catalyst is required to increase the NO2 fraction.
Platinum has been found to be especially active
for NO oxidation; thus, Pt-based diesel oxidation
(DOC) and LNTcatalysts have been widely used
for diesel exhaust aftertreatment (4, 5). How-
ever, they suffer from issues such as high cost
and poor thermal durability. Consequently, there
is substantial interest in the development of better-
performing, low-cost, and more durable NO
oxidation catalysts.
Here we report that perovskite catalysts show
activities for NO oxidation similar to or higher
than Pt-based commercial catalysts. Perovskite-
based catalysts have been extensively investigated
as potential substitutes for precious metal–based
catalysts in automotive applications since the 1970s
(6–9). The perovskite oxides have a general for-
mula of ABO3, where A designates a rare-earth
or alkaline earth cation and B a transition metal
cation (9). They are attractive because of their
ease of synthesis, low cost, and high thermal sta-
bility (10, 11). The La-based perovskite oxides
(such as LaCoO3, LaMnO3, and LaFeO3) have
drawn particular interest because their catalytic
properties can be easily tuned by substituting a

small fraction of A-site atoms with other cations
such as Ba, Ce, or Sr (11–14). Previous studies
have focused on the oxidation of CO and hydro-
carbons (9, 12, 13, 15, 16) and NO reduction by
CO (17). Despite the extensive research effort,
the activities of the perovskite catalysts are typi-
cally inferior to those of the precious metal–based
counterparts. In addition, like many oxide cata-
lysts, the perovskite catalysts are susceptible to
S poisoning (2, 9).
Reports on non-Pt NO oxidation catalysts have
been rare. Wen and co-workers reported recently
that perovskite catalysts such as La1-xCexCoO3
were more active than Co3O4 (14). However, in
their work the catalyst activities were measured
using a space velocity that was 4 to 5 times lower
than that in realistic vehicle exhaust conditions.
Furthermore, the effects of S and hydrocarbons
were not investigated in their study. Therefore,
their results, although interesting, did not provide
sufficient information to evaluate the potential of
perovskite catalysts for practical applications
such as DOC and LNT.
For the present study, a series of perovskite
catalysts including La1-xSrxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1) and
La1-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0, 0.1) catalysts were pre-
pared by the citrate method (18). For the LNT
catalysts, Pd-Rh/BaO/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts were
prepared by a wet impregnation method (19)
and then mixed with the perovskite catalyst. The
perovskite catalysts were ball-milled, and the slurry
was kept at pH = 9.0 by adding aqueous ammonia
solution, then wash coated onto cordierite sub-
strates (400 cells per cubic inch). Commercial DOC
and LNT catalysts obtained from catalyst manu-
facturers were used to benchmark the performance
of the perovskite-based catalysts. Before the per-
formance evaluation, all the catalyst samples were
hydrothermally pretreated in an oven at 750°C
for 72 hours to simulate real-world vehicle aging.
Surface areas of the synthesized perovskite
oxides were low (7 to 20 m2/g), and they gen-
erally agreed with results reported in previous
studies (10). For both LaCoO3 (11 m2/g) and
LaMnO3 (7 m2/g), the surface areas increased
with the addition of Sr (20 m2/g and 15 m2/g,
respectively), suggesting that Sr may act as a
structural promoter. Surface areas for perovskites
are typically low as compared with other oxide-
based catalytic materials such as CeO2 or Co3O4,
partially as a consequence of the high synthe-
sis temperature (700°C) required for forming a
perovskite phase.
Despite the low surface areas, we found the
LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 catalysts to be highly ac-
tive for NO oxidation; the NO-to-NO2 conver-
sions for the LaCoO3, La0.9Sr0.1CoO3, LaMnO3,
and La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 catalysts are plotted as a func-
tion of temperature in Fig. 1. Conversion increased
with increasing temperatures within the kinetically
limited regime and achieved a maximum as the
equilibrium limit was reached. LaCoO3 was more
active than LaMnO3, and its activity was further
enhanced with 10 mole % substitution of Sr, reach-
ing a maximum conversion of 86% at 300°C. In
fact, conversions for the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 catalyst
were significantly higher than those for the com-
mercial Pt-based catalyst. The substantial increase
in activity by the partial substitution of a La3+ ion
with a Sr2+ ion was also observed by Seiyama et al.
for hydrocarbon oxidation, and Tanaka and Misono
attributed it to a generally accepted explanation that
the substitution of Sr greatly increased the amount
of weakly bonded oxygen in LaCoO3 (20). There
was no such promotional effect of Sr observed
for LaMnO3. One possible explanation of this
behavior could be the charge imbalance created
by the divalent Sr substitution for the trivalent La.
Because the highest stable oxidation state for
cobalt is +3, this charge imbalance can only be
neutralized with O vacancies, which could be
associated with the weakly bonded O active for
the oxidation reactions. On the other hand, Mn
cations can exist in stable +3 or +4 oxidation
states, hence the charge imbalance caused by Sr
doping in LaMnO3 could be neutralized by either
Mn4+ or O vacancies (20, 21). Therefore, doping
a small amount of Sr ions in LaMnO3 may not
result in significant O vacancies. However, further
investigation is necessary to better understand
this difference in the Sr promotion on LaCoO3
and LaMnO3.
In addition to oxidizing NO to NO2 in the
diesel exhaust, a DOC catalyst must also oxidize
CO and hydrocarbons. Although the perovskite
catalysts are very active for NO oxidation, they
are not as active as precious metal–based cata-
lysts for CO and hydrocarbon oxidation. It has
been widely reported that Pd [~70% less expen-
sive than Pt (22)] is active for hydrocarbon and
CO oxidation (23) but not active for NO oxida-
tion (24). Therefore, a catalyst containing a com-
bination of Pd and perovskite may act similarly
to a Pt-containing catalyst.
Another advantage of Pd is that it helps to
improve S tolerance of the catalysts. Sulfur is
present in most transportation fuels and lubri-

cants, and the perovskite catalysts are known to
form sulfates (–SO4) when exposed to SO2 and/or
SO3, which may lead to collapse of the perovskite
structure and loss of catalytic activities. Using a
similar strategy to that of Koponen et al. (25), we
modified our perovskite catalyst with Pd particles.
Figure 2 illustrates the oxidation performance of
a Pd-only (1.8 g liter−1) catalyst, followed by a
Pd/perovskite catalyst compared to a commercial
Pt-based catalyst with 1.6 Pt/0.2 Pd (g liter−1)
loading after exposure to 1 g of S per liter of
catalyst under the simulated diesel exhaust con-
dition. The Pd/perovskite catalyst achieved almost
50% NO-to-NO2 conversion at 250°C, whereas the
commercial catalyst showed less than 20% con-
version. In addition, the combination of Pd/Al2O3
and Pd/perovskite catalysts showed similar or
better hydrocarbon oxidation performance than
that of the commercial DOC catalyst. This Pt-free
DOC catalyst thus shows performance and du-
rability superior to those of a commercial Pt-based
DOC catalyst, with a 70% reduction in the metal
cost.
In addition to DOC catalysts, the perovskite
oxides also show the potential to substitute Pt in
LNTcatalysts. The importance of NO2 as an inter-
mediate in the storage of NOx as nitrates over LNT
under O2-rich conditions is well documented (24),
hence commercial LNT catalysts typically require
high Pt loadings. With the excellent NO oxidation
activities of the perovskite catalysts, we explored
the feasibility of substituting perovskite oxides for
Pt in the LNTcatalysts. However, using perovskite
oxides for LNTapplications represents a challenge
because of the required frequent exposure to reduc-
ingenvironmentsduringregenerationand/or desul-
fation processes, which can degrade the perovskite
structure. Fierro et al. observed such a breakdown
of the perovskite structure after H2 temperature-
programmed reduction (TPR) at elevated temper-
atures (26). H2 TPR is a useful tool in selecting a
durable perovskite LNT catalyst, and Fig. 3 shows
the TPR profiles and powder x-ray diffraction pat-
terns of the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 and La0.9Sr0.1MnO3
catalysts. The low-temperature H2 TPR peak below
500°C could be assigned to the removal of non-
stoichiometric excess O accommodated within
the lattice (27). Cobalt in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 was
completely reduced by H2 during the TPR, with a
concurrent collapse of the perovskite structure
(inset) and the formation of discrete oxide phases
after re-oxidation in air at 550°C (10, 26); mean-
while, La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 maintained the perovskite
structure with no formation of the oxide phases.
Therefore, La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 was chosen for LNT
applications because of its structural stability
(Fig. 3), despite its lower NO oxidation activities
(Fig. 2).
NOx conversions over a La0.9Sr0.1MnO3-based
LNT with precious metal loadings of 1.8 Pd/0.2
Rh (g liter−1) are plotted as a function of temper-
ature in Fig. 4, and NOx reduction efficiencies
were comparable to those of a commercial Pt-
based LNT with 1.6 Pt/0.3 Pd/0.2 Rh (g liter−1)
loading. Over 90% NOx conversion was achieved
at 350°C over the La0.9Sr0.1MnO3-based LNT,
whereas the peak NOx conversion was reached at
400°C over the commercial LNT catalyst. LNT
catalysts require frequent desulfation processes to
remove the S absorbed on the Ba sites. Accord-
ingly, we examined the effect of S poisoning and
desulfation conditions on a perovskite-based LNT.
After the sample was exposed to 1 g of S per liter
of catalyst, the perovskite-based LNT lost ap-
proximately 10% of its initial NOx conversion
efficiency (Fig. 4). After the desulfation process
was performed at 700°C in the presence of 3%
CO and 1% H2, the NOx conversion was restored
to 90% from 82% at 350°C, suggesting that most
of the S was removed.
Oxide-based catalysts have typically shown
much lower activities for NO oxidation than
Pt-based catalysts under the kinetics-controlled
temperature regime (14, 28, 29). The Sr-doped
Co- and Mn-based perovskite catalysts reported
in the present work showed NO oxidation activ-
ities similar to or higher than those of Pt-based
catalysts under realistic conditions. The potential
use of perovskites for automotive applications is
hindered by the fact that the perovskites alone are
susceptible to deactivation by S. However, the
NOx-treating performance of Pd/perovskite-based
DOC and LNT catalysts in simulated diesel ex-
haust demonstrated the potential of Pd/perovskite
catalysts as a viable substitute for Pt in diesel
aftertreatment catalysts. This substitution could
drastically reduce the cost of diesel aftertreatment
systems for mobile applications. Lean-burn gas-
oline engines will also benefit from this technology.

Heme-Like Coordination Chemistry
Within Nanoporous Molecular Crystals
C. Grazia Bezzu,1 Madeleine Helliwell,2 John E. Warren,3 David R. Allan,4 Neil B. McKeown1*
Crystal engineering of nanoporous structures has not yet exploited the heme motif so widely found
in proteins. Here, we report that a derivative of iron phthalocyanine, a close analog of heme, forms
millimeter-scale molecular crystals that contain large interconnected voids (8 cubic nanometers),
defined by a cubic assembly of six phthalocyanines. Rapid ligand exchange is achieved within these
phthalocyanine nanoporous crystals by single-crystal–to–single-crystal (SCSC) transformations.
Differentiation of the binding sites, similar to that which occurs in hemoproteins, is achieved so
that monodentate ligands add preferentially to the axial binding site within the cubic assembly,
whereas bidentate ligands selectively bind to the opposite axial site to link the cubic assemblies.
These bidentate ligands act as molecular wall ties to prevent the collapse of the molecular
crystal during the removal of solvent. The resulting crystals possess high surface areas (850 to
1000 square meters per gram) and bind N2 at the equivalent of the heme distal site through a
SCSC process characterized by x-ray crystallography.
I
n biological environments, hemoproteins per-
form many important chemical tasks involving
diatomic gases (1). These include oxidative
catalysis by activating molecular oxygen under
mild conditions (e.g., cytochrome P450), the stor-
age and transport of oxygen (e.g., hemoglobin and
myoglobin), and sensing of gas molecules such
as CO and NO (e.g., guanylyl cyclase). Increas-
ingly sophisticated synthetic models of the iron
porphyrin in the heme reactive site have been used
to understand this complex coordination chemistry
and to prepare biomimetic catalysts (2). These
model systems share at least some of the follow-
ing structural features with the heme reactive site:
an iron porphyrin, the differentiation of the two
axial binding sites (proximal and distal), a prox-
imal ligand to control gas binding, and steric pro-
tection of the distal binding site to prevent m-oxo
dimer formation. These synthetic models are
designed to function in homogeneous solution,
generally organic solvents rather than the environ-
mentally benign aqueous media of hemoproteins.
Here, we demonstrate a heme model system
based on a nanoporous crystal that possesses the
basic requirements of these homogeneous mod-
els but with the added advantage that axial coor-
dination chemistry at the iron cation is achieved
by single-crystal–single-crystal (SCSC) transfor-
mations that can be characterized directly by x-ray
diffraction. Furthermore, these crystals are com-
patible with aqueous media, and their nanoporous
structure ensures rapid access of ligands to the
axial binding sites, even by simple adsorption from
the gas phase. Ultimately, the added convenience
of these nanoporous crystals could lead to the
development of practical industrial catalysts. In
addition to Fe2+, we show that other transition
metal cations (e.g., Co2+, Mn2+, and Ru2+) that are
known to impart useful catalytic activity to porphy-
rins and phthalocyanines are incorporated success-
fully into the nanoporous molecular crystal (3).
Progress in the development of crystalline
nanoporous materials (4–6), such as the metal-
organic frameworks (MOFs), has produced nu-
merous examples incorporating a metalloporphyrin
component (7–17). However, despite the obvious
motivation to prepare nanoporous heme models,
no such material containing an iron porphyrin has
emerged. It is likely that the high reactivity of the
Fe2+ cation and its strong preference to be hexa-
coordinate results in competitive ligand binding
that interferes with MOF formation. We reasoned
that a nanoporous molecular crystal derived from
an appropriate metallomacrocycle by simple crys-
tallization would avoid this problem. Furthermore,
the subsequent study of coordination chemistry
at the axial sites of the Fe2+ cation would benefit
from the absence of an extended framework con-
taining transition metals, which could provide
competitive binding sites for ligands. In this con-
text, our interest was aroused by the seren-
dipitous discovery of the molecular crystal of
zinc 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octa(2′,6′-di-iso-
propylphenoxy)phthalocyanine, which contains
very large (8 nm3) solvent-filled voids (18). The
phthalocyanine macrocycle (i.e., tetraazatetra-
benzoporphyrin) is closely related to porphyrin,
and, importantly, the coordination chemistry of
iron phthalocyanine is very similar to that of iron
porphyrin (19). Hence, we prepared the analo-
gous Fe2+ complex (Fig. 1) from 4,5-(2′,6′-di-iso-
propylphenoxy)phthalonitrile and ferrous acetate
by using a well-established synthetic procedure
(20). Pleasingly, this complex gave a phthalo-
cyanine nanoporous crystal (PNC), isomorphic
with that of the Zn2+ complex (i.e., cubic sym-
metry, space group = Pn 3n, a = 3.74 T 0.03 nm,
Z = 12), on diffusion of methanol into a con-
centrated chloroform solution. Even minor struc-
tural modifications to such molecules can alter
markedly the subsequent packing arrangement
within a molecular crystal. Therefore, it is re-
markable that the PNC structure is obtained for
many different metal complexes of this particular
phthalocyanine derivative (Fig. 1A; M = Mg2+,
Al3+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ru2+, or In3+),
even as they encompass great variation in size,
shape, type, and number of axial ligands (Fig.
1A; L). Indeed, the addition of the bulky ligand,
t-butyl isocyanide (BuNC), to the Fe2+ (or Ru2+)
complex before crystallization enhances PNC for-
mation so that large crystals of several mm in
