A method for the preparation of NiO and Nb–NiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxi-
dation of a nickel-rich Nb–Ni gel obtained in citric acid. The resulting materials have higher surface areas
than those obtained by the classical evaporation method from nickel nitrate and ammonium niobium
oxalate. These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (7–13 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an
amorphous thin layer (1–2 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6.
Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy-
drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys-
tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, Nb–NiO
composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase
probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO. This geometric
effect is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. The close interac-
tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the
nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to signiﬁcant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings.
Hence, the most efﬁcient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3–4 at.% Nb, which
combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural
and catalytic properties of Nb–NiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed
ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is a major raw material of the petrochemical industry. It
is indeed used in the production of commodity chemicals, such as
ethylene oxide and polyethylene. It is currently produced together
with propylene by high temperature steam cracking of naphtha
[1]. This thermal process, involves gas phase free-radical chemistry;
it results in a mixture of various types of hydrocarbons [2], with low
yields of ethylene. These yields can be improved by cracking LPG
(Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas) [3]. Energy input and carbon emissions
can be lowered, to a certain extent, by catalytic approaches, which
at the same time allow tuning the ethylene to propylene ratio [4].
However, these highly endothermic processes suffer from high
energy demand and complex thermal management [5].
These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under
oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of ethane. Many materials have been shown to catalyze this
reaction, such as rare-earth oxides [6–9], alkaline/alkaline-earth
metals [10–12], perovskites [13–18], and transition metal oxides
[19–23]. Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce
ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based
systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by
Thorsteinson et al. [25] and reﬁned later by Lopez Nieto et al.
[26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a
combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]. This last discovery followed
the observation that nickel oxides displayed high activity and
selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH [28]. This was some-
how unexpected due to the high activation energy of oxygen
desorption from NiO [29]. The efﬁciency of nickel oxides catalysts
was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of
supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another
strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg,
Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these
elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]. These dopants
inﬂuence not only the amount but also the mobility of oxygen spe-
cies present in the catalytic oxides. According to Lemonidou et al.,
niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation
by ﬁlling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion

of unselective, ‘‘electrophilic’’ O oxygen species inside the bulk
and increase the number of less labile, selective, ‘‘nucleophilic’’
O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]. However, it was
recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was
limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the
Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selec-
tivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide
phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface
and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36].
In this context, we present an alternative method for the
synthesis of Ni and Ni–Nb catalysts. This sol–gel-based method,
starting from nickel nitrate, niobium chloride, and citric acid, pro-
duces oxides with high surface areas. It leads to highly active and
stable nickel oxides. The optimum levels of Nb doping is reduced,
and results in both high efﬁciency (conversion  selectivity) and
high stability in low-temperature ethane ODH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
NiCl2 (98%, Aldrich), Ni(NO3)2. 6H2O (98.5%, Aldrich), NbCl5
(99%, Strem), Niobium oxalate hydrate (C10H5NbO20xH2O, Alfa Ae-
sar), oxalic acid (99%, Aldrich), citric acid (99.5%, Aldrich), ammonia
(28% in H2O, Aldrich) were commercially available and used with-
out further puriﬁcation.
2.1.1. Preparation of nickel oxides
Protocol 1: precipitation by reaction between nickel nitrate and
oxalic acid. 1.81 g of oxalic acid was dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol,
and this solution was added dropwise into a solution containing
5.75 g Ni(NO3)2 and 100 mL ethanol. The obtained blue precipitates
were separated by ﬁltration and then washed with ethanol and
water several cycles. The last blue solid was dried at 100 C for
12 h and subsequently calcined at 400 C for 4 h. It is referred to
as NiO_oxalic acid.
Protocol 2: precipitation by reaction between nickel chloride and
ammonia. 3 mL NH3H2O (28 vol.%) was dissolved in 100 mL H2O
to get diluted ammonia solution, which was added to a NiCl2 solu-
tion (4.69 g in 200 mL H2O) slowly (approximately 3 h) under vig-
orous stirring (300 rpm) at room temperature. The resulting
precipitates were ﬁltered and washed with distilled water several
times. After drying at 90 C for 12 h, the precipitates were heated at
400 C for 4 h. It is referred to as NiO_NH4OH.
Protocol 3: sol–gel by reaction between nickel nitrate and citric
acid.
The
sol–gel
method
was
inspired
from
[37].
3 g
of
Ni(NO3)26H2O and 6 g of citric acid were dissolved in 50 mL of
H2O. The blue solution was aged at 80 C under stirring for 24 h
and then evaporated at 80 C in an open system to eliminate water.
The obtained gel was further dried at 120 C and 140 C, respec-
tively, for 2 h and lastly dried at 160 C for 12 h. The resulting black
xerogel was calcined by heating from room temperature to 450 C
with a rate of 1 C/min and then kept at this temperature for 4 h in
static air. It is referred to as NiO_SG. After calcination at 450 C, a
shiny layer of metal-like material appeared on the surface of the
black NiO powder. That metallic micro-sheet was easily removed
using a spatula, without contaminating the powder, referred to
as NiO_SG (Ni removed).
2.1.2. Preparation of Nb2O5
Nb2O5 was prepared by calcination of Niobium oxalate hydrate
at 450 C (ramp rate of 1 C/min from room temperature to 450 C)
for 4 h in static air.
2.1.3. Preparation of Nb-doped NiO
Protocol 3⁄. NixNb1xO (x = 0.99, 0.98, 0.97, 0.96, 0.95, 0.90, 0.85,
0.80), which will be referred to as Nb1x–NixO in the following,
were prepared by modifying the sol–gel protocol for nickel oxide
(Protocol 3) as follows for the, e.g., Nb0.15–Ni0.85O composition.
0.46 g NbCl5 was slowly added to 30 ml H2O. The resulting white
Nb2O5nH2O precipitate was washed with H2O until free of chlo-
rine. It was then dissolved in warm citric acid solution (50 mL,
0.63 mol L1). When 3 g of Ni(NO3)26H2O were added, the initially
transparent solution turned blue. It was kept at 80 C in a closed
system for 24 h and then under stirring for 12 h to remove the
water. The gel was dried in 3 steps. First, it stayed at 120 C for
2 h. Second, it was then heated to 140 C and kept at this temper-
ature for 2 h. Third, the gel was dried at 160 C for 12 h. The ob-
tained black xerogel was calcined at 450 C (ramp rate of 1 C/
min from room temperature to 450 C) for 4 h in static air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) in air were performed on a
Mettler–Toledo. The uncalcined samples were heated from 50 to
800 C with a rate of 10 C/min in a ﬂow of air (100 mL/min).
N2
adsorption/desorption
isotherms
were
acquired
on
a
Micromeritics ASAP2420. The samples were degassed for 2 h at
300 C before nitrogen adsorption. Surface areas of the samples
were analyzed by multipoint BET analysis method, and pore vol-
umes were estimated at P/P0 = 0.99.
The morphologies of the catalyst were imaged with an FEI
Quanta 600 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope
(ESEM). The catalyst was sputter-coated with gold in argon atmo-
sphere before measurement to make it conductive.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a
Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer, using a monochromatic Al
Ka X-ray source operating at 45 W and a pass energy of 20 eV.
The binding energies of Nb 3d core levels are referenced to the C
1s core level at 285.0 eV.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on
an Altamira Instrument equipped with a TCD detector; data were
analyzed using the AMI analysis Software. The catalyst powder
(25 mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pretreated
in ﬂowing Ar (30 mL/min) for 0.5 h at 350 C, followed by cooling
to room temperature. The temperature was then raised from room
temperature to 800 C at a rate of 10 C/min with a 5% H2/Ar ﬂow
(30 mL/min). The uptake of the H2 was estimated by 5 blank pulse
calibrations.
Rietveld X-ray diffraction intensity data sets were collected
using a Bruker D8 Advanced A25 diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano
geometry ﬁtted with a copper tube operating at 40 kV and 40 mA
and a linear position sensitive detector (opening 2.9). The diffrac-
tometer was conﬁgured with a 0.18 diverging slit, 3.2 anti scat-
tering slit, 2.5 Soller slits, and a Ni ﬁlter. The data sets were
acquired in continuous scanning mode (0.007182/s) over the 2h
range 10–140, using a step interval of 0.05 and a counting time
of 7 s per step.
The XRD data were analyzed by the Rietveld method using the
fundamental-parameters (FPs) approach contained within the soft-
ware TOPAS V4.2 (Bruker-AXS) [38]. For consistency, the same
reﬁnement procedure was used for all samples. Bunsenite and
metallic nickel reﬂections were both reﬁned with a cubic structure
(space group Fm–3m (no. 225)) with initial cell parameters of 4.18
and 3.52 Å, respectively. The proﬁle parameters included the scale
factor, a sample displacement parameter, and a ﬁve-term polyno-
mial for the background (zero to fourth order coefﬁcients). The
FPs approach calculates analytically the instrumental resolution
function. Crystallite size then becomes a function of the Lorentzian
peak broadening. Reﬁned structural parameters are the site

occupation factor of nickel and the isotropic atomic displacement
parameter of nickel and oxygen. Strong correlation between atom-
ic displacement parameters and site occupation factor prevented
the structure reﬁnement to be conclusive about the occurrence of
bulk niobium doping.
Additional peaks localized at 2h = 30.43, 35.64, 41.22, 43.80, and
60.82, characteristic of NiNb2O6 [ICSD card: 37212] [36,39], were
ﬁtted with a pseudo-Voigt function and used to improve the over-
all quality of the reﬁnement. Indeed, the latter peaks are in vicinity
of bunsenite reﬂections and tend to inﬂuence the calculation of
bunsenite crystallite size when not taken into account. Those reﬂec-
tions are considered as an amorphous NixNbyO phase which might
constitute a precrystalline network of the crystalline mixed oxide
NiNb2O6, that was identiﬁed by HRTEM-FFT studies described be-
low. Evolution of the amorphous content as a function of Nb con-
tent was roughly computed by calculating a pseudo degree of
crystallinity q.

Rwp, RBragg, GOF were, respectively, in the range of 0.9, 0.7, and 1.8

Imaging of samples was performed on a Titan G2 80–300 kV
transmission electron microscope (TEM) from FEI Company (FEI
Company, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with a 4 k  4 k changed couple
device (CCD) camera model US4000 and an energy ﬁlter model GIF
Tridiem from Gatan, Inc. (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Multiple
locations of the specimens are investigated using high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) technique. The ac-
quired HRTEM micrographs were processed to obtain their diffrac-
tograms using Fast-Fourier transforms (FFT) technique to measure
the spatial frequencies present in the images. The measurement of
the spatial frequencies allowed obtaining the d-spacings of the
phases present in the sample with an error less than 5%. The
TEM was also set to scanning TEM (STEM) mode for carrying out
the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) characterization of
sample with about 1 nm spatial resolution. Energy resolution of
GIF in EELS mode was nearly 1 eV, and furthermore, it was set to
an energy dispersion of 0.2 eV/channel. EELS signal from Oxygen
K edge (O-K edge) of 532 eV is acquired with convergence angle
of 9 mrad and collection angle of 20 mrad. GIF was also utilized
in energy-ﬁltered TEM (EFTEM) mode for the distribution of Ni-
and Nb-based phases in the samples. Ni M-edge of energy 68 eV
and Nb M-edge of energy 205 eV were selected for their EFTEM
maps. Furthermore, each elemental map is created by using a 3-
window method of generating such maps in GIF.
3. Catalyst evaluation in low-temperature ethane oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH)
Catalytic properties are evaluated at atmospheric pressure in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using a P and ID micro-
pilot equipped with a stainless steel reactor (internal diameter
4 mm). Gas mixtures of 10% C2H6/5% O2 and 10% C2H6/10% O2 in
He are introduced through the catalytic bed at a total ﬂow rate
of 10 mL/min. Gas compositions are controlled by calibrated
mass-ﬂow controllers. 100 mg catalyst was placed in the reactor
with glass wool as support (W/F = 0.6 g s/mL). It is ramped at
1/min from 200 to 400 C. The reaction mixture is sampled at
the outlet of the reactor at regular intervals, typically every
5 min, and analyzed with on-line Varian 490 micro-GC equipped
with a TCD detector and two columns: a MolSieve 5 Å column
(Ar as carrier gas) to quantify O2 (no CO is detected under our con-
ditions), and a poraPLOT Q column (He as carrier gas) to quantify
CO2, C2H4 as well as C2H6. Ethane conversion and selectivity to
ethylene are calculated on a carbon basis. To obtain different con-
version levels at constant temperature (330 C), the W/F ratio is
varied from 0.05 to 0.6 g s/mL. For stability tests, gas mixtures of
10% C2H6/5% O2 in He are introduced through the catalytic bed held
at 330 C, at a total ﬂow rate of 10 mL/min (W/F = 0.6 g s/mL), and
the reaction mixture is sampled every 30 min for about 70 h.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. NiO catalysts
4.1.1. Morphology
Three methods were considered for the preparation of NiO cat-
alysts: precipitation of nickel nitrate in oxalic acid (Protocol 1),
precipitation of nickel chloride in ammonia (Protocol 2) and a
sol–gel method starting from nickel nitrate and citric acid (Protocol
3). The speciﬁc surface areas and porosities, as well as the corre-
sponding scanning electron micrographs, are given in Table 1 and
Fig. 1.
The morphologies of the materials prepared by precipitation are
consistent with the morphology obtained in [37] by precipitation
of nickel nitrate in ammonia, with similar scanning electron micro-
graphs (Fig. 1) and surface areas of 60–65 m2/g (Table 1). The
nickel oxide prepared by sol–gel exhibits a lower surface area of
31 m2/g. It is attributed to the presence of the more dense Ni
metallic phase (14 wt.% present in NiO_SG, as determined by XRD,
Table 2), which appeared after calcination at 450 C in the form
of a shiny black micro-sheet on top of the black NiO powder. The
use of citric acid in the synthesis, which remains in the dry gel as
evidenced by TGA, indeed results in incomplete oxidation of NiO
after calcination at 450 C, as observed in [40]. After removal of
the shiny nickel micro-sheet (<1 wt.% Ni left in NiO_SG (Ni re-
moved)), the surface area reaches a value of 48 m2/g. This is lower
than the 88 m2/g obtained in [37], despite the fact that the NiO
crystallite size (13 nm, Table 2) is similar (10 nm). It is also lower
than the theoretical surface (69 m2/g) expected for spheres of
NiO (density 6.67 g/cm3) of 13 nm in diameter. This indicates a cer-
tain degree of aggregation of the NiO crystallites, in agreement
with SEM observations (Fig. 1).
4.1.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
These nickel oxides prepared by three different methods have
been tested in low-temperature ODH of ethane (Fig. 2). Despite
lower surface area (48 m2/g) and presence of <1 wt.% Ni metal,
NiO_SG exhibits a higher efﬁciency than NiO_NH4OH, which is simi-
lar to that displayed by NiO_oxalic acid. The intrinsic activity of
NiO_SG, in terms of number of mole of ethane converted per surface
unit per time unit (Table 3, Entry 3), is similar to that reported for
nickel oxides prepared by the evaporation method [34,36]. But, gi-
ven the high selectivity of our catalyst (Table 3, Entry 3), the efﬁ-
ciency of NiO_SG is 2–3 times higher than those reported so far,
with a surface-speciﬁc ethene production rate at 350 C of
3.9  108 molethene/m2/s. Finally, given the low surface area of
the published nickel oxides (17 m2/g [34] and 12 m2/g [36]), the
mass-speciﬁc ethene production rate (Table 3, Entry 3) is one order
of magnitude higher on our 48 m2/g NiO_SG and ethene yields of 9%
and 24% are obtained at 300 C and 350 C, respectively (Table 3,
Entry 3).
These preliminary results clearly show the impact of the prep-
aration method on the structural and catalytic properties of nickel
oxides catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH. The selectivity
of about 60% displayed by NiO_SG (held up to 25% conversion) is
signiﬁcantly higher than selectivities normally reported for pure
nickel oxides (20% [34] – 30% [36]). It is normally only achieved
with composite materials, such as the recently reported nickel
oxide supported on high surface area zirconia, which managed to
294
H. Zhu et al. / Journal of Catalysis 285 (2012) 292–303
reach a selectivity to ethene of 55% (at 24.8% conversion obtained
at 450 C with ethane/O2 = 2) [41]. Hence, by combining high activ-
ity and an exceptionally high selectivity for pure NiO, undoped
nickel oxides prepared in the presence of citric acid can be remark-
ably efﬁcient catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH.
4.2. Nb1x–NixO catalysts (0.80 6 x 6 0.95)
4.2.1. Morphology
By incorporating Niobium in the sol–gel method at similar load-
ing (5–20 at.%) as those published (see Experimental Part), the sur-
face areas of the resulting materials increase signiﬁcantly. The
material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area
of 130 m2/g (Table 4), which increases with increasing Nb loading
until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15–Ni0.85O. This is,
to the best of our knowledge, the highest surface area ever re-
ported for such oxides. The diffraction patterns are slightly broad-
ened and can be ﬁtted with the bunsenite NiO phase with a lattice
parameter of 4.179 ± 0.001 Å and a crystallite size of about 9–
10 nm (Table 2), regardless of the Nb loading.
The measured surface areas are thus higher than the calculated
surface of NiO spheres of 9–10 nm in diameter (90–100 m2/g). This
cannot be accounted for by the doping of the nickel oxide cubic
structure with Nb atoms. First, the expected contraction of the
NiO lattice [34] is not observed (Table 2). Second, given the molec-
ular weights of Ni (58.7 g/mol) and of Nb (92.9 g/mol), replacing
one Ni2+–Ni3+ pair with one Nb5+ (which creates one nickel va-
cancy) would result, at the maximum doping of 20 at.%, in a ca.
4% decrease in the weight of a given crystallite. The change in
the volume of the crystallite being negligible, such a 20 at.% doping
of NiO crystals would thus result in a maximum of 4% increase in
the surface area of the crystal. Besides, ﬁlling cationic vacancies
with Nb5+ cations (which, for each vacancy ﬁlled, causes reduction
of ﬁve Ni3+ into ﬁve Ni2+) would result in an increase in the weight
of the crystal and thus a decrease in its surface area.
The signiﬁcant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the
other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO

phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium
content. Bright ﬁeld images (Fig. 3a) obtained by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy performed on Nb0.20–Ni0.80O in-
deed show areas containing essentially amorphous particles. These
particles contain an intimate mixture of nickel and niobium, as indi-
cated by EFTEM (Fig. 3b). The Nb/Ni ratio is not only superior to the
theoretical 1/4 ratio, but also much larger than 1 (EELS). The diffrac-
tograms from the couple of Nb-rich areas shown in Fig. 3a clearly
indicate that some parts are completely amorphous (Fig. 3c), while
other parts display the possible crystalline signature of NiNb2O6
(d002 = 2.51 Å and d312 = 2.05 Å, Fig. 3d). The presence of this latter
phase was also identiﬁed in Ni–Nb–O samples prepared by the evap-
oration method [36,39]. Including a broad contribution of this phase
(2h = 30.43, 35.64, 41.22, 43.80, and 60.82 [ICSD: 37212]) in the
Rietveld analysis of the diffractograms allowed us to signiﬁcantly
improve the reﬁnement. According to the evolution of the crystallin-
ity degree, it can represent a non-negligible part of the sample
(Table 2).
Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the dif-
fractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of
metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the Nb–Ni–citrate gel is
thus prevented. This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio
(M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the syn-
thetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue
retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component
upon TGA in air (at about 450 C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20–Ni0.80O in-
stead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4). It also suggests that the pres-
ence of Nb in the Ni–citrate gel hinders the reduction of Ni by
citrate. This can possibly be due to a kind of geometric effect: the
Nb atoms located near the nickel atoms would increase the dis-
tance between the citrate component and the nickel atoms and
thus act as a kind of barrier. The absence of any citrate residue after
calcination at 450 C (absence of mC–H and mC=O vibrations in FTIR
spectra) excludes the formation/occurrence of high surface area
hybrid NiO–citrate networks [42]. Alternatively, it strongly indi-
cates that the high surface areas observed indeed stem from the
presence of very small nanoobjects of niobium-rich oxide, of about
1.6 nm for Nb0.15–Ni0.85O, for example, considering non-aggregated
10 nm NiO crystallites and a density of 5.644 g/cm3 for NiNb2O6. A
brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15–Ni0.85O shows a bind-
ing energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as com-
pared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as
compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent
with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativ-
ity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling
scale. This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed
Ni–Nb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6.
4.2.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
With these systems, the ethene yields systematically decrease
with increasing Nb content (Fig. 4). This decrease occurs despite
the higher surface area of the Nb-containing samples (130–
225 m2/g), as compared with that of NiO_SG (48 m2/g). The low eth-
ene yields result from a much lower intrinsic activity of the Nb-
containing nickel oxides (from 4.2  109 molethane converted/m2/s to
1.8  108 molethane converted/m2/s at 350 C), as compared with that
of NiO_SG, which is not compensated by the otherwise signiﬁcantly
higher selectivity of the Nb-containing catalysts (Table 3). These re-
sults could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on
the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active
species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM
micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites
(Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and sur-
rounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c).

shape, which are similar to those displayed by NiO_SG and highly
loaded Nb1x–NixO. The diffraction pattern of Nb0.01–Ni0.99O is sim-
ilar to that of Nb-free NiO_SG (before removal of Ni), with an average
NiO crystallite size of about 13 nm and the presence of 18 wt.% Ni
metallic phase (Table 2). On the other hand, the diffraction patterns
of Nb0.02–Ni0.98O, Nb0.03–Ni0.97O, and Nb0.04–Ni0.96O are more simi-
lar to those displayed by the Nb-rich NiO samples. First, the Ni
metallic phase is absent from the diffractograms. This indicates that
a loading of 2 at.% Nb in the Nb–Ni–citrate gel is enough to disturb
reduction to Ni by citrate upon calcination. Second, the NiO crystal-
lite sizes of 10 nm in Nb0.02–Ni0.98O and 7 nm in Nb0.03–Ni0.97O and
Nb0.04–Ni0.96O are lower than those observed in NiO_SG and Nb0.01–
Ni0.99O samples (13 nm) and close to those displayed by Nb-rich
samples (9–10 nm). Finally, all samples contain a signiﬁcant amount
of an amorphous phase (Table 2), which is present as a broad contri-
bution in the diffraction patterns. The surface areas (Table 5) are
consistent with samples containing aggregated 7–13 nm NiO crys-
tallites and a small amount of extra-crystalline, amorphous, nano-
metric Nb-rich mixed oxides. At the 4at% Nb content in particular,
the surface area exceeds the external surface displayed by unaggre-
gated 7 nm NiO crystallites (129 m2/g). A potential effect of Nb on
lowering the degree of aggregation of NiO crystallites is thus not en-
ough to explain the high value observed (145 m2/g). This latter effect
can however not be excluded.
4.3.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
Ethene yields obtained over these materials are very similar to
those obtained on 48 m2/g NiO_SG (Fig. 7a). The two formulations
containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lat-
tice parameter (4.184 Å), Nb0.03–Ni0.97O and Nb0.04–Ni0.96O, how-
ever,
seem
slightly
more
efﬁcient.
This
is
conﬁrmed
by
decreasing the amount of oxygen in the reactant feed, i.e., by per-
forming ethane ODH in the presence of 5 vol.% instead of 10 vol.%
O2 (Fig. 7b). The high yields, of up to 10% at 300 C and 25% at
350 C in the presence of 10 vol.%O2, come from slightly lower
intrinsic activities (between 2.0  108 molethane converted/m2/s and
2.8  108 molethane converted/m2/s at 350 C) associated with higher

5. Discussion
5.1. Activity
By compiling the catalytic results obtained on all NiO and Nb-
containing nickel oxides (Tables 3 and 6), it appears that mass-spe-
ciﬁc ethene production rates are quasi-stable at Nb loading up to
4 at.% (with two higher values obtained with Nb0.03–Ni0.97O and
Nb0.04–Ni0.96O), before decreasing with increasing Nb content at
higher loadings. On the other hand, intrinsic ethane ODH rates con-
tinuously decrease with increasing Nb content in the NiO samples.
Activities
of
Nb1x–NixO
represent
at
300 C
only
30–60%
(0.96 6 x 6 0.99) and 5–25% (0.80 6 x 6 0.95) of the activity of
NiO_SG (Table 5). However, NiO contributes to 50–100% of the total
surface area at low Nb loading and to 20%, at the very least, of the
total surface area at high Nb loading (48/225). Hence, the extent of
the continuous decrease in the intrinsic ethane ODH rates cannot
be solely explained by the increasing presence of a potentially
inactive Nb-rich mixed oxide phase (Fig. 3) added to similarly ac-
tive NiO particles. This suggests that the presence of Nb somehow
reduces the ethane ODH activity of NiO and that the interaction be-
tween the Nb-rich Ni–Nb mixed oxide phase and NiO crystals can-
not be ignored.
Apparent activation energies for Nb–NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH
are clearly not as affected by the Nb content as in [36]. Indeed, only
a minor decrease in apparent activation energies from about 80
(±1) kJ/mol to 77 (±1) kJ/mol at high Nb contents is observed, in-
stead of the reported 78 to 60 kJ/mol decrease. Hence, no major
change in the nature of the active site is expected; it seems that
the active site responsible for ethane ODH is hardly affected by
the presence of Nb. The values for apparent activation energies
are in agreement with those reported for ethane ODH catalyzed
by unsupported nickel oxide (75 kJ/mol) [31] or by supported Ni/
SiO2 (86 kJ/mol) [31]. They are also consistent with those reported
for Mo–V–Ni-catalyzed ethene production (18 kcal/mol = 75 kJ/
mol) [45].
5.2. Selectivity
Apparent activation energies for total oxidation are systemati-
cally higher than those for selective ethene formation for Nb load-
ings >4 at.%, whatever the O2 partial pressure (5 kPa or 10 kPa),
which is in agreement with [44]. This means that, over Nb-rich
NiO samples, high selectivities to ethene are favored by lower tem-
peratures, as observed on Fig. 8a. On NiO_SG and lightly-doped nickel
oxides, the selectivity to ethene is quite stable over the 200–400 C
temperature range (Fig. 8a). This is consistent with the similar acti-
vation energies found for ethene production and CO2 formation (Ta-
bles 3 and 6). This stability is slightly disturbed though (Fig. 8b)
when the reaction is carried out in a gas mixture containing more
oxygen (10 vol.% instead of 5 vol.%). This is due to the higher sensi-
tivity of the CO2 formation rate, as compared with the ethene pro-
duction rate, to the partial pressure of oxygen (10 kPa). It is the
case for all catalysts, which all exhibit a lower selectivity in the gas
feed containing a higher O2/ethane ratio (Fig. 8).
As the Nb content increases, apparent activation energy for eth-
ene production decreases slightly, while the apparent activation
energy for CO2 formation increases (Tables 3 and 6). The resulting
increasing difference between activation energies for ethene pro-
duction and total oxidation, with no major change on the activa-
tion energy of the overall ethane ODH process, suggests that the
presence of Nb does not modify the key catalytic steps of the
NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH process but slightly modiﬁes the elec-
tronic/geometric nature of the sites responsible for ethene produc-
tion and CO2 formation. It is also consistent with an increasing
ratio of selective versus unselective surface species at low temper-
ature in the initial stage of ethane ODH.
Selectivity to ethene indeed gradually increases with increasing
Nb content at low conversion (Fig. 9) until a maximum is reached
at
the
15
at%
loading,
whatever
the
oxygen/ethane
ratio.
Nb0.15–Ni0.85O achieves the maximum selectivity to ethene of
92% at 1% ethane conversion (Fig. 9a). The selectivity of the sample
containing more than 4 at.% Nb, however, rapidly decreases with
increasing conversion, but at 15% (Fig. 9a) or 20% (Fig. 9b) conver-
sion, Nb0.05–Ni0.95O remains more selective than Nb1x–NixO with
x > 0.95. The rate of decrease becomes faster with increasing Nb
content; it is fastest over Nb0.20–Ni0.80O. This suggests that highly
loaded Nb–NiO nanocomposites contain active sites for the consec-
utive total oxidation of ethene (ethane over-oxidation) at 330 C
[46]. On the other hand, the selectivity of NiO and the lightly-
loaded samples is pretty stable over the range of conversions
considered, especially at low O2/ethane ratio (Fig. 9a), indicating
that selectivity is essentially compromised, at 330 C, by the paral-
lel total oxidation of ethane to CO2.
5.3. Reducibility
Ethane ODH is known to proceed via a Mars and Van Krevelen
mechanism, which includes the following elementary steps [47]:
1. Interactions of ethane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/
physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the C–H bond leading to the formation of the ethyl
species.
3. Reaction of the ethyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen
(b-elimination) and formation of ethene.
4. Reoxidation of the catalyst surface by dissociative adsorption of
molecular oxygen.
Hence TPR experiments were performed in order to evaluate
the redox properties of the materials. The TPR proﬁle of NiO_SG
(Fig. 10a) consists in a main reduction peak at 310 C, associated
with a shoulder at 250 C. When Nb is incorporated into the sam-
ple, the main reduction peak shifts to 370 C in Nb0.01–Ni0.99O; it
further shifts toward higher temperatures as the Nb content in-
creases, until it reaches 430 C in Nb0.20–Ni0.80O. This peak can be
attributed to the main Ni2+ ? Ni0 transformation [48]. Its shift to-
ward higher temperatures thus shows that NiO reducibility gradu-
ally diminishes, as the Nb content increases. This suggests that the
ﬁrst step of ethane ODH (reduction of the catalyst surface) could be
hindered in Nb–NiO composites. As this step is generally consid-
ered to be limiting in ethane ODH, this could explain the lower
activity of the Nb-containing nickel oxides.
Besides, the shoulder occurring 60 C below the reduction tem-
perature of the main peak is absent from the proﬁles of the compos-
ites containing more than 5 at.% Nb. The shoulder can be attributed
in NiO_SG to the reduction of the Ni3+ cations present in non-stoichi-
ometric NiO to Ni2+. It indicates an over-stoichiometry of oxygen in
NiO crystal structure, hence the presence of cationic vacancies and
non-stoichiometric O species [48]. O species being generally con-
sidered as highly active and poorly selective, the absence of the most
active of them could account for both the lower activity and the
higher selectivity of the highly loaded Nb–NiO composites.
Furthermore, the total hydrogen consumption, normalized to
the theoretical amount of Ni atoms in the sample, slightly de-
creases with increasing Nb content (Fig. 10b), as also observed
with Nb–Ni oxides prepared by evaporation [34]. This further sup-
ports the fact that fewer active/reducible oxygen species are
H. Zhu et al. / Journal of Catalysis 285 (2012) 292–303
299
present in the Nb-rich NiO catalysts. It can stem from the presence
of a physical barrier that allows access to fewer O species. This is
consistent with the ‘‘geometric’’ effect proposed by Millet et al.
[36], in which the presence of a Nb-rich mixed oxide phase on
NiO nanocrystallites (Fig. 5) covers part of the active sites, thereby
protecting them from reduction and inhibiting the rate-limiting
step of ethane ODH. The lower hydrogen consumption can also
indicate that NiO crystallites are more reduced in Nb-rich Nb–
NiO composites. This could result from doping of the NiO crystal
structure with Nb cations, as proposed by Lemonidou and Heracl-
eous [34]. Filling cationic vacancies of the nickel oxide structure
would indeed lead to reduction of 2, 4 or 5 Ni3+ to 2, 4 or 5 Ni2+,
depending on the valency of the Nb cation. This ‘‘electronic’’ effect
of Nb on NiO would also lead to a modiﬁcation of the active sites,
which could become less active and more selective.
Hence, increasing the Nb content in the Nb–NiO composites de-
creases both the number of reducible species available and the
reducibility of these species. When Nb–NiO nanocomposites are
prepared by the citrate method, their activity in low-temperature
ethane ODH can thus be correlated with their redox properties,
the most reducible catalysts being the most active ones. This is
in contrast with what was previously reported for supported NiO
[28] and for Nb–Ni oxides prepared by evaporation [34]. In the lat-
ter case, the incorporation of Nb indeed caused the main reduction
peak to shift toward lower temperatures. This can be explained by a
size effect. Indeed, lattice oxygen diffuses much more efﬁciently in
smaller oxides crystallites, due to the higher surface-to-volume
ratio, and smaller crystallites are thus more easily reduced than
larger ones. Hence, the lower reduction temperature of 13 nm
NiO_SG (310 C, Fig. 10a), as compared with that reported for the
32 nm NiO reference used by Lemonidou and Heracleous (415 C)
[34]. Increasing the Nb content in the Nb–NiO composites prepared
by evaporation affects the NiO crystallite size and the reduction
temperature accordingly, the smallest NiO crystallites (15 nm) ob-
tained for the Ni0.8Nb0.2 composition being the most easily reduced
(340 C) [34]. On the other hand, the reducibility of the smaller NiO
crystallites obtained in high surface area Nb–NiO nanocomposites
prepared by the citrate method (7–13 nm, Table 2), is not deter-
mined by the size effect.
5.4. Stability
The fresh non-stoichiometric nickel oxide-based nanocompos-
ites prepared by the citrate method are all black in color after cal-
cination at 450 C. However, nickel oxides containing more than
5 at.% Nb turn greenish upon ethane ODH, indicating modiﬁcation
under reaction conditions and suggesting in particular the forma-
tion of more stoichiometric NiO. The stability of Nb0.01–Ni0.99O,
Nb0.05–Ni0.95O, and Nb0.15–Ni0.85O versus time-on-stream has thus
been investigated (Fig. 11). It turns out that 11%, 18%, and 44% of

rate of deactivation in ethane ODH increases with increasing Nb
content in the catalyst. This is accompanied by a slight increase
in selectivity (Fig. 11b) for high Nb contents and no signiﬁcant
change of selectivity for Nb0.01–Ni0.99O (66%).
Deactivation is thus not a function of initial activity; the least ac-
tive catalysts, i.e., those containing a large amount of niobium, are
actually also the least stable (Fig. 11a). For Nb0.01–Ni0.99O and
Nb0.05–Ni0.95O, the loss of activity correlates quite well with the loss
of surface area observed (Table 7), suggesting that the intrinsicactiv-
ity of these catalysts is retained. For Nb0.15–Ni0.85O, the loss of activ-
ity slightly exceeds the loss of surface area, indicating that its
intrinsic activity decreases with time-on-stream. This is associated
with a signiﬁcant shift of the main reduction peak toward higher
temperature in the used catalyst (Table 7), indicating that the less
reducible, spent Nb0.15–Ni0.85O is less efﬁcient for activating ethane.
It is consistent with Nb0.15–Ni0.85O being partially reduced dur-
ing ethane ODH and NiO becoming near-stoichiometric (green).
The consumption of non-stoichiometric surface oxygen species
during the ﬁrst, limiting step of the ODH reaction indeed causes
both the creation of an oxygen vacancy and the reduction of the
two neighboring Ni3+ cations to Ni2+ species in the NiO structure.
It is possible that reoxidation of the Mars Van Krevelen catalyst,
normally occurring via dissociative adsorption of molecular oxy-
gen on the oxygen vacancy and reoxidation of the two neighboring
Ni2+ species to Ni3+ cations, is hindered by the presence of large
amount of Nb (15 at.%). It is not clear whether this could be related
to the reorganization/restructuration of the Nb–NiO nanocompos-
ite suggested by BET results (Table 7), which still leaves XRD pat-
terns
rather
unchanged.
Would
instability/mobility
of
the
niobium-rich mixed oxide amorphous nanolayer at immediate
proximity of NiO surface or migration of species toward blocking
access to oxygen vacancies be involved? It seems that inhibition
of the catalyst reoxidation, i.e., reﬁll of the oxygen vacancies cre-
ated by the ODH reaction, anyhow causes loss of active sites. Deac-
tivation could thus be attributed to irreversible consumption of
active oxygen species which are not replenished.
Hence, although Nb generally enhances selectivity in NiO-cata-
lyzed low-temperature ethane ODH [49], it is clear that its overall
positive effect (taking into account both productivity and stability)
depends on the level of loading, the chemical form of Nb and the
interaction between Nb with NiO (solid solution, demixed oxide,
etc.) in the catalyst. These three parameters are clearly intercon-
nected and are a function of the method of preparation. Among
the catalysts produced by the citrate method, NiO_SG displays the
best performance ever displayed by nickel oxides; it is also the
most stable catalyst in ethane ODH. The presence of 3–4 at.% Nb

increases both conversion and selectivity, i.e., overall catalyst efﬁ-
ciency, without signiﬁcantly compromising stability. Although the
speciﬁcities of these samples are not fully understood, it appears
that the corresponding NiO crystallites are the smallest obtained
in this study (7 nm) and the smallest studied so far. They are also
the only ones presenting a slight increase in the cubic cell param-
eter (Table 2), as expected from the dependency of the cell param-
eter on the crystallite size [50].
6. Conclusion
In addition to leading to highly efﬁcient and stable NiO catalysts
for ethane ODH, the development of the citrate method for the syn-
thesis of Nb–NiO composites shows that:
1. The method of preparation has a critical impact on the phys-
ico-chemical and catalytic properties of Ni and Nb–Ni oxides;
Nb-containing NiO catalysts prepared in the presence of citric
acid in a sol–gel method behave differently in low-tempera-
ture ethane ODH than the catalysts prepared by the evapora-
tion method from nickel nitrate and ammonium niobium
oxalate.
2. Nanocrystalline NiO is obtained (<13 nm) in all samples.
3. In the presence of niobium, an amorphous phase is formed; it is
attributed to a Nb-rich mixed oxide phase close to NiNb2O6.
4. Large metallic Ni particles (38–102 nm), representing 14–18
wt.% of the nanocomposite, are produced in the presence of less
than 1 at.% Nb.
5. The presence of >2 at.% Nb in Nb–Ni–citrate prevents the forma-
tion of the metallic Ni phase upon calcination of the gel at
450 C; it also reduces the crystallite size of the formed NiO.
6. The presence of >2 at.% Nb signiﬁcantly increases the overall
surface area of the nanocomposite, up to 225 m2/g for Nb0.15–
Ni0.85O, which is a mixture of 10 nm NiO crystallites and ca.
1–2 nm amorphous Nb-rich mixed oxide.
7. When prepared by the citrate method, Nb0.15–Ni0.85O is not the
optimum catalyst for ethane ODH, neither in terms of produc-
tivity nor in terms of stability. The positive effect of Nb in
NiO-catalyzed low-temperature ethane ODH is obtained only
at low levels of Nb contents (3–4 at.%), at which high activity
and stable selectivity are obtained.
8. At Nb loading >5 at.%, amorphous interparticle Nb-rich oxide
layers lead to lower activity and, at the same time, cause deac-
tivation of the NiO catalyst, which increases with increasing Nb
content.
9. The activity of these nanometric oxides in low-temperature
ethane ODH seems to be directly related to their redox proper-
ties, the most reducible catalysts being the most active.
Since catalytic properties of Nb–NiO systems in low-tempera-
ture ethane ODH are so critically dependent on the method of
preparation used, it is expected that further improvement can be
made by optimizing catalyst preparation.
