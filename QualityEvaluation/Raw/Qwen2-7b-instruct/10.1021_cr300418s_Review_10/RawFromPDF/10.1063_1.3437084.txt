I. INTRODUCTION
The role of an automotive catalyst is to convert pollutants in exhaust gas, namely carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides
(
NO
x
)
⁠, and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). In these gases,
NO
x
is removed by reduction process and the other components are removed by oxidation process. Thus, an automotive catalyst should have good performance in oxidative and reductive atmospheres. Besides, the catalyst is exposed to heat of emissions during long periods of vehicle use. However, one serious problem is that the catalytic converter deteriorates owing to a decrease in the surface area of the metal fine particles by aggregation during long-time reaction.
Previous experiments indicated that perovskite-based automotive catalysts can maintain a high activity through making a solid solution with base crystal.1–4 X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement revealed that Pd atoms occupy the B-sites of a perovskite structure in an oxidative atmosphere, and they are segregated from the perovskite crystal to form metallic particles in a reductive atmosphere. Because this process repeats, the aggregation of metal fine particles is suppressed and the activity of catalytic reactions is kept high in a severe environment.
Although it is now clear that the Pd atoms make a solid solution under oxidative atmosphere, the information of dynamical structural transformation of the catalyst is still not sufficient. A detailed understanding of the structural change in the Pd-perovskite is required to produce the catalyst using smaller amounts of precious metals. In situ and time-resolved measurements from the viewpoint of a chemical reaction model can clarify the mechanism of the structural change. The dispersed XAFS system,5,6 which makes millisecond-order time-resolved measurement possible,7–11 enables us to determine how fast the local structure surrounding Pd atoms changes.
Recent in situ time-resolved XAFS measurements using a dispersive conformation have led to the direct observation of the atomic structural change in the Pd-perovskite catalyst.3,4 The previous study pointed out the evidence that the Pd-perovskite shows a rapid structural transformation as the surrounding atmosphere changes. In this study, we measured the in situ and time-resolved XAFS spectra of Pd-perovskite automotive catalysts by dispersive XAFS measurement at different temperatures and succeeded to observe more precise structural change. From the measurements of temperature dependence of the structural transformation rate, the key difference between the Pd-perovskite and the conventional
Pd
/

catalyst was determined. The origin of the difference is discussed to clarify the characteristics of perovskite-type catalysts having long lifetime of catalytic activity.

for 2 h in air to give a perovskite powder catalyst containing homogeneously distributed Pd.

Although this reflection plane contains second higher harmonics, larger intensity of light than that from all-odd reflection plane can be used. The polychromator was bent horizontally by setting it in a curved copper block cooled by the water. From the curvature with a radius of 2000 mm, x-rays with an energy range of 800 eV, which is restricted for producing high energy-resolved spectra, were obtained.

channels, 12 bits). The intensities in the vertical direction (about 200 channels) were summed to produce a one-dimensional spectroscopy. The horizontal focus size of the x-rays was measured to be 0.1 mm in full width at half maximum and the vertical size is equal to the sample pellet height for accumulating the intensity of transmitted x-rays. Neither vertical focusing nor the removal of higher-order reflection using a mirror was adopted.

were used as the reducing and oxidizing gases, respectively. The gases were supplied at a flow rate of 100 cc/min. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was located in front of the quartz tube. A trigger signal from a TCD that detects the difference in thermal conductivity between the gases, or a valve opening signal, was used to start the measurement. The samples were heated by an infrared furnace from the outside of the quartz cell. Between the
H
2
and
O

gas flows, He gas was supplied to the cells. The insertion of He as a purge gas was programmed to prevent the production of an explosive gas mixture. After measurement in the
O
2
atmosphere, temperature was increased to
700
°
C
in the same oxidative atmosphere for 30 s to completely restore the Pd to its oxidation state.
All spectra were taken under in situ conditions in the gas flow mode. Immediately after switching the gas flow, spectra were measured for 10 s at frame rates of 20–50 Hz. In order to improve counting statistics, measurements were carried out consecutively in a reducing-oxidizing cycle and XAFS spectra were accumulated 2–10 times.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

⁠. The change in the spectra indicates that metal Pd particles were produced from oxidized state in both catalysts after the
H

treatment. Previous study indicated that Pd atoms for Pd-perovskite occupy the B-sites of the perovskite crystal of

The time-resolved XAFS spectra of the Pd-perovskite in the
H

atmosphere are shown in Fig. 2. From the figure, it is understood that the surroundings of Pd atoms are gradually changed by the
H

injection and Pd metal particles are produced. Some

and Fourier transforms of those are displayed in Fig. 3. For Fourier transform, a range of

was typically used. Two distinct peaks in the Fourier-transformed functions at 1.5 and 2.5 Å correspond to the Pd–O shell of Pd oxide and Pd–Pd shell of Pd metal particle, respectively. We cannot determine that Pd atoms are substituted for the B-sites of the perovskite structure only from the EXAFS spectra showing no distinct structure of higher coordination in the oxidized state. We consider that the peaks of the higher coordination of Pd-perovskite are reduced due to the thermal vibration at a temperature of
400
°
C
and the static disorder derived by the Pd substitution. However, the past study pointed out that
Pd
3
+
state by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy14 and other study for similar sample indicated the substitution of B-sites of the perovskite structure by means of x-ray anomalous diffraction.1 From these results, we are convinced that the Pd atoms are substituted for the Fe-sites of
LaFeO
3
in oxidized state. The change in the spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 indicates that, in the
H
2
atmosphere, the Pd–O peak gradually disappears as the time progresses, while the Pd–Pd peak is gradually enhanced. This means that Pd atoms occupying the B-sites of the perovskite crystal gradually move out to the surface of the crystal as metal fine particles. The main change in the structure was accomplished within 2 s under this condition.

⁠. EXAFS functions are derived from corresponding XAFS spectra in Fig. 2. Phase is not corrected. Dotted lines are fitted intensities with values given in Table I.
In order to understand the dynamical structural changes clearly, structural parameters were estimated from the EXAFS spectra by the curve-fitting method.15,16 A curve-fitting analysis of Pd–O shell of the Pd oxide and Pd–Pd shell of the Pd metal was performed in the
R
-space with a range of 1–3 Å. Hanning type window with
1
Å
−
1
frame width was used for Fourier transform. Typical results were summarized in Table I. Pd configurations were treated as a mixture of Pd oxide and Pd metal. Because the measurement temperature is high and the disorder is large, we did not observe the distinct peak of higher coordination in the Fourier transform intensity of the EXAFS spectra both under the oxidative and reductive atmosphere. We took only the single scattering of the nearest-neighbors into account and neglected the multiple scattering effect because of above reasons. The fitting parameters employed for the determination of the dynamic structure were coordination number (CN) and interatomic distance (R). The edge energy shift and mean square relative displacement were fixed through fitting of time-resolved data set. The static structures of complete oxidized and reduced state were fitted with the parameters of CN, R, edge shift, and mean square relative displacement at every temperature. After this procedure, the dynamic structure were fitted by two-shell method with the parameters of CN and R of each shell with the constant values of the edge shift and mean square relative displacement which were determined by the static condition. Because the observation of low noise spectra of dynamic structure is difficult due to the limited accumulation time, we used only CN and R for free parameters in the fitting procedure of the dynamic structure. The absolute values of structural parameters were determined with comparing the complete oxidized and reduced states with the simulated spectra using the FEFF 8.4 code.17,18 The intrinsic loss factor was determined to 0.8 from Pd foil data at room temperature. Structural changes under

The structural change from oxide to metal in the
H
2
atmosphere (left side of the Figs. 4 and 5) is mentioned in the first point of the discussion. All changes show a linear slope and finish within 2–3 s. This tendency is seen in both cases of Pd-perovskite and
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
⁠. The linear slope and the lack of temperature dependence of structural change around Pd atom mean that chemical state of Pd atom does not contribute to the determination of chemical reaction rate. Adsorption process of hydrogen on the surface or diffusion process of adsorbed hydrogen determines the changing rate of Pd atoms under this condition.
It is also noted that the CN of Pd–Pd shell for
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
gradually increases after 3 s where the main change in CN of Pd–Pd shell finishes. Such gradual increase in CN is not observed in the case of Pd-perovskite. CN normally shows a small value in the very fine particle because of the increase in surface area. The gradual increase in Pd–Pd shell in
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
may indicate that the Pd metal on
Al
2
O
3
tends to move and segregate to form more stable and larger particle.
Next, the structural change from metal to oxide in the
O
2
atmosphere (right side of the Figs. 4 and 5) is discussed. From the viewpoint of structural change rate, similar trend is observed in Pd-perovskite at 300 and
500
°
C
⁠. This means that the structural change around Pd atoms in the
O
2
atmosphere for Pd-perovskite is governed by the gaseous adsorption or diffusion process as well as the case of the structural transformation in the
H
2
atmosphere. However, for
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
⁠, marked changes of the CN curves between at 300 and
500
°
C
are indicated. The temperature dependence of the change rate for
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
shows that the structural change is governed by Pd oxidation process. We note that the changes of the CN for Pd–O are highly correlated with those for Pd–Pd in all cases of Figs. 4 and 5. This strongly indicates that the structural transformations from oxide to metal and vice versa are clearly observed and the fitting procedures employed with the fixed values of the mean square relative displacement are reliable, though the CN values have high correlation with the mean square relative displacement.
In the changes of
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
under the
O
2
atmosphere, there clearly exist two types of reaction: a nontemperature-dependent structural transformation at the beginning and a temperature-dependent transformation at the following, which is clearly seen in Fig. 4. On the other hand, in Pd-perovskite, only one type of reaction which is similar with the first step for the
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
is observed. These results indicate that a large difference in the oxidation mechanism exists between Pd-perovskite and
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
⁠. It was reported that the Pd-perovskite produces the substitutional solid solution in the oxidized state.1,2 Pd metal particles in Pd-perovskite are dispersed to atomic level by making solid solution with base crystal, while those in
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
are just converted to PdO particles on the surface of
Al
2
O
3
⁠.19 
The two oxidation processes of
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
are understood as surface oxidation and inner oxidation. The latter process determines the change rate of the structural transformation and shows a larger activation energy. For the oxidation mechanism of the Pd metal surfaces of single crystal, existence of the particular surface oxide state which is considered to be the intermediate state between bulk oxide and chemisorbed oxygen has been reported.20,21 Other reports pointed out that similar surface oxide state which is the precursor structure before the nucleation of bulk Pd oxide can influence the kinetics of the growth in chemical reaction of the inner oxidation.22,23 The first process for the oxidation of
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
in our study is consistent with the above points of view for the two-dimensional surface oxide layer, and following second process is assigned to the creation of the bulk Pd oxide.
For the Pd particles on
LaFeO
3
⁠, the creation of such particular state of the surface oxide layer is not realized. Oxidation mechanism may be related to the different particle size of Pd metal particles. Some different interactions with gases as function of particle size have been observed.24–27 It also has been reported that oxidation mechanism of Pd metal fine particles depend on the particle size.28–30 Main trend of these studies is that small Pd metal particles can be easily converted to PdO stable oxide. Previous results of XAFS measurement and transmission electron microscope showed that Pd-perovskite produces fine particles with diameters of
∼
1
nm
⁠.3,4 The difference of the reaction rate under the
O
2
atmosphere in Pd-perovskite and
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
is consistent with the model that fine particles are realized in Pd-perovskite.
However, it is again noted that the Pd-perovskite does not produce PdO but
LaFe
0.9
Pd
0.1
O
3
as oxide state. The oxidation mechanism from metal particle on the perovskite crystal to
Pd
3
+
oxidized state in the crystal should be considered. Oxidation of Pd particles may start at the interface between Pd particle and
LaFeO
3
base crystal. Some studies indicate the importance of interface oxidation for oxidation mechanism of Pd metal particles.30–33 A nonstoichiometric surface structure is usually observed in perovskite-type crystals. Left La oxides can be connected to the Pd atoms and then solid solution is created under
O
2
atmosphere. The understandings of interaction between metal particles and support materials at incommensurate interface will be obtained by a systematic experiment for the different particle size which is controlled by amount of loading.
The CN values for Pd–Pd shell after the 10 s treatment of the
H
2
atmosphere and the values for Pd–O shell after the treatment of
O
2
atmosphere at
200
–
500
°

are summarized in Fig. 6. These values relate to the amounts of metal and oxide states under the
H
2
and
O
2
atmospheres, respectively. Although both of Pd-perovskite and
Pd

supply more Pd metal particles as temperature increases under the
H
2
atmosphere, CN for Pd–Pd shell shows a larger value in
Pd

than in Pd-perovskite especially at low temperature, indicating the influence of the support on making metal fine particles.34 Under the
O
2
atmosphere, Pd oxides are produced at lower temperature in Pd-perovskite than in
Pd

⁠. These results also indicate that the Pd atoms in Pd-perovskite prefers the oxidative states than those in

IV. CONCLUSION
The local structural change in a Pd-perovskite automotive catalyst is compared with that of a conventional
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
catalyst using real-time-resolved dispersive XAFS spectra. There is a marked difference in structural transformation between the two catalysts in an oxidative atmosphere. The activation energy of the oxidation of inner Pd metal particles for
Pd
/
Al
2
O
3
is larger than that for Pd-perovskite. This implies that forming a solid solution of Pd-perovskite in an oxidative atmosphere is the key of understanding the mechanism of Pd-perovskite automotive catalyst.
