[1] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[2] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[3] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[4] "We conclude that, in the case of La-doped ceria, doping with La affects all surface oxygen atoms in the supercell and adsorbing a H atom compensates the effect of La on all oxygen atoms."
[5] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[6] "In all cases, doping with Na (our representative for LVD2) activates a surface oxygen atom next to the dopant, as evidenced by a substantial decrease in ΔEv and an increase in ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4, as compared to the undoped La2O3."

The diversity of properties in niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, can significantly influence their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The behavior of these dopants can lead to complex catalytic systems where theoretical predictions may not align perfectly with experimental observations due to the intricate interactions between dopants and catalysts. Challenges in reconciling these discrepancies often stem from understanding how dopants modify the electronic structure of NiO, potentially altering its reactivity and selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Key factors include the stability of dopant species, their compatibility with NiO, and the extent to which they can introduce defects or modify surface properties. Experimental studies might need to consider a wide range of dopant conditions and assess their effects on catalytic activity and stability. Additionally, the interplay between dopants and the NiO lattice can lead to unexpected behavior, necessitating detailed characterization and modeling efforts to predict and optimize catalyst performance.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by activating the surface oxygen atoms. This activation enhances the catalytic activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the presence of the dopant also leads to the adsorption of electron donors like H or CH3, which counteracts the effect of the dopant through a chemical compensation mechanism. This compensation effect introduces complexities in the catalytic reactions, particularly those involving electron-donating adsorbates. The rate-limiting step may not solely be the breaking of the CH bond but also the prompt removal of H and CH3 from the surface to maintain the catalyst's activity.

In reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, one faces challenges due to the intricate interplay between the dopant's activation effect and the chemical compensation mechanism. Theoretical models must accurately capture the long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface induced by the dopant and the subsequent effects of electron donors. Experimental data, on the other hand, might not always reflect the dynamic equilibrium between the activation and compensation processes, leading to discrepancies between theoretical expectations and observed catalytic performances.

铌氧化物的不同性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，通过激活表面氧原子。这种激活增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。然而，掺杂剂的存在导致吸附电子供体如H或CH3，通过化学补偿机制抵消了掺杂剂的效果。这种补偿效应在涉及电子供体的催化反应中引入了复杂性，特别是对于断裂CH键的步骤可能不是唯一的限制因素，还有可能是从表面上迅速去除H和CH3以维持催化剂的活性。

在理论预测与实验观察之间达成一致时，会遇到挑战，因为激活作用与补偿机制之间的复杂相互作用。理论模型必须准确捕捉掺杂剂对表面氧原子化学的远距离修改及其后续对电子供体的影响。而实验数据可能不会总是反映激活和补偿过程之间的动态平衡，从而导致理论预期与观测到的催化性能之间的差异。

The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1). First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide.
Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant. We call this a chemical compensation effect.
The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates. Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive. This crude picture is reinforced by the analysis of the partial density of states for all the systems studied here. The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide. In the case of LaCeO2 the molecular orbital in question is delocalized and consists mainly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations.
We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s. The compensation effect proposed here introduces interesting complications in those reactions, catalyzed by an oxide doped with an LVD1, that involve the formation of electron-donating adsorbates (e.g., hydroxyls or organic radicals). Consider, for example, the activation of methane by an oxide catalyst doped with an LVD1. The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides. However, the dissociation produces H and CH3 bonded to the oxygen atoms of the surface, which act as compensating agents. If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst. We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The lower valence of the dopants compared to the host cation creates an electron deficit at the surface, which affects the binding strength of oxygen atoms to the doped surface. Adsorbing an electron donor onto the doped oxide surface helps heal this electron deficit, thereby reducing the reactivity of the surface and potentially influencing the efficiency of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The presence of electron-donating species, like hydroxyls or organic radicals, complicates the catalytic process by introducing a chemical compensation effect, where the presence of these species counteracts the initial activation of the surface due to the dopant. This can lead to poisoning of the catalyst if the electron-donating species are not removed efficiently from the surface. The rate-limiting step in the catalytic process might shift from the breaking of the CH bond to the removal of the electron-donating species from the surface.

铌氧化物的不同特性，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。与宿主阳离子相比，掺杂物较低的电荷值在表面创建了一个电子缺陷，这影响了表面氧原子与掺杂物的结合强度。在掺杂物表面上吸附电子供体有助于修复这个电子缺陷，从而降低表面活性，可能影响乙烷氧化脱氢的效率。存在的电子供体物种，如羟基或有机自由基，会复杂化催化过程，引入化学补偿效应，其中这些物种会抵消由于掺杂物而表面初始的激活作用。如果从表面上有效去除这些电子供体物种，则可能会导致催化剂中毒。催化过程中的限速步骤可能是从断裂CH键到从表面上去除电子供体物种。
