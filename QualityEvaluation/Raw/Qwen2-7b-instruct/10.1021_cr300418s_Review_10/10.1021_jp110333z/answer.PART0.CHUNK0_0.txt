[1] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[2] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[3] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[4] "We conclude that, in the case of La-doped ceria, doping with La affects all surface oxygen atoms in the supercell and adsorbing a H atom compensates the effect of La on all oxygen atoms."
[5] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[6] "In all cases, doping with Na (our representative for LVD2) activates a surface oxygen atom next to the dopant, as evidenced by a substantial decrease in ΔEv and an increase in ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4, as compared to the undoped La2O3."

1. The presence of dopants enhances the oxidizing capacity of oxides. 
2. Adsorbing electron donors on the surface effectively neutralizes the impact of dopants.
3. Adsorbing hydrogen or CH3 radicals on a dopant-modified oxide surface leads to chemistry resembling that of the undoped surface.
4. In the case of lanthanum-doped ceria, the dopant influences all oxygen atoms on the surface, and adsorbing a hydrogen atom compensates for the dopant's effects on all of them.
5. The long-range effects of dopants or compensating hydrogen atoms are due to a delocalized orbital involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms.
6. Sodium doping activates a nearby surface oxygen atom, indicated by a significant reduction in ΔEv and increases in ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4, compared to undoped lanthanum oxide.

1. 添加掺杂剂可以提高氧化物的氧化能力。
2. 在表面吸附电子供体可以有效地抵消掺杂剂的影响。
3. 在掺杂氧化物的表面上吸附氢或CH3基团会导致化学性质类似于未掺杂的表面。
4. 对镧掺杂的二氧化铈而言，掺杂剂影响所有表面氧原子，并且吸附一个氢原子可以补偿掺杂剂对所有氧原子的影响。
5. 掺杂剂或补偿氢原子的远距离效应是由于涉及表面氧原子原子轨道的分布式轨道被填充或空出。
6. 氧化镧中钠掺杂激活了一个附近的表面氧原子，表明与未掺杂镧氧化物相比，ΔEv显著减少，而ΔEH、ΔECH3和ΔECH4增加。
