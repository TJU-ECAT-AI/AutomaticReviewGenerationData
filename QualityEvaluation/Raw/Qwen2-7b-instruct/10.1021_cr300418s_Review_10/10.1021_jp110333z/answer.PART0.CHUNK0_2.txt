[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant."
[4] "We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by activating the surface oxygen atoms. This activation enhances the catalytic activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the presence of the dopant also leads to the adsorption of electron donors like H or CH3, which counteracts the effect of the dopant through a chemical compensation mechanism. This compensation effect introduces complexities in the catalytic reactions, particularly those involving electron-donating adsorbates. The rate-limiting step may not solely be the breaking of the CH bond but also the prompt removal of H and CH3 from the surface to maintain the catalyst's activity.

In reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, one faces challenges due to the intricate interplay between the dopant's activation effect and the chemical compensation mechanism. Theoretical models must accurately capture the long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface induced by the dopant and the subsequent effects of electron donors. Experimental data, on the other hand, might not always reflect the dynamic equilibrium between the activation and compensation processes, leading to discrepancies between theoretical expectations and observed catalytic performances.

铌氧化物的不同性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，通过激活表面氧原子。这种激活增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。然而，掺杂剂的存在导致吸附电子供体如H或CH3，通过化学补偿机制抵消了掺杂剂的效果。这种补偿效应在涉及电子供体的催化反应中引入了复杂性，特别是对于断裂CH键的步骤可能不是唯一的限制因素，还有可能是从表面上迅速去除H和CH3以维持催化剂的活性。

在理论预测与实验观察之间达成一致时，会遇到挑战，因为激活作用与补偿机制之间的复杂相互作用。理论模型必须准确捕捉掺杂剂对表面氧原子化学的远距离修改及其后续对电子供体的影响。而实验数据可能不会总是反映激活和补偿过程之间的动态平衡，从而导致理论预期与观测到的催化性能之间的差异。
