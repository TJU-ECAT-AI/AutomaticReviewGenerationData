[1] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[2] "In this case, the effect of the dopant is to make the surface a better oxidant, facilitating the removal of an oxygen atom from the surface."
[3] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[4] "This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations."
[5] "We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

1. The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant by facilitating the removal of an oxygen atom from the surface.
2. Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface heals the electron deficit, reducing the reactivity of the oxide.
3. Doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms due to the delocalized molecular orbital in the valence band.
4. The rate-limiting step in the catalytic process might not be the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface.

1. 添加掺杂剂可以使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，促进表面氧原子的去除。
2. 在表面上吸附电子供体可以修复电子缺陷，降低氧化物的活性。
3. 钐掺杂对所有表面氧原子的反应性影响是均匀的，因为涉及到的分子轨道是部分填充且空间分布广泛的。
4. 在催化过程中，可能限制步骤不是断开CH键，而是从表面移除H和CH3分子。
