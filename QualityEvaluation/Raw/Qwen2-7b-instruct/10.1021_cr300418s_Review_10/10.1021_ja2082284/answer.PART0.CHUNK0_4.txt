The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The self-regeneration process of PdLaFeO3 catalysts involves the redox cycling of metal ions within the catalyst structure, which is a finding that challenges previous theoretical models predicting a different mechanism for catalyst regeneration. Experimental observations show that the catalyst regenerates through a series of steps involving the dissolution and re-precipitation of metal species.
