[4] "Unlike the case of Au(111) supported MoS2 studied by STM in previous work,6 the catalysts probed herein are more commercially relevant,which also implies that they are less homogeneous and more difficult to image on the atomic scale."
[5] "It has been found that DGH, the hydrogen binding energy to a given surface, is a good descriptor for identifying electrocatalyst materials with high exchange current densities."
[6] "We have calculated DFT values are best compared to experimental data where the activity has been normalized with respect to the number of active sites on the catalyst, in this case the number and type of edge sites on the different metal sulfides."
[7] "The findings are corroborated by DFT calculations showing that the activity of the different samples should be WS2 < MoS2  CoMoS < CoWS."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the complexity of the interactions between the dopants and the catalyst matrix. The document highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogen binding energy (DGH) on surfaces as a key descriptor for identifying high-performance electrocatalyst materials. It also discusses the comparison between DFT-calculated values and experimental data to normalize activity based on the number of active sites, particularly focusing on the number and type of edge sites on metal sulfides. The results indicate that the activity order for the studied samples should be WS2 < MoS2  CoMoS < CoWS, supporting the effectiveness of cobalt promotion in enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.

铌氧化物的多样属性，包括它们的不同稳定形态和氧化状态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂行为。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的整合存在挑战，这主要由于掺杂剂与催化剂基质之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。文献强调了理解表面的氢吸附能（DGH）作为识别高性能电催化剂材料的关键描述符的重要性。它还讨论了将DFT计算值与实验数据进行比较以根据催化剂上活性位点的数量进行归一化活动的方法，特别是针对金属硫化物边缘位点的数量和类型。结果表明，不同样品的活动顺序应为WS2 < MoS2  CoMoS < CoWS，支持了促进钴在增强氢演化反应（HER）活性方面的有效性。
