<p>Introduction Research efforts to develop electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions have increased substantially in recent years.</p>
<p>It has been found that DGH, the hydrogen binding energy to a given surface, is a good descriptor for identifying electrocatalyst materials with high exchange current densities.</p>
<p>A recent study5 using DFT showed that the active sites on nitrogenase and hydrogenase bind hydrogen weakly, similar to Pt.</p>
<p>By having identified the active site of MoS2 particles, the next step is to modify that edge such that its DGH approaches even closer to zero where the HER volcano curve has its maximum, and this is a major aim of the work presented herein.</p>
<p>In the following, we will show our investigation of MoS2, WS2 and cobalt promoted WS2 (CoWS) and MoS2 (CoMoS), prepared similarly to the ones imaged by Brorson et al.11 and supported on Toray carbon paper.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 Tafel plot (main) and polarization curve (inset) in the cathodic potential range of MoS2 supported on Toray paper. The scan rate is 5 mV s−1 and the Tafel slope in the HER region is found to be 120 mV dec−1.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 Cyclic voltammogram of the oxidation and subsequent deactivation of the MoS2 sample. Scan rate 2 mV s−1. Main: the deactivation of the sample showing one sweep from 0.35 V vs. NHE to 1.05 V vs. NHE and back to 0.35 V vs. NHE. On the 1st anodic sweep an irreversible oxidation peak occurs at 0.6 V vs. NHE and is followed by a subsequent decrease in current at cathodic potentials (0.35 V vs. NHE), indicating a deactivation of the active sites.</p>
<p>We note that the Mo peaks of the MoO3 were significantly greater than the Mo peaks observed on the other samples and at the same time the C 1s peak was significantly smaller.</p>
<p>Fig. 6A shows the initial and the stable Tafel (log iE) and polarization curves (iE) within a narrow potential window (maximum +0.1 V vs. NHE).</p>
<p>The decrease is most likely due to the CoSx instability in sulfuric acid, introducing ambiguity into the interpretation of the current at cathodic potentials as the HER competes with cathodic desorption or dissolution of CoSx.</p>
<p>The Tafel slopes are also in the expected region (Co WS 132 mV dec−1, CoMoS 101 mV dec−1).</p>
<p>In Fig. 9 exhibits normalized polarization curves (Ei) pertaining to each of the different samples.</p>

The document discusses the investigation of various metal sulfides, including MoS2, WS2, and their cobalt-promoted versions (CoMoS, CoWS), as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Tafel plots and polarization curves demonstrate the HER activity of these materials. The document also explores the electrochemical oxidation of MoS2, revealing that it occurs at high anodic potentials, with the irreversible oxidation peaks suggesting the presence of edge sites on the material. The cobalt-promoted versions exhibit enhanced HER activity compared to the unpromoted versions, as indicated by the Tafel slopes and normalized polarization curves. The document employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the hydrogen binding energies (DGH) on different surfaces of the metal sulfides, which correlate with their catalytic performance. The study aims to understand the structure-activity relationships for these systems and optimize their activity for the HER.

本文讨论了对各种金属硫化物，包括MoS2、WS2及其钴促进版本（CoMoS、CoWS）作为氢演化反应（HER）催化剂的调查。Tafel图和极化曲线展示了这些材料的HER活性。文档还探讨了MoS2的电化学氧化，表明它在高正向电位下发生，不可逆氧化峰提示材料上的边缘位点存在。钴促进版本显示出与未促进版本相比增强的HER活性，这从Tafel斜率和归一化极化曲线中可以看出来。文档利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算预测不同金属硫化物表面的氢结合能（DGH），这与它们的催化性能相关联。研究旨在理解这些系统的结构-活性关系并优化其HER活性。
