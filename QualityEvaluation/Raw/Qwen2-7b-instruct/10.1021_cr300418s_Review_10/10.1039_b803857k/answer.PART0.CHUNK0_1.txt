1. We have conducted research on cobalt-promoted and un-promoted nanocrystalline MoS2 and WS2 structures. Our findings show that they are irreversibly oxidized at high anodic potentials through cyclic voltammetry.

2. We utilized the irreversible oxidation characteristics to ascertain the surface area of MoS2 and hypothesized a plausible oxidation pathway for MoS2.

3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the oxidation state of MoS2 remained unchanged post hydrogen evolution reaction measurements; however, MoS2 underwent oxidation at potentials exceeding 0.6 V vs. NHE.

4. The performance of carbon-supported MoS2 was found to be comparable to our earlier published outcomes for Au(111)-supported MoS2.

5. WS2 shares a comparable structure and was likewise examined within this study.

6. It was discovered to oxidize irreversibly at high anodic potentials, akin to MoS2, and exhibited nearly equivalent activity.

7. We carried out experiments on cobalt-promoted MoS2 and WS2 samples, and it was confirmed that cobalt indeed enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both cases.

8. The results are validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, indicating that the catalytic efficiency of the various samples should be ranked as WS2 < MoS2 < CoMoS < CoWS.

1. 我们对含钴促进和未促进的纳米晶MoS2和WS2结构进行了研究。通过循环伏安法，我们发现它们在高阳极电位下不可逆氧化。

2. 我们利用不可逆氧化特征来确定MoS2的表面积，并提出了MoS2可能的氧化机制。

3. X射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析显示，MoS2在氢演化反应测量后氧化状态保持不变；然而，在超过0.6 V vs. NHE的电压下，MoS2被氧化。

4. 碳支持的MoS2的性能与我们之前在Au(111)-支持的MoS2上发表的结果相当。

5. WS2具有相似的结构，并且也在本研究中进行了研究。

6. 它们在高阳极电位下不可逆氧化，类似于MoS2，并且具有几乎相同的活性。

7. 对于含钴促进的MoS2和WS2样品，我们进行了实验，并证实了钴确实促进了两种情况下氢演化反应（HER）。

8. 根据密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的结果，各种样品的催化效率应按以下顺序排列：WS2 < MoS2 < CoMoS < CoWS。
