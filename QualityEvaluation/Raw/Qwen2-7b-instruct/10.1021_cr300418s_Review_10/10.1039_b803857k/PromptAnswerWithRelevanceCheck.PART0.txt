The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the complexity of the interactions between the dopants and the catalyst matrix. The document highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogen binding energy (DGH) on surfaces as a key descriptor for identifying high-performance electrocatalyst materials. It also discusses the comparison between DFT-calculated values and experimental data to normalize activity based on the number of active sites, particularly focusing on the number and type of edge sites on metal sulfides. The results indicate that the activity order for the studied samples should be WS2 < MoS2  CoMoS < CoWS, supporting the effectiveness of cobalt promotion in enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.

<p>A recent study5 using DFT showed that the active sites on nitrogenase and hydrogenase bind hydrogen weakly, similar to Pt.</p>
<p>By having identified the active site of MoS2 particles, the next step is to modify that edge such that its DGH approaches even closer to zero where the HER volcano curve has its maximum, and this is a major aim of the work presented herein.</p>
<p>In the following, we will show our investigation of MoS2, WS2 and cobalt promoted WS2 (CoWS) and MoS2 (CoMoS), prepared similarly to the ones imaged by Brorson et al.11 and supported on Toray carbon paper.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 Tafel plot (main) and polarization curve (inset) in the cathodic potential range of MoS2 supported on Toray paper. The scan rate is 5 mV s−1 and the Tafel slope in the HER region is found to be 120 mV dec−1.</p>

Main: the deactivation of the sample showing one sweep from 0.35 V vs. NHE to 1.05 V vs. NHE and back to 0.35 V vs. NHE. On the 1st anodic sweep an irreversible oxidation peak occurs at 0.6 V vs. NHE and is followed by a subsequent decrease in current at cathodic potentials (0.35 V vs. NHE), indicating a deactivation of the active sites.</p>
<p>We note that the Mo peaks of the MoO3 were significantly greater than the Mo peaks observed on the other samples and at the same time the C 1s peak was significantly smaller.</p>
<p>Fig. 6A shows the initial and the stable Tafel (log iE) and polarization curves (iE) within a narrow potential window (maximum +0.1 V vs. NHE).</p>
<p>The decrease is most likely due to the CoSx instability in sulfuric acid, introducing ambiguity into the interpretation of the current at cathodic potentials as the HER competes with cathodic desorption or dissolution of CoSx.</p>

The document discusses the investigation of various metal sulfides, including MoS2, WS2, and their cobalt-promoted versions (CoMoS, CoWS), as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Tafel plots and polarization curves demonstrate the HER activity of these materials. The document also explores the electrochemical oxidation of MoS2, revealing that it occurs at high anodic potentials, with the irreversible oxidation peaks suggesting the presence of edge sites on the material. The cobalt-promoted versions exhibit enhanced HER activity compared to the unpromoted versions, as indicated by the Tafel slopes and normalized polarization curves. The document employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the hydrogen binding energies (DGH) on different surfaces of the metal sulfides, which correlate with their catalytic performance. The study aims to understand the structure-activity relationships for these systems and optimize their activity for the HER.

<p>It has been found that DGH, the hydrogen binding energy to a given surface, is a good descriptor for identifying electrocatalyst materials with high exchange current densities.1,7,8 A recent study5 using DFT showed that the active sites on nitrogenase and hydrogenase bind hydrogen weakly, similar to Pt. It was also found that the over- potential of carbon supported MoS2 is comparable to the DFT calculated hydrogen binding energy on the edge of the nanoparticles. In another study, MoS2 nanopar- ticles on Au(111) were synthesized under UHV conditions, characterized by STM and examined for HER activity.6 This study showed direct evidence that the active site of the MoS2 nanoparticles is indeed the edge.</p>
<p>The electrochemical oxidation of nanoparticulate MoS2 is not covered in the literature, which instead focuses on the corrosion of bulk MoS2. Kau-tek and Gerischer16 found that the bulk system preferentially oxidized at the (10 11) face and that it did not corrode at the (0001) basal plane. On the nanoparticles this would correspond to corrosion of the particle edges. Closer examination of the insert of Fig. 2 reveals two distinct oxidation peaks. The major peak has its maximum at approx. +0.98 V vs. NHE whereas the minor peak has its maximum at approx. +0.7 V vs. NHE. As the edges of MoS2 nanoparticles are expected to be more readily oxidized than the basal plane,16 we interpret the two distinct oxidation peaks to correspond to the edges (minor peak, +0.7 V vs. NHE) and the basal planes (major peak, +0.98 V vs. NHE) of the particles.</p>
<p>In order to determine the activity of the MoS2/C system per active site, we start with the irreversible oxidation to estimate the total surface area of MoS2 on the Toray paper. The irreversible oxidation peak of the sample, shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,has a charge of 0.014 C. If we assume that 11 electrons are involved in the oxidation of MoS2, as presented in the previous section, the surface area will be 3.8 cm2 of single layered MoS2 giving an exchange current density (i0) of 1.2  106 A cm2 (and a Tafel slope of 120mV dec1).</p>
<p>WS2 exhibits a layered structure similar to MoS2,11,12 forming the same triangular shape as MoS2 when prepared under similar conditions. WS2 supported on Toray paper has previously been proposed as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.22 The WS2 was studied on Toray paper and the preparation method was similar to that of the MoS2 samples.</p>
<p>The first step in testing the promotion by cobalt is the test of sulfided cobalt itself. We have used Co(acetate) as the Co precursor as described in ref. 11. The precursor was sulfided under the same conditions as the MoS2 and the WS2 samples. The Co is expected to be in the form of Co8S9 immediately after sulfidation, but as this form is not stable in air,24 our Co sulfide is most likely partially sulfided (CoSx).</p>
<p>Cobalt promoted MoS2(CoMoS) and WS2(CoWS) was prepared by co-impregnation of the Mo/W and the Co precursor. Fig. 7A and C shows the Tafel (log iE) and the polarization (inset) curve (iE) within a narrow potential window (maximum +0.1 V vs. NHE). The HER current diminishes just as on the pure CoSx sample: it is initially high and after subsequent sweeps the current decreases noticeably, but unlike the case of pure CoSx, remains stable at a fairly high level.</p>
<p>Fig. 9 exhibits normalized polarization curves (Ei) pertaining to each of the different samples. There is an apparent promotion effect of Co on both the MoS2 and the WS2 samples. The promotion effect on the WS2 sample can be explained by the DFT calculations predicting that the Co promotion should decrease the free energy of hydrogen adsorption from 0.22 eV to 0.07 eV on the S-edge, and thus effectively increasing the activity of the active site.</p>

1. The hydrogen binding energy to a given surface, known as DGH, helps identify electrocatalyst materials with high exchange current densities. Studies using density functional theory (DFT) have shown that the active sites on nitrogenase and hydrogenase bind hydrogen weakly, similar to platinum. Carbon supported MoS2 has an overpotential comparable to the DFT calculated hydrogen binding energy on the edge of the nanoparticles.

2. The electrochemical oxidation of MoS2 nanoparticles is focused on, revealing that the bulk system prefers to oxidize at the (10 11) face and does not corrode at the (0001) basal plane. The two distinct oxidation peaks observed on the nanoparticles indicate oxidation of the edges (minor peak, +0.7 V vs. NHE) and the basal planes (major peak, +0.98 V vs. NHE).

3. To determine the activity of MoS2/C per active site, the irreversible oxidation peak is utilized to estimate the total surface area of MoS2 on the Toray paper. Assuming 11 electrons are involved in the oxidation of MoS2, the surface area is calculated to be 3.8 cm2 of single layered MoS2, yielding an exchange current density (i0) of 1.2 × 10^6 A cm^-2.

4. WS2, similar to MoS2, exhibits a layered structure and has been proposed as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution. Preparation on Toray paper follows a method akin to MoS2 samples.

5. Testing the promotion by cobalt involves sulfided cobalt itself, which is expected to form Co8S9 but is likely partially sulfided (CoSx) due to its instability in air.

6. Cobalt promoted MoS2 (CoMoS) and WS2 (CoWS) are prepared by co-impregnation of the Mo/W and Co precursor. The HER current decreases after initial high levels, unlike in the case of pure CoSx, and remains stable at a higher level.

7. Normalized polarization curves for different samples exhibit a promotion effect of cobalt on both MoS2 and WS2. DFT calculations predict that cobalt promotion reduces the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, enhancing the activity of the active site on WS2 from 0.22 eV to 0.07 eV on the S-edge.

1. DGH，即氢吸附到特定表面的能量，被证明是识别具有高交换电流密度的电催化剂材料的重要指标。使用密度泛函理论（DFT）的研究发现，氮酶和氢酶的活性位点与铂类似，其氢吸附力较弱。碳支持的MoS2的过电势与纳米粒子边缘处的DFT计算的氢吸附能量相当。

2. 对于MoS2纳米颗粒的电化学氧化进行了研究，发现该系统倾向于在(10 11)面氧化，并且不会在(0001)基平面腐蚀。观察到的两个不同氧化峰分别对应于边缘（小峰，+0.7 V vs. NHE）和基平面（大峰，+0.98 V vs. NHE）。

3. 为了确定MoS2/C中每个活性位点的活性，利用不可逆氧化峰估计了Toray纸上MoS2的总面积。假设在MoS2氧化过程中涉及11个电子，则面积被计算为单层MoS2的3.8 cm²，产生1.2×10^6 A cm^-2的交换电流密度（i0）。

4. WS2与MoS2相似，表现出层状结构，并且被提议用作氢进化反应的催化剂。Toray纸上对WS2的制备方法与MoS2样品类似。

5. 用于测试钴促进作用的第一步是对自身进行硫化处理的钴。预期其会形成Co8S9，但因其在空气中不稳定，我们的钴硫化物很可能是部分硫化的（CoSx）。

6. 钴促进的MoS2（CoMoS）和WS2（CoWS）通过将Mo/W和钴前体进行共浸渍制备。Tafel（log iE）和极化曲线（inset）显示，在窄电压窗口（最大+0.1 V vs. NHE）内，与纯CoSx样本相比，初始高电流降低明显，但与纯CoSx不同，保持在较高水平。

7. 不同样本的正常化极化曲线显示钴对MoS2和WS2的促进效果。DFT计算预测，钴促进可以将氢吸附到S边的自由能从0.22 eV降低至0.07 eV，从而有效增加活性位点的活性。
