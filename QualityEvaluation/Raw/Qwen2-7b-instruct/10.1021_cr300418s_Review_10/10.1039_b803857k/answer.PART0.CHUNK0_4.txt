<p>As we are studying metal sulfides where no such method exists, the irreversible oxidation of metal sulfides will be investigated as a measure of their surface area and edge sites.</p>
<p>The irreversible oxidation peak of the sample, shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,has a charge of 0.014 C. If we assume that 11 electrons are involved in the oxidation of MoS2, as presented in the previous section, the surface area will be 3.8 cm2 of single layered MoS2 giving an exchange current density (i0) of 1.2 × 106 A cm2 (and a Tafel slope of 120mV dec1).</p>
<p>Electrochemical characterization of WS2 WS2 exhibits a layered structure similar to MoS2,11,12 forming the same triangular shape as MoS2 when prepared under similar conditions. WS2 supported on SiO2 has previously been proposed as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.22 The WS2 was studied on Toray paper and the preparation method was similar to that of the MoS2 samples (see experimental details).</p>
<p>In order to determine the activity of the MoS2/C system per active site, we start with the irreversible oxidation to estimate the total surface area of MoS2 on the Toray paper.</p>
<p>Fig. 9 exhibits normalized polarization curves (Ei) pertaining to each of the different samples. There is an apparent promotion effect of Co on both the MoS2 and the WS2 samples. The promotion effect on the WS2 sample can be explained by the DFT calculations predicting that the Co promotion should decrease the free energy of hydrogen adsorption from 0.22 eV to 0.07 eV on the S-edge, and thus effectively increasing the activity of the active site. MoS2 is a slightly different case.</p>
