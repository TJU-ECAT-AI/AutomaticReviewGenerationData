The diverse properties of niobium oxides, such as their different stable forms and oxidation states, influence their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by enhancing the reactivity of the catalyst. However, there are challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental outcomes due to the complexity of these systems.
