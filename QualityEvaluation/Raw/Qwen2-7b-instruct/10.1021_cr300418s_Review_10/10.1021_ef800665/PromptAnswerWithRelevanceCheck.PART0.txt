<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by modifying the surface structure and reactivity of the catalyst. This modification provides additional active sites for the reaction, leading to high activity and selectivity. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in these complex catalytic systems remains a challenge due to the intricate nature of the interactions between the dopants and the base material.
