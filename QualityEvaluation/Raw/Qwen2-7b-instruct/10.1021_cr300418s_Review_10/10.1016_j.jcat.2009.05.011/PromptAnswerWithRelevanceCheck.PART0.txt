[1] "The proposed mechanisms were made plausible by studying CO oxidation with 18O2."
[2] "We found that the catalyst produces 18OC16O, which proves that the oxygen atom that oxidizes CO originates from the gas-phase oxygen molecule."
[3] "The formation of three CO2 isotopes indicates that several distinct reaction mechanisms are at work in this system."
[4] "The presence of C16O2 and C18O2, along with the expected C18O16O, surprised us. None of the three mechanisms proposed in Section 3 would produce them."
[5] "The formation of C16O2 has to involve 16O atoms from the surface of the oxide, which suggests a Marsvan Krevelen or a MVK-like mechanism."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of C16O2 and C18O2 in the products of CO oxidation by Ti- or Al-doped ZnO indicates the existence of additional reaction mechanisms beyond the traditional Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. These mechanisms involve the movement of oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to react with CO, leading to the formation of C16O2 and C18O2. The presence of C16O2 specifically suggests that 16O atoms from the surface of the oxide participate in the reaction, supporting a Marsvan Krevelen-like mechanism. The presence of C18O2 complicates the understanding of the reaction mechanisms, as it cannot be explained solely by the adsorption of 18O2 on the dopant.

Ti-或Al掺杂的ZnO中CO氧化产物中出现的C16O2和C18O2表明存在传统马尔森克雷文机制之外的额外反应机制。这些机制涉及从氧化物表面移动氧原子与CO反应，导致形成C16O2和C18O2。C16O2的存在特别支持氧化物表面氧原子参与反应，支持类似于马尔森克雷文机制的过程。C18O2的出现使反应机制的理解复杂化，因为它不能仅通过气体相中的18O2吸附在掺杂剂上进行解释。

[1] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn. When these dopants replace a Zn atom, at the surface of ZnO, they do not find enough lattice oxygen atoms to satisfy their valence. This drives them to adsorb gas-phase O2. Because these particular dopants would prefer to have one additional oxygen atom, rather than two, the adsorbed O2 molecule reacts readily with a reductant."
[2] "The net result is that the dopant adsorbs and activates O2 from the gas phase, promoting oxidation reactions. Another possibility is that the undercoordinated dopant will steal an oxygen atom from the surface of the host oxide. This atom will settle on top of the dopant, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer."
[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."
[4] "In this article, we present results of calculations and experiments that explore these two possibilities. To prove that CO is oxidized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase, we have performed the oxidation reaction with gas-phase 18O2. We found that the catalyst produces 18OC16O, which proves that the oxygen atom that oxidizes CO originates from the gas-phase oxygen molecule."
[5] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti. We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments. Therefore, if the compound we prepare is active for CO oxidation at low temperatures, it cannot consist of separate bulk oxide phases."
[6] "Because DFT does not allow for rigorous description of spin of the many-body electronic wave function we enforce the conservation of spin polarization along the reaction path, as discussed in Refs. [64,65]. We do this because the internal magnetic fields felt by the electrons during the reaction are very weak, and the probability that the spin of an electron is changed during the reaction is very low."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature describes two alternative CO oxidation pathways in ZnO doped with Ti or Al, which deviate from the traditional Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism. The dopants adsorb O2 from the gas phase to satisfy their higher valence, leading to the activation of O2 for oxidation reactions. The literature also discusses the possibility of oxygen atoms migrating onto the dopant atoms, creating oxygen vacancies and potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Experiments confirm that CO is oxidized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase, and the catalysts prepared exhibit CO oxidation activity at temperatures below 450°C, suggesting that they consist of a single phase rather than a mixture of bulk oxide phases. The authors utilize density functional theory (DFT) calculations and enforce spin polarization conservation to study these systems, accounting for the weak internal magnetic fields experienced by electrons during the reaction.

文献描述了锌氧化物中掺入钛或铝时，CO氧化的两种替代途径，这与传统的马斯范克列文（MVK）机制不同。掺杂剂从气体相吸附氧气以满足其更高的电荷，导致氧气激活并用于氧化反应。文献还讨论了氧原子迁移到掺杂原子上的可能性，形成氧空位，可能增强催化活性。实验确认CO由从气体相吸附的氧气氧化，并且在低于450°C的温度下，催化剂表现出CO氧化活性，表明它们由单一相组成，而不是混合的氧化物相。作者利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，并强制沿反应路径保量子自旋极化，以研究这些系统，考虑到电子在反应期间经历的微弱内部磁场。
