[1] "In this article, we present results of calculations and experiments that explore these two possibilities. To prove that CO is oxidized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase, we have performed the oxidation reaction with gas-phase 18O2."
[2] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti."
[3] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant."
[4] "We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide."
[5] "We have also found that an oxygen atom from the surface may migrate onto the dopant atom, and then react with CO. This mechanism explains the presence of C16O2 products when the gas-phase oxygen is 18O2."
