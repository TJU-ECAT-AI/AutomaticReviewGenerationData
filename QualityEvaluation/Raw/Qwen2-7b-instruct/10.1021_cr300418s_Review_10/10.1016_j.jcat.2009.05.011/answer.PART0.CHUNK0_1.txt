[1] "The proposed mechanisms were made plausible by studying CO oxidation with 18O2."
[2] "We found that the catalyst produces 18OC16O, which proves that the oxygen atom that oxidizes CO originates from the gas-phase oxygen molecule."
[3] "The formation of three CO2 isotopes indicates that several distinct reaction mechanisms are at work in this system."
[4] "The presence of C16O2 and C18O2, along with the expected C18O16O, surprised us. None of the three mechanisms proposed in Section 3 would produce them."
[5] "The formation of C16O2 has to involve 16O atoms from the surface of the oxide, which suggests a Marsvan Krevelen or a MVK-like mechanism."

The presence of C16O2 and C18O2 in the products of CO oxidation by Ti- or Al-doped ZnO indicates the existence of additional reaction mechanisms beyond the traditional Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. These mechanisms involve the movement of oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to react with CO, leading to the formation of C16O2 and C18O2. The presence of C16O2 specifically suggests that 16O atoms from the surface of the oxide participate in the reaction, supporting a Marsvan Krevelen-like mechanism. The presence of C18O2 complicates the understanding of the reaction mechanisms, as it cannot be explained solely by the adsorption of 18O2 on the dopant.

Ti-或Al掺杂的ZnO中CO氧化产物中出现的C16O2和C18O2表明存在传统马尔森克雷文机制之外的额外反应机制。这些机制涉及从氧化物表面移动氧原子与CO反应，导致形成C16O2和C18O2。C16O2的存在特别支持氧化物表面氧原子参与反应，支持类似于马尔森克雷文机制的过程。C18O2的出现使反应机制的理解复杂化，因为它不能仅通过气体相中的18O2吸附在掺杂剂上进行解释。
