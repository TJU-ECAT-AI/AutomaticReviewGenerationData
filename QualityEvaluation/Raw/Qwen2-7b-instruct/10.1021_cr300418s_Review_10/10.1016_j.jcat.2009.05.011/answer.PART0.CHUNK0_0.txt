[1] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism."
[2] "In the case of ZnO, many dopants increase the energy that is necessary for removing an oxygen atom from the surface."
[3] "The adsorption of O2 on the dopant, required by Mechanisms 1-3, has no barrier and is strongly exothermic."
[4] "We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide."
[5] "We have also found that an oxygen atom from the surface may migrate onto the dopant atom, and then react with CO."

1. Two alternative CO oxidation pathways were proposed that deviate from the conventional Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 
2. Many dopants in ZnO increase the energy needed to remove an oxygen atom from the surface.
3. The adsorption of O2 on the dopant in Mechanisms 1-3 is barrierless and strongly exothermic.
4. The higher valence of the dopant compared to Zn explains the behavior of the doped oxide.
5. An oxygen atom from the surface can move onto the dopant and react with CO.
