[1] "We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn. When these dopants replace a Zn atom, at the surface of ZnO, they do not find enough lattice oxygen atoms to satisfy their valence."
[2] "We have found that an oxygen atom from the surface may migrate onto the dopant atom, and then react with CO. This mechanism explains the presence of C16O2 products when the gas-phase oxygen is 18O2."

1. The high valence of titanium and aluminum compared to zinc enables them to substitute zinc ions in zinc oxide and adsorb oxygen from the gas phase due to their unsatisfied valence states.
2. An oxygen atom from the surface of the doped zinc oxide can move onto the dopant atom, facilitating CO oxidation and the production of C16O2 when using 18O2.

1. 钛和铝的高电荷与锌相比，使得它们能够替换锌离子并用锌氧化物吸附气体中的氧，因为它们的电荷状态未得到满足。
2. 表面的氧原子可以迁移到掺杂剂原子上，从而在使用18O2时促进CO氧化并产生C16O2。
