[1] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation (47) than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Doping ceria with certain elements like Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta reduces its activity in n-butane oxidation compared to undoped ceria. Additionally, doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb decreases its CO oxidation rate.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 向铈掺入某些元素，如Sm、Gd、La、Nb和Ta会降低其在异丁烷氧化中的活性，与未掺杂的铈相比。此外，向铈掺入La、Pr、Gd或Nb会减慢其CO氧化速率。

[1] "We are interested here in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
2. To utilize these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to understand their structure when exposed to gas-phase oxygen.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also formed. The energy of formation of WO2 is so close to that of TiO2 that, within the errors of experiment and DFT, the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not change the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
3. The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also produced. The formation energy of WO2 is nearly identical to that of TiO2, meaning the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not alter the energy needed to create an oxygen vacancy, considering experimental and DFT errors.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
3. 最稳定的钨氧化物是WO3，但也形成了锐钛矿型WO2。WO2的形成能接近TiO2，因此用W原子替换Ti原子不会改变形成氧空位所需的能量，考虑到实验和DFT误差。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

[1] "The important steps in the catalytic cycle (the reactivity of surface oxygen and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2) both depend on the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv2."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. Critical steps in the catalytic process, such as the oxygen surface reactivity and the vacancy's ability to adsorb O2, both hinge on the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv2.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
4. 催化循环中的关键步骤，包括表面氧的反应性和空位吸附O2的能力，都取决于空位形成能ΔEv2。

[1] "One more catalytic cycle is needed in order to restore the surface to the spin state it started with."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. An additional catalytic cycle is required to return the surface to its initial spin state.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. 需要额外的一次催化循环才能使表面恢复到初始的自旋状态。

[1] "We find that, indeed, it is; the energies E1 and E3 (for steps 1 and 3) are linear functions of the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy at b2 (see Figure 7)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
6. Indeed, the energies E1 and E3, which correspond to steps 1 and 3, are linear functions of the energy of an oxygen vacancy formation at b2 (refer to Figure 7).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
6. 确实如此，能量E1和E3（对应步骤1和3）是形成b2位置氧空位的能量的线性函数（参见图7）。
