<p>The only review article we could find (5) was written in 2002 and contains only a few examples.</p>
<p>These articles suggest that doped oxides might be a promising class of catalysts.</p>
<p>Considering that a large number of oxides can be combined with a large number of dopants and considering the large number of oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions that might be catalyzed by such compounds, we feel that the potential of this class of catalyst has not been fully explored by either theory or experiment.</p>
<p>Doping TiO2 (110) with Ru, Sn, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, or Au substantially lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change.</p>
<p>Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110)with M = V, W, Cr, or Moand in MnxTi1xO2 is smaller than in TiO2 (110).</p>
<p>The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also formed. The energy of formation of WO2 is so close to that of TiO2 that, within the errors of experiment and DFT, the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not change the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W).</p>
<p>Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin.</p>
<p>These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another.</p>
<p>In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis.</p>

1. There was a single review article on the topic published in 2002, containing limited examples. 
2. Doped oxides are seen as a potentially promising class of catalysts.  
3. The full potential of this catalyst class has not been thoroughly explored by both theoretical studies and experiments.
4. Substitutional doping significantly reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation in TiO2 (110).
5. Oxygen vacancy formation energy decreases in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) with M = V, W, Cr, or Mo, compared to TiO2 (110).
6. Replacing Ti with W does not drastically alter the formation energy of oxygen vacancies in WO2.
7. Dopants like V, Cr, Mo, and W bind an oxygen atom, forming MO groups on the surface.
8. Spin-conserving reactions are prioritized in determining the most likely catalytic pathways.
9. Two reactions' energies vary across different doped oxides.
10. Spin-flipping reactions are excluded from consideration due to their slow catalytic rates.

1. 我们找到的唯一一篇综述文章发表于2002年，内容包含的例子较少。
2. 掺杂氧化物被认为是一个有前景的催化剂类别。
3. 这一催化剂类别的全部潜力尚未通过理论研究和实验充分探索。
4. 在TiO2（110）中进行替换掺杂可以显著降低形成氧空位所需的能量。
5. 在（MO）xTi1xO2（110）中，当M为V、W、Cr或Mo时，氧空位形成能比TiO2（110）小。
6. 在WO2中替换Ti与W并不大幅度改变氧空位的形成能。
7. 某些掺杂剂如V、Cr、Mo和W会在表面结合氧原子，形成MO组分。
8. 考虑到自旋守恒原则，只考虑不涉及自旋翻转的反应。
9. 两种反应的能量在不同掺杂氧化物之间存在差异。
10. 需要自旋翻转的反应因其催化速率缓慢而被排除考虑。
