[1] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation (47) than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."
[2] "A better oxidant is not necessarily a better oxidation catalyst. The oxidation reaction creates oxygen vacancies on the surface, and to close the catalytic cycle these vacancies must be healed by gas phase oxygen."
[3] "This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide."
[4] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."
[5] "If we speculate that, according to BEP, the larger the reaction energy the smaller the activation barrier, then we find that (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is likely to be the fastest oxidant, whereas the reduced MnxTi1xO2δ (110) is the fastest oxygen adsorber."

1. Doping ceria with certain elements reduces its activity in n-butane oxidation compared to undoped ceria. Doping ceria with some elements also slows down CO oxidation.
2. A material that is a better oxidant may not necessarily be a better catalyst for oxidation reactions. After an oxidation reaction, the created oxygen vacancies must be healed by gas phase oxygen to complete the catalytic cycle.
3. The correlation between the ease of vacancy formation and the effectiveness of dopants as catalysts is not precise, but it can offer a rough estimate for predicting which dopant is likely to improve vacancy formation.
4. The three key energies involved in the catalytic cycle (reaction of CO with surface oxygen, O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and energy of vacancy formation) are interconnected by two linear relationships.
5. Based on the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship, the catalysts with higher reaction energies are expected to have smaller activation barriers. Therefore, (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is anticipated to be the fastest oxidant, while the reduced MnxTi1xO2δ (110) is predicted to be the fastest oxygen adsorber.

1. 向氧化铈添加某些元素会降低其在异丁烷氧化中的活性，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比。向氧化铈添加某些元素也会减慢一氧化碳的氧化速率。
2. 更强的氧化剂并不一定意味着更强的氧化催化剂。氧化反应后生成的氧空位必须通过气体相氧气来愈合以完成催化循环。
3. 关于掺杂剂促进空位形成的效率和催化性能之间的相关性不是定量的，但它可以提供一个粗略的指南，用于预测哪种掺杂剂更有可能改善空位形成。
4. 在催化循环中涉及的三个关键能量（表面氧与CO的反应、O2结合到氧空位以及空位形成能）通过两个线性关系相互关联。
5. 根据Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP)关系，具有更高反应能量的催化剂预计具有更小的活化势垒。因此，(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)预计是最快速的氧化剂，而还原后的MnxTi1xO2δ (110)则被预测为最快的氧吸附器。
