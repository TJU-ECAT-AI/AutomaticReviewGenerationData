<p>There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
<p>The explicit idea of using doped oxides (or mixed oxides as they were called in the older literature) seems to go back to Cimino and co-workers, (1, 2) who showed that NixMg1xO is more active for N2O decomposition than NiO.</p>
<p>Although doped oxides received some attention in the older literature, (3, 4) there have been few studies of their catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Considering that a large number of oxides can be combined with a large number of dopants and considering the large number of oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions that might be catalyzed by such compounds, we feel that the potential of this class of catalyst has not been fully explored by either theory or experiment.</p>
<p>Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110)with M = V, W, Cr, or Moand in MnxTi1xO2 is smaller than in TiO2 (110).</p>
<p>Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change.</p>
<p>Our calculations also find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) is smaller than that of MxTi1xO2 (110) (for M = V, Cr, Mo, or W).</p>
<p>The mechanism of CO oxidation by (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) (for M = V, Cr, Mo, or W) is similar to that observed on AuxTi1xO2 (110) (48) and AuxCe1xO2 (111): (49)</p>
<p>(1) CO adsorbs and reacts with two oxygen atoms on the surface to form a carbonate;</p>
<p>(2) the carbonate decomposes easily to release CO2 in the gas phase and form an oxygen vacancy on the surface;</p>
<p>(3) O2 adsorbs at the oxygen vacancy site, and its OO bond is weakened by interaction with this electron rich environment;</p>
<p>(4) the adsorbed O2 reacts with CO to form a carbonate;</p>
<p>(5) the carbonate decomposes to produce gas phase CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.</p>
