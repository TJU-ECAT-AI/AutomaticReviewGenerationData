[1] "The only review article we could find (5) was written in 2002 and contains only a few examples."
[2] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[3] "We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W)."
[4] "The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also formed."
[5] "In the case of reaction 2 one would expect that if it is hard to make an oxygen vacancy then it is hard to desorb CO2 (since this process creates a vacancy at b2); this is not the case."
</quotes>

1. There was only one review article found on the topic, published in 2002, which provided limited examples.
2. To determine the most probable intermediate reactions from an energetic standpoint, we enforce a spin conservation principle; reactions requiring spin flips are too slow for catalysis.
3. The dopants like V, Cr, Mo, and W at the surface bind an oxygen atom, resulting in the formation of MO (where M stands for V, Cr, Mo, or W).
4. The most stable form of tungsten oxide is WO3, while rutile WO2 is also a possible structure.
5. Contrary to expectation, making an oxygen vacancy is not correlated with the difficulty of desorbing CO2.

<p>There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
<p>The explicit idea of using doped oxides (or mixed oxides as they were called in the older literature) seems to go back to Cimino and co-workers, (1, 2) who showed that NixMg1xO is more active for N2O decomposition than NiO.</p>

<p>Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change.</p>
<p>Our calculations also find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) is smaller than that of MxTi1xO2 (110) (for M = V, Cr, Mo, or W).</p>
<p>The mechanism of CO oxidation by (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) (for M = V, Cr, Mo, or W) is similar to that observed on AuxTi1xO2 (110) (48) and AuxCe1xO2 (111): (49)</p>
<p>(1) CO adsorbs and reacts with two oxygen atoms on the surface to form a carbonate;</p>

<p>(3) O2 adsorbs at the oxygen vacancy site, and its OO bond is weakened by interaction with this electron rich environment;</p>
<p>(4) the adsorbed O2 reacts with CO to form a carbonate;</p>
<p>(5) the carbonate decomposes to produce gas phase CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.</p>

[1] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation (47) than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."
[2] "A better oxidant is not necessarily a better oxidation catalyst. The oxidation reaction creates oxygen vacancies on the surface, and to close the catalytic cycle these vacancies must be healed by gas phase oxygen."
[3] "This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide."
[4] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."
[5] "If we speculate that, according to BEP, the larger the reaction energy the smaller the activation barrier, then we find that (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is likely to be the fastest oxidant, whereas the reduced MnxTi1xO2δ (110) is the fastest oxygen adsorber."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Doping ceria with certain elements reduces its activity in n-butane oxidation compared to undoped ceria. Doping ceria with some elements also slows down CO oxidation.
2. A material that is a better oxidant may not necessarily be a better catalyst for oxidation reactions. After an oxidation reaction, the created oxygen vacancies must be healed by gas phase oxygen to complete the catalytic cycle.
3. The correlation between the ease of vacancy formation and the effectiveness of dopants as catalysts is not precise, but it can offer a rough estimate for predicting which dopant is likely to improve vacancy formation.
4. The three key energies involved in the catalytic cycle (reaction of CO with surface oxygen, O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and energy of vacancy formation) are interconnected by two linear relationships.
5. Based on the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship, the catalysts with higher reaction energies are expected to have smaller activation barriers. Therefore, (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is anticipated to be the fastest oxidant, while the reduced MnxTi1xO2δ (110) is predicted to be the fastest oxygen adsorber.

1. 向氧化铈添加某些元素会降低其在异丁烷氧化中的活性，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比。向氧化铈添加某些元素也会减慢一氧化碳的氧化速率。
2. 更强的氧化剂并不一定意味着更强的氧化催化剂。氧化反应后生成的氧空位必须通过气体相氧气来愈合以完成催化循环。
3. 关于掺杂剂促进空位形成的效率和催化性能之间的相关性不是定量的，但它可以提供一个粗略的指南，用于预测哪种掺杂剂更有可能改善空位形成。
4. 在催化循环中涉及的三个关键能量（表面氧与CO的反应、O2结合到氧空位以及空位形成能）通过两个线性关系相互关联。
5. 根据Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP)关系，具有更高反应能量的催化剂预计具有更小的活化势垒。因此，(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)预计是最快速的氧化剂，而还原后的MnxTi1xO2δ (110)则被预测为最快的氧吸附器。

3. The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also produced. The formation energy of WO2 is nearly identical to that of TiO2, meaning the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not alter the energy needed to create an oxygen vacancy, considering experimental and DFT errors.
