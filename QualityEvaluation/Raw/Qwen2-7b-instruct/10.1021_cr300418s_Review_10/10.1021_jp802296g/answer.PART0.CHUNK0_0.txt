[1] "The only review article we could find (5) was written in 2002 and contains only a few examples."

1. There was only one review article found on the topic, published in 2002, which provided limited examples.
2. To determine the most probable intermediate reactions from an energetic standpoint, we enforce a spin conservation principle; reactions requiring spin flips are too slow for catalysis.
3. The dopants like V, Cr, Mo, and W at the surface bind an oxygen atom, resulting in the formation of MO (where M stands for V, Cr, Mo, or W).
4. The most stable form of tungsten oxide is WO3, while rutile WO2 is also a possible structure.
5. Contrary to expectation, making an oxygen vacancy is not correlated with the difficulty of desorbing CO2.

1. 只有一篇于2002年发表的综述文章，内容提供很少的例子。
2. 为了从能动性角度判断最有可能的中间反应，我们应用了一个自旋守恒原则：需要改变自旋的反应太慢而无法作为催化作用。
3. V、Cr、Mo、W等表面掺杂原子会与氧原子结合，形成MO（其中M代表V、Cr、Mo或W）。
4. 最稳定的钨氧化物是WO3，而rutile WO2也是可能的结构形式之一。
5. 相反，制造氧空位并不意味着脱除CO2的难度增加。
