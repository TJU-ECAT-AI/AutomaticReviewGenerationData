[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "The adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron."

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which decrease the energy required to form oxygen vacancies and increase the binding energy of single metal atoms.
2. High-valence dopants display Lewis base characteristics, strongly adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogens.
3. Upon adsorption, O2 onto Nb introduces four electrons to the NbO2 group, leaving it formally with just one valence electron.
4. Similarly, the adsorption of O2 onto Nb transforms the NbO2 group, formally having just one valence electron after acquiring four electrons from O2.

1. 可还原氧化物显示出路易斯酸的性质，这降低了形成氧空位的能量，并增加了单个金属原子的结合能。
2. 高价掺杂剂显示出路易斯碱的特性，强烈吸附如O2或卤素这样的路易斯酸。
3. O2在Nb上的吸附向NbO2引入四个电子，使其正式上仅有一个价电子。
4. 同样，O2在Nb上的吸附将NbO2组转化为正式上仅有一个价电子的状态，从O2获取了四个电子。
