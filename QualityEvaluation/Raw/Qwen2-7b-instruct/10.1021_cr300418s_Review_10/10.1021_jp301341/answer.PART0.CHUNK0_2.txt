[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."
[4] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."
[5] "However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen."

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, reducing the energy needed to form oxygen vacancies and enhancing the binding of various bases to the surface. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, strongly attract Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules. If the dopant isn't overly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or bromine remains reactive, able to interact with Lewis bases. However, if the dopant is highly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or bromine binds too strongly, losing its chemical activity. In certain scenarios, the combined system of the dopant and adsorbed oxygen behaves like a low-valence dopant, activating the surface oxygen.

1. 可还原氧化物显示出路易斯酸的性质，降低了形成氧空位的能量，并增强了表面各种基团的结合。高价掺杂剂作为路易斯碱，强烈吸引如O2或卤素分子这样的Lewis酸。如果掺杂物不是过于碱性，吸附的氧气或溴仍然具有活性，能够与Lewis基团反应。然而，如果掺杂物过于碱性，吸附的氧气或溴会绑定得太强，失去其化学活性。在某些情况下，掺杂物和吸附的氧气组合体表现出如同低价掺杂物的作用，激活表面氧气。
