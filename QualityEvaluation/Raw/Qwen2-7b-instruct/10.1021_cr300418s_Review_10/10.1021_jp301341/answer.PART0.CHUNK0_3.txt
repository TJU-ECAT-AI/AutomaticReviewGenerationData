[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."
[3] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which reduce the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of single metal atoms.
2. When the basicity of the dopant isn't too high, the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 retains some acidity, enabling it to react with Lewis bases.
3. If the dopant is highly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is bound too tightly, rendering it inactive chemically.

1. 可还原氧化物显示出了路易斯酸的性质，这降低了氧空位形成所需的能量，并增强了单个金属原子的结合。
2. 当掺杂剂的碱性不是太高时，吸附的氧气或Br2仍保留一定的酸性，能够与路易斯碱反应。
3. 如果掺杂剂非常碱性，吸附的氧气或Br2被紧紧地绑定，使其化学上不活跃。
