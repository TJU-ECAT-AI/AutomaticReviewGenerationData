[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and makes the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which facilitate oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of various bases like H, CH3, and CO to the surface. This also makes the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic due to the Lewis acid nature of the surface.

2. High-valence dopants display Lewis base characteristics, attracting Lewis acids such as O2 or halogens (X2). If the dopant isn't overly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or halogen retains some acidity, enabling reactions with Lewis bases.

1. 可还原氧化物显示Lewis酸性质，这有助于氧空位的形成，并增强了表面各种基团（如H、CH3和CO）的吸附。这也使得烷烃的解离吸附更加放热，因为表面具有Lewis酸性。

2. 高价掺杂剂显示出Lewis碱特性，吸引Lewis酸如O2或卤素（X2）。如果掺杂剂不是过于碱性，吸附的氧或卤素仍保留一定的酸性，能够与Lewis碱发生反应。
