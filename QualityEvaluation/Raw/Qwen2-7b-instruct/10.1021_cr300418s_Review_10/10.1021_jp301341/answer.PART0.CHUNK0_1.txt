[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "The formation of ZrO2 does activate the surface oxygen atoms near the dopant. When this system reacts with CH4, the alkane dissociates, and it can either form ZrOCH3 and ZrOH (Figure 1) or form ZrOCH3 and OH, with the oxygen in OH being the surface oxygen. The latter is activated by the presence of ZrO2."
[4] "The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base. The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."
[5] "The binding energy of Au on an ultrathin MgO film supported on a metal increases as the work function of the metal decreases."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1.Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties that facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhance the binding of single metal atoms.
2.High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, effectively adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogens.
3.The presence of ZrO2 activates the surface oxygen atoms when interacting with CH4, enabling dissociative adsorption of the alkane to form ZrOCH3 and either ZrOH or OH.
4.Nb, as a strong base, adsorbs O2 with an unusually low energy of 8.40 eV, preventing gas-phase reactions involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group.
5.The binding energy of Au on a MgO film supported on a metal is enhanced as the metal's work function decreases, indicating the influence of Lewis acid-base interactions.

1.可还原氧化物显示出Lewis酸特性，促进氧空位的形成并增强单金属原子的结合。
2.高价掺杂剂充当Lewis碱，有效吸附O2或卤素等Lewis酸。
3.ZrO2的存在激活了与CH4反应时的表面氧原子，使烷烃发生离解吸附，形成ZrOCH3和ZrOH或OH。
4.Nb作为强碱，以8.40 eV的极低吸附能吸附O2，阻止涉及NbO2组中氧原子的气相反应。
5.在金属上支持的MgO薄膜中，Au的结合能随金属的工作函数降低而增加，表明Lewis酸-碱相互作用的影响。
