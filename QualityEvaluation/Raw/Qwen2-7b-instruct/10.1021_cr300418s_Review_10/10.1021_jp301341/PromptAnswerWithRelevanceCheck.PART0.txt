<quotes>
[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and makes the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which facilitate oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of various bases like H, CH3, and CO to the surface. This also makes the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic due to the Lewis acid nature of the surface.

2. High-valence dopants display Lewis base characteristics, attracting Lewis acids such as O2 or halogens (X2). If the dopant isn't overly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or halogen retains some acidity, enabling reactions with Lewis bases.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 可还原氧化物显示Lewis酸性质，这有助于氧空位的形成，并增强了表面各种基团（如H、CH3和CO）的吸附。这也使得烷烃的解离吸附更加放热，因为表面具有Lewis酸性。

2. 高价掺杂剂显示出Lewis碱特性，吸引Lewis酸如O2或卤素（X2）。如果掺杂剂不是过于碱性，吸附的氧或卤素仍保留一定的酸性，能够与Lewis碱发生反应。

[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "The formation of ZrO2 does activate the surface oxygen atoms near the dopant. When this system reacts with CH4, the alkane dissociates, and it can either form ZrOCH3 and ZrOH (Figure 1) or form ZrOCH3 and OH, with the oxygen in OH being the surface oxygen. The latter is activated by the presence of ZrO2."
[4] "The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base. The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."
[5] "The binding energy of Au on an ultrathin MgO film supported on a metal increases as the work function of the metal decreases."

1.Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties that facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhance the binding of single metal atoms.
2.High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, effectively adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogens.
3.The presence of ZrO2 activates the surface oxygen atoms when interacting with CH4, enabling dissociative adsorption of the alkane to form ZrOCH3 and either ZrOH or OH.
4.Nb, as a strong base, adsorbs O2 with an unusually low energy of 8.40 eV, preventing gas-phase reactions involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group.
5.The binding energy of Au on a MgO film supported on a metal is enhanced as the metal's work function decreases, indicating the influence of Lewis acid-base interactions.

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, reducing the energy needed to form oxygen vacancies and enhancing the binding of various bases to the surface. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, strongly attract Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules. If the dopant isn't overly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or bromine remains reactive, able to interact with Lewis bases. However, if the dopant is highly basic, the adsorbed oxygen or bromine binds too strongly, losing its chemical activity. In certain scenarios, the combined system of the dopant and adsorbed oxygen behaves like a low-valence dopant, activating the surface oxygen.

1. 可还原氧化物显示出路易斯酸的性质，降低了形成氧空位的能量，并增强了表面各种基团的结合。高价掺杂剂作为路易斯碱，强烈吸引如O2或卤素分子这样的Lewis酸。如果掺杂物不是过于碱性，吸附的氧气或溴仍然具有活性，能够与Lewis基团反应。然而，如果掺杂物过于碱性，吸附的氧气或溴会绑定得太强，失去其化学活性。在某些情况下，掺杂物和吸附的氧气组合体表现出如同低价掺杂物的作用，激活表面氧气。
