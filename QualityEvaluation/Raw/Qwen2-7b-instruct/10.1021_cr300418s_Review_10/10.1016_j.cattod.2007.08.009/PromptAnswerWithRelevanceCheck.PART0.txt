1. Recent STM, DFT, and HAADF-STEM studies of sulfide-based hydrotreating catalysts have provided insights into their mechanistic, structural, and particle size effects. These studies have highlighted experimental and theoretical investigations of both unpromoted MoS2 and promoted CoMoS and NiMoS nanostructures. New understanding of the HDS mechanism has been obtained, including complete hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways for thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) under reaction conditions. Size-dependent structural and electronic changes in MoS2 clusters have been observed, suggesting that these effects should be considered when evaluating catalytic activity.

2. STM images have revealed that the Mo edge possesses a special electronic edge state, identifiable as a bright brim extending along the edges. This state has been linked to catalytic activity, particularly for hydrogenation reactions, as opposed to vacancy sites commonly believed to be the key active sites. 

3. The brim sites observed in STM images are not exclusive to gold-supported systems but are likely to be characteristic of MoS2- and WS2-based catalysts across various supports. These sites exhibit catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions, contrary to the prevailing notion that vacancy sites are the primary active sites.

4. Studies have uncovered significant structure-size effects in MoS2 nanoclusters catalysts. These effects are expected to impact the hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization activities of MoS2 nanoclusters in the nanometer regime, influencing their catalytic performance.
