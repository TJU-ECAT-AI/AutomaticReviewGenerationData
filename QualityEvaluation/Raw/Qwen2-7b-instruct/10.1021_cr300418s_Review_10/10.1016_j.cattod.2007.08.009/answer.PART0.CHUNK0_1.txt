[1] "It is well-known that materials scaled down to particles in the nanometer regime may adopt new and interesting structural and electronic properties that are significantly different from those observed in bulk systems [98]."
[2] "The four largest clusters all adopt the structure described in Section 2 and in the previous studies [19,30], and these clusters are terminated by fully sulfided Mo edges."
[3] "For the triangular clusters with less than six Mo atoms on the edge (n  6), the edge structure appears differently and also the appearance of the interior of the cluster becomes brighter and different from that of normal basal planes."
[4] "The results clearly show that the smallest clusters do not possess extended metallic states."
[5] "Even in the fairly large nanoclusters (n = 8), a large excess of sulfur exists (S:Mo  2.89 for n = 8)."

1. Materials at the nanoscale can exhibit unique structural and electronic properties that differ significantly from their bulk counterparts.
2. The four largest clusters maintain the structure described in previous studies, with fully sulfided Mo edges.
3. Triangular clusters with fewer than six Mo atoms on the edge have different edge structures and brighter interiors.
4. The smallest clusters lack extended metallic states.
5. Large nanoclusters (n = 8) contain a substantial surplus of sulfur.
