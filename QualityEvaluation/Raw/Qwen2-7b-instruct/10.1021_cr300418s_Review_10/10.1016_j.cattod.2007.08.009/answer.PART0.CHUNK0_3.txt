[1] "The present article will highlight some recent experimental and theoretical studies of both unpromoted MoS2 and promoted CoMoS and Ni MoS nanostructures."
[2] "The NiMoS structures may in some instances differ from the CoMoS analogues."
[3] "In view of the large structure sensitivity of hydrotreating reactions this is expected to give rise to large effects on the catalysis."
[4] "STM has for the first time provided us with atom resolved images of MoS2 clusters of different sizes."
[5] "Many size-dependent structural and electronic changes were observed and such effects must clearly also be taken into account when addressing the catalysis."
[6] "Support interactions have been an important topic in catalysis research for many years, since the catalytic properties of MoS2 are significantly influenced by the support."
[7] "In a recent study [42], we have investigated a simplified system, where we modelled the linkages by hydroxyl groups."
[8] "The results also showed that the linkages may also significantly influence the brim sites which play an important role in the catalysis (see Section 4)."
[9] "The multilayer clusters are also predominantly shaped as hexagons (See Fig. 4b)."
[10] "Importantly, the atom-resolved STM images provide solid evidence for one-dimensional metallic brim sites on the graphite-supported MoS2, which as discussed further in Section 4 play an important role in the catalytic properties of single-layer MoS2 [31,32]."
[11] "In a recent study [97], we investigated the effects of the three different inhibitors pyridine, benzene and H2S."
[12] "Interestingly, it was found that protonation of pyridine does not take place at the S edge, as hydrogen itself is too strongly bound to this edge and thus not available."
[13] "Benzene and H2S only bind weakly to both edges, which explains why their inhibition effect is much lower than pyridine."
[14] "These results also point to the Mo edge primarily being the active site for the HYD pathway."
[15] "The identified Mo edge brim site as the hydrogenation site explains the low inhibiting effect of H2S on hydrogenation as found in many studies."
[16] "For the triangular clusters with less than six Mo atoms on the edge (n  6), the edge structure appears differently and also the appearance of the interior of the cluster becomes brighter and different from that of normal basal planes."
[17] "The STM images also provide information on how the electronic structure like the brim sites vary with changing cluster size, and the results clearly show that the smallest clusters do not possess extended metallic states."
[18] "A detailed analysis of the images and a deconvolution of the structural and electronic effects await a full DFT-STM study."
