1. Recent STM, DFT, and HAADF-STEM studies of sulfide-based hydrotreating catalysts have provided insights into their mechanistic, structural, and particle size effects. These studies have highlighted experimental and theoretical investigations of both unpromoted MoS2 and promoted CoMoS and NiMoS nanostructures. New understanding of the HDS mechanism has been obtained, including complete hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways for thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) under reaction conditions. Size-dependent structural and electronic changes in MoS2 clusters have been observed, suggesting that these effects should be considered when evaluating catalytic activity.

2. STM images have revealed that the Mo edge possesses a special electronic edge state, identifiable as a bright brim extending along the edges. This state has been linked to catalytic activity, particularly for hydrogenation reactions, as opposed to vacancy sites commonly believed to be the key active sites. 

3. The brim sites observed in STM images are not exclusive to gold-supported systems but are likely to be characteristic of MoS2- and WS2-based catalysts across various supports. These sites exhibit catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions, contrary to the prevailing notion that vacancy sites are the primary active sites.

4. Studies have uncovered significant structure-size effects in MoS2 nanoclusters catalysts. These effects are expected to impact the hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization activities of MoS2 nanoclusters in the nanometer regime, influencing their catalytic performance.

1. 近期的STM、DFT和HAADF-STEM研究揭示了硫化物基加氢脱硫催化剂的机制、结构和颗粒尺寸效应。这些研究聚焦于未促进的MoS2和促进的CoMoS、NiMoS纳米结构的实验和理论分析。对脱硫化机制的新见解包括了在反应条件下进行的噻吩氢化脱硫（HDS）的完整氢化和氢解途径。观察到尺寸依赖性的结构和电子变化，表明这些效应在评估催化活性时必须考虑。

2. STM图像显示Mo边缘具有特殊的电子边缘状态，可以识别为沿边缘延伸的非常明亮的边缘，这种状态与催化活性有关，特别是对于氢化反应，而通常认为空位点是关键活性位点。

3. 观察到的边缘特征不仅存在于金支持的系统中，而且是所有MoS2-和WS2基催化剂上不同支持的重要特性。这些特征显示出氢化反应的催化活性，这与普遍认为的活性中心位于空位点的观点相反。

4. 研究发现了MoS2纳米簇催化剂的显著结构尺寸效应。这些效应预计会影响纳米尺度的MoS2簇的氢化和脱硫化活性，从而影响它们的催化性能。
