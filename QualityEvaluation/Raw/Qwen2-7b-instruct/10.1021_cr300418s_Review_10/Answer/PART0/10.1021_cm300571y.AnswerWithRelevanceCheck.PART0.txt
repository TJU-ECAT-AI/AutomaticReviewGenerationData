          [1] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
          [2] "The observed states adopted by Pd strongly influenced methane oxidation activity."
          [3] "The state of Pd in Y(Fe,Pd)O3 appeared to be dependent on the calcination temperature."
          [4] "In the case of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, the state of Pd appears to be calcination temperature dependent."
          [5] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
          [6] "The absence of any reflection of the PdO phase is however not conclusive about the actual state of Pd."
          [7] "Moreover, this difference also characterizes the reducibility of the existing PdO particles on La(Mn,Pd)O3."
          [8] "The activity of the catalysts strongly depends on the state of Pd, since typically PdO is considered the active phase for the reaction."
          [9] "The formation of a solid solution between Pd and common perovskite-type oxidation catalysts needs to be carefully ascertained and strongly depends on the composition of the perovskite oxide."

          The state of palladium (Pd) in perovskite-type oxides, including its coordination states and oxidation levels, significantly impacts its behavior as a dopant in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Palladium can adopt various stable forms and oxidation states, influencing its catalytic activity. Its state is influenced by factors such as the specific coordination environment of the B-site cation and the ionic radii of the involved elements. Palladium's different states are interpreted based on ionic radius arguments. The activity of catalysts depends on the state of palladium, as palladium oxide (PdO) is often considered the active phase for reactions. The formation of a solid solution between palladium and common perovskite-type catalysts requires careful consideration and depends on the composition of the perovskite oxide.

          在钙钛矿型氧化物中，钯（Pd）的不同状态及其配合态和氧化水平显著影响其作为NiO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢的行为。钯可以采取多种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响其催化活性。其状态受特定配合中心离子环境和涉及元素的离子半径等因素的影响。根据离子半径论点解释了钯的不同状态。催化剂的活性取决于钯的状态，因为通常认为钯氧化物（PdO）是反应中的活性载体。钯与常见钙钛矿型催化剂之间形成固溶体需要仔细确认，并且依赖于钙钛矿氧化物的组成。

          [1] "Incorporation of palladium within the perovskite-type lattice is a valuable strategy to prevent sintering phenomena that reduce the performance of automotive catalysts."
          [2] "The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen."
          [3] "Calcination at 700 C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3."
          [4] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
          [5] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
          [6] "In the typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co) where the coordination geometry of the B-site is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is generally assumed that a doping element such as Pd adopts the same coordination state."
          [7] "Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment of the B-site can be tentatively rationalized on the base of ionic radii arguments and on the electronic structure of the cations considered in this work."
          [8] "Therefore, while the short-range coordination environment of Pd may be very similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 varies, most likely depending on the crystallinity of the support oxide."
          [9] "The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200900 C."

          Incorporating palladium within the perovskite-type lattice serves as an effective strategy to mitigate sintering issues that can degrade the performance of automotive catalysts. The state of palladium (Pd) was comprehensively analyzed through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen. Calcination at 700°C resulted in cationic palladium with a strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure, although it likely exists in a distinct coordination environment compared to LaFeO3. The significant variations in palladium states are explained by ionic radius considerations. The smaller size of manganese (Mn) ions does not favor the occupation of octahedral sites by larger Pd3+ ions. In typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (with A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co), where the B-site coordination geometry is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is commonly assumed that a dopant element like Pd assumes a similar coordination state. Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment as the B-site can be tentatively justified based on ionic radius arguments and the electronic structures of the considered cations. While the local coordination environment of palladium might be quite similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 is expected to differ, most likely due to the crystallinity of the support oxide. The palladium state has been linked to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation within the temperature range of 200 to 900°C.

          将钯（Pd）嵌入钙钛矿型晶格是一个有效的策略，旨在减轻可能导致汽车催化剂性能下降的结团现象。通过X射线吸收光谱、X射线光电子光谱和氢程序升温还原分析了钯的状态。在700°C的煅烧下，形成了与YFeO3结构有强相互作用的带正电钯，但其协调环境可能与LaFeO3不同。钯的不同状态通过离子半径考虑来解释。锰（Mn）离子的较小尺寸不利于较大Pd3+离子占据八面体位置。在A = La、B = Mn、Fe、Co的典型氧化催化剂的ABO3系列中，B位的配合几何为八面体（BO6八面体），通常假设掺杂元素如Pd采用相同配合状态。钯是否可以采用B位的相同配合环境可以通过离子半径论点和考虑的阳离子的电子结构来暂时合理化。虽然钯的局部配合环境可能非常相似，但与YFeO3的相互作用程度可能会有所不同，最有可能取决于支持氧化物的结晶性。钯的状态与200至900°C范围内的甲烷氧化催化活性相关联。
