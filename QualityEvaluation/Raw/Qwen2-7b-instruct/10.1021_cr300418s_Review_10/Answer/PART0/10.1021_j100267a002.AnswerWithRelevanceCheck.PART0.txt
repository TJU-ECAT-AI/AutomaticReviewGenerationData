          (1) "In this way, among the three candidates of HOMO, t2g,tzu,and eg, only the tza HOMO is consistent with the observed temperature dependence."
          (2) "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
          (3) "The results of this study, along with the specific surface areas of the oxides examined and the bond strengths of the most labile hydrogen atom of the hydrocarbons,14 are presented in Table I."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the reactivity of the oxide ions towards hydrogen atom abstraction. These factors contribute to the ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals, depending on the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or undergo further surface reactions. However, the literature does not directly address the challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems.

          铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，通过影响氧化离子对氢原子抽取的反应性。这些因素决定了表面生成气相烃基自由基的能力，取决于最弱C-H键的键能、表面特定自由基形成位点的存在以及自由基在脱离或进一步表面反应之间的倾向。然而，文献没有直接讨论在研究这些复杂催化系统时理论预测与实验观察之间协调的挑战。

          [1] "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
          [2] "Previous reports, from this laboratory, have shown that EPR matrix isolation is a very sensitive and versatile technique for detecting the formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals."
          [3] "The results described here clearly demonstrate that the ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends upon the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or to undergo further surface reactions."
