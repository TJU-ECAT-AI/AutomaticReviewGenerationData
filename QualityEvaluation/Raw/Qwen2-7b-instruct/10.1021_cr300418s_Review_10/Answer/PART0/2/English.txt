The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the reactivity of oxide ions towards hydrogen atom abstraction. The ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends on factors such as the strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of specific radical-forming sites on the surface, and the likelihood of radicals to desorb or undergo further surface reactions. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex nature of these catalytic systems.

The stability of the catalysts has been examined over different time periods, observing a consistent decline in activity. Lemonidou and colleagues studied the stability of NiNbO catalysts for 24 hours at 350°C. After deactivation, only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound, which likely correspond to strongly adsorbed defects on the surface. The use of ammonium oxalato niobate as a precursor led to the thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, reducing NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and affecting catalytic properties. The specific surface area increase for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound can be attributed to a mutual protective effect reported in literature. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) altered the intrinsic ethane conversion rate but significantly enhanced selectivity to ethylene, reaching the best value observed on NiNbO catalysts.

Incorporating palladium within the perovskite-type lattice serves as an effective strategy to mitigate sintering issues that can degrade the performance of automotive catalysts. The state of palladium (Pd) was comprehensively analyzed through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen. Calcination at 700°C resulted in cationic palladium with a strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure, although it likely exists in a distinct coordination environment compared to LaFeO3. The significant variations in palladium states are explained by ionic radius considerations. The smaller size of manganese (Mn) ions does not favor the occupation of octahedral sites by larger Pd3+ ions. In typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (with A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co), where the B-site coordination geometry is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is commonly assumed that a dopant element like Pd assumes a similar coordination state. Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment as the B-site can be tentatively justified based on ionic radius arguments and the electronic structures of the considered cations. While the local coordination environment of palladium might be quite similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 is expected to differ, most likely due to the crystallinity of the support oxide. The palladium state has been linked to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation within the temperature range of 200 to 900°C.

The research focuses on self-regeneration of PdLaFeO3 catalysts, providing new insights through atomic-resolution electron microscopy.

However, it mentions that the different topology of niobium oxides can lead to strikingly distinctive ways of storing entropy. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying complex catalytic systems may arise due to the complexity and variability of the materials involved.
