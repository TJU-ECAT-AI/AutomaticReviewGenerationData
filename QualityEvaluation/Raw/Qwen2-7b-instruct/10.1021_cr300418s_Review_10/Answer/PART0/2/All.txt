The state of palladium (Pd) was comprehensively analyzed through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen. Calcination at 700°C resulted in cationic palladium with a strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure, although it likely exists in a distinct coordination environment compared to LaFeO3. The significant variations in palladium states are explained by ionic radius considerations. The smaller size of manganese (Mn) ions does not favor the occupation of octahedral sites by larger Pd3+ ions. In typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (with A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co), where the B-site coordination geometry is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is commonly assumed that a dopant element like Pd assumes a similar coordination state. Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment as the B-site can be tentatively justified based on ionic radius arguments and the electronic structures of the considered cations. While the local coordination environment of palladium might be quite similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 is expected to differ, most likely due to the crystallinity of the support oxide.
