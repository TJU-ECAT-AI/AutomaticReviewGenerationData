[1] "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
          [2] "Previous reports, from this laboratory, have shown that EPR matrix isolation is a very sensitive and versatile technique for detecting the formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals."
          [3] "The results described here clearly demonstrate that the ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends upon the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or to undergo further surface reactions."

[1] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time."
          [2] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]."
          [3] "After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and corners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation."
          [4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [5] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
          [6] "When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts."

[1] "Incorporation of palladium within the perovskite-type lattice is a valuable strategy to prevent sintering phenomena that reduce the performance of automotive catalysts."
          [2] "The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen."
          [3] "Calcination at 700 C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3."
          [4] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
          [5] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
          [6] "In the typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co) where the coordination geometry of the B-site is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is generally assumed that a doping element such as Pd adopts the same coordination state."
          [7] "Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment of the B-site can be tentatively rationalized on the base of ionic radii arguments and on the electronic structure of the cations considered in this work."
          [8] "Therefore, while the short-range coordination environment of Pd may be very similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 varies, most likely depending on the crystallinity of the support oxide."
          [9] "The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200900 C."

          [4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."
          [5] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
          [6] "When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts."

[1] "Incorporation of palladium within the perovskite-type lattice is a valuable strategy to prevent sintering phenomena that reduce the performance of automotive catalysts."
          [2] "The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen."
          [3] "Calcination at 700 C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3."
          [4] "The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments."
          [5] "The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+."
          [6] "In the typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co) where the coordination geometry of the B-site is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is generally assumed that a doping element such as Pd adopts the same coordination state."
          [7] "Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment of the B-site can be tentatively rationalized on the base of ionic radii arguments and on the electronic structure of the cations considered in this work."
          [8] "Therefore, while the short-range coordination environment of Pd may be very similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 varies, most likely depending on the crystallinity of the support oxide."
          [9] "The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200900 C."
