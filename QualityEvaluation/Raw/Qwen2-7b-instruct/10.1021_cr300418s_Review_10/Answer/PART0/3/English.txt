The catalytic results of NiNbO catalysts align well with those published in literature, exhibiting similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene for catalysts with comparable compositions tested under the same conditions. The addition of niobium oxide at low loading affects the surface of the NiO phase, reducing the accessible oxygen. The remaining active sites, which are more isolated, become highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The specific surface area increase for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound can be attributed to a mutual protective effect reported in literature. Depositing niobium oxide on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO) does not alter the solid's texture but decreases the intrinsic ethane conversion rate while significantly increasing selectivity to ethylene, reaching the best value obtained on NiNbO catalysts.
