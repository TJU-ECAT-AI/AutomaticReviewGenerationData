The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the reactivity of the oxide ions towards hydrogen atom abstraction. These factors contribute to the ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals, depending on the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or undergo further surface reactions. However, the literature does not directly address the challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems.

NiNbO catalysts have been investigated for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, showing an optimal conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene at 15% Nb loading at 350°C. The addition of niobium oxide affects the surface interaction with NiO, leading to selective ethane conversion. Partial reduction of NiO with oxalic acid during preparation is also considered as a method to lower oxygen concentration. Contrary to expectations, oxygen adsorption at a surface with excess oxygen is favored due to the ease of extraction work from such surfaces.
