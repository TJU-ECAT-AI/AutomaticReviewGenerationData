<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility.</p>
<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Given the high selectivity of our catalyst (Table 3, Entry 3), the efficiency of NiO_SG is 23 times higher than those reported so far, with a surface-specific ethene production rate at 350 C of 3.9  108 molethene/m2/s.</p>
<p>These results could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and surrounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c).</p>

1. The activity of niobium oxides in catalyzing ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is attributed to their redox properties, which limit the size of NiO crystals and inhibit NiO reducibility.
2. The effectiveness of the catalyst preparation method in influencing the structure and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites implies that improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be anticipated through optimized catalyst development.
3. The efficiency of the catalyst NiO_SG is 23 times higher than previously reported, showcasing a surface-specific ethene production rate of 3.9  108 molethene/m2/s at 350 C.
4. The presence of a niobium-based thin layer on the NiO crystal surface, as proposed by Millet et al., prevents access to some active oxygen species, which is supported by electron microscopy evidence.
