<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties.</p>
<p>In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility.</p>
<p>At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO.</p>
<p>This geometric effect is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations.</p>
<p>The surface areas of the resulting materials increase significantly. The material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area of 130 m2/g, which increases with increasing Nb loading until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O.</p>
<p>The significant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium content.</p>
<p>These preliminary results clearly show the impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of nickel oxides catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH.</p>

1. The preparation method affects the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites, suggesting potential improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH with optimized catalysts.

2. The activity of nanooxides for ethane ODH correlates with their redox properties.

3. The Nb-rich phase restrains NiO reducibility, affecting the catalyst's performance.

4. NbNiO composites with 5 at.% or more Nb content exhibit reduced activity for ethane ODH but increased selectivity.

5. The Nb-rich phase likely covers unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species of NiO, influencing catalyst performance.

6. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy supports the geometric effect of the Nb-rich phase.

7. The surface area increases significantly with the incorporation of Nb, reaching a maximum of 225 m2/g at 15 at.% Nb.

8. The increase in surface area is attributed to the presence of an amorphous NixNbyO phase, whose concentration rises with increasing Nb content.

9. The preliminary results highlight the importance of preparation methods in determining the efficiency of NiO catalysts for ethane ODH.
