<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility.</p>
<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Given the high selectivity of our catalyst (Table 3, Entry 3), the efficiency of NiO_SG is 23 times higher than those reported so far, with a surface-specific ethene production rate at 350 C of 3.9  108 molethene/m2/s.</p>
<p>These results could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and surrounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c).</p>

<p>Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]. This last discovery followed the observation that nickel oxides displayed high activity and selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH [28].</p>
<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility.

1. Niobium oxides, when incorporated as dopants in nickel oxides, exhibit unique properties that influence their performance as catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). These properties include the ability to selectively produce ethene at low temperatures, and they are often found in mixed oxides. For instance, niobium has been used in molybdenum-vanadium systems since 1978, and more recently, nickel-niobium-tantalum (NiNbTa) systems have been discovered through a combinatorial approach in 2003. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxides has been observed to enhance activity and selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH, contrary to the high activation energy of oxygen desorption from nickel oxide.

2. The effectiveness of these niobium-doped nickel oxides is influenced by their redox properties. By controlling the size of nickel oxide crystallites and inhibiting the reducibility of nickel oxide, the presence of the niobium-rich phase leads to catalysts that are less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This suggests that niobium likely covers part of the non-stoichiometric, unselective oxygen species on the nickel oxide surface, which contributes to enhanced selectivity.

3. The synthesis method used to prepare the niobium-nickel oxide nanocomposites plays a crucial role in determining their structural and catalytic properties. Optimization of the catalyst preparation process could lead to further improvements in the efficiency of nickel oxide-catalyzed ethane ODH reactions.

1. 钽氧化物作为镍氧化物中的掺杂剂，显示出独特的性质，影响其作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应催化剂的性能。这些性质包括在混合氧化物中选择性地在低温下产生乙烯的能力。例如，自1978年以来，钽已经用于钼-钒系统，并且最近，通过组合方法在2003年发现了镍-钽-铌（NiNbTa）系统。将钽掺入镍氧化物中已被观察到可以增强在低温下乙烷氧化脱氢的活性和选择性，这与氧从镍氧化物高脱附能的预期相矛盾。

2. 这些钽掺杂的镍氧化物的有效性受到它们的还原性质的影响。通过控制镍氧化物晶粒的大小并抑制镍氧化物的还原性，钽丰富的相导致催化剂对于乙烷氧化脱氢的活性较低但选择性较高。这表明钽很可能覆盖了镍氧化物表面的部分非等价、非选择性的氧物种，从而增加了选择性。

3. 合成方法用于制备铌镍氧化物纳米复合材料，对确定其结构和催化性质至关重要。优化催化剂制备过程可能会进一步提高镍氧化物催化乙烷氧化脱氢反应的效率。

1. The preparation method significantly influences the structural and catalytic properties of niobium oxides catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, affecting factors such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Optimizing the catalyst could lead to further improvements in performance.

2. The activity of nanooxides derived from the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich niobium gel is linked to their redox properties rather than the bulk properties of traditional nickel oxides.

3. The efficiency of the catalyst NiO_SG, based on the sol-gel method, is remarkably high. At 350°C, it produces ethene at a rate of 3.9 × 10^8 moles per square meter per second, which is 23 times higher than previously reported catalysts.

4. The sol-gel method produces catalysts with enhanced properties for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to conventional methods, demonstrating the impact of preparation techniques.

5. The increase in surface area is attributed to the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich mixed oxide phase, which increases with higher niobium content, contributing to the catalyst's efficiency.

6. The niobium doping does not cause a contraction of the nickel oxide lattice, and the 4% decrease in weight predicted by replacing one nickel pair with niobium is negligible due to the lack of volume change in the crystallite.

7. The high surface area is explained by the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich mixed oxide phase, which has a lower density than the nickel oxide matrix and increases with higher niobium content.

8. The catalysts exhibit similar ethene yields to the 48 m^2/g NiO_SG catalyst, with slight improvements seen in formulations with smaller nickel oxide crystallites and larger lattice parameters.
