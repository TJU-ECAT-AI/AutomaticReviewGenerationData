<p>Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]. This last discovery followed the observation that nickel oxides displayed high activity and selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH [28].</p>
<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO.</p>
<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>

1. Niobium oxides, when incorporated as dopants in nickel oxides, exhibit unique properties that influence their performance as catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). These properties include the ability to selectively produce ethene at low temperatures, and they are often found in mixed oxides. For instance, niobium has been used in molybdenum-vanadium systems since 1978, and more recently, nickel-niobium-tantalum (NiNbTa) systems have been discovered through a combinatorial approach in 2003. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxides has been observed to enhance activity and selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH, contrary to the high activation energy of oxygen desorption from nickel oxide.

2. The effectiveness of these niobium-doped nickel oxides is influenced by their redox properties. By controlling the size of nickel oxide crystallites and inhibiting the reducibility of nickel oxide, the presence of the niobium-rich phase leads to catalysts that are less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This suggests that niobium likely covers part of the non-stoichiometric, unselective oxygen species on the nickel oxide surface, which contributes to enhanced selectivity.

3. The synthesis method used to prepare the niobium-nickel oxide nanocomposites plays a crucial role in determining their structural and catalytic properties. Optimization of the catalyst preparation process could lead to further improvements in the efficiency of nickel oxide-catalyzed ethane ODH reactions.

1. 钽氧化物作为镍氧化物中的掺杂剂，显示出独特的性质，影响其作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应催化剂的性能。这些性质包括在混合氧化物中选择性地在低温下产生乙烯的能力。例如，自1978年以来，钽已经用于钼-钒系统，并且最近，通过组合方法在2003年发现了镍-钽-铌（NiNbTa）系统。将钽掺入镍氧化物中已被观察到可以增强在低温下乙烷氧化脱氢的活性和选择性，这与氧从镍氧化物高脱附能的预期相矛盾。

2. 这些钽掺杂的镍氧化物的有效性受到它们的还原性质的影响。通过控制镍氧化物晶粒的大小并抑制镍氧化物的还原性，钽丰富的相导致催化剂对于乙烷氧化脱氢的活性较低但选择性较高。这表明钽很可能覆盖了镍氧化物表面的部分非等价、非选择性的氧物种，从而增加了选择性。

3. 合成方法用于制备铌镍氧化物纳米复合材料，对确定其结构和催化性质至关重要。优化催化剂制备过程可能会进一步提高镍氧化物催化乙烷氧化脱氢反应的效率。
