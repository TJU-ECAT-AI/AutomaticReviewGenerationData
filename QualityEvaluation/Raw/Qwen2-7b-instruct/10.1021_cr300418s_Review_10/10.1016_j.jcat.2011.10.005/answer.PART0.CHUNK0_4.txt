<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties.</p>
<p>Given the high selectivity of our catalyst (Entry 3), the efficiency of NiO_SG is 23 times higher than those reported so far, with a surface-specific ethene production rate at 350 C of 3.9 × 10<sup>8</sup> molethene/m<sup>2</sup>/s.</p>
<p>These preliminary results clearly show the impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of nickel oxides catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH.</p>

<p>Second, given the molecular weights of Ni (58.7 g/mol) and of Nb (92.9 g/mol), replacing one Ni2+/Ni3+ pair with one Nb5+ (which creates one nickel vacancy) would result in a ca. 4% decrease in the weight of a given crystallite.</p>
<p>The significant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium content.</p>

1. The preparation method significantly influences the structural and catalytic properties of niobium oxides catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, affecting factors such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Optimizing the catalyst could lead to further improvements in performance.

2. The activity of nanooxides derived from the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich niobium gel is linked to their redox properties rather than the bulk properties of traditional nickel oxides.

3. The efficiency of the catalyst NiO_SG, based on the sol-gel method, is remarkably high. At 350°C, it produces ethene at a rate of 3.9 × 10^8 moles per square meter per second, which is 23 times higher than previously reported catalysts.

4. The sol-gel method produces catalysts with enhanced properties for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to conventional methods, demonstrating the impact of preparation techniques.

5. The increase in surface area is attributed to the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich mixed oxide phase, which increases with higher niobium content, contributing to the catalyst's efficiency.

6. The niobium doping does not cause a contraction of the nickel oxide lattice, and the 4% decrease in weight predicted by replacing one nickel pair with niobium is negligible due to the lack of volume change in the crystallite.

7. The high surface area is explained by the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich mixed oxide phase, which has a lower density than the nickel oxide matrix and increases with higher niobium content.

8. The catalysts exhibit similar ethene yields to the 48 m^2/g NiO_SG catalyst, with slight improvements seen in formulations with smaller nickel oxide crystallites and larger lattice parameters.

1. 制备方法对镍氧化物催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢反应的结构和催化性质产生了显著影响，包括活性、选择性和稳定性的变化。优化催化剂有望进一步提高其性能。

2. 来源于缓慢氧化镍富铌胶的方法制备的纳米氧化物的活性与它们的还原性相关，而不是传统镍氧化物的固有属性。

3. 基于溶胶-凝胶法的催化剂NiO_SG表现出极高的效率。在350°C时，以每平方米每秒3.9×10^8摩尔的速度生产乙烯，比之前报道的催化剂高23倍。

4. 溶胶-凝胶方法制备的催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中展现出优于常规方法的特性，这表明制备技术的影响。

5. 表面积的增加归因于一种密度较低的非晶态铌基混合氧化物相的存在，该相随铌含量增加而增加，从而增加了催化剂的效率。

6. 铌掺杂没有引起镍氧化物晶格的收缩，并且将一个镍对替换为铌导致的约4%重量减少是微不足道的，因为晶体体积的变化可以忽略不计。

7. 高表面积是由密度较低的非晶态铌基混合氧化物相的出现解释的，这种相随铌含量的增加而增加，这些相存在于镍氧化物基质中。

8. 催化剂显示出与48 m^2/g NiO_SG催化剂相似的乙烯产率，但在较小的镍氧化物晶粒和较大的晶格参数的配方中略有改善。
