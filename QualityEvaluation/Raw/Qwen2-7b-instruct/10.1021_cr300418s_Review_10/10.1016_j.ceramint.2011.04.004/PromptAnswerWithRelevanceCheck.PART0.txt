Ceramics samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction characterization indicates that all samples are of single phase with cubic symmetry. The high-temperature electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefficients have been obtained for all samples, which means conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

The synthesis and thermoelectric properties of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics have been studied. The materials exhibit cubic symmetry and show n-type conduction with decreasing Seebeck coefficients and power factors as tantalum concentration increases. The thermal conductivity decreases with tantalum substitution, reaching a minimum of 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K for x = 0.03. The thermoelectric figure of merit reaches 0.29 at 1046 K in the undoped sample, indicating high potential for use in thermoelectric applications.

The study examines the synthesis and thermoelectric performance of Ta-doped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramics. The researchers find that as the amount of tantalum (Ta) added to the ceramic increases, the high-temperature electrical resistivity generally decreases, except for a specific sample (x = 0.05). The Seebeck coefficients for all samples are negative, indicating an n-type conduction mechanism. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum substitution. Small amounts of tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity is observed at 2.9 W/mK for a sample with 0.03 units of tantalum, at a temperature of 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit is found in the undoped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively high value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

该研究考察了Ta掺杂Sr0.9La0.1TiO3陶瓷的合成与热电性能。研究人员发现，随着添加到陶瓷中的钽（Ta）量增加，高温电导率通常会降低，除了一个特定样品（x = 0.05）。所有样品的塞贝克系数均为负值，表明为n型传导机制。绝对塞贝克系数随钽浓度的增加而降低。功率因子随钽取代度的增加而降低。少量钽掺杂可以降低热导率。在1074 K时，含有0.03单位钽的样品的最低热导率为2.9 W/mK。最高热电品质因数在未掺杂的Sr0.9La0.1TiO3样品中观察到，达到1046 K时的0.29，这是n型氧化物热电材料中相对较高的值。

Tantalum doping in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramics affects various properties such as electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and thermal conductivity. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration, leading to a reduction in the power factor. However, small amounts of tantalum doping can reduce thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity reached is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit is observed in the undoped sample, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively high value for n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

Answer: The synthesis process involves a conventional solid-state reaction method, leading to single-phase cubic perovskite structures. The electrical resistivity generally decreases with tantalum content, except for a specific sample. All samples exhibit n-type conduction, with the absolute Seebeck coefficient decreasing with tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum substitution. Small amounts of tantalum can reduce thermal conductivity, achieving a minimum of 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K. The thermoelectric figure of merit reaches 0.29 at 1046 K for the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicating relatively high performance in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

[1] "All samples are of cubic symmetry with the lattice parameter increases with increasing tantalum content."
[2] "The absolute Seebeck coefficient obviously decreases gradually with the tantalum substitution."
[3] "Therefore, the power factor is lower than that of un-doped sample."
[4] "The thermal conductivity is decreased by tantalum substitution, and this behavior confirms our previous idea."
[5] "However, the thermoelectric performance has not been improved by the tantalum doping in our work."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the complex interactions within the catalysts. The lattice parameter increases with the addition of tantalum, leading to a decrease in the absolute Seebeck coefficient and thus a reduction in the power factor compared to the undoped sample. The thermal conductivity is also decreased by tantalum substitution, which aligns with previous theoretical expectations. However, the overall thermoelectric performance did not improve with tantalum doping in this study.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，影响其作为乙烷氧化脱氢NiO催化剂的掺杂剂的行为。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的整合存在挑战，这是由于催化剂内部复杂交互作用的结果。随着钽的添加，晶格参数增加，导致绝对塞贝克系数降低，进而降低了功率因数，与未掺杂样品相比。热导率也通过钽掺杂而降低，这与之前的理论预期相吻合。然而，在这项研究中，钽掺杂的整体热电性能并未得到改善。
