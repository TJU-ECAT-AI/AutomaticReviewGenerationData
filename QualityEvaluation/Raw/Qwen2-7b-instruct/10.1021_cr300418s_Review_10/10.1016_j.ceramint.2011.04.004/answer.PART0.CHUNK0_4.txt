The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the complex interactions within the catalysts. The lattice parameter increases with the addition of tantalum, leading to a decrease in the absolute Seebeck coefficient and thus a reduction in the power factor compared to the undoped sample. The thermal conductivity is also decreased by tantalum substitution, which aligns with previous theoretical expectations. However, the overall thermoelectric performance did not improve with tantalum doping in this study.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，影响其作为乙烷氧化脱氢NiO催化剂的掺杂剂的行为。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的整合存在挑战，这是由于催化剂内部复杂交互作用的结果。随着钽的添加，晶格参数增加，导致绝对塞贝克系数降低，进而降低了功率因数，与未掺杂样品相比。热导率也通过钽掺杂而降低，这与之前的理论预期相吻合。然而，在这项研究中，钽掺杂的整体热电性能并未得到改善。
