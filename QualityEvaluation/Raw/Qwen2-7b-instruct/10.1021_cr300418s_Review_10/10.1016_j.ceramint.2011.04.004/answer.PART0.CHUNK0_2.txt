Ceramics samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction characterization indicates that all samples are of single phase with cubic symmetry. The high-temperature electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefficients have been obtained for all samples, which means conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

Tantalum doping in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramics affects various properties such as electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and thermal conductivity. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration, leading to a reduction in the power factor. However, small amounts of tantalum doping can reduce thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity reached is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit is observed in the undoped sample, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively high value for n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

在Sr0.9La0.1TiO3陶瓷中，钽掺杂对电阻率、塞贝克系数、功率因子和热导率等特性产生影响。塞贝克系数绝对值随钽浓度增加而减小，导致功率因子降低。然而，少量钽掺杂可以降低热导率。达到最低热导率2.9 W/mK是在x=0.03时，温度为1074 K。最高热电性能指标在未掺杂样品中观察到，达到0.29，温度为1046 K，这是n型氧化物热电材料相对较高的值。
