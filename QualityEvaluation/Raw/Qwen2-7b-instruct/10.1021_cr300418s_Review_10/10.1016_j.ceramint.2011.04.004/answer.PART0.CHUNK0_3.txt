Ceramics samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction characterization indicates that all samples are of single phase with cubic symmetry. The high-temperature electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefficients have been obtained for all samples, which means conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

Answer: The synthesis process involves a conventional solid-state reaction method, leading to single-phase cubic perovskite structures. The electrical resistivity generally decreases with tantalum content, except for a specific sample. All samples exhibit n-type conduction, with the absolute Seebeck coefficient decreasing with tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum substitution. Small amounts of tantalum can reduce thermal conductivity, achieving a minimum of 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K. The thermoelectric figure of merit reaches 0.29 at 1046 K for the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicating relatively high performance in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

合成过程采用常规固相反应法，得到单相立方结构的陶瓷样品。随着钽含量的增加，高温电导率通常会降低，但特定样品除外。所有样品均表现出n型传导，绝对塞贝克系数随钽浓度的增加而减小。功率因子随钽替代量的增加而降低。少量钽可以减少热导率，最低热导率为2.9 W/mK，在1074 K时获得。在1046 K时，Sr0.9La0.1TiO3样品的热电性能达到0.29，表明在n型氧化物热电材料中具有相对较高的性能。
