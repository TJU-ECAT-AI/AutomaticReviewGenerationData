The study examines the synthesis and thermoelectric performance of Ta-doped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramics. The researchers find that as the amount of tantalum (Ta) added to the ceramic increases, the high-temperature electrical resistivity generally decreases, except for a specific sample (x = 0.05). The Seebeck coefficients for all samples are negative, indicating an n-type conduction mechanism. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing tantalum concentration. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum substitution. Small amounts of tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity is observed at 2.9 W/mK for a sample with 0.03 units of tantalum, at a temperature of 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit is found in the undoped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively high value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

该研究考察了Ta掺杂Sr0.9La0.1TiO3陶瓷的合成与热电性能。研究人员发现，随着添加到陶瓷中的钽（Ta）量增加，高温电导率通常会降低，除了一个特定样品（x = 0.05）。所有样品的塞贝克系数均为负值，表明为n型传导机制。绝对塞贝克系数随钽浓度的增加而降低。功率因子随钽取代度的增加而降低。少量钽掺杂可以降低热导率。在1074 K时，含有0.03单位钽的样品的最低热导率为2.9 W/mK。最高热电品质因数在未掺杂的Sr0.9La0.1TiO3样品中观察到，达到1046 K时的0.29，这是n型氧化物热电材料中相对较高的值。
