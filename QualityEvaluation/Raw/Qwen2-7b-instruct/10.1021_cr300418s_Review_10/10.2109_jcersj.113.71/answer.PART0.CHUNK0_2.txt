The diverse properties of niobium oxides, such as their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. This process involves the insertion of niobium oxides into the NiO structure to enhance its catalytic activity. However, the complex interplay between the dopant's electronic structure and the host material's properties poses significant challenges in predicting the dopant's impact on the catalyst's performance through theoretical models. These models often fail to accurately forecast the dopant's effect on the catalyst's activity and selectivity, necessitating the development of more advanced computational techniques. Additionally, limitations in experimental characterization methods can lead to discrepancies between predicted and observed results, complicating the study of these complex catalytic systems.
