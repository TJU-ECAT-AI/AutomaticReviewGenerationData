<p>The catalytic flameless combustion (CFC) of methane allows to decrease the emission of nitrogen oxides, which usually form during high-temperature combustion in heat power plants [1,2].</p>
<p>In particular, it was found that the introduction of Ag (1030 mol%) in the structure of LaMnO3 [35], LaFeO3, LaFe0.5Co0.5O3 [6] and LaCoO3 [7] led to increasing activity with respect to unsubstituted samples.</p>
<p>Indeed, the formation of structure defects induced by the partial substitution increases oxygen mobility through the lattice.</p>
<p>For silver substituted LaFeO3 [6], an improvement of catalytic activity was also due to the intrinsic activity of metallic silver.</p>
<p>Ag addition led to a complex change of activity and resistance to poisoning.</p>
<p>The activity of FP-prepared samples doped with a small amount of Ag (e.g. 5 mol%) was indeed lower than that of the undoped LaCoO3.</p>
<p>By contrast, a further increase of Ag concentration led to increasing catalytic activity,mainly when big extraframework Ag particles were present.</p>
<p>However, at least the former method showed beneficial for LaMnO3 based catalysts, whereas LaCoO3 showed decreasing activity upon Sr addition, besides being intrinsically less resistant to S-poisoning.</p>
<p>To highlight this point, the cell volume of SG samples has been directly compared with catalyst conversion at 450 8C, or better with (100-conv%): It immediately appears that with decreasing cell volume, i.e. with higher Ag incorporation into the framework, a higher activity is achieved (Fig. 4a).</p>
<p>On this basis the activity of the SG samples show maximum activity for 5 mol% Ag doping, both when Ag is directly added during the preparation (Fig. 5) or added after synthesis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the value calculated for the SG-prepared La0.95Ag0.05CoO3 sample was approximately twice that of LaCoO3 (sample S0, Table 3), however decreasing with further Ag addition.</p>
<p>This can be explained as follows, separately considering the effect of intra- and extraframework Ag.</p>
<p>Therefore, small Ag crystallites lead to stronger AgO bond so decreasing the number of active sites for milder methane oxidation [37].</p>
<p>Anderson et al. [37] reported that the heat of oxygen adsorption on small Ag crystallites (3.7 nm) is 50 kcal/mol,much higher than the value relative to larger (27 nm) Ag crystallites.</p>
<p>Of course, this estimate is rude, due to poor resolution of the reflection, but it explains the peculiar behaviour of FP samples: a higher segregation of Ag leads to bigger Ag particle size and hence to higher activity.</p>
<p>When extraframework Ag particle size is too low, it is not sufficiently active for this reaction.</p>
<p>Ag insertion into the lattice can bring about two effects. On the one hand, it would induce an increase of oxygen vacancies concentration, due to its lower valence with respect to La.</p>

1. The introduction of silver (Ag) in the structure of certain perovskites increases their catalytic activity for flameless methane combustion, particularly when the Ag concentration reaches 1030 mol%.
2. The formation of structural defects due to partial substitution increases oxygen mobility through the lattice, enhancing catalytic activity.
3. The intrinsic activity of metallic silver contributes to the improvement of catalytic activity when Ag is introduced into the structure.
4. The activity of samples prepared by flame pyrolysis (FP) decreases when a small amount of Ag is added, but increases with higher Ag concentrations, especially when large extraframework Ag particles are present.
5. For LaCoO3, adding Sr instead of Ag reduces its catalytic activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning.
6. The activity of samples prepared by the solgel (SG) method shows maximum activity with 5 mol% Ag doping, whether the Ag is added during preparation or after synthesis.
7. The activity of SG-prepared La0.95Ag0.05CoO3 is approximately twice that of pure LaCoO3, but decreases with further Ag addition.
8. The size of Ag particles affects the catalytic activity, with larger particles leading to higher activity due to the increased surface area and oxygen mobility.
9. Small Ag particles have a stronger AgO bond, reducing the number of active sites for methane oxidation.
10. The heat of oxygen adsorption on small Ag crystallites is higher compared to larger Ag crystallites, which explains the reduced activity of small Ag particles.
11. The segregation of Ag in the FP samples leads to larger Ag particle sizes, which increases activity.
12. Low-sized extraframework Ag particles are not sufficiently active for the catalytic reaction, while large particles contribute positively.
13. Inserting Ag into the lattice induces an increase in oxygen vacancies concentration, potentially affecting the reducibility of cobalt ions and oxygen mobility.
