<p>Ag addition led to a complex change of activity and resistance to poisoning. The activity of FP-prepared samples doped with a small amount of Ag (e.g. 5 mol%) was indeed lower than that of the undoped LaCoO3. By contrast, a further increase of Ag concentration led to increasing catalytic activity,mainly when big extraframework Ag particles were present. By contrast, for SG samples a low Ag amount was beneficial for activity, due to an increased reducibility of Co3+.</p>
<p>In a previous investigation it was found [18] that in Sr1xAgxTiO3d perovskites silver may exist as intra-crystalline framework Ag2+, likely substituting part of Sr2+ in the lattice, and as inter-crystalline metallic silver. Ag2+ ions could interact with some Ox species, leading to Ox /Ag2+ couples and so influencing oxygen mobility and catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is interesting to see whether it is possible to couple the beneficial effect of Ag doping with the intrinsically high activity of LaCoO3. Indeed, silver substitution could end in Ag incorporation into the framework, in principle leading to an increased amount of defects in the framework, due to different ionic radius and lower valence of Ag with respect to La. Both these aspects could influence the mobility of lattice oxygen, which is the active factor for methane combustion in the high temperature region.</p>
<p>Upon sulphur doping, a more or less evident conversion decrease was always observed, at difference with more suitable dopants from this point of view, such as Sr. A slightly higher poisoning effect was observed in the case of FP-prepared samples,likely due to their higher surface exposure. However, with proper formulation a satisfactory residual activity was attained with Ag- doped samples, comparable with that of the fresh undoped ones.</p>

The behavior of silver (Ag) as a dopant in LaCoO3 catalysts is influenced by several factors. Firstly, the addition of Ag leads to a complex change in catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning. Specifically, for flame pyrolysis (FP)-prepared samples, Ag doping with a small amount (e.g., 5 mol%) results in lower activity compared to undoped LaCoO3. However, increasing Ag concentration, particularly when large extraframework Ag particles are present, leads to enhanced catalytic activity. In contrast, for solgel (SG) samples, a small amount of Ag is beneficial for activity, attributed to the increased reducibility of Co3+. 

Silver in Sr1xAgxTiO3d perovskites exists as intra-crystalline framework Ag2+, which might substitute Sr2+ ions in the lattice and interact with oxidized species, thereby influencing oxygen mobility and catalytic activity. Incorporating Ag into the framework of LaCoO3 could lead to increased defect density, due to the smaller ionic radius and lower valence of Ag compared to La. This could affect the mobility of lattice oxygen, which is crucial for methane combustion at high temperatures.

When subjected to sulfur poisoning, a clear decrease in activity is observed in Ag-doped samples, contrasting with other more suitable dopants like strontium (Sr). FP-prepared samples show a slightly higher poisoning effect due to their greater surface exposure. However, with appropriate formulation, satisfactory residual activity is achieved in Ag-doped samples, comparable to the activity of undoped catalysts. This suggests that a proper balance of Ag incorporation can enhance the resistance to sulfur poisoning while maintaining or even improving catalytic activity.

银（Ag）作为LaCoO3催化剂掺杂剂的行为受到多种因素的影响。首先，Ag掺杂导致催化活性和对毒性的复杂变化。具体来说，对于火焰分解（FP）制备的样品，Ag掺杂量较小（例如，5摩尔%）时，活性低于未掺杂的LaCoO3。然而，增加Ag浓度，特别是当存在较大的额外框架Ag颗粒时，催化活性会提高。相比之下，对于溶胶（SG）样品，少量的Ag对活性有益，归因于Co3+的还原性增强。 

在Sr1xAgxTiO3d钙钛矿中，银以框架内的Ag2+形式存在，可能取代晶格中的Sr2+离子并与氧化物种相互作用，从而影响氧的流动性及其催化活性。将Ag引入LaCoO3的晶格中可能会导致缺陷密度的增加，由于Ag的离子半径较小且电荷较低与La相比。这可能会改变晶格氧的流动性，这对于高温下甲烷燃烧至关重要。

当受到硫化物中毒时，在Ag掺杂样品中观察到明显的活性降低，与其他更合适的掺杂剂如锶（Sr）形成对比。FP制备的样品显示出更高的中毒效应，这是由于其更大的表面积暴露所致。然而，通过适当的配方，可以实现满意的残留活性在Ag掺杂样品中，与未掺杂催化剂的活性相当。这表明适当的Ag掺入平衡可以增强对硫化物中毒的抵抗力，并维持或甚至改善催化活性。
