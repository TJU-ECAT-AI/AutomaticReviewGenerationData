[1] "Indeed, silver substitution could end in Ag incorporation into the framework, in principle leading to an increased amount of defects in the framework, due to different ionic radius and lower valence of Ag with respect to La. Both these aspects could influence the mobility of lattice oxygen, which is the active factor for methane combustion in the high temperature region."
[2] "By contrast, the FP technique is intrinsically characterised by a flash calcination, which limits any deep sintering of the powder, always leading to much higher surface area with respect to the homologous SG-prepared samples, as well as to smaller crystal size."
[3] "By comparing the kinetic constant of the undoped catalysts,one may notice that the FP sample doubles the value obtained with the SG one."
[4] "Furthermore, it is interesting to see whether it is possible to couple the beneficial effect of Ag doping with the intrinsically high activity of LaCoO3."
[5] "Indeed, when the comparison between the activity on fresh and doped samples is carried out by considering the whole activity curve, one may observe that even after poisoning the FP-prepared La0.8Ag0.2CoO3 sample showed satisfactory activity, e.g. lower than the undoped FP-prepared LaCoO3, but higher than the SG-prepared one, even when considering the fresh samples."

1. Incorporation of silver into the framework could introduce defects due to its different ionic radius and lower valence compared to lanthanum, potentially affecting the mobility of lattice oxygen in the high-temperature region, which is crucial for methane combustion.
2. The flame pyrolysis technique typically provides a higher surface area and smaller crystal size compared to the sol-gel method, due to its flash calcination process.
3. The kinetic constant of the undoped catalysts was found to be higher for the flame pyrolysis samples compared to the sol-gel samples.
4. There is potential to combine the advantages of silver doping with the high activity of LaCoO3 catalysts.
5. Even after sulfur poisoning, the flame pyrolysis-prepared La0.8Ag0.2CoO3 sample maintained satisfactory activity, albeit lower than the undoped flame pyrolysis sample, but higher than the sol-gel sample, even when considering the fresh samples.

1. 银的掺入可能会在结构中引入缺陷，由于其与镧不同的离子半径和较低的电荷状态，这可能会影响高温区域中晶格氧的移动性，这是甲烷燃烧的关键因素。
2. 火焰热解技术通常提供更高的比表面积和更小的晶体尺寸，这是由于其快速烧结过程。
3. 未掺杂催化剂的动量常数在火焰热解样品中的值高于溶胶-凝胶样品。
4. 有可能将银掺杂的优点与LaCoO3催化剂的高活性结合起来。
5. 即使在硫化物中毒之后，火焰热解制备的La0.8Ag0.2CoO3样品仍保持了令人满意的活性，尽管其活性低于未掺杂的火焰热解样品，但高于溶胶-凝胶样品，即使考虑的是新鲜样品。
