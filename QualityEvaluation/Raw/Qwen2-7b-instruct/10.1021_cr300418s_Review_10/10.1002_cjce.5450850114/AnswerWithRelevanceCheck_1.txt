        [Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition) is a definitive instructional and reference text that has been written for a broad chemical science and engineering audience. The text has been authored with a balanced academic and industrial perspective of industrial catalysis by authors who have been instrumental in advancing the discipline. This book directly addresses the academic need for a comprehensive course text, while providing a level of information and detail for several industrially relevant processes that will be of particular interest to the practising chemist and engineer. The result is a very readable and comprehendible text for the engineer and chemist alike, which is based on a foundation of using fundamental aspects of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial design and optimization of industrial catalytic processes.]
