1. Our research utilizes scanning-tunneling microscopy and density-functional theory to investigate the spatial relationship between oxygen vacancies and the accompanying Ce3 ion pair in defective CeO2111 films. The two Ce3 ions often occupy distinct cationic shells around the vacancy, leading to a variation in their chemical environment that results in the splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels detectable via STM spectroscopy. The position of the Ce3 ion pair is manifested in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, where Ce4 ions adjacent to the defect appear brighter due to the expansion of their 4f orbitals in the presence of the vacancy. The study demonstrates that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion not directly next to the oxygen vacancy, offering insights into the electron localization phenomena in ceria surfaces.

2. The presence of an oxygen vacancy in ceria films typically leads to the formation of two electrons left behind in the lattice, which combine to form two reduced Ce3 species. These electrons occupy split-off states within the O2p  Ce5d band gap of ceria, being highly localized in space. However, the exact location of these electrons relative to the oxygen vacancy remains ambiguous based on photoelectron spectroscopy data alone. Our research employs a combination of scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT) to explore the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and the associated Ce3 ion pairs in a CeO2 (111) surface. We find that electrons formed upon vacancy creation localize in Ce ions that are not directly next to the defect, thus shedding light on electron localization effects in ceria systems.

3. The study reports that ceria films prepared in an excess of oxygen exhibit a small defect concentration, and oxygen vacancies are introduced by injecting 50 eV electrons at 100 K. Despite the lack of equilibrium distribution due to the highly nonthermal formation process, most defects are located near the oxide surface owing to the low excitation energies. At positive bias, oxygen vacancies manifest as paired and tripled protrusions of 0.4 Å height, marking the Ce4 ions around the vacancy. At negative polarity, they transform into atom-sized holes, confirming their identity as surface oxygen vacancies. The electronic properties of surface defects are analyzed through STM conductance spectroscopy, revealing a band gap that ranges from 2.5 (valence band) to 3.5 V (conduction band) in the stoichiometric film. Inside this gap, an additional dI=dV peak at 2.3 eV corresponds to the unoccupied Ce 4f band. This finding suggests a relation between the gap states and the localized filled 4f levels at the Ce3 ions. Further investigation using density-functional theory calculations confirms the localization of electrons in Ce ions not adjacent to the oxygen vacancy, providing a clearer understanding of electron localization phenomena in ceria surfaces.

4. In the context of the research, the study demonstrates that electrons left behind upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy occupy Ce sites that are not in a next-neighbor position to the defect. This discovery offers a direct route for monitoring oxidation and reduction processes in the catalytically relevant ceria system. By employing scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT), the researchers are able to explore the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and the associated Ce3 ion pairs in a CeO2 (111) surface. The findings indicate that electrons localize in Ce ions that are not directly next to the oxygen vacancy, providing insights into the electron localization effects in ceria surfaces.

5. The research involves the preparation of ceria films on a Ru(0001) surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at 10 K. The films are grown by depositing cerium atoms in 5 × 10−6 mbar oxygen at temperatures of 100 K and 450 K, followed by annealing to 1000 K in oxygen. The mean film thickness is adjusted to five O-Ce-O tri-layers, and highly resolved STM measurements are obtained at positive sample bias, indicating that the Ce4 ions are responsible for the contrast. At negative bias, atomic resolution is more challenging to achieve due to the filled O 2p orbitals governing the contrast. The observed atom periodicity aligns with the CeO2 lattice constant of 3.88 Å. Oxygen vacancies are generated by injecting 50 eV electrons at 100 K, and their identification is confirmed through STM imaging. The study further analyzes the electronic properties of surface defects using STM conductance spectroscopy, revealing the presence of filled f states at the position of the Ce3 ions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electron localization phenomena in ceria surfaces and offer a basis for the development of advanced ceria-based catalysts.

6. The study presents a comprehensive investigation into the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and the associated Ce3 ion pairs in a CeO2 (111) surface using scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT). The research identifies that electrons left behind upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy occupy Ce sites that are not directly next to the defect. This finding provides a direct method for monitoring oxidation and reduction processes in the catalytically relevant ceria system. Through STM imaging and DFT calculations, the researchers explore the spatial relationship between oxygen defects and the Ce3 ion pairs, demonstrating that electrons localize in Ce ions not adjacent to the oxygen vacancy. These insights into electron localization phenomena in ceria surfaces contribute to the development of more efficient ceria-based catalysts and offer a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of ceria in catalytic applications.

2. 在铈氧化物薄膜中，当形成缺氧空位时，通常会留下两个电子在晶格中，结合形成两个减少的铈3物种。这些电子占据铈2p轨道和铈5d带隙内部的填充状态，高度局部化在空间内。然而，仅基于光电谱数据无法确定这些电子相对于氧气空位的确切位置。我们的研究结合扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）来探索铈（111）表面中氧气缺陷与相关铈3离子对的空间相关性。我们发现，形成空位后留下的电子定位在与空位不直接相邻的铈离子上，为理解铈表面的电子局部化现象提供了更清晰的见解。

3. 研究报告指出，准备在过剩氧气中的铈薄膜显示了较小的缺陷浓度，并通过注入50eV电子在100K下生成氧气空位。尽管由于高度非热形成过程缺乏平衡分布，大多数缺陷仍位于氧化物表面，这是由于低激发能量。在正偏压下，氧气空位表现为配对和三重突起的0.4 Å高度，标记着周围铈4离子的位置。在负极性下，它们转变为原子大小的孔，证实了它们作为表面氧气空位的身份。通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）电导光谱分析，揭示了从2.5（价带）到3.5 V（传导带）的带隙范围在等比薄膜中。在这一间隙内，检测到一个额外的dI=dV峰位于2.3 eV处，对应于未占用的铈4f带。这表明间隙状态与铈3离子上的局部化填充4f能级之间的关系。进一步的研究利用密度泛函理论计算确认了留在与氧气空位不相邻的铈离子上的电子定位，为理解铈表面的电子局部化现象提供了深入的见解。

4. 在此研究中，研究人员通过在Ru（0001）表面上在超高真空条件下以10 K运行的扫描隧道显微镜制备铈薄膜。铈原子通过在5×10−6 mbar氧气下在100 K和450 K温度下沉积在薄膜上进行生长，然后在氧气中退火至1000 K。平均薄膜厚度调整为五层O-Ce-O三角层，并在正样品偏置下获得高度解析的STM测量，指示铈4离子负责对比度。在负偏置下，原子分辨率更难实现，因为被填满的O 2p轨道控制对比度。观察到的原子周期性与铈氧化物晶格常数一致，为3.88 Å。通过注入50 eV电子在100 K下生成氧气空位，其识别得到了STM成像的确认。研究进一步通过STM电导光谱分析分析表面缺陷的电子性质，揭示了铈3离子的存在填充f状态。这些发现对于理解铈表面的电子局部化现象以及开发基于铈的高效催化剂具有重要意义。

5. 研究采用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）对铈（111）表面中氧气缺陷与相关铈3离子对的空间相关性进行了全面调查。研究结果表明，形成空位后留下的电子定位在与空位不直接相邻的铈离子上。这些发现提供了一种直接方法来监测催化相关铈系统的氧化和还原过程。通过STM成像和DFT计算，研究人员探讨了氧气缺陷与铈3离子对的空间关系，证明了电子定位在与氧气空位不相邻的铈离子上。这些关于铈表面的电子局部化现象的见解有助于开发更高效的铈基催化剂，并为理解铈在催化应用中的行为机制提供了更清晰的理解。
