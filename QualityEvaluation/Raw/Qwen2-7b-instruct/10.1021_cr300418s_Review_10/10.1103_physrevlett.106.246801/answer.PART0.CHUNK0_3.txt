The study investigates the spatial correlation between oxygen vacancies and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a defective CeO2111 film. By employing scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT), researchers identified that the two Ce3 ions can occupy different cationic shells around the vacancy, leading to a splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels detectable with STM spectroscopy. Characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which show the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark, confirm the localization of at least one excess electron in a Ce ion not adjacent to the O vacancy. The study demonstrates that STM imaging and spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations provide insights into the localization of excess electrons in defective CeO2 surfaces upon oxygen vacancy formation. The research identifies six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV and finds that for Ce3 ions with different coordination numbers (CNs), there is a splitting of the f orbitals due to the different distances from the vacancy. The study also concludes that the localization of the Ce3 ions with respect to the defect is not deduced from the splitting but is instead contained in empty-state STM topographies. The research highlights the importance of considering the local electronic structure when interpreting STM images of defective ceria surfaces.

研究通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT），对缺陷CeO2111薄膜中的氧空位与相关Ce3离子对的空间关联进行了调查。研究人员识别出，两个Ce3离子可以占据不同阳离子壳层围绕空位，导致填充的Ce3 f能级分裂，可由STM光谱检测。在空态STM图像中观察到的具有特征缺陷模式，显示空位附近Ce4离子的明亮出现而Ce3则保持暗淡，证实至少一个过剩电子位于与O空位不相邻的Ce离子中。研究表明，STM成像和光谱分析与DFT计算结合，为理解缺损CeO2表面中氧空位形成后的过剩电子定位提供了洞察。研究识别出六种Ce3离子对配置，其缺陷形成能低于2.6 eV，并发现对于不同配位数（CN）的Ce3离子，由于与空位的距离不同，f轨道存在分裂。研究还得出结论，Ce3离子相对于空位的定位不能从分裂中推断出来，而是包含在空态STM拓扑图中。研究强调考虑局部电子结构在解释缺损铈酸盐表面的STM图像时的重要性。
