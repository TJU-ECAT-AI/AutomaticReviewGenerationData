<p>Electron Localization in Defective Ceria Films: A Study with Scanning-Tunneling Microscopy and Density-Functional Theory</p>
<p>Ceria films are prepared in an excess of O2 and exhibit only a small defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are thus generated by injecting 50 eV electrons (1 mC dose) at 100 K.</p>
<p>On defective ceria, also filled f states should appear at the position of the Ce3 ions [4,20]. Their detection is challenging due to the small tip overlap with the localized states in the gap.</p>
<p>The high spatial confinement and energy position of the gap states suggest a relation to the filled 4f levels localized at the Ce3 ions, as similar states were detected with electron-energy loss and photoelectron spectroscopy before [5,15].</p>
<p>While the dI=dV maximum at 2.3 V reflects the empty Ce 4f band, the peaks around 1:5 V are assigned to filled f states.</p>
<p>We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I).</p>
<p>This information is, however, contained in empty-state STM topographies, which also reflect the local electronic structure of the ceria surface.</p>
<p>Although the precise position of the two Ce3 ions is not revealed, we have demonstrated that they always sit in different coordination spheres around the defect, in agreement with earlier theoretical results [11].</p>

1. Ceria films are created with an excess of oxygen, resulting in a low defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are introduced by applying 50 electron volts (1 microcoulomb dose) at 100 Kelvin.

2. When examining defective ceria, filled f states are identified at the location of Ce3 ions. Detection of these states is difficult due to the small overlap between the tip and localized states in the gap.

3. The high spatial confinement and energy position of the gap states suggest a connection to the filled 4f levels localized at the Ce3 ions, which was previously confirmed using electron-energy loss and photoelectron spectroscopy methods.

4. The dI=dV peak at 2.3 volts indicates the empty Ce 4f band, whereas peaks around 1.5 volts are attributed to filled f states.

5. Six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair exist with formation energies below 2.6 electron volts (Table I).

6. Information regarding the precise position of the two Ce3 ions is not provided, but it is confirmed that they are always situated in distinct coordination spheres around the defect, aligning with earlier theoretical studies.

1. 使用过剩的氧气制备铈亚薄膜，缺陷浓度较低。通过在100开尔文下施加50电子伏特（1微库仑剂量）来引入氧空位。

2. 在有缺陷的铈亚中，发现在铈3离子位置存在填充的f状态。由于尖端与间隙中局部化状态的小重叠，检测这些状态具有挑战性。

3. 高空间限制和能量位置的间隙状态暗示与靠近铈3离子的填充4f能级有关联，先前通过电子能量损失和光电子谱学方法确认了这一点。

4. 2.3伏特处的dI=dV峰代表空的Ce 4f带，而大约1.5伏特处的峰值被归因于填充的f状态。

5. 表I中列出六种铈3离子对的配置，其形成能低于2.6电子伏特。

6. 尽管没有提供两个铈3离子的确切位置信息，但证实它们总是位于缺陷周围的不同配位球体中，这与之前的理论研究结果一致。
