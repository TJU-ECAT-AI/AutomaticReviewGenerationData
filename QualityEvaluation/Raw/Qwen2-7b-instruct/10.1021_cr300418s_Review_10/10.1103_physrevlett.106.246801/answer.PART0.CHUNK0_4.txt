<p>Ceria films are prepared in an excess of O2 and exhibit only a small defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are thus generated by injecting 50 eV electrons (1 mC dose) at 100 K. Because of the highly nonthermal formation process, the defects are not expected to be in an equilibrium distribution; however, most of them are located in the oxide surface given the low excitation energies.</p>
<p>Also, subsurface vacancies that appear as three protruding maxima at negative bias are occasionally observed but have been disregarded in this study [Fig. 1(c), dashed triangle].</p>
<p>At positive bias, they appear as paired and tripled protrusions of 0.4 A height, which mark the Ce4 ions around the vacancy as shown below [Figs. 1(d) and 1(e)].</p>
<p>The mean film thickness is adjusted to five O-Ce-O tri-layers. Highly resolved STM measurements are mainly obtained at positive sample bias (unoccupied states), indicating that the Ce4 ions are responsible for the contrast (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>On defective ceria, also filled f states should appear at the position of the Ce3 ions [4,20]. Their detection is challenging due to the small tip overlap with the localized states in the gap. Sufficient spectral sensitivity is achieved only if the tip is stabilized inside the empty f band and then ramped to negative bias [Fig. 2(b), left].</p>
<p>While the dI=dV maximum at 2.3 V reflects the empty Ce 4f band, the peaks around 1.5 V are assigned to filled f states.</p>
<p>We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I). The Ce3 positions are hereby labeled in an nm scheme, with m being the cationic layer counted from the surface and n denoting the shell of cations surrounding the vacancy.</p>
<p>From those results, it becomes clear why the experimental spectra show either a double- or a single-peak structure. The two Ce3 ions in spec 1 of Fig. 2(b) are apparently located in rather different environments, while the pair in spec 2 has a comparable CN.</p>
<p>However, this configuration has not been detected in the experiment.</p>

The document discusses the study of electron localization in defective ceria films. The researchers use scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT) to identify the spatial correlation between an oxygen vacancy and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a defective CeO2111 film. The two Ce3 ions can occupy different cationic shells around the vacancy, leading to a splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels, which is detected with STM spectroscopy. The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark. The study demonstrates that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy.

本文件研究了缺陷铈氧化物薄膜中电子局部化的现象。研究人员利用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）来识别缺氧空位及其周围关联的Ce3离子对在缺氧CeO2111薄膜中的空间相关性。两个Ce3离子可以在不同的阳离子层中占据，导致填充的Ce3 f能级分裂，这可以通过STM光谱学检测。Ce3离子对的位置反映在空态STM图像中观察到的特征缺陷模式，这些模式源自缺氧空位附近明亮的Ce4离子而Ce3则保持暗淡。研究表明至少一个多余的电子局部化在与缺氧空位相邻的Ce离子中。
