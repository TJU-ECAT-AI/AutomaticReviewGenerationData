[1] "The reduction of ceria can be followed with photoelectron spectroscopy, by using the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels as a measure [5,6]."
[2] "STM and atomic force microscopy have been successfully employed to identify single O vacancies in surface or subsurface ceria layers [7,8]."
[3] "However, no information on the electronic properties of the defects was acquired in this case, and the question of electron localization remained unsolved."
[4] "We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I)."
[5] "In ceria nanoclusters, the Ce3 ions were found to form preferentially at low-coordinated edge sites, even if the O vacancy is far away [14]."
[6] "In conclusion, STM imaging and spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations provide an unique insight into the localization of the two excess electrons that remain in the CeO2 (111) surface upon O vacancy formation."

The study employs scanning-tunneling microscopy and density-functional theory to identify the spatial correlation between an oxygen vacancy and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a defective CeO2111 film. The two Ce3 ions can occupy different cationic shells around the vacancy, leading to a splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels. This finding is detected through STM spectroscopy. The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark. Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy.

研究使用扫描隧道显微镜和密度泛函理论来识别氧空位与关联的Ce3离子对在缺陷CeO2111薄膜中的空间相关性。两个Ce3离子可以占据不同的阳离子壳层围绕空位，导致填充的Ce3 f能级分裂。这一发现通过STM光谱检测到。Ce3离子对的位置在空态STM图像中以特征性的缺陷模式反映出来，这些模式是由靠近缺陷的Ce4离子的明亮外观产生的，而Ce3则保持暗淡。这两项发现表明至少有一个多余的电子局部化在一个与氧空位相邻的Ce离子中。
