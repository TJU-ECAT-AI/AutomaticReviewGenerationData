[1] "The reducibility of LaFeO3 was remarkably enhanced after incorporation of Pd into the lattice, resulting in a reduction peak at a temperature as low as 78 C."
[2] "This outstanding redox characteristic of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 led to great performance for NO reduction and CO oxidation at low temperatures."
[3] "NO decomposition was difficult over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at temperatures below 500 C. In contrast, N2O could be decomposed at T > 350 C, achieving a N2 yield of 31% at 500 C and 50,000 h1 GHSV."
[4] "O2 strongly inhibited N2 yield by suppressing the reducing agent through unfavorable CO oxidation."

1. Incorporation of palladium into the lattice of LaFeO3 significantly enhanced its reducibility, enabling a reduction peak at a low temperature of 78 C.

2. This exceptional redox property of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 resulted in superior catalytic performance for the reduction of nitrogen oxides and oxidation of carbon monoxide at low temperatures.

3. Decomposition of nitrogen oxides was challenging over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at temperatures below 500 C. However, nitrogen dioxide oxide could be decomposed at temperatures above 350 C, achieving a nitrogen yield of 31% at 500 C under a gas hourly space velocity of 50,000 h1.

4. Oxygen in the feed had a strong inhibitory effect on nitrogen yield by suppressing the reducing agent through unfavorable carbon monoxide oxidation.

1. 将钯掺入LaFeO3晶格中显著提高了其可还原性，使得在78 C的低温下就能发生还原峰。

2. 这种非凡的氧化还原特性使得LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3在低温下表现出优异的氮氧化物还原和一氧化碳氧化性能。

3. 在低于500 C的温度下，LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3中的氮氧化物分解较为困难。然而，在350 C以上的温度下，氮二氧化物可以被分解，达到500 C时氮的产率为31%，气体小时空间速度为50,000 h1。

4. 饲料中的氧气对氮的产率有强烈的抑制作用，通过不利的一氧化碳氧化抑制了还原剂。
