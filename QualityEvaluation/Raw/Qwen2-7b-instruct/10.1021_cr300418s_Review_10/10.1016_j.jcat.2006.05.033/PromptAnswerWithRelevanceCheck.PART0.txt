The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, the ability to generate anion vacancies after doping with copper or palladium ions enhances the catalytic performance. The enhanced reducibility of the perovskite structure, particularly at lower temperatures, leads to improved conversion rates of both NO and N2O. The presence of a reducing agent facilitates the transformation of NO to N2 or N2O, and the oxidized surface can be continuously reduced by CO, promoting the production of CO2. Palladium doping further boosts the catalyst's performance at lower temperatures, demonstrating its superior redox properties. However, the presence of oxygen in the feed stream strongly inhibits the production of N2, as it competes with the reducing agent, CO, leading to its oxidation instead.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。具体来说，铜或钯离子掺杂后产生阴离子空位的能力增强了催化剂的性能。结构的增强还原性，特别是在较低温度下，促进了NO和N2O的转化率的提高。掺杂剂的存在使NO转化为N2或N2O，氧化化的表面可以连续被CO还原，促进CO2的生成。钯掺杂进一步提高了在较低温度下的催化剂性能，显示了其优越的氧化还原性质。然而，在进料流中氧气的存在强烈抑制了N2的产生，因为它与还原剂CO竞争，导致其氧化而不是还原。
