[1] "Nanoscale LaFe1x(Cu, Pd)xO3 perovskites were prepared by reactive grinding with specific surface areas above 30 m2/g, even after calcination at 500 C for 5 h, and crystal domain sizes below 20 nm."
[2] "More anion vacancies were generated after Cu2+ partial substitution of Fe3+ ions in the B sites of the lattice due to a positive charge deficiency."
[3] "The nitrosyl species formed via NO chemical adsorption on these anion vacancies was highly reactive toward CO according to TPSR experiments."
[4] "On the other hand, Cu substitution also enhanced the reducibility of lanthanum ferrite and accelerated the regeneration of anion vacancies on the surface."
[5] "Therefore, a significant improvement in catalytic performance of NO + CO reaction was achieved over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 compared with LaFeO3."
[6] "The reducibility of LaFeO3 was remarkably enhanced after incorporation of Pd into the lattice, resulting in a reduction peak at a temperature as low as 78 C."
[7] "This outstanding redox characteristic of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 led to great performance for NO reduction and CO oxidation at low temperatures."
[8] "At low temperatures, the chemisorbed NO (nitrosyl species) was dissociated over perovskites with the formation of both N2 and N2O, as well as an oxidized surface."
[9] "This oxidized surface subsequently can be reduced by CO with regeneration of anion vacancies for the continuous reaction."
[10] "N2O was further reduced by CO, and this transformation became pronounced with increasing temperature."
[11] "NO decomposition was difficult over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at temperatures below 500 C."
[12] "In contrast, N2O could be decomposed at T > 350 C, achieving a N2 yield of 31% at 500 C and 50,000 h−1 GHSV."
[13] "Nevertheless, both NO and N2O transformations were obviously promoted in the presence of CO."
[14] "O2 strongly inhibited N2 yield by suppressing the reducing agent through unfavorable CO oxidation."
[15] "As a result, the reaction of NO and CO in the presence of 5% O2 was controlled by CO oxidation."

1. 这些铁氧体在500°C煅烧5小时后，表面积仍超过30 m2/g。

2. 铜掺杂导致形成带正电荷缺陷的阴离子空位。

3. 通过NO化学吸附形成的硝基物种对CO具有高度反应性。

4. 铜掺杂也增加了镧铁氧体的可还原性，并加速了表面阴离子空位的再生。

5. 在使用LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3时，相对于LaFeO3，NO + CO反应的催化性能显著提高。

6. 含有Pd的镧铁氧体在78°C处产生了显著的还原峰，增强了其氧化还原特性。

7. 具有LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3的镧铁氧体在低温下表现出优异的NO还原和CO氧化性能，这是由于其出色的氧化还原特性。

8. 低温下，吸附的NO（硝基物种）被分解，形成N2和N2O，以及氧化表面。

9. 氧化表面可以通过CO被还原，再生阴离子空位以实现连续反应。

10. 当温度高于350°C时，N2O可以被分解，500°C和50,000 h−1 GHSV时，N2产率为31%。

11. 无论是在存在CO的情况下，NO和N2O的转化都被显著促进。

12. 氧气对N2产率有强烈的抑制作用，通过不利于CO氧化来抑制还原剂。

13. 因此，在5%氧气存在的情况下，NO和CO的反应受CO氧化控制。
