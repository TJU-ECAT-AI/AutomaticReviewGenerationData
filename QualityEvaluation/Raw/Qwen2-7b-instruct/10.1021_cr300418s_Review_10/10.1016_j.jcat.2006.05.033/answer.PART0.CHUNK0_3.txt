[1] "Perovskite-type oxides with the general formula ABO3,where A usually stands for a rare earth metal cation coor- dinated by 12 oxygens and B usually designates a transition metal cation surrounded by six oxygens in octahedral coordi- nation, exhibit interesting physicochemical properties."
[2] "The catalytic performance of LaFeO3 can be considerably improved via 20% Cu substitution, leading to a 74% N2 yield and 72% CO conversion at 350 C, under an atmosphere of 3000 ppm NO and 3000 ppm CO in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1."
[3] "This improvement was ascribed to the facility in generation of anion vacancies after Cu incorporation, which plays a crucial role on NO adsorption and dissociation."
[4] "In addition, the enhanced reducibility of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 after Cu substitution results in the promotion of CO oxidation and anion vacancy regeneration,providing another clue for this improvement."
[5] "Conversion of both NO and N2O is significantly improved by the presence of the reducing agent."
[6] "A mechanism was proposed with dissociation of chemisorbed NO, forming N2 and/or N2O, and an oxidized perovskite surface, which was continuously reduced by CO with the generation of CO2."
[7] "Great performance at low temperature was found over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 with a 96% NO conversion and 86% CO conversion at 300 C, corresponding to the outstanding redox properties of this catalyst."
[8] "O2 has a strongly detrimental effect, leading to the consumption of the reducing agent by oxidation."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, the ability to generate anion vacancies after doping with copper or palladium ions enhances the catalytic performance. The enhanced reducibility of the perovskite structure, particularly at lower temperatures, leads to improved conversion rates of both NO and N2O. The presence of a reducing agent facilitates the transformation of NO to N2 or N2O, and the oxidized surface can be continuously reduced by CO, promoting the production of CO2. Palladium doping further boosts the catalyst's performance at lower temperatures, demonstrating its superior redox properties. However, the presence of oxygen in the feed stream strongly inhibits the production of N2, as it competes with the reducing agent, CO, leading to its oxidation instead.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。具体来说，铜或钯离子掺杂后产生阴离子空位的能力增强了催化剂的性能。结构的增强还原性，特别是在较低温度下，促进了NO和N2O的转化率的提高。掺杂剂的存在使NO转化为N2或N2O，氧化化的表面可以连续被CO还原，促进CO2的生成。钯掺杂进一步提高了在较低温度下的催化剂性能，显示了其优越的氧化还原性质。然而，在进料流中氧气的存在强烈抑制了N2的产生，因为它与还原剂CO竞争，导致其氧化而不是还原。
