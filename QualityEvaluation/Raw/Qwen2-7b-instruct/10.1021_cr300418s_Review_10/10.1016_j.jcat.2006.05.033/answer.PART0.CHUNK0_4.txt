The catalytic performance of LaFeO3 can be considerably improved via 20% Cu substitution, leading to a 74% N2 yield and 72% CO conversion at 350 C, under an atmosphere of 3000 ppm NO and 3000 ppm CO in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1.
This improvement was ascribed to the facility in generation of anion vacancies after Cu incorporation, which plays a crucial role on NO adsorption and dissociation.
In addition, the enhanced reducibility of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 after Cu substitution results in the promotion of CO oxidation and anion vacancy regeneration, providing another clue for this improvement.

The catalytic performance of LaFeO3 was significantly enhanced through the substitution of 20% copper, achieving 74% nitrogen yield and 72% carbon monoxide conversion at 350°C. This improvement is attributed to the increased creation of anion vacancies upon copper incorporation, which facilitates NO adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the improved reducibility of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3, post-copper substitution, boosts CO oxidation and the regeneration of anion vacancies, offering additional insights into this enhancement.

通过将20%的铜进行置换，LaFeO3的催化性能显著增强，达到350°C时74%的氮气产率和72%的一氧化碳转化率。这种改进归因于铜掺杂后生成的阴离子空位增加，促进了NO的吸附与分解。此外，LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3在铜置换后的增强还原性提高了CO氧化作用以及阴离子空位的再生，为这一改进提供了额外的解释。

The catalytic activity of LaFeO3 was notably enhanced by substituting 20% copper, resulting in a 74% nitrogen yield and 72% carbon monoxide conversion at 350°C under a helium atmosphere with 3000 ppm NO and 3000 ppm CO at a space velocity of 50,000 h1. This enhancement was attributed to the ease of generating anion vacancies following copper incorporation, playing a key role in NO adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, the increased reducibility of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 post-copper substitution promotes CO oxidation and the regeneration of anion vacancies, offering another explanation for this improvement.
