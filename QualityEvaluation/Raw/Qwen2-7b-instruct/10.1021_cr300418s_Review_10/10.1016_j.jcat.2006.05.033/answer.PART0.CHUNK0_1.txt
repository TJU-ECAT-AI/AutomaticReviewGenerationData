[1] "Nanoscale LaFe1x(Cu, Pd)xO3 perovskites were prepared by reactive grinding with specific surface areas above 30 m2/g,even after calcination at 500 C for 5 h, and crystal domain sizes below 20 nm."
[2] "The catalytic performance of LaFeO3 can be considerably improved via 20% Cu substitution, leading to a 74% N2 yield and 72% CO conversion at 350 C, under an atmosphere of 3000 ppm NO and 3000 ppm CO in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1."
[3] "The reducibility of LaFeO3 was remarkably enhanced after incorporation of Pd into the lattice, resulting in a reduction peak at a temperature as low as 78 C."
[4] "The surface concentration of O 2 species in the presence of propene and oxygen was higher (compared with CO alone),thus resulting in a higher NO 3 density over the surface."
[5] "NO reduction was previously studied over the same catalysts but using propene as a reducing agent and in the presence of oxygen [13], suggesting that NO reduction proceeded involving NO 3 species over the surface."

1.Nanoscale LaFe1x(Cu, Pd)xO3 perovskites were successfully synthesized using reactive grinding, achieving specific surface areas over 30 m2/g post calcination at 500 C for 5 hours, with crystal domains measuring less than 20 nm. 

2.LaFeO3 catalytic performance notably improved by 20% Cu substitution, delivering 74% N2 yield and 72% CO conversion at 350 C under a 3000 ppm NO and 3000 ppm CO atmosphere in helium, with a space velocity of 50,000 h1.

3.Introduction of Pd into the lattice structure of LaFeO3 significantly enhances its reducibility, evidenced by a reduction peak at 78 C upon incorporation.

4.In the presence of propene and oxygen, the surface NO 3 density was found to be higher compared to CO alone, attributed to the higher concentration of O 2 species.

5.Previous studies on NO reduction over similar catalysts employed propene as a reducing agent alongside oxygen, indicating that NO reduction occurred via NO 3 species on the catalyst surface.

1.通过反应研磨成功制备了纳米级LaFe1x(Cu, Pd)xO3钙钛矿，即使在500°C下煅烧5小时后，也达到了超过30 m2/g的特定表面面积，晶体尺寸小于20 nm。

2.通过20%铜的替代，LaFeO3的催化性能显著提高，实现了350°C下3000 ppm NO和3000 ppm CO在氦气气氛下的74%氮气产率和72%一氧化碳转化率，空间速度为50,000 h1。

3.引入Pd到LaFeO3的晶格结构中显著增强了其可还原性，表现为在78°C时的还原峰。

4.在丙烯和氧气的存在下，表面NO 3密度比仅CO高，这是由于O 2物种浓度较高的结果。

5.之前的研究使用丙烯作为还原剂，并在氧气存在下对相同催化剂进行了NO减少研究，表明NO减少通过表面NO 3物种在催化剂上进行。
