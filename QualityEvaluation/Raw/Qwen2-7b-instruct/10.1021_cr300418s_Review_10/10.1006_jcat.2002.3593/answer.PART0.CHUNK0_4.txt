[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide."
[2] "At 823 K, the styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere)."
[3] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with carbon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "In order to elucidate the role of carbon dioxide in this reaction, characterization of the catalyst was carried out via methods such as temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, and UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies."
[5] "The styrene yield increased by air oxidation of the used catalyst after the reaction for 6h in carbon dioxide, although the activity could not completely return to its initial level."
[6] "On the other hand, the catalyst used under the argon atmosphere exhibited a lower activity after the oxidation of the catalyst."
[7] "The results of various characterization techniques, including UV visible, ESR, FT-IR, and CO2-TPR spectra clearly indicate that lattice oxygen of the magnesium vanadate abstracts the hydrogen from ethylbenzene, that water and styrene are produced, and, consequently, that the vanadium species is reduced."
[8] "However, it seems difficult to keep the vanadium species at the initial high oxidation state throughout the reaction,since the oxidation capability of carbon dioxide is weaker than that of oxygen."
[9] "Especially over a MgO support, the strong interaction between acidic vanadia and basic magnesia results in the formation of mixed oxides."
[10] "Considering that the promoting effect of carbon dioxide was observed on the V/MgO catalyst with a large surface area but not observed on bulk V2O5, the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide may occur only in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magnesium oxide."
