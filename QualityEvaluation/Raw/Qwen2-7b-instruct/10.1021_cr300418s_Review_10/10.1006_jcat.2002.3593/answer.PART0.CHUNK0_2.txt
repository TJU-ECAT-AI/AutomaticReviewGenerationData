[1] "In order to elucidate the role of carbon dioxide in this reaction, characterization of the catalyst was carried out via methods such as temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, and UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies."
[2] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with carbon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species, and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1)."
[5] "According to the results shown in Fig. 5, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the styrene yield decreased with an increase in the reaction period due to the coke deposition and increases in the lower-valency-state vanadium species."
[6] "For the high-vanadium-loading catalysts (V = 3.0 mmol/g of MgO), overlapping peaks at higher temperatures were detected."
[7] "On the higher loading case, in addition to this species, polymeric V5+ species with bridging VOV oxide ions forming MgV2O6 and Mg2V2O7 structures coexist (10, 22), resulting in a decrease in the styrene selectivity over a V(3.0)/MgO catalyst."

1. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was studied using various characterization techniques including temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, UV-visible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies.
2. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction.
3. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species was continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction.
4. In contrast, carbon dioxide could oxidize the reduced vanadium species in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, keeping the vanadium species in a higher oxidation state.
5. Over longer reaction periods in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the styrene yield decreased due to coke deposition and increases in the lower-valency-state vanadium species.
6. Higher-vanadium-loading catalysts showed overlapping peaks at higher temperatures during temperature-programmed reduction studies.
7. In the case of higher loading, polymeric V5+ species with bridging VOV oxide ions forming MgV2O6 and Mg2V2O7 structures coexisted, leading to a decrease in styrene selectivity over a V(3.0)/MgO catalyst.

1. 为了阐明二氧化碳在该反应中的作用，对催化剂进行了包括温度程序化还原、温度程序化与二氧化碳反应、紫外可见光谱、傅里叶变换红外光谱和粉末X射线衍射等方法的表征。
2. 二氧化碳作为氧化剂作用于钒物种，在脱氢反应过程中，表面的钒物种保持在高氧化状态。
3. 在氩气气氛下，脱氢反应期间，钒物种连续被还原。
4. 相反，在二氧化碳气氛中，二氧化碳可以氧化还原态的钒物种，并使钒物种保持在更高的氧化状态（方案1）。
5. 随着反应时间的增加，在二氧化碳气氛下，由于焦炭沉积和低价钒物种的增加，苯乙烯产率降低。
6. 较高的钒负载催化剂在温度程序化减少研究中显示出重叠的高温峰。
7. 对于较高的负载情况，形成了聚集体V5+物种与桥接的VOV氧化离子形成MgV2O6和Mg2V2O7结构，导致了MgO上的V(3.0)催化剂的苯乙烯选择性下降。
