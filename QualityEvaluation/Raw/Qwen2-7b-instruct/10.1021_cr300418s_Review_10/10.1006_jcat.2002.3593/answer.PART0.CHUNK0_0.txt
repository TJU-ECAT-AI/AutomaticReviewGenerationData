[1] "In our study, differences in the reduction temperature of the vanadium species with hydrogen were observed (Fig. 6). For the low-vanadium-loading catalyst (V = < 1.5 mmol/g of MgO), a single and low-temperature peak was observed, but for the high-vanadium-loading catalysts (V = 3.0 mmol/g of MgO), overlapping peaks at higher temperatures were detected."
[2] "The active sites differ according to the atmosphere. The active site in a carbon dioxide atmosphere would seem to be the redox site and that in an argon atmosphere a weak acid site of magnesium vanadate."

The behavior of the vanadium species in the reduction temperature with hydrogen varies depending on the vanadium loading level. For the low-vanadium-loading catalyst, a single and low-temperature peak is observed, while for the high-vanadium-loading catalysts, overlapping peaks at higher temperatures are detected. The active sites in the catalytic system also differ based on the atmosphere. In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the active site appears to be the redox site, whereas in an argon atmosphere, it is a weak acid site of magnesium vanadate.

在氢化还原温度中，不同钒负载水平下的行为有所不同。对于低钒负载催化剂，观察到单一且低温峰，而对于高钒负载催化剂，则检测到在较高温度下的重叠峰。催化体系中的活性位点也根据气氛的不同而有所差异。在二氧化碳气氛下，活性位点似乎为氧化还原位点，而在氩气氛下，它是镁钒酸盐的弱酸位点。
