[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide. The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[2] "In order to elucidate the role of car- bon dioxide in this reaction, characterization of the catalyst was carried out via methods such as temperature-programmed reduc- tion, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, and UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies."
[3] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[5] "The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation."
[6] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1), resulting in a high styrene yield compared to that in an argon atmosphere."
[7] "Considering that the promoting effect of carbon diox- ide was observed on the V/MgO catalyst with a large sur- face area but not observed on bulk V2O5, the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide may occur only in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magne- sium oxide."
[8] "According to the results shown in Fig. 5, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the styrene yield decreased with an in- crease in the reaction period due to the coke deposition and increases in the lower-valency-state vanadium species."

The study found that carbon dioxide significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalyst, increasing the styrene yield by 2.5 times compared to an argon atmosphere at 823 K. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant, keeping the vanadium species in a high oxidation state, which led to the high yield of styrene. This promotion occurred primarily on the surface of MgO, in mixed oxides containing V5+ species, likely in the form of V2O5 or Mg3V2O8. The continuous reduction of vanadium species in an argon atmosphere contrasted with the oxidation of reduced vanadium species by carbon dioxide in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, which kept the vanadium species in a higher oxidation state, thus enhancing the styrene yield. However, the effectiveness of carbon dioxide depended on the surface area of the catalyst, with larger surface areas showing a more pronounced promotion effect.

研究发现，二氧化碳显著提高了负载在镁氧化物上的钒氧化物催化剂上乙基苯的脱氢反应，与氩气氛相比，在823 K时将乙烯基产量提高了2.5倍。二氧化碳作为氧化剂的作用，使钒物种保持在高氧化状态，这导致了乙烯基产量的提高。这种促进作用主要发生在镁氧化物的表面，在混合氧化物中包含V5+物种，可能是V2O5或Mg3V2O8的形式。在氩气氛下，钒物种持续被还原，而二氧化碳气氛下的还原则氧化了还原的钒物种，使钒物种保持在更高的氧化状态，从而增强乙烯基产量。然而，二氧化碳的效果依赖于催化剂的表面积，较大表面积的催化剂显示出更明显的促进效果。
