[1] "In our study, differences in the reduction temperature of the vanadium species with hydrogen were observed (Fig. 6). For the low-vanadium-loading catalyst (V = < 1.5 mmol/g of MgO), a single and low-temperature peak was observed, but for the high-vanadium-loading catalysts (V = 3.0 mmol/g of MgO), overlapping peaks at higher temperatures were detected."
[2] "The active sites differ according to the atmosphere. The active site in a carbon dioxide atmosphere would seem to be the redox site and that in an argon atmosphere a weak acid site of magnesium vanadate."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The behavior of the vanadium species in the reduction temperature with hydrogen varies depending on the vanadium loading level. For the low-vanadium-loading catalyst, a single and low-temperature peak is observed, while for the high-vanadium-loading catalysts, overlapping peaks at higher temperatures are detected. The active sites in the catalytic system also differ based on the atmosphere. In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the active site appears to be the redox site, whereas in an argon atmosphere, it is a weak acid site of magnesium vanadate.

在氢化还原温度中，不同钒负载水平下的行为有所不同。对于低钒负载催化剂，观察到单一且低温峰，而对于高钒负载催化剂，则检测到在较高温度下的重叠峰。催化体系中的活性位点也根据气氛的不同而有所差异。在二氧化碳气氛下，活性位点似乎为氧化还原位点，而在氩气氛下，它是镁钒酸盐的弱酸位点。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems. The reduction temperature of the vanadium species with hydrogen varies depending on the vanadium loading level. A single, low-temperature peak is observed in the low-vanadium-loading catalyst, while higher loading cases show overlapping peaks at higher temperatures. This suggests the coexistence of different vanadium species, such as Mg3V2O8 and MgV2O6 or Mg2V2O7 structures, which affect the catalytic activity. The styrene yield does not increase above a loading level of 1.0 mmol/g of MgO in the presence of carbon dioxide because the isolated VO4 species does not increase beyond this level.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的协调存在挑战。不同钒负载水平的还原温度有所不同。低钒负载催化剂中观察到单个低温峰，而高负载情况则显示出更高温度的重叠峰。这表明存在不同的钒物种共存，如Mg3V2O8、MgV2O6或Mg2V2O7结构，这影响催化活性。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，当负载量超过1.0 mmol/g的MgO时，由于孤立的VO4物种没有超过这个负载量，所以辛烯产量不会增加。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide. The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[2] "In order to elucidate the role of car- bon dioxide in this reaction, characterization of the catalyst was carried out via methods such as temperature-programmed reduc- tion, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, and UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies."
[3] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[5] "The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation."
[6] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1), resulting in a high styrene yield compared to that in an argon atmosphere."
[7] "Considering that the promoting effect of carbon diox- ide was observed on the V/MgO catalyst with a large sur- face area but not observed on bulk V2O5, the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide may occur only in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magne- sium oxide."
[8] "According to the results shown in Fig. 5, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the styrene yield decreased with an in- crease in the reaction period due to the coke deposition and increases in the lower-valency-state vanadium species."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study found that carbon dioxide significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalyst, increasing the styrene yield by 2.5 times compared to an argon atmosphere at 823 K. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant, keeping the vanadium species in a high oxidation state, which led to the high yield of styrene. This promotion occurred primarily on the surface of MgO, in mixed oxides containing V5+ species, likely in the form of V2O5 or Mg3V2O8. The continuous reduction of vanadium species in an argon atmosphere contrasted with the oxidation of reduced vanadium species by carbon dioxide in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, which kept the vanadium species in a higher oxidation state, thus enhancing the styrene yield. However, the effectiveness of carbon dioxide depended on the surface area of the catalyst, with larger surface areas showing a more pronounced promotion effect.

研究发现，二氧化碳显著提高了负载在镁氧化物上的钒氧化物催化剂上乙基苯的脱氢反应，与氩气氛相比，在823 K时将乙烯基产量提高了2.5倍。二氧化碳作为氧化剂的作用，使钒物种保持在高氧化状态，这导致了乙烯基产量的提高。这种促进作用主要发生在镁氧化物的表面，在混合氧化物中包含V5+物种，可能是V2O5或Mg3V2O8的形式。在氩气氛下，钒物种持续被还原，而二氧化碳气氛下的还原则氧化了还原的钒物种，使钒物种保持在更高的氧化状态，从而增强乙烯基产量。然而，二氧化碳的效果依赖于催化剂的表面积，较大表面积的催化剂显示出更明显的促进效果。

[6] "On the other hand, the catalyst used under the argon atmosphere exhibited a lower activity after the oxidation of the catalyst."
[7] "The results of various characterization techniques, including UV visible, ESR, FT-IR, and CO2-TPR spectra clearly indicate that lattice oxygen of the magnesium vanadate abstracts the hydrogen from ethylbenzene, that water and styrene are produced, and, consequently, that the vanadium species is reduced."
[8] "However, it seems difficult to keep the vanadium species at the initial high oxidation state throughout the reaction,since the oxidation capability of carbon dioxide is weaker than that of oxygen."
[9] "Especially over a MgO support, the strong interaction between acidic vanadia and basic magnesia results in the formation of mixed oxides."
[10] "Considering that the promoting effect of carbon dioxide was observed on the V/MgO catalyst with a large surface area but not observed on bulk V2O5, the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide may occur only in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magnesium oxide."
