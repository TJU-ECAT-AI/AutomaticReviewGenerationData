[1] "In our study, differences in the reduction temperature of the vanadium species with hydrogen were observed (Fig. 6)."
[2] "For the low-vanadium-loading catalyst (V = < 1.5 mmol/g of MgO), a single and low-temperature peak was observed."
[3] "On the high-loading case, in addition to this species, polymeric V5+ species with bridging VOV oxide ions forming MgV2O6 and Mg2V2O7 structures coexist (10, 22)."
[4] "It is believed that the styrene yield did not increase above the loading level of 1.0 mmol/g of MgO since the isolated VO4 species did not increase above this loading level in the presence of carbon dioxide."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems. The reduction temperature of the vanadium species with hydrogen varies depending on the vanadium loading level. A single, low-temperature peak is observed in the low-vanadium-loading catalyst, while higher loading cases show overlapping peaks at higher temperatures. This suggests the coexistence of different vanadium species, such as Mg3V2O8 and MgV2O6 or Mg2V2O7 structures, which affect the catalytic activity. The styrene yield does not increase above a loading level of 1.0 mmol/g of MgO in the presence of carbon dioxide because the isolated VO4 species does not increase beyond this level.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的协调存在挑战。不同钒负载水平的还原温度有所不同。低钒负载催化剂中观察到单个低温峰，而高负载情况则显示出更高温度的重叠峰。这表明存在不同的钒物种共存，如Mg3V2O8、MgV2O6或Mg2V2O7结构，这影响催化活性。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，当负载量超过1.0 mmol/g的MgO时，由于孤立的VO4物种没有超过这个负载量，所以辛烯产量不会增加。
