Density functional theory was employed to investigate whether doping oxides enhances their performance as oxidation catalysts. Specifically, the effect of adding gold (Au) to titanium dioxide (TiO2) was scrutinized using carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation as a benchmark test. It was discovered that doping with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, thereby making the system more effective at oxidation. These findings suggest that exploring doped oxides as potential oxidation catalysts could prove beneficial. The proposed mechanism for the oxidation process involves the weakening of the oxygen-oxide bond by the dopant and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and adsorbed molecules at the vacancy site. Despite potential inaccuracies in the nature of Kohn-Sham states, the adsorbate binding energies were accurately described by density functional theory.

我们使用密度泛函理论来研究掺杂氧化物是否能使其成为更好的氧化催化剂。具体地，我们详细研究了用Au掺杂TiO2，并将CO氧化作为系统氧化能力测试的方法。发现掺杂Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni显著减弱了表面氧与氧化物之间的键，从而使得系统在氧化方面更有效。这些发现表明，探索掺杂氧化物作为潜在氧化催化剂是有意义的。提出的氧化机制涉及掺杂物削弱氧-氧化物键以及氧空位和吸附在氧空位处的分子的反应性。尽管Kohn-Sham状态的性质可能存在问题，但密度泛函理论准确描述了吸附剂结合能。
