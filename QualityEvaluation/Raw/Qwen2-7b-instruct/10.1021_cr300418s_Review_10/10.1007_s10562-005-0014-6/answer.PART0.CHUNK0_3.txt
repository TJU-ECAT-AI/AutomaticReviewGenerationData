[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[4] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

Answer: Doping oxides with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide material, enhancing their ability to act as oxidation catalysts. This mechanism involves the weakening of the oxygen-oxide bond facilitated by the dopant, increasing the reactivity of oxygen vacancies and adsorbed molecules. The density functional theory calculations suggest that exploring doped oxides as potential oxidation catalysts could be beneficial.

1. 添加金属如Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni到氧化物中显著减弱了表面氧与氧化物材料之间的键，提高了它们作为氧化催化剂的能力。
2. 这种机制涉及通过掺杂剂削弱氧-氧化物键，增加氧空位的活性以及吸附在氧空位位置的分子的活性。
3. 密度泛函理论计算表明，探索掺杂氧化物作为潜在氧化催化剂可能是有益的。
