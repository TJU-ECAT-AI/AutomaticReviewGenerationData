[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "Doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."

The document discusses how doping oxides, specifically with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni, can significantly weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide material. This weakening makes the doped oxides better oxidation catalysts, as evidenced by the density functional theory calculations. The authors suggest that exploring doped oxides as oxidation catalysts is worthwhile. However, they also caution about the accuracy of certain density functional theory methods, particularly in describing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides accurately.

该文档讨论了如何通过向氧化物中掺入Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属，可以显著减弱表面氧与氧化物材料之间的键合。这种削弱使掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化催化剂。密度泛函理论计算证明了这一点。作者建议探索掺杂氧化物作为氧化催化剂是值得的。然而，他们也警告说，在描述过渡金属和稀土氧化物的电子结构时，某些密度泛函理论方法的准确性存在疑问。
