[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[4] "First, they contain less metal than catalysts consisting of supported metal clusters; when expensive metals are used, this is a considerable advantage."
[5] "Second, in some cases, the catalyst resists sintering better than the supported metallic par- ticles."
[6] "Finally, a catalytic center consisting of one ion is likely to be more sensitive to its environment than a metal cluster containing thousands of atoms; it is therefore more likely that its activity can be tuned by changing M and N."
[7] "We conclude with a note of caution regarding the accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemis- try."

The study demonstrates that doping oxides with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly enhances their performance as oxidation catalysts. This is due to the weakening of the surface oxygen bond in titania or ceria, leading to increased reactivity. Doped oxides offer advantages over traditional metal clusters, including reduced metal content, improved resistance to sintering, and greater environmental sensitivity, enabling tunable activity. However, the authors caution about potential inaccuracies in density functional theory (DFT) calculations when dealing with transition metal and rare-earth oxides.

研究显示，通过向氧化物中添加金属（如Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni），可以显著提高它们作为氧化催化剂的性能。这是由于表面氧键在二氧化钛或氧化铈中的减弱，导致活性增加。掺杂氧化物在某些方面优于传统的金属簇，包括减少金属含量、增强抗烧结能力以及更高的环境敏感性，从而实现可调的活性。然而，作者警告说，在处理过渡金属和稀有地球氧化物时，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算可能存在的准确性问题。
