NiO is a non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies which induce the formation of p+ holes, in the form of O ions, to maintain charge neutrality conditions. These oxygen species are electrophilic in nature and mostly responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 on the pure NiO sample. When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed. In the case of NiLiO, the dopants valence is lower than Ni, and the substitution process results in an extra negative charge,which induces the formation of O species to maintain neutrality conditions. This is in accordance with the O2-TPD measurements which showed an increase in the amount of desorbed oxygen, the TPIE experiments that demonstrated the exchange of a large amount of oxygen at low temperatures in Li/NiO and the decreased selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction, due to the highly oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species. In the case of doping with a higher valence element, the extra positive charge induced by the substituting process reduces the surface defects and consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species,thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the formation of solid solutions, the modification of the NiO lattice, and the regulation of the non-stoichiometric oxygen content. This, in turn, impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity towards ethylene. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complex interplay between the physical and chemical properties of the dopants and the catalytic system. Theoretical models often oversimplify the real-world complexities, failing to capture the nuanced effects of the dopant valence on the catalytic behavior. Experimental data, on the other hand, may not always align perfectly with theoretical expectations due to variations in synthesis conditions, reaction environments, and the inherent limitations of measurement techniques. Thus, there is a continuous effort to bridge the gap between theory and practice, refining models to better predict and explain the behavior of NiO-based catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

尼铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们稳定的形态和氧化状态，影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，在乙烯氧化脱氢反应中的作用。这主要通过影响固溶体的形成、NiO晶格的修改以及非化学计量氧含量的调节来实现。这些变化进而影响催化活性和向乙烯的选择性转化。理论与实验观察之间难以调和的挑战来自于掺杂剂价态对催化行为的复杂影响。理论模型往往过于简化现实世界的情况，未能完全捕捉到掺杂剂价态对催化行为的影响。而实验数据可能并不总是与理论预期完全一致，由于合成条件的差异、反应环境的变化以及测量技术的局限性，实验结果可能无法完全符合理论预测。因此，不断努力在理论与实践之间建立联系，改进模型以更好地预测和解释基于镍氧化物的催化剂在乙烯氧化脱氢过程中的行为。
