[1] "The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."
[3] "Not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species is affected by the presence of the different dopants, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species."
[4] "An important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."
[5] "Based on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced activity in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by modifying the lattice structure and electronic properties of NiO. This substitution process leads to the formation of solid solutions, altering the non-stoichiometry and oxygen content of the NiO lattice. The valence of the dopant plays a critical role in this process, with lower valence dopants increasing the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence dopants act as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration and the electrophilic oxygen radicals. This results in changes to the physicochemical properties and catalytic behavior of the NiMeO mixed oxides. The introduction of dopants can tune the catalytic properties of NiO for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, enabling control over the selectivity to ethylene production. By adjusting the valence of the dopant, the catalytic activity can be optimized for selective ethane conversion.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，在乙烯氧化脱氢反应中。这种替代过程通过修改镍氧化物的晶格结构和电子性质来影响镍氧化物。这种替代过程导致固体溶液的形成，改变了镍氧化物晶格中的非化学计量氧含量。掺杂剂的价态在这一过程中起着关键作用，低价态掺杂剂增加了镍氧化物中的非化学计量氧，而高价态掺杂剂则充当电子供体，减少了正p+空穴浓度和镍氧化物接受者的亲电氧基团。这导致镍MeO混合氧化物的物理化学性质和催化行为的变化。掺杂剂的引入可以调整镍氧化物的催化性能以用于乙烯氧化脱氢，允许控制乙烷生成乙烯的选择性。通过调整掺杂剂的价态，催化活性可以优化为选择性乙烷转换。
