[1] "The introduction of other than Nb metals also significantly modifies the reduction profiles, as shown in Fig 4. While Nb was found to ease the reduction of NiONi bonds, shifting the reduction temperature at lower values, all other metals seem to inhibit the reduction process compared to pure NiO."
[2] "The amount of oxygen desorption, expressed in mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1."
[3] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."
[4] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

1. The introduction of various metals other than niobium (Nb) significantly alters the reduction profiles of the catalysts. For example, niobium facilitates the reduction of NiONi bonds, lowering the reduction temperature. Other metals, however, hinder the reduction process compared to pure nickel oxide (NiO).

2. The amount of desorbed oxygen, measured in milligrams per gram of catalyst, is documented in Table 1.

3. The presence of dopants in the nickel oxide (NiO) structure impacts both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species. 

4. There is a clear inverse relationship between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen in the catalyst and its ability to selectively convert ethane into ethylene, with this relationship becoming stronger as the valence of the dopant metal increases.

5. A direct link has been established between the rate of 16O exchange in the temperature-programmed isotope oxygen exchange (TPIE) experiments and the rate of ethane consumption in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity tests, demonstrating that the observed oxygen species indeed participate actively in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism.

1. 除了铌以外的其他金属引入显著改变了催化剂的还原轮廓。例如，铌能够简化NiONi键的还原，降低还原温度。相比之下，其他金属会抑制还原过程，与纯镍氧化物（NiO）相比。

2. 表1中记录了脱附氧的量，以每克催化剂的毫克为单位。

3. 在镍氧化物（NiO）结构中添加掺杂剂会改变交换氧物种的数量和流动性。

4. 非化学计量氧在催化剂中的含量与其选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明确的反比关系，随着掺杂物金属电荷数的增加，这种关系变得更加强烈。

5. 在温度程序化同位素氧交换（TPIE）实验中16O交换的速率与氧化脱氢（ODH）活性测试中乙烷消耗的速率之间建立了直接联系，证明了检测到的氧物种确实积极参与了乙烷激活和转化机制。
