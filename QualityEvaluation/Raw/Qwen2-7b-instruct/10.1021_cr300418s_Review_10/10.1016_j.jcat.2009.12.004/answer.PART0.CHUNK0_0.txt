[1] "In all mixed oxides, with the exception of Ta, the dopants modify the NiO lattice, which contracts or expands depending on the radius of the cation, indication for the formation of solid solutions."
[2] "The introduction of Nb causes the appearance of a high temperature shoulder and broadens the reduction profile,while shifting the reduction temperature of the main peak to 360 C."
[3] "It is interesting to comment on the ratio of hydrogen consumption versus the stoichiometrically required hydrogen to completely reduce the nickel species present in the NiMeO mixed oxides."
[4] "Indeed, the oxy- gen desorption profiles change dramatically in the mixed oxides compared to pure NiO."
[5] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."
[6] "Not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species changes in the presence of the different dopants."
[7] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
[8] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
[9] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectiv- ity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selec- tivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by altering the lattice structure and reducing the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen. These modifications affect the reduction characteristics, oxygen desorption properties, and the exchange of oxygen species, leading to changes in the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include understanding the precise role of niobium dopants in modifying the electronic properties of NiO, the formation of solid solutions, and the impact on the overall catalytic performance.

Answer: Niobium oxides' properties, such as their stable forms and oxidation states, influence their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the lattice structure, reducing non-stoichiometric oxygen, and modifying reduction characteristics, oxygen desorption properties, and oxygen species exchange. Challenges in aligning theoretical predictions with experimental outcomes involve elucidating the precise impact of niobium dopants on NiO's electronic properties, solid solution formation, and overall catalytic performance.
