[1] "In all mixed oxides, with the exception of Ta, the dopants modify the NiO lattice, which contracts or expands depending on the radius of the cation, indication for the formation of solid solutions."
[2] "Increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."
[3] "These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
[4] "NiNbO exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while NiLiO demonstrated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%."
[5] "The catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

1. The dopants affect the NiO lattice by contracting or expanding it based on the cation radius, suggesting the creation of solid solutions.
2. Increasing the valence of the dopant reduces non-stoichiometric oxygen in the host oxide, aligning with the principle of controlled valence.
3. Electrophilic oxygen species catalyze ethane to COx reactions, favoring ethylene production when these species are reduced or eliminated.
4. NiNbO showed the highest catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400°C, compared to NiLiO's lowest yield of 8.42%.
5. The properties of NiO in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation can be adjusted through doping, depending on the dopant's nature in Me-promoted NiO catalysts.

1. 添加剂影响NiO晶格，根据阳离子半径，导致收缩或膨胀，表明形成固溶体。
2. 增加添加剂的电荷数降低宿氧化物中的非化学计量氧，与控制电荷原则一致。
3. 亲电氧物种催化乙烷到COx反应，促进乙烷选择性氧化为乙烯，当这些物种被减少或消除时。
4. NiNbO显示了最高的催化性能，在400°C下获得了46%的乙烯产率，而NiLiO的产率最低仅为8.42%。
5. NiO在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性质可以通过掺杂调整，取决于掺杂剂的性质在Me掺杂NiO催化剂中。
