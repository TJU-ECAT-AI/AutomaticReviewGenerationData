[1] "The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."
[3] "Not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species is affected by the presence of the different dopants, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species."
[4] "An important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."
[5] "Based on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced activity in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by modifying the lattice structure and electronic properties of NiO. This substitution process leads to the formation of solid solutions, altering the non-stoichiometry and oxygen content of the NiO lattice. The valence of the dopant plays a critical role in this process, with lower valence dopants increasing the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence dopants act as electron donors, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration and the electrophilic oxygen radicals. This results in changes to the physicochemical properties and catalytic behavior of the NiMeO mixed oxides. The introduction of dopants can tune the catalytic properties of NiO for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, enabling control over the selectivity to ethylene production. By adjusting the valence of the dopant, the catalytic activity can be optimized for selective ethane conversion.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化状态，影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，在乙烯氧化脱氢反应中。这种替代过程通过修改镍氧化物的晶格结构和电子性质来影响镍氧化物。这种替代过程导致固体溶液的形成，改变了镍氧化物晶格中的非化学计量氧含量。掺杂剂的价态在这一过程中起着关键作用，低价态掺杂剂增加了镍氧化物中的非化学计量氧，而高价态掺杂剂则充当电子供体，减少了正p+空穴浓度和镍氧化物接受者的亲电氧基团。这导致镍MeO混合氧化物的物理化学性质和催化行为的变化。掺杂剂的引入可以调整镍氧化物的催化性能以用于乙烯氧化脱氢，允许控制乙烷生成乙烯的选择性。通过调整掺杂剂的价态，催化活性可以优化为选择性乙烷转换。

NiO is a non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies which induce the formation of p+ holes, in the form of O ions, to maintain charge neutrality conditions. These oxygen species are electrophilic in nature and mostly responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 on the pure NiO sample. When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed. In the case of NiLiO, the dopants valence is lower than Ni, and the substitution process results in an extra negative charge,which induces the formation of O species to maintain neutrality conditions. This is in accordance with the O2-TPD measurements which showed an increase in the amount of desorbed oxygen, the TPIE experiments that demonstrated the exchange of a large amount of oxygen at low temperatures in Li/NiO and the decreased selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction, due to the highly oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species. In the case of doping with a higher valence element, the extra positive charge induced by the substituting process reduces the surface defects and consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species,thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the formation of solid solutions, the modification of the NiO lattice, and the regulation of the non-stoichiometric oxygen content. This, in turn, impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity towards ethylene. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complex interplay between the physical and chemical properties of the dopants and the catalytic system. Theoretical models often oversimplify the real-world complexities, failing to capture the nuanced effects of the dopant valence on the catalytic behavior. Experimental data, on the other hand, may not always align perfectly with theoretical expectations due to variations in synthesis conditions, reaction environments, and the inherent limitations of measurement techniques. Thus, there is a continuous effort to bridge the gap between theory and practice, refining models to better predict and explain the behavior of NiO-based catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

尼铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们稳定的形态和氧化状态，影响它们作为镍氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，在乙烯氧化脱氢反应中的作用。这主要通过影响固溶体的形成、NiO晶格的修改以及非化学计量氧含量的调节来实现。这些变化进而影响催化活性和向乙烯的选择性转化。理论与实验观察之间难以调和的挑战来自于掺杂剂价态对催化行为的复杂影响。理论模型往往过于简化现实世界的情况，未能完全捕捉到掺杂剂价态对催化行为的影响。而实验数据可能并不总是与理论预期完全一致，由于合成条件的差异、反应环境的变化以及测量技术的局限性，实验结果可能无法完全符合理论预测。因此，不断努力在理论与实践之间建立联系，改进模型以更好地预测和解释基于镍氧化物的催化剂在乙烯氧化脱氢过程中的行为。

[1] "The introduction of other than Nb metals also significantly modifies the reduction profiles, as shown in Fig 4. While Nb was found to ease the reduction of NiONi bonds, shifting the reduction temperature at lower values, all other metals seem to inhibit the reduction process compared to pure NiO."
[2] "The amount of oxygen desorption, expressed in mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1."

1. The introduction of various metals other than niobium (Nb) significantly alters the reduction profiles of the catalysts. For example, niobium facilitates the reduction of NiONi bonds, lowering the reduction temperature. Other metals, however, hinder the reduction process compared to pure nickel oxide (NiO).

2. The amount of desorbed oxygen, measured in milligrams per gram of catalyst, is documented in Table 1.

3. The presence of dopants in the nickel oxide (NiO) structure impacts both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species. 

4. There is a clear inverse relationship between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen in the catalyst and its ability to selectively convert ethane into ethylene, with this relationship becoming stronger as the valence of the dopant metal increases.

5. A direct link has been established between the rate of 16O exchange in the temperature-programmed isotope oxygen exchange (TPIE) experiments and the rate of ethane consumption in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity tests, demonstrating that the observed oxygen species indeed participate actively in the ethane activation and conversion mechanism.
