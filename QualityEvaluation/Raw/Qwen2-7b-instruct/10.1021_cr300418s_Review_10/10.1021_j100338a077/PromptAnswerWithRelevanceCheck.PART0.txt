"Based upon the similarity in ESR spectral properties, the observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical."
"No indication of another radical species was found in the ESR spectra."
"Two very distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the R(bpy),+ radical, either of which should have been easily recognized in the samples in the present study."
"The trends shown for the radical yields observed in the different samples indicate variability in the average separation distance between ruthenium and viologen molecules."
"First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+, suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore."
"Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+. One expects these complexes to be embedded deeper into the micelle, and optimum proximity to the alkylmethylviologens apparently occurs for hexyl to octyl."
"In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles, the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains."

However, for R u M C   + / C  V  + and R u M C   + / C   V  + the breakup of the self-association of C,V2+ by the SDS micelles dominates, and the radical yields decrease in the presence of SDS micelles.
The results in Figure 1 indicate a net electron transfer between photoexcited tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen when bound to SDS micelles at 77 K.

The document discusses the electron transfer between a ruthenium complex and methylviologen when they are bound to SDS micelles. The presence of SDS micelles affects the radical yields differently for various complexes, depending on the alkyl chain length of the viologen moiety. The optimal radical yield is observed for alkylruthenium complexes with specific alkylmethylviologens, indicating an intimate interaction between the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule. Without SDS micelles, the differences in yields are explained by the self-association of alkylmethylviologens forming aggregates, with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains.

文献讨论了当钌配合物和甲基维奥洛辛被吸附在SDS微球上时，它们之间的电子转移。SDS微球的存在以不同的方式影响了不同复合物的自由基产率，这取决于维奥洛辛分子的烷基链长度。对于特定的烷基甲基维奥洛辛，观察到了最佳的自由基产率，这表明钌配合物和维奥洛辛分子之间存在紧密的相互作用。没有SDS微球时，差异在图5中显示，可以解释为烷基甲基维奥洛辛自聚形成冻溶剂溶液中的聚合物，较长烷基链的聚合物较大。

结果表明，在77 K下，光激发三(bipyridine)钌与甲基维洛根结合时，存在净电子转移。观察到的信号归因于维洛根单阳离子自由基。没有稳定其他自由基物种存在于样品中。趋势显示了钌和维洛根分子之间平均分离距离的变化。解释指出，钌复合物和维洛根分子根据其烷基链长度在SDS微球界面内嵌入的程度不同。Ru(bpy)，2+样品中的自由基产量从MV2+下降到CzoV2+，这表明随着烷基链长度增加，维洛根部分逐渐更深地插入微球界面，并因此远离钌络合物。对于c6v2+和c8v2+的烷基钌复合物，存在最优产量，这些复合物更深入地嵌入微球，而六到八烷基的烷基甲基维洛根似乎具有最佳接近性。在没有SDS微球的水中溶液中，差异的产量与更长烷基链形成聚合物一致，这些聚合物具有更大的倾向与RuMCS2+相结合。对于Ru(bpy)?+，较大的聚合体与较大的聚合体的结合受到电荷效应的影响。在SDS微球的存在下，C,V2+聚合体被分解，影响了自由基产量。

The interaction between RuMCS2+ and C,V2+ is not suggested to be intimate enough to allow rapid back-electron-transfer, since significant radical yields are observed.
Two very distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the R(bpy),+ radical, either of which should have been easily recognized in the samples in the present study.
First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+,. suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore.

The results indicate that when tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen are bound to SDS micelles at 77 K, there is a net electron transfer between the photoexcited ruthenium complex and the methylviologen. The observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical. The presence of SDS micelles affects the radical yields, especially when considering the self-association of the viologen moiety. The interaction between the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule influences the separation distance and the efficiency of electron transfer. The trends in radical yields suggest that the alkyl chains on the electron donor and acceptor molecules cause subtle ultrastructural changes, potentially allowing control of the photoinduced electron transfer. The presence of SDS micelles disrupts the self-association of the viologen, affecting the radical yields. In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles, the differences in yields are explained by the formation of aggregates with larger sizes for longer alkyl chains, which tend to associate with the ruthenium complex differently based on their charge effects.

结果表明，当三（二吡啶基）钌和甲基维奥洛根在77 K时结合到SDS微乳液上时，会发生净电子转移。观察到的信号归因于维奥洛根单阳离子自由基。SDS微乳液的存在影响了自由基产率，尤其是在考虑维奥洛根的自聚合作用时。钌复合物与维奥洛根分子之间的相互作用影响了它们之间的分离距离和电子转移效率。在不同样品中观察到的自由基产率趋势表明，电子供体和受体分子上的烷基链会引起微妙的超结构变化，可能允许控制光诱导的电子转移。SDS微乳液破坏了维奥洛根的自聚合作用，从而影响了自由基产率。在没有SDS微乳液的水中，不同产率的变化可以解释为形成更大的聚合物，其大小随着烷基链长度的增长而增加，并且这些聚合物与钌复合物的关联受到电荷效应的影响。
