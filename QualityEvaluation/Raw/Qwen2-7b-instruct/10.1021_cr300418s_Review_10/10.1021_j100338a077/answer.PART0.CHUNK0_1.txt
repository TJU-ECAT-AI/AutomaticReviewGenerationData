"Based upon the similarity in ESR spectral properties, the observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical."
"No indication of another radical species was found in the ESR spectra."
"Two very distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the R(bpy),+ radical, either of which should have been easily recognized in the samples in the present study."
"The trends shown for the radical yields observed in the different samples indicate variability in the average separation distance between ruthenium and viologen molecules."
"First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+, suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore."
"Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+. One expects these complexes to be embedded deeper into the micelle, and optimum proximity to the alkylmethylviologens apparently occurs for hexyl to octyl."
"In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles, the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains."
