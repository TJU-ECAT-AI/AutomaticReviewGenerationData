[1] "The results in Figure 1 indicate a net electron transfer between photoexcited tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen when bound to SDS micelles at 77 K."
[2] "Based upon the similarity in ESR spectral properties, the observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical."
[3] "Presumably, this other radical species is not stable in frozen micellar or frozen aqueous solutions."
[4] "The trends shown for the radical yields observed in the different samples indicate variability in the average separation distance between ruthenium and viologen molecules."
[5] "One explanation of these trends is that both the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule become embedded in the SDS micellar interface to varying degrees, depending on their alkyl chain length."
[6] "First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+ suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore."
[7] "Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+. One expects these complexes to be embedded deeper into the micelle, and optimum proximity to the alkylmethylviologens apparently occurs for hexyl to octyl."
[8] "In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains."
[9] "The larger aggregates have a greater tendency to associate with RuMCS2+, but with Ru(bpy)?+, association of the larger aggregates is modified by charge effects."
[10] "In the presence of SDS micelles the C,V2+ aggregates are broken up and the radical yields are affected accordingly."

结果表明，在77 K下，光激发三(bipyridine)钌与甲基维洛根结合时，存在净电子转移。观察到的信号归因于维洛根单阳离子自由基。没有稳定其他自由基物种存在于样品中。趋势显示了钌和维洛根分子之间平均分离距离的变化。解释指出，钌复合物和维洛根分子根据其烷基链长度在SDS微球界面内嵌入的程度不同。Ru(bpy)，2+样品中的自由基产量从MV2+下降到CzoV2+，这表明随着烷基链长度增加，维洛根部分逐渐更深地插入微球界面，并因此远离钌络合物。对于c6v2+和c8v2+的烷基钌复合物，存在最优产量，这些复合物更深入地嵌入微球，而六到八烷基的烷基甲基维洛根似乎具有最佳接近性。在没有SDS微球的水中溶液中，差异的产量与更长烷基链形成聚合物一致，这些聚合物具有更大的倾向与RuMCS2+相结合。对于Ru(bpy)?+，较大的聚合体与较大的聚合体的结合受到电荷效应的影响。在SDS微球的存在下，C,V2+聚合体被分解，影响了自由基产量。
