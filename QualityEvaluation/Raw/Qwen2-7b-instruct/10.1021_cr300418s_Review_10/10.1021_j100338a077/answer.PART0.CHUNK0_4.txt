However, for R u M C   + / C  V  + and R u M C   + / C   V  + the breakup of the self-association of C,V2+ by the SDS micelles dominates, and the radical yields decrease in the presence of SDS micelles.
The interaction between RuMCS2+ and C,V2+ is not suggested to be intimate enough to allow rapid back-electron-transfer, since significant radical yields are observed.
Two very distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the R(bpy),+ radical, either of which should have been easily recognized in the samples in the present study.
First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+,. suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore.
Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+.
In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains.
The larger aggregates have a greater tendency to associate with RuMCS2+,but with Ru(bpy)?+, association of the larger aggregates is modified by charge effects.

The results indicate that when tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen are bound to SDS micelles at 77 K, there is a net electron transfer between the photoexcited ruthenium complex and the methylviologen. The observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical. The presence of SDS micelles affects the radical yields, especially when considering the self-association of the viologen moiety. The interaction between the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule influences the separation distance and the efficiency of electron transfer. The trends in radical yields suggest that the alkyl chains on the electron donor and acceptor molecules cause subtle ultrastructural changes, potentially allowing control of the photoinduced electron transfer. The presence of SDS micelles disrupts the self-association of the viologen, affecting the radical yields. In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles, the differences in yields are explained by the formation of aggregates with larger sizes for longer alkyl chains, which tend to associate with the ruthenium complex differently based on their charge effects.

结果表明，当三（二吡啶基）钌和甲基维奥洛根在77 K时结合到SDS微乳液上时，会发生净电子转移。观察到的信号归因于维奥洛根单阳离子自由基。SDS微乳液的存在影响了自由基产率，尤其是在考虑维奥洛根的自聚合作用时。钌复合物与维奥洛根分子之间的相互作用影响了它们之间的分离距离和电子转移效率。在不同样品中观察到的自由基产率趋势表明，电子供体和受体分子上的烷基链会引起微妙的超结构变化，可能允许控制光诱导的电子转移。SDS微乳液破坏了维奥洛根的自聚合作用，从而影响了自由基产率。在没有SDS微乳液的水中，不同产率的变化可以解释为形成更大的聚合物，其大小随着烷基链长度的增长而增加，并且这些聚合物与钌复合物的关联受到电荷效应的影响。
