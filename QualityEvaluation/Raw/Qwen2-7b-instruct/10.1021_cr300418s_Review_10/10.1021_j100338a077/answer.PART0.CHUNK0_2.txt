However, for R u M C   + / C  V  + and R u M C   + / C   V  + the breakup of the self-association of C,V2+ by the SDS micelles dominates, and the radical yields decrease in the presence of SDS micelles.
The results in Figure 1 indicate a net electron transfer between photoexcited tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen when bound to SDS micelles at 77 K.
One explanation of these trends is that both the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule become embedded in the SDS micellar interface to varying degrees, depending on their alkyl chain length.
First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+, suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore.
Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+.
In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains.

The document discusses the electron transfer between a ruthenium complex and methylviologen when they are bound to SDS micelles. The presence of SDS micelles affects the radical yields differently for various complexes, depending on the alkyl chain length of the viologen moiety. The optimal radical yield is observed for alkylruthenium complexes with specific alkylmethylviologens, indicating an intimate interaction between the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule. Without SDS micelles, the differences in yields are explained by the self-association of alkylmethylviologens forming aggregates, with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains.

文献讨论了当钌配合物和甲基维奥洛辛被吸附在SDS微球上时，它们之间的电子转移。SDS微球的存在以不同的方式影响了不同复合物的自由基产率，这取决于维奥洛辛分子的烷基链长度。对于特定的烷基甲基维奥洛辛，观察到了最佳的自由基产率，这表明钌配合物和维奥洛辛分子之间存在紧密的相互作用。没有SDS微球时，差异在图5中显示，可以解释为烷基甲基维奥洛辛自聚形成冻溶剂溶液中的聚合物，较长烷基链的聚合物较大。
