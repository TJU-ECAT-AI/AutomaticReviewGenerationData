2. Experimental
A solution of metal ethoxyethylates [M3+(OC2H4OC2H5)3] of La, Fe and palladium acetylacetone [Pd2+(CH3COCHCOCH3)2] in toluene was hydrolyzed with deionized water to give a Pd-containing precipitate. This precursor was dried and then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in air to give a perovskite powder catalyst containing homogeneously distributed Pd.

In the experimental section, the preparation of the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst involves dissolving metal ethoxyethylates of lanthanum, iron, and palladium acetylacetone in toluene. This solution is then hydrolyzed with deionized water to form a precipitate containing palladium. The precipitate is dried and subsequently calcined at 800°C for 2 hours in air to produce a perovskite powder catalyst with evenly distributed palladium.

3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the radial distribution function around Pd, which was obtained by Fourier transform of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, typically in the range of k values from 3.0 A 1 to 8.0 A 1. There are two peaks in each samples corresponding to the PdO bond and the PdPd bond, respectively. The PdO bond of LaFePdO3 originates from the B-site of the perovskite structure [1,7], whereas the PdO bond of Pd/Al2O3 originates from PdO [1,7]. The PdPd bond originates from metallic Pd for both catalysts.

Figure 2 illustrates the time evolution of the radial distribution function around palladium, which was derived from the Fourier transform of k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations within the k range of 3.0 Å−1 to 8.0 Å−1. Each sample exhibits two peaks representing the PdO bond and the PdPd bond, respectively. The PdO bond in LaFePdO3 originates from the B-site of the perovskite structure [1,7], while the PdO bond in Pd/Al2O3 originates from PdO [1,7]. Both catalysts exhibit a PdPd bond originating from metallic palladium.

图2展示了围绕钯的时间演化径向分布函数，该函数通过傅立叶变换从k值范围为3.0 Å−1到8.0 Å−1的k3加权EXAFS振荡获得。每个样品均表现出两个峰值，分别对应PdO键和PdPd键。LaFePdO3中的PdO键源自过氧化物结构的B位点[1,7]，而Pd/Al2O3中的PdO键源自PdO[1,7]。两种催化剂均具有源自金属钯的PdPd键。

Fig. 3 shows the time dependence of the coordination number (CN) of the PdO bonds and PdPd bond. The theoretical CN of the PdO bond for the perovskite crystal is 6 and that for PdO is 4. In the analysis of the spectra, the Debye-Waller factors were fixed at those values extracted from reference materials (Pd and PdO powder) measured at the same temperature.

As shown in Fig. 3a for the reduction process, the CN of the PdO bond decreased from 5.6 to 1.1. The decreasing of the CN of the PdO bond meant that about 20% of the Pd remained dissolved in the perovskite crystal and about 80% of the Pd was reduced at 400 C.

As illustrated in Figure 3a during the reduction process, the CN of the PdO bond decreased from 5.6 to 1.1. This decrease in CN of the PdO bond indicates that approximately 20% of the Pd remained dissolved in the perovskite crystal, while about 80% of the Pd was reduced at 400°C.
