[1] "In the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst, redox fluctuations of the exhaust gas suppress the growth of particles of precious metal by caus- ing Pd to move in and out of the perovskite crystal."
[2] "We proved that the change in structure of Pd is sufficiently fast to respond to the control frequency (14 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine and that the Pd particles that segregate out are extremely fine."
[3] "It was proved that these Pd movements could respond to the high-speed fluctuations of automotive exhaust. It was also clearly shown that the Pd metal particles segregated from the perovskite crystal are extremely fine, and the Pd particle size is only 0.8 nm."

1. The redox fluctuations of the exhaust gas in the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst cause the precious metal particles to grow by enabling Pd to move in and out of the perovskite crystal structure. 
2. The movement of Pd in and out of the perovskite crystal structure is fast enough to respond to the high-speed fluctuations of automotive exhaust, with Pd particles that segregate being very fine, approximately 0.8 nm in size.

1. 废气中的氧化还原波动在LaFePdO3钙钛矿催化剂中通过使Pd在钙钛矿晶格内和外移动来抑制贵金属颗粒的生长，从而促进其增长。
2. Pd在钙钛矿晶格中的移动速度足够快以响应汽车排气的高速波动。从钙钛矿晶体中分离出的Pd金属颗粒非常细小，大小约为0.8纳米。
