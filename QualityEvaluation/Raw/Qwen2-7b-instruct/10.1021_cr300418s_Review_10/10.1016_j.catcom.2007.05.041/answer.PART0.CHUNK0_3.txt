[1] "The time evolution of local structure around Pd by redox fluctuations was investigated by in situ energy-dispersive X-ray absorption fine-structure (DXAFS) analysis with a 10 ms resolution."
[2] "We proved that the change in structure of Pd is sufficiently fast to respond to the control frequency (14 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine and that the Pd particles that segregate out are extremely fine."
[3] "The dynamical changes in the Pd structure, which corresponds to the movement of the Pd atom in and out of the perovskite crystal, were measured by in situ DXAFS. Pd movements between segregation and solidsolution with the perovskite crystal take only about 1 s at 400 C."

The study demonstrates that the local structure of palladium (Pd) within a LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst changes rapidly in response to redox fluctuations, with movements occurring within approximately 1 second at 400 degrees Celsius. These movements are fast enough to respond to the control frequency of an actual gasoline engine, indicating a highly dynamic behavior of Pd that is crucial for the catalyst's self-regeneration function. The study also confirms that the Pd particles that segregate out during these processes are extremely fine, with an average size of around 0.8 nanometers.

研究显示，在400摄氏度下，钯（Pd）在LaFePdO3钙钛矿催化剂中的局部结构在红氧波动响应下快速变化，这些变化发生在大约1秒内。这些运动足够快以响应实际汽油发动机的控制频率，表明Pd的关键动态行为对于催化剂的自再生功能至关重要。研究还证实，分离出的Pd颗粒非常细小，平均大小约为0.8纳米。
