[1] "In the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst, redox fluctuations of the exhaust gas suppress the growth of particles of precious metal by caus- ing Pd to move in and out of the perovskite crystal."
[2] "We proved that the change in structure of Pd is sufficiently fast to respond to the control frequency (14 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine and that the Pd particles that segregate out are extremely fine."
[3] "It was proved that these Pd movements could respond to the high-speed fluctuations of automotive exhaust. It was also clearly shown that the Pd metal particles segregated from the perovskite crystal are extremely fine, and the Pd particle size is only 0.8 nm."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The redox fluctuations of the exhaust gas in the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst cause the precious metal particles to grow by enabling Pd to move in and out of the perovskite crystal structure. 
2. The movement of Pd in and out of the perovskite crystal structure is fast enough to respond to the high-speed fluctuations of automotive exhaust, with Pd particles that segregate being very fine, approximately 0.8 nm in size.

[1] "These rapid movements of Pd in the perovskite crystal could be the result of the sensitivity of the perovskite crystal to oxygen and prevent from the particle growth."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rapid movements of palladium (Pd) within the perovskite crystal structure might be attributed to the crystal's sensitivity to oxygen. This sensitivity helps prevent particle growth by facilitating the dynamic exchange of Pd atoms between segregation from and solid solution into the perovskite lattice.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

[1] "These movements of Pd would occur in response to the redox conditions of the environment [18]."
[2] "To observe the real movements of Pd directly, the time evolution of local structure around Pd by redox fluctuations was investigated by in situ energy-dispersive X-ray absorption fine-structure (DXAFS) analysis with a 10 ms resolution."
[3] "We proved that the change in structure of Pd is sufficiently fast to respond to the control frequency (14 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine and that the Pd particles that segregate out are extremely fine."
[4] "The observed CN of the PdPd bond was about 6.2 in the reduction process. The observed CN was corrected to allow for the existence ratio of Pd in an oxidized or reduced state (Table 2). As a result, the corrected CN of the PdPd bond was 7.7 (=6.2/0.804)."
[5] "The change in the Pd state with redox fluctuations that accompanied its segregation out and solid solution into the perovskite crystal are extremely fast, taking only about 1 s."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Palladium (Pd) movements between segregation and solid solution within the perovskite crystal occur rapidly, taking approximately 1 second at 400°C. These swift movements can be attributed to the perovskite crystal's sensitivity to oxygen, preventing particle growth.
2. Palladium in the perovskite catalyst undergoes structural changes in response to redox fluctuations, facilitating its movement in and out of the perovskite crystal. This process occurs within about 1 second, indicating a high responsiveness to environmental redox conditions.
3. The study employed in situ DXAFS analysis with a 10 ms resolution to directly observe the real-time movements of Pd within the catalyst. This allowed researchers to determine the speed at which Pd changes its state, responding to the control frequency of a gasoline engine (14 Hz).
4. The corrected coordination number (CN) of the PdPd bond during the reduction process was calculated to be 7.7, suggesting that the segregated Pd particles are significantly smaller, with an estimated average size of about 0.8 nanometers.
5. The redox fluctuations that cause Pd to segregate out and dissolve back into the perovskite crystal are highly dynamic, occurring at a speed fast enough to respond to the rapid fluctuations of automotive exhaust gases. This rapid change in Pd state is a key factor in maintaining the catalyst's activity and efficiency.

1. 钯(Pd)在泊松晶格中的分离和固溶体状态之间的快速变化，仅需大约1秒的时间，在400°C下。这些迅速的变化可以归因于泊松晶体对氧气的敏感性，从而防止颗粒的生长。
2. 催化剂中的钯通过红/氧化还原波动经历结构变化，使其能够在泊松晶格中移动进出。这一过程大约需要1秒，表明其能够快速响应汽车尾气的环境红/氧化还原条件。
3. 研究者使用了具有10毫秒分辨率的原位能量分散X射线吸收精细结构（DXAFS）分析，直接观察钯在催化剂中的实时移动。这使得研究人员能够确定钯状态变化的速度，以响应汽油发动机（14赫兹）的控制频率。
4. 减少过程中PdPd键的修正协调数（CN）计算为7.7，表明分离的Pd颗粒非常小，估计平均大小约为0.8纳米。
5. 引起钯从泊松晶格中分离和溶解回晶格的红/氧化波动是高度动态的，其速度足以响应汽车尾气气体的快速波动。这种快速变化的钯状态是维持催化剂活性和效率的关键因素。

The study demonstrates that the local structure of palladium (Pd) within a LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst changes rapidly in response to redox fluctuations, with movements occurring within approximately 1 second at 400 degrees Celsius. These movements are fast enough to respond to the control frequency of an actual gasoline engine, indicating a highly dynamic behavior of Pd that is crucial for the catalyst's self-regeneration function.

3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the radial distribution function around Pd, which was obtained by Fourier transform of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, typically in the range of k values from 3.0 A 1 to 8.0 A 1. There are two peaks in each samples corresponding to the PdO bond and the PdPd bond, respectively. The PdO bond of LaFePdO3 originates from the B-site of the perovskite structure [1,7], whereas the PdO bond of Pd/Al2O3 originates from PdO [1,7]. The PdPd bond originates from metallic Pd for both catalysts.
