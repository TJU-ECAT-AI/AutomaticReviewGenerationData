[1] "These rapid movements of Pd in the perovskite crystal could be the result of the sensitivity of the perovskite crystal to oxygen and prevent from the particle growth."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rapid movements of palladium (Pd) within the perovskite crystal structure might be attributed to the crystal's sensitivity to oxygen. This sensitivity helps prevent particle growth by facilitating the dynamic exchange of Pd atoms between segregation from and solid solution into the perovskite lattice.
