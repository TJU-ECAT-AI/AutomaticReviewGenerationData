Nb effect in the nickel oxide-catalyzed low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane Haibo Zhu a, Samy Ould-Chikh a, Dalaver H.

The resulting materials have higher surface areas than those obtained by the classical evaporation method from nickel nitrate and ammonium niobium oxalate. These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6.
Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crys- tallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO. This geometric effect is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. The close interac- tion between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings.
Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is a major raw material of the petrochemical industry. It is indeed used in the production of commodity chemicals, such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene. It is currently produced together with propylene by high temperature steam cracking of naphtha [1]. This thermal process, involves gas phase free-radical chemistry;it results in a mixture of various types of hydrocarbons [2], with low yields of ethylene. These yields can be improved by cracking LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) [3]. Energy input and carbon emissions can be lowered, to a certain extent, by catalytic approaches, which at the same time allow tuning the ethylene to propylene ratio [4].
However, these highly endothermic processes suffer from high energy demand and complex thermal management [5].
These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane. Many materials have been shown to catalyze this reaction, such as rare-earth oxides [69], alkaline/alkaline-earth metals [1012], perovskites [1318], and transition metal oxides [1923]. Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al.
[26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]. This last discovery followed the observation that nickel oxides displayed high activity and selectivity for low-temperature ethane ODH [28]. This was some- how unexpected due to the high activation energy of oxygen desorption from NiO [29]. The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]. These dopants influence not only the amount but also the mobility of oxygen spe- cies present in the catalytic oxides. According to Lemonidou et al.,niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion 0021-9517/$ - see front matter  2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005 Corresponding author.

However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selec- tivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36].
In this context, we present an alternative method for the synthesis of Ni and NiNb catalysts. This solgel-based method,starting from nickel nitrate, niobium chloride, and citric acid, pro- duces oxides with high surface areas. It leads to highly active and stable nickel oxides. The optimum levels of Nb doping is reduced,and results in both high efficiency (conversion  selectivity) and high stability in low-temperature ethane ODH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
NiCl2 (98%, Aldrich), Ni(NO3)2. 6H2O (98.5%, Aldrich), NbCl5 (99%, Strem), Niobium oxalate hydrate (C10H5NbO20xH2O, Alfa Ae- sar), oxalic acid (99%, Aldrich), citric acid (99.5%, Aldrich), ammonia (28% in H2O, Aldrich) were commercially available and used with- out further purification.
2.1.1. Preparation of nickel oxides
Protocol 1: precipitation by reaction between nickel nitrate and oxalic acid. 1.81 g of oxalic acid was dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol,and this solution was added dropwise into a solution containing
5.75 g Ni(NO3)2 and 100 mL ethanol. The obtained blue precipitates
were separated by filtration and then washed with ethanol and water several cycles. The last blue solid was dried at 100 C for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 400 C for 4 h. It is referred to as NiO_oxalic acid.
Protocol 2: precipitation by reaction between nickel chloride and ammonia. 3 mL NH3H2O (28 vol.%) was dissolved in 100 mL H2O to get diluted ammonia solution, which was added to a NiCl2 solu- tion (4.69 g in 200 mL H2O) slowly (approximately 3 h) under vig- orous stirring (300 rpm) at room temperature. The resulting precipitates were filtered and washed with distilled water several times. After drying at 90 C for 12 h, the precipitates were heated at 400 C for 4 h. It is referred to as NiO_NH4OH.
Protocol 3: solgel by reaction between nickel nitrate and citric acid.
The solgel method was inspired from [37]. 3 g of Ni(NO3)26H2O and 6 g of citric acid were dissolved in 50 mL of
H2O. The blue solution was aged at 80 C under stirring for 24 h
and then evaporated at 80 C in an open system to eliminate water.
The obtained gel was further dried at 120 C and 140 C, respec- tively, for 2 h and lastly dried at 160 C for 12 h. The resulting black xerogel was calcined by heating from room temperature to 450 C with a rate of 1 C/min and then kept at this temperature for 4 h in static air. It is referred to as NiO_SG. After calcination at 450 C, a shiny layer of metal-like material appeared on the surface of the black NiO powder. That metallic micro-sheet was easily removed using a spatula, without contaminating the powder, referred to as NiO_SG (Ni removed).
2.1.2. Preparation of Nb2O5
Nb2O5 was prepared by calcination of Niobium oxalate hydrate at 450 C (ramp rate of 1 C/min from room temperature to 450 C) for 4 h in static air.
2.1.3. Preparation of Nb-doped NiO
Protocol 3. NixNb1xO (x = 0.99, 0.98, 0.97, 0.96, 0.95, 0.90, 0.85,
0.80), which will be referred to as Nb1xNixO in the following,
were prepared by modifying the solgel protocol for nickel oxide (Protocol 3) as follows for the, e.g., Nb0.15Ni0.85O composition.
0.46 g NbCl5 was slowly added to 30 ml H2O. The resulting white
Nb2O5nH2O precipitate was washed with H2O until free of chlo- rine. It was then dissolved in warm citric acid solution (50 mL,
0.63 mol L1). When 3 g of Ni(NO3)26H2O were added, the initially
transparent solution turned blue. It was kept at 80 C in a closed system for 24 h and then under stirring for 12 h to remove the water. The gel was dried in 3 steps. First, it stayed at 120 C for 2 h. Second, it was then heated to 140 C and kept at this temper- ature for 2 h. Third, the gel was dried at 160 C for 12 h. The ob- tained black xerogel was calcined at 450 C (ramp rate of 1 C/ min from room temperature to 450 C) for 4 h in static air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) in air were performed on a MettlerToledo. The uncalcined samples were heated from 50 to 800 C with a rate of 10 C/min in a flow of air (100 mL/min).
N2
adsorption/desorption isotherms were acquired on a Micromeritics ASAP2420. The samples were degassed for 2 h at 300 C before nitrogen adsorption. Surface areas of the samples were analyzed by multipoint BET analysis method, and pore vol- umes were estimated at P/P0 = 0.99.
The morphologies of the catalyst were imaged with an FEI Quanta 600 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The catalyst was sputter-coated with gold in argon atmo- sphere before measurement to make it conductive.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer, using a monochromatic Al Ka X-ray source operating at 45 W and a pass energy of 20 eV.
The binding energies of Nb 3d core levels are referenced to the C 1s core level at 285.0 eV.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on an Altamira Instrument equipped with a TCD detector; data were analyzed using the AMI analysis Software. The catalyst powder (25 mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pretreated in flowing Ar (30 mL/min) for 0.5 h at 350 C, followed by cooling to room temperature. The temperature was then raised from room temperature to 800 C at a rate of 10 C/min with a 5% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min). The uptake of the H2 was estimated by 5 blank pulse calibrations.
Rietveld X-ray diffraction intensity data sets were collected using a Bruker D8 Advanced A25 diffractometer in BraggBrentano geometry fitted with a copper tube operating at 40 kV and 40 mA and a linear position sensitive detector (opening 2.9). The diffrac- tometer was configured with a 0.18 diverging slit, 3.2 anti scat- tering slit, 2.5 Soller slits, and a Ni filter. The data sets were acquired in continuous scanning mode (0.007182/s) over the 2h range 10140, using a step interval of 0.05 and a counting time of 7 s per step.
The XRD data were analyzed by the Rietveld method using the fundamental-parameters (FPs) approach contained within the soft- ware TOPAS V4.2 (Bruker-AXS) [38]. For consistency, the same refinement procedure was used for all samples. Bunsenite and metallic nickel reflections were both refined with a cubic structure (space group Fm3m (no. 225)) with initial cell parameters of 4.18 and 3.52 Å, respectively. The profile parameters included the scale factor, a sample displacement parameter, and a five-term polyno- mial for the background (zero to fourth order coefficients). The FPs approach calculates analytically the instrumental resolution function. Crystallite size then becomes a function of the Lorentzian peak broadening. Refined structural parameters are the site

293 occupation factor of nickel and the isotropic atomic displacement parameter of nickel and oxygen. Strong correlation between atom- ic displacement parameters and site occupation factor prevented the structure refinement to be conclusive about the occurrence of bulk niobium doping.
Additional peaks localized at 2h = 30.43, 35.64, 41.22, 43.80, and
60.82, characteristic of NiNb2O6 [ICSD card: 37212] [36,39], were
fitted with a pseudo-Voigt function and used to improve the over- all quality of the refinement. Indeed, the latter peaks are in vicinity of bunsenite reflections and tend to influence the calculation of bunsenite crystallite size when not taken into account. Those reflec- tions are considered as an amorphous NixNbyO phase which might constitute a precrystalline network of the crystalline mixed oxide NiNb2O6, that was identified by HRTEM-FFT studies described be- low. Evolution of the amorphous content as a function of Nb con- tent was roughly computed by calculating a pseudo degree of crystallinity q. q Total peak areas of crystalline phases Total peak areas of crystalline phases  Total peak areas of NixNbyO amorphous phase Rwp, RBragg, GOF were, respectively, in the range of 0.9, 0.7, and 1.8 for all refinements.
Imaging of samples was performed on a Titan G2 80300 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) from FEI Company (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with a 4 k  4 k changed couple device (CCD) camera model US4000 and an energy filter model GIF Tridiem from Gatan, Inc. (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Multiple locations of the specimens are investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) technique. The ac- quired HRTEM micrographs were processed to obtain their diffrac- tograms using Fast-Fourier transforms (FFT) technique to measure the spatial frequencies present in the images. The measurement of the spatial frequencies allowed obtaining the d-spacings of the phases present in the sample with an error less than 5%. The TEM was also set to scanning TEM (STEM) mode for carrying out the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) characterization of sample with about 1 nm spatial resolution. Energy resolution of GIF in EELS mode was nearly 1 eV, and furthermore, it was set to an energy dispersion of 0.2 eV/channel. EELS signal from Oxygen K edge (O-K edge) of 532 eV is acquired with convergence angle of 9 mrad and collection angle of 20 mrad. GIF was also utilized in energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) mode for the distribution of Ni- and Nb-based phases in the samples. Ni M-edge of energy 68 eV and Nb M-edge of energy 205 eV were selected for their EFTEM maps. Furthermore, each elemental map is created by using a 3- window method of generating such maps in GIF.
3. Catalyst evaluation in low-temperature ethane oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) Catalytic properties are evaluated at atmospheric pressure in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using a P and ID micro- pilot equipped with a stainless steel reactor (internal diameter 4 mm). Gas mixtures of 10% C2H6/5% O2 and 10% C2H6/10% O2 in He are introduced through the catalytic bed at a total flow rate of 10 mL/min. Gas compositions are controlled by calibrated mass-flow controllers. 100 mg catalyst was placed in the reactor with glass wool as support (W/F = 0.6 g s/mL). It is ramped at 1/min from 200 to 400 C. The reaction mixture is sampled at the outlet of the reactor at regular intervals, typically every 5 min, and analyzed with on-line Varian 490 micro-GC equipped with a TCD detector and two columns: a MolSieve 5 Å column (Ar as carrier gas) to quantify O2 (no CO is detected under our con- ditions), and a poraPLOT Q column (He as carrier gas) to quantify CO2, C2H4 as well as C2H6. Ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene are calculated on a carbon basis. To obtain different con- version levels at constant temperature (330 C), the W/F ratio is varied from 0.05 to 0.6 g s/mL. For stability tests, gas mixtures of 10% C2H6/5% O2 in He are introduced through the catalytic bed held at 330 C, at a total flow rate of 10 mL/min (W/F = 0.6 g s/mL), and the reaction mixture is sampled every 30 min for about 70 h.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. NiO catalysts
4.1.1. Morphology
Three methods were considered for the preparation of NiO cat- alysts: precipitation of nickel nitrate in oxalic acid (Protocol 1),precipitation of nickel chloride in ammonia (Protocol 2) and a solgel method starting from nickel nitrate and citric acid (Protocol 3). The specific surface areas and porosities, as well as the corre- sponding scanning electron micrographs, are given in Table 1 and Fig. 1.
The morphologies of the materials prepared by precipitation are consistent with the morphology obtained in [37] by precipitation of nickel nitrate in ammonia, with similar scanning electron micro- graphs (Fig. 1) and surface areas of 6065 m2/g (Table 1). The nickel oxide prepared by solgel exhibits a lower surface area of 31 m2/g. It is attributed to the presence of the more dense Ni metallic phase (14 wt.% present in NiO_SG, as determined by XRD, Table 2), which appeared after calcination at 450 C in the form of a shiny black micro-sheet on top of the black NiO powder. The use of citric acid in the synthesis, which remains in the dry gel as evidenced by TGA, indeed results in incomplete oxidation of NiO after calcination at 450 C, as observed in [40]. After removal of the shiny nickel micro-sheet (<1 wt.% Ni left in NiO_SG (Ni re- moved)), the surface area reaches a value of 48 m2/g. This is lower than the 88 m2/g obtained in [37], despite the fact that the NiO crystallite size (13 nm, Table 2) is similar (10 nm). It is also lower than the theoretical surface (69 m2/g) expected for spheres of NiO (density 6.67 g/cm3) of 13 nm in diameter. This indicates a cer- tain degree of aggregation of the NiO crystallites, in agreement with SEM observations (Fig. 1).
4.1.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
These nickel oxides prepared by three different methods have been tested in low-temperature ODH of ethane (Fig. 2). Despite lower surface area (48 m2/g) and presence of <1 wt.% Ni metal, NiO_SG exhibits a higher efficiency than NiO_NH4OH, which is simi- lar to that displayed by NiO_oxalic acid. The intrinsic activity of NiO_SG, in terms of number of mole of ethane converted per surface unit per time unit (Table 3, Entry 3), is similar to that reported for nickel oxides prepared by the evaporation method [34,36]. But, gi- ven the high selectivity of our catalyst (Table 3, Entry 3), the effi- ciency of NiO_SG is 23 times higher than those reported so far,with a surface-specific ethene production rate at 350 C of
3.9  108 molethene/m2/s. Finally, given the low surface area of
the published nickel oxides (17 m2/g [34] and 12 m2/g [36]), the mass-specific ethene production rate (Table 3, Entry 3) is one order of magnitude higher on our 48 m2/g NiO_SG and ethene yields of 9% and 24% are obtained at 300 C and 350 C, respectively (Table 3, Entry 3).
These preliminary results clearly show the impact of the prep- aration method on the structural and catalytic properties of nickel oxides catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH. The selectivity of about 60% displayed by NiO_SG (held up to 25% conversion) is significantly higher than selectivities normally reported for pure nickel oxides (20% [34]  30% [36]). It is normally only achieved with composite materials, such as the recently reported nickel oxide supported on high surface area zirconia, which managed to 294
H. Zhu et al. / Journal of Catalysis 285 (2012) 292303
reach a selectivity to ethene of 55% (at 24.8% conversion obtained at 450 C with ethane/O2 = 2) [41]. Hence, by combining high activ- ity and an exceptionally high selectivity for pure NiO, undoped nickel oxides prepared in the presence of citric acid can be remark- ably efficient catalysts for low-temperature ethane ODH.
4.2. Nb1xNixO catalysts (0.80 6 x 6 0.95)
4.2.1. Morphology
By incorporating Niobium in the solgel method at similar load- ing (520 at.%) as those published (see Experimental Part), the sur- face areas of the resulting materials increase significantly. The material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area of 130 m2/g (Table 4), which increases with increasing Nb loading until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O. This is,to the best of our knowledge, the highest surface area ever re- ported for such oxides. The diffraction patterns are slightly broad- ened and can be fitted with the bunsenite NiO phase with a lattice parameter of 4.179  0.001 Å and a crystallite size of about 9 10 nm (Table 2), regardless of the Nb loading.
The measured surface areas are thus higher than the calculated surface of NiO spheres of 910 nm in diameter (90100 m2/g). This cannot be accounted for by the doping of the nickel oxide cubic structure with Nb atoms. First, the expected contraction of the NiO lattice [34] is not observed (Table 2). Second, given the molec- ular weights of Ni (58.7 g/mol) and of Nb (92.9 g/mol), replacing one Ni2+Ni3+ pair with one Nb5+ (which creates one nickel va- cancy) would result, at the maximum doping of 20 at.%, in a ca. 4% decrease in the weight of a given crystallite. The change in the volume of the crystallite being negligible, such a 20 at.% doping of NiO crystals would thus result in a maximum of 4% increase in the surface area of the crystal. Besides, filling cationic vacancies with Nb5+ cations (which, for each vacancy filled, causes reduction of five Ni3+ into five Ni2+) would result in an increase in the weight of the crystal and thus a decrease in its surface area.
The significant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO Table 1 Physico-chemical properties of nickel oxides prepared by three different methods of preparation.

295 phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium content. Bright field images (Fig. 3a) obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy performed on Nb0.20Ni0.80O in- deed show areas containing essentially amorphous particles. These particles contain an intimate mixture of nickel and niobium, as indi- cated by EFTEM (Fig. 3b). The Nb/Ni ratio is not only superior to the theoretical 1/4 ratio, but also much larger than 1 (EELS). The diffrac- tograms from the couple of Nb-rich areas shown in Fig. 3a clearly indicate that some parts are completely amorphous (Fig. 3c), while other parts display the possible crystalline signature of NiNb2O6 (d002 = 2.51 Å and d312 = 2.05 Å, Fig. 3d). The presence of this latter phase was also identified in NiNbO samples prepared by the evap- oration method [36,39]. Including a broad contribution of this phase (2h = 30.43, 35.64, 41.22, 43.80, and 60.82 [ICSD: 37212]) in the Rietveld analysis of the diffractograms allowed us to significantly improve the refinement. According to the evolution of the crystallin- ity degree, it can represent a non-negligible part of the sample (Table 2).
Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the dif- fractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented. This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the syn- thetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component upon TGA in air (at about 450 C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20Ni0.80O in- stead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4). It also suggests that the pres- ence of Nb in the Nicitrate gel hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate. This can possibly be due to a kind of geometric effect: the Nb atoms located near the nickel atoms would increase the dis- tance between the citrate component and the nickel atoms and thus act as a kind of barrier. The absence of any citrate residue after calcination at 450 C (absence of mCH and mC=O vibrations in FTIR spectra) excludes the formation/occurrence of high surface area hybrid NiOcitrate networks [42]. Alternatively, it strongly indi- cates that the high surface areas observed indeed stem from the presence of very small nanoobjects of niobium-rich oxide, of about
1.6 nm for Nb0.15Ni0.85O, for example, considering non-aggregated
10 nm NiO crystallites and a density of 5.644 g/cm3 for NiNb2O6. A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a bind- ing energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as com- pared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativ- ity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale. This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6.
4.2.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
With these systems, the ethene yields systematically decrease with increasing Nb content (Fig. 4). This decrease occurs despite the higher surface area of the Nb-containing samples (130 225 m2/g), as compared with that of NiO_SG (48 m2/g). The low eth- ene yields result from a much lower intrinsic activity of the Nb- containing nickel oxides (from 4.2  109 molethane converted/m2/s to
1.8  108 molethane converted/m2/s at 350 C), as compared with that
of NiO_SG, which is not compensated by the otherwise significantly higher selectivity of the Nb-containing catalysts (Table 3). These re- sults could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and sur- rounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c).

shape, which are similar to those displayed by NiO_SG and highly loaded Nb1xNixO. The diffraction pattern of Nb0.01Ni0.99O is sim- ilar to that of Nb-free NiO_SG (before removal of Ni), with an average NiO crystallite size of about 13 nm and the presence of 18 wt.% Ni metallic phase (Table 2). On the other hand, the diffraction patterns of Nb0.02Ni0.98O, Nb0.03Ni0.97O, and Nb0.04Ni0.96O are more simi- lar to those displayed by the Nb-rich NiO samples. First, the Ni metallic phase is absent from the diffractograms. This indicates that a loading of 2 at.% Nb in the NbNicitrate gel is enough to disturb reduction to Ni by citrate upon calcination. Second, the NiO crystal- lite sizes of 10 nm in Nb0.02Ni0.98O and 7 nm in Nb0.03Ni0.97O and Nb0.04Ni0.96O are lower than those observed in NiO_SG and Nb0.01 Ni0.99O samples (13 nm) and close to those displayed by Nb-rich samples (910 nm). Finally, all samples contain a significant amount of an amorphous phase (Table 2), which is present as a broad contri- bution in the diffraction patterns. The surface areas (Table 5) are consistent with samples containing aggregated 713 nm NiO crys- tallites and a small amount of extra-crystalline, amorphous, nano- metric Nb-rich mixed oxides. At the 4at% Nb content in particular,the surface area exceeds the external surface displayed by unaggre- gated 7 nm NiO crystallites (129 m2/g). A potential effect of Nb on lowering the degree of aggregation of NiO crystallites is thus not en- ough to explain the high value observed (145 m2/g). This latter effect can however not be excluded.
4.3.2. Catalytic properties in ethane ODH
Ethene yields obtained over these materials are very similar to those obtained on 48 m2/g NiO_SG (Fig. 7a). The two formulations containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lat- tice parameter (4.184 Å), Nb0.03Ni0.97O and Nb0.04Ni0.96O, how- ever,seem slightly more efficient.
This is confirmed by decreasing the amount of oxygen in the reactant feed, i.e., by per- forming ethane ODH in the presence of 5 vol.% instead of 10 vol.% O2 (Fig. 7b). The high yields, of up to 10% at 300 C and 25% at 350 C in the presence of 10 vol.%O2, come from slightly lower intrinsic activities (between 2.0  108 molethane converted/m2/s and
2.8  108 molethane converted/m2/s at 350 C) associated with higher
