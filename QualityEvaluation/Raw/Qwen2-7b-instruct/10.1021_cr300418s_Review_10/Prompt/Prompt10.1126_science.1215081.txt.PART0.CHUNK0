I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

PERSPECTIVES
ically separated before, but the connection to subcellular compartments is new. The authors tie these points together with previous results ( 8,11) in a model (see the fi gure).
The most surprising fi nding from these studies is that EDS1 interacts with AvrRps4 and another bacterial effector protein HopA1.
Bhattacharjee et al. show that AvrRps4 and HopA1 interact directly with EDS1 in vitro and disrupt interactions between EDS1, SRFR1, and TIR-NB-LRR proteins at the endomembrane. Heidrich et al. demonstrate that AvrRps4 binds directly to EDS1, but not RPS4, in vivo. These results suggest that AvrRps4 and HopA1 evolved independently to target EDS1 and thereby interfere with immunity. Subsequently, multiple TIR-NB- LRR proteins evolved to guard EDS1.
In this context, EDS1 could be consid- ered a co-receptor in a surveillance complex.
Does this contradict the long-standing model that predicts a downstream signaling role for EDS1? In principle, the necessity of EDS1 for resistance triggered by RPS4, RPS6, and SNC1 could be explained simply by its role as a guarded virulence target. That is, the absence of the target/guardee in eds1 mutants renders the surveillance complex incompe- tent. However, it is important to consider the conservation of EDS1 in monocots (which do not have TIR-NB-LRR proteins), along with its role in basal resistance (presumably independent of TIR-NB-LRR proteins) and experiments from previous studies of EDS1 that support a signaling role in effector-trig- gered immunity ( 11). The two functions are not mutually exclusive and could be recon- ciled by an evolutionary model in which EDS1 has a relatively ancient signaling func- tion in basal resistance that was targeted by effectors and also co-opted to support effec- tor-triggered immunity. This could be further resolved, such as by testing whether EDS1 is guarded by other TIR-NB-LRR proteins.
Bhattacharjee et al. and Heidrich et al. provide important clues to the mystery of how plant immune surveillance proteins per- ceive pathogen effectors and activate down- stream responses. Additionally, the target- ing of EDS1 generalizes the prediction that pathogens exploit points of vulnerabil- ity in the immune network, which in turn can be guarded by NB-LRR proteins ( 12).
Attention can now be focused on plotting the sequence of events in RPS4 activation and understanding how effectors manipulate EDS1 to enhance virulence. The effector pro- teins might serve as probes to investigate how EDS1 and partners regulate immunity in dif- ferent cellular compartments. Because EDS1 supports resistance against diverse pathogens in divergent plants, results from these experi- ments can inform breeding for disease resis- tance in crops.

<questions>


How do the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, and what challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
