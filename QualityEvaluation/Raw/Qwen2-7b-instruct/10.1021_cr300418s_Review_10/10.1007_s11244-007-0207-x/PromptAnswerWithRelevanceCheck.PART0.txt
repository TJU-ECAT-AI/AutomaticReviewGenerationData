The study aimed to address the question of whether the self-regenerative function, previously observed in palladium, could also occur in rhodium and platinum. Through the utilization of X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at SPring-8, the researchers successfully developed a super-intelligent catalyst. This catalyst demonstrated that rhodium and platinum could also exhibit self-regenerative behavior through solid solutions and segregation within a perovskite crystal structure, akin to palladium. This achievement paved the way for the application of self-regenerative technology to rhodium and platinum, offering potential socio-economic benefits.

It was reported that the innovation of An Intelligent Catalyst which has the self-regenerative function of Pd, and the development for application to the Japanese ULEV standard.
It was whether the self-regenerative function is unique to Pd or it can happen to Rh and Pt.
In this study, a remaining big question was replied to.
The question is Is this self-regenerative function the special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The self-regenerative function of the intelligent catalyst is not unique to Palladium (Pd), as it can also occur in Rhodium (Rh) and Platinum (Pt) through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal.

Figure 1 shows how the amount of Rh, Pt and Pd used for automotive catalysts has increased as a whole over the last decade [9]. In these precious metals,because the demand of Pd rapidly grew for the reason to reduce cold start emissions, our initial development of the self-regenerative function was focused on Pd.
The price of Rh fluctuates markedly and over 85% of the demand for Rh coming from automotive catalyst manufacture. Recently, demand and price for Pt are also increasing gradually, because Pt is very useful for many ways such as diesel catalysts and fuel cell catalysts.
Success in applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would have immediate socio-economic results.

Graph 1 illustrates the significant increase in the usage of Rhodium (Rh), Platinum (Pt), and Palladium (Pd) in automotive catalysts over the past decade. The rapid demand for Pd was driven by its effectiveness in reducing cold-start emissions. Due to the marked price fluctuations and high demand from automotive catalyst production, Rhodium and Platinum also experience increasing demand, particularly for applications in diesel catalysts and fuel cells. Successfully applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would yield immediate socio-economic benefits.

This document addresses the question of whether the self-regenerative function is unique to palladium (Pd) or if it can also occur in rhodium (Rh) and platinum (Pt). It confirms that the self-regenerative function is not exclusive to Pd but can also happen to Rh and Pt. The study demonstrates that through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal, Rh and Pt can achieve similar self-regenerative capabilities as Pd. This finding opens up potential for more efficient and economically beneficial catalysts in automotive emissions control and other applications.

This document discusses the development of intelligent catalysts with self-regenerative functions for precious metals such as palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and platinum (Pt). The authors have focused on the industrialization of these catalysts, particularly for use in automotive emissions reduction. The document also addresses the question of whether the self-regenerative function is exclusive to Pd or if it applies to Rh and Pt as well. Through X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, the researchers have demonstrated that Rh and Pt can indeed exhibit self-regenerative behavior similar to Pd, by forming solid solutions and segregating within perovskite crystals. This development leads to the creation of a 'Super Intelligent Catalyst' that can utilize Rh and Pt alongside Pd for automotive applications. The document further highlights the socio-economic benefits of extending this technology to Rh and Pt, given their growing demand in various industries, such as diesel catalysts and fuel cells. The successful implementation of this technology has led to its commercialization for Japanese SULEV catalysts since December 2005.

本文讨论了对贵金属如钯（Pd）、铑（Rh）和铂（Pt）的智能催化剂自再生功能的工业化。作者们关注了这些催化剂的工业应用，特别是用于汽车排放减少。文档还回答了一个遗留的大问题：自再生功能是否仅限于Pd，还是Rh和Pt也能实现这一功能。通过X射线吸收精细结构测量，研究人员证明了Rh和Pt确实能够像Pd一样，在正交晶系晶体中形成固溶体并发生分离，从而实现自再生行为。这一发展导致了“超级智能催化剂”的创建，该催化剂可以利用Rh、Pt与Pd一起在汽车应用中使用。文档进一步强调了将此技术扩展至Rh和Pt的经济和社会效益，考虑到这两种金属在不同行业（如柴油催化剂和燃料电池）需求的增加。这项技术的成功实施已使其自2005年12月起商业化应用于日本SULEV催化剂。
