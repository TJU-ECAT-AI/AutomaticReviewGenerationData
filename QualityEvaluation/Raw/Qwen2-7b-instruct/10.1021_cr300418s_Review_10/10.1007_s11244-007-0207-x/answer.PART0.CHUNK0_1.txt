<p>In this study, a remaining big question was replied to. The question is Is this self-regenerative function the special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?</p>
<p>The attempt succeeded in the development of A Super Intelligent Catalyst which Rh and Pt, as well as Pd, can be also realized through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal.</p>

1. The self-regenerative function of the Pd-, Rh-, and Pt-perovskite catalysts was initially thought to be unique to Pd. However, this study demonstrated that Rh and Pt can also exhibit this self-regenerative function through solid solution and segregation within the perovskite crystal structure.
