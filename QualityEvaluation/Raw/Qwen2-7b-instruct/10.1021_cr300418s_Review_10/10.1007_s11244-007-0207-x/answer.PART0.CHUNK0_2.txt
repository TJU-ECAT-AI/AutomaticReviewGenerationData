It was reported that the innovation of An Intelligent Catalyst which has the self-regenerative function of Pd, and the development for application to the Japanese ULEV standard.
It was whether the self-regenerative function is unique to Pd or it can happen to Rh and Pt.
In this study, a remaining big question was replied to.
The question is Is this self-regenerative function the special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?

The self-regenerative function of the intelligent catalyst is not unique to Palladium (Pd), as it can also occur in Rhodium (Rh) and Platinum (Pt) through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal.

Figure 1 shows how the amount of Rh, Pt and Pd used for automotive catalysts has increased as a whole over the last decade [9]. In these precious metals,because the demand of Pd rapidly grew for the reason to reduce cold start emissions, our initial development of the self-regenerative function was focused on Pd.
The price of Rh fluctuates markedly and over 85% of the demand for Rh coming from automotive catalyst manufacture. Recently, demand and price for Pt are also increasing gradually, because Pt is very useful for many ways such as diesel catalysts and fuel cell catalysts.
Success in applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would have immediate socio-economic results.

Graph 1 illustrates the significant increase in the usage of Rhodium (Rh), Platinum (Pt), and Palladium (Pd) in automotive catalysts over the past decade. The rapid demand for Pd was driven by its effectiveness in reducing cold-start emissions. Due to the marked price fluctuations and high demand from automotive catalyst production, Rhodium and Platinum also experience increasing demand, particularly for applications in diesel catalysts and fuel cells. Successfully applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would yield immediate socio-economic benefits.

图1显示了过去十年中，铑（Rh）、铂（Pt）和钯（Pd）在汽车催化剂中的使用量整体显著增长的情况。钯（Pd）需求快速增长的原因是其能有效降低冷启动排放。由于铑（Rh）价格波动明显且超过85%的铑（Rh）需求来自于汽车催化剂制造，近期铂（Pt）的需求也在逐渐增加，因为它在柴油催化剂和燃料电池催化剂等多个领域都非常有用。将自再生智能催化剂技术成功应用于铑（Rh）和铂（Pt）会带来即时的社会经济效益。
