1. Introduction
In the last CAPoC6 Congress, it was reported that the industrialization of An Intelligent Catalyst which has the function for self-regeneration of Pd [1]. The function was realized through a cyclic movement of Pd between the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) and the outside (as Pd nano-particles) of the LaFePdO3 perovskite crystal in synchronization with the inherent fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occurred in real automotive exhaust gases. As a result, the growth of Pd particles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle and drastic reductions in Pd consumption for automotive catalysts can be achieved [28].
In this study, a remaining big question was replied to.
The question is Is this self-regenerative function the special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?
Figure 1 shows how the amount of Rh, Pt and Pd used for automotive catalysts has increased as a whole over the last decade [9]. In these precious metals,because the demand of Pd rapidly grew for the reason to reduce cold start emissions, our initial development of the self-regenerative function was focused on Pd. As a result, we have been able to realize drastic reductions in Pd consumption for automotive catalysts.
The price of Rh fluctuates markedly and over 85% of the demand for Rh coming from automotive catalyst manufacture. Recently, demand and price for Pt are also increasing gradually, because Pt is very useful for many ways such as diesel catalysts and fuel cell catalysts.
Success in applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would have immediate socio- economic results.
X-ray absorption fine structure measurement at SPring-8 was used effectively to solve this question.
The attempt succeeded in the development of A Super Intelligent Catalyst which Rh and Pt, as well as Pd, can be also realized through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal. This super- intelligent catalyst has been commercialized from December 2005 for Japanese SULEV catalyst, and is expected to be the key that opens the windows for clean air to blow in.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of powder catalyst
Rh-containing perovskites; LaFe0.95Rh0.05O3 and CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3 and Pt-containing perovskites; LaFe0.95Pt0.05O3 and CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3 powder catalysts were prepared by the alkoxide method.
Metal isopropoxides, Mx+[OCH(CH3)2]x, of Ca, Ti and precious metal acetylacetonate (Mx+(CH3CO CHCOCH3)2) were dissolved in toluene. The amount of precious metal was adjusted to 5 atom% of that of the B-site element of the perovskite structure. Precipitate containing Pd was obtained by hydrolysis with deion- ized water. The precursor was dried and then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in the air to obtain perovskite powder catalyst containing homogeneously distributed precious metal.
Rh/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 powder catalysts were also prepared as references. AI2O3 was impregnated with nitrate solution, then dried and calcined at 500 C for 1 h in the air. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2.2. Thermal redox treatment
The Rh- and Pt-perovskite powder catalysts (LaFe- RhO3, CaTiRhO3, LaFePtO3 and CaTiPtO3) prepared to investigate the self-regenerative function of precious metal were exposed to the following treatment: First, the samples were oxidized in the air at 800 C for 1 h. They were then reduced in 2.5% H2 and 7.5% CO balanced with nitrogen gas at 800 C for 1 h. Finally, the catalysts were re-oxidized in the air at 800 C for 1 h (figure 2) [3,5]. These successive single-run treatments created a separate model for each of the key stages of exhaust gas from a gasoline engine.
2.3. Characterization
2.3.1. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS)
In order to investigate the self-regenerative function of precious metal in perovskite oxides, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement near the Rh K-edge or the Pt Liii-edge was carried out using 8-GeV synchrotron radiation at beam line of BL01B1 in SPring-8, Japan. Extended X-ray absorption fine struc- ture (EXAFS) oscillations were analyzed with standard procedures, in order to know the local structure around precious metal.
The powder from each catalyst sample was pressed to form pellets. X-ray absorption spectra were measured by scanning a Si (311) for Rh or Si (111) for Pt double crystal monochromator. The photon energy was cali- brated with Rh or Pt powder by assigning 23.224 or
11.559 keV to the energy at half the edge jump. The
powder of Rh2O3 and PtO2 were also measured as standard materials for the edge position of the samples [10,11].
2.3.2. Transmissive electron microscopy (TEM)
Rh and Pt particles of the catalysts after oxidation,reduction and reoxidation were observed by TEM at the magnification of 400,000·.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. XAFS analysis for Rh- and Pt-perovskite powder
Figure 3 shows the calculated radial structure func- tion around Rh for LaFeRhO3 and CaTiRhO3 per- ovskties. All the Rh of LaFeRhO3 was present as a solid-solution in perovskite after oxidation, but only about 37% of Rh segregated even after reduction at 800 C (table 1). By replacing the perovskite from La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3,the segregation of metallic Rh particles after reduction is significantly improved [10].
Figure 4 shows the calculated radial structure func- tion around Pt for LaFePtO3 and CaTiPtO3 perovskites.
All the Pt of LaFePtO3 was present as a solid-solution in perovskite after oxidation, and almost Pt segregated after reduction, but only about 78% of Pt restored to the perovskite lattice. By replacing the perovskite from La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3, the restoration rate of Pt after re-oxidation is significantly improved.
3.2. Rh and Pt particle observation after redox treatment
TEM observations of Rh and Pt particles in CaTi- RhO3 and CaTiPtO3 after redox treatments are shown in figure 5(af). The magnification is 400,000· and the bar in this figure measures 10 nm.
In oxidized samples, Rh and Pt particles are not discoverable by TEM. This indicates that Rh and Pt are dissolved in the perovskite as a solid-solution.

M. Taniguchi et al./The self-regenerative Pd-, Rh-, and Pt-perovskite catalysts
369 reduced samples, metallic nano-particles about 13 nm in diameter are found at the perovskite surface. It is expected that these fine metallic particles have very high catalytic activity. In re-oxidized samples, precious metal particles are once again dissolved in the perovskite crystal structure and invisible even by the precise TEM observation.
It demonstrates that CaTiRhO3 and CaTiPtO3 has the self-regenerative function of Rh and Pt, moving in and out of the perovskite structure in relation to the fluctuation of oxidation and reduction atmospheres.
3.3. Universality of the new catalyst design with the self-
regenerative function The perovskite-type oxides are very useful because of their structural durability and the abundance of their possible combination. The requirement for the self- regenerative intelligent catalyst is as follows. The oxide,which makes perovskite representative, should maintain a stable structure to heal the precious metal at high temperatures in a redox environment. Under reductive conditions, the precious metal emerges from the frame- work of the perovskite to form metallic clusters or nano- particles. Under oxidative conditions, the precious metal comes back to the perovskite framework to refresh itself.
The precious metal repeats the cycle of solid-solution and segregation responding to the inherent cycling between an oxidative and a reductive environment. For optimization of the self-regenerative function, it is important to design the valency, the ionic radius, the chemical state, etc. of the catalyst and provide it har- mony of easiness between solid-solution and segrega- tion.
4. Conclusion
1. The advanced intelligent catalysts with the self-
regenerative function of Rh and Pt were developed successfully.
2. From X-ray research, by replacing the perovskite
from La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3, the self-regen- erative function was significantly improved.
3. TEM observations of CaTiRhO3 and CaTiPtO3
showed that the segregated Rh and Pt after reduction were fine (about 13 nm).
4. The universal technology for designing the self-
regenerative intelligent catalyst was able to be pro- posed.
5. This innovative technology is expected not only to
enable further reductions in precious metal use but also to open the way to new applications, such as for diesel catalysts.
