<p>In this study, a remaining big question was replied to.
The question is Is this self-regenerative function the special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows how the amount of Rh, Pt and Pd used for automotive catalysts has increased as a whole over the last decade [9]. In these precious metals,because the demand of Pd rapidly grew for the reason to reduce cold start emissions, our initial development of the self-regenerative function was focused on Pd. As a result, we have been able to realize drastic reductions in Pd consumption for automotive catalysts.</p>
<p>The price of Rh fluctuates markedly and over 85% of the demand for Rh coming from automotive catalyst manufacture. Recently, demand and price for Pt are also increasing gradually, because Pt is very useful for many ways such as diesel catalysts and fuel cell catalysts.</p>
<p>Success in applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst technology to Rh and Pt would have immediate socio-economic results.</p>
<p>X-ray absorption fine structure measurement at SPring-8 was used effectively to solve this question.</p>
<p>The attempt succeeded in the development of A Super Intelligent Catalyst which Rh and Pt, as well as Pd, can be also realized through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal.</p>

This document addresses the question of whether the self-regenerative function is unique to palladium (Pd) or if it can also occur in rhodium (Rh) and platinum (Pt). It confirms that the self-regenerative function is not exclusive to Pd but can also happen to Rh and Pt. The study demonstrates that through the solid solution and segregation in a perovskite crystal, Rh and Pt can achieve similar self-regenerative capabilities as Pd. This finding opens up potential for more efficient and economically beneficial catalysts in automotive emissions control and other applications.

本文件回答了自修复功能是否仅限于钯（Pd），或者铑（Rh）和铂（Pt）是否也能实现该功能的问题。它证实，自修复功能不仅限于Pd，Rh和Pt也能实现类似的功能。研究表明，通过在钙钛矿晶体中的固溶体和分离，Rh和Pt可以实现与Pd相似的自修复能力。这一发现为汽车排放控制和其他应用中更高效、更具经济效益的催化剂提供了可能。
