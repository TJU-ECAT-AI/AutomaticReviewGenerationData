This document discusses the development of intelligent catalysts with self-regenerative functions for precious metals such as palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and platinum (Pt). The authors have focused on the industrialization of these catalysts, particularly for use in automotive emissions reduction. The document also addresses the question of whether the self-regenerative function is exclusive to Pd or if it applies to Rh and Pt as well. Through X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, the researchers have demonstrated that Rh and Pt can indeed exhibit self-regenerative behavior similar to Pd, by forming solid solutions and segregating within perovskite crystals. This development leads to the creation of a 'Super Intelligent Catalyst' that can utilize Rh and Pt alongside Pd for automotive applications. The document further highlights the socio-economic benefits of extending this technology to Rh and Pt, given their growing demand in various industries, such as diesel catalysts and fuel cells. The successful implementation of this technology has led to its commercialization for Japanese SULEV catalysts since December 2005.

本文讨论了对贵金属如钯（Pd）、铑（Rh）和铂（Pt）的智能催化剂自再生功能的工业化。作者们关注了这些催化剂的工业应用，特别是用于汽车排放减少。文档还回答了一个遗留的大问题：自再生功能是否仅限于Pd，还是Rh和Pt也能实现这一功能。通过X射线吸收精细结构测量，研究人员证明了Rh和Pt确实能够像Pd一样，在正交晶系晶体中形成固溶体并发生分离，从而实现自再生行为。这一发展导致了“超级智能催化剂”的创建，该催化剂可以利用Rh、Pt与Pd一起在汽车应用中使用。文档进一步强调了将此技术扩展至Rh和Pt的经济和社会效益，考虑到这两种金属在不同行业（如柴油催化剂和燃料电池）需求的增加。这项技术的成功实施已使其自2005年12月起商业化应用于日本SULEV催化剂。
