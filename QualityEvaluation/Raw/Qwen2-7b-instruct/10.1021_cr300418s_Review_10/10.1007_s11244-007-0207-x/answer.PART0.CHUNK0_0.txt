The study aimed to address the question of whether the self-regenerative function, previously observed in palladium, could also occur in rhodium and platinum. Through the utilization of X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at SPring-8, the researchers successfully developed a super-intelligent catalyst. This catalyst demonstrated that rhodium and platinum could also exhibit self-regenerative behavior through solid solutions and segregation within a perovskite crystal structure, akin to palladium. This achievement paved the way for the application of self-regenerative technology to rhodium and platinum, offering potential socio-economic benefits.

研究旨在回答一个问题，即自再生功能是否仅限于钯，是否也能在铑和铂中观察到。通过在SPring-8上进行X射线吸收精细结构测量，研究人员成功开发了一种超级智能催化剂。该催化剂显示，铑和铂也能够在钙钛矿晶格结构中通过固溶体和分离表现自我再生行为，类似于钯。这一成就为铑和铂应用自再生技术提供了可能，有望带来社会经济效益。
