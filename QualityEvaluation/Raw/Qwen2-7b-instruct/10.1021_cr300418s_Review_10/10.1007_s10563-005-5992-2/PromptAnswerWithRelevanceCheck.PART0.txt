[2] "Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment."
[3] "That is, Pd atoms move back and forth between the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) and the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases."
[4] "As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle."

The self-regenerative function of the palladiumperovskite catalyst allows it to maintain high performance throughout the vehicle's lifetime. This is achieved through the movement of palladium atoms between the lattice sites and as nanoparticles within the perovskite crystal. The function synchronizes with the redox atmospheres found in automotive exhaust gases, ensuring that the growth of palladium nanoparticles is suppressed. This process is described in detail and is shown to occur rapidly across a wide temperature range, as confirmed by X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analyses.

2. Introduction
A catalyst that does not age has been a long-held dream of automotive engineers.
From the viewpoint of intelligent materials, the intelligence of the catalyst may be defined as its ability to maintain a high performance by adapting its structure, responding sensitively to environmental changes.
The important role of the automotive three-way catalyst is widely recognized for the simultaneous conversion of emissions of three pollutants in engine exhaust gases: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC).
The conventional three-way catalyst consists of fine particles of precious metals dispersed on ceramic support materials such as alumina, ceria, or zirconia; however, the catalytic activity of such catalysts deteriorates, owing to the agglomeration and growth of precious-metal particles during use.
An intelligent Pdperovskite catalyst has been developed that has a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regeneration function of Pd nanoparticles.
It has been confirmed that the catalytic activity can be maintained even when the amount of precious metals is reduced by 70-90%.
A vehicle equipped with the intelligent catalyst was supplied to the market and succeeded in achieving the ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV) standard in 2002.
Moreover, the intelligent catalyst has also succeeded in achieving a new super-ultra-low-emission vehicle (SULEV) standard, adopted from January 2004.
The production of clean vehicles equipped with the intelligent catalyst exceeded one million units in January 2005.
By this technology, it not only became possible to achieve a drastic reduction in the cost of catalysts, but also the technology solved the problem of the supply and demand of precious metals for automotive applications, which had caused a negative effect on other industries.
The intelligent catalyst now attracts worldwide attention and provides a new concept for the development of future automotive catalysts.
