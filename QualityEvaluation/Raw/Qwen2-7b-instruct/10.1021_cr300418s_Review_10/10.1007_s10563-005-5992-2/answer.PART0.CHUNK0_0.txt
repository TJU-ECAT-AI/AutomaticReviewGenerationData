[1] "The intelligent catalyst that exhibits a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regenerative function of Pd nanoparticles has been developed."
[2] "Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment."
[3] "That is, Pd atoms move back and forth between the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) and the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases."
[4] "As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle."
[5] "This self-regenerative function provides a new and useful tool for the development of future automotive catalysts."
[6] "The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is described, and it is shown by ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analyses that the self-regenerative function occurs at an extremely high speed over a wide range of temperatures."

The self-regenerative function of the palladiumperovskite catalyst allows it to maintain high performance throughout the vehicle's lifetime. This is achieved through the movement of palladium atoms between the lattice sites and as nanoparticles within the perovskite crystal. The function synchronizes with the redox atmospheres found in automotive exhaust gases, ensuring that the growth of palladium nanoparticles is suppressed. This process is described in detail and is shown to occur rapidly across a wide temperature range, as confirmed by X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analyses.

钯氧化物催化剂的自再生功能使其在整个车辆生命周期内保持高性能。这一功能通过钯原子在晶格点和晶体内的纳米颗粒之间移动实现。该过程与汽车排气气体中发现的还原性和氧化性气氛同步，确保了钯纳米颗粒的生长被抑制。这一过程详细描述，并且通过离线和原位X射线吸收精细结构光谱分析证实，可在广泛的温度范围内以极高的速度发生。
