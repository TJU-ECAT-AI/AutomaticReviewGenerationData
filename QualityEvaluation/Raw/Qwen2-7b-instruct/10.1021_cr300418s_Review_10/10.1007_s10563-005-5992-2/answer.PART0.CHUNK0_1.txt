[1] "Automotive emissions regulations are getting tighter and tighter all over the world."
[2] "In this article, the outline of an intelligent catalyst is described [15]. This catalyst has the ability to regain its catalytic activity,should this deteriorate, without any outside interference."

[5] "The Pdperkovskite catalyst maintained its high activity during aging, whereas the activity of the Pd/alumina catalyst deteriorated by about 10%."
[6] "Detailed analyses were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of suppression of Pd grain growth."
[7] "Binding energies were corrected based on measured values for C1S. The values for Pd0 and Pd2+ were determined by comparison with metallic Pd and PdO, respectively."
[8] "The structure factors for the pseudocubic cell are expressed approximately in the form: F(100) = PfA + fB + fO and F(110) = PfA + fB + fO, where fA, fB, and fO are atomic scattering factors for the A-site, B-site, and oxygen atoms, respectively."
[9] "On the other hand, the cusp of the intensity was not observed for the reduced catalyst, implying that Pd does not occupy any site in the perovskite lattice of the reduced catalyst."

1. The global automotive emissions regulations are becoming increasingly stringent.
2. The intelligent catalyst, capable of restoring its catalytic activity without external intervention, is outlined in the article.
3. The intelligent catalyst garners worldwide attention and introduces a novel approach for future automotive catalyst development.
4. A palladium-containing perovskite catalyst (LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3) was synthesized using the alkoxide method.
5. The Pdperovskite catalyst maintained its high activity during aging, contrasting with a 10% decrease in the activity of the Pd/alumina catalyst.
6. In-depth analyses were conducted to understand how the catalyst suppresses the growth of palladium grains.
7. The binding energies were adjusted using measurements for C1S, and Pd0 and Pd2+ values were compared to metallic Pd and PdO, respectively.
8. The structure factors for the pseudocubic cell are represented as F(100) = PfA + fB + fO and F(110) = PfA + fB + fO, with fA, fB, and fO being atomic scattering factors for the A-site, B-site, and oxygen atoms, respectively.
9. The absence of the intensity peak for the reduced catalyst suggests that palladium does not occupy any site within the perovskite lattice of the reduced catalyst.
