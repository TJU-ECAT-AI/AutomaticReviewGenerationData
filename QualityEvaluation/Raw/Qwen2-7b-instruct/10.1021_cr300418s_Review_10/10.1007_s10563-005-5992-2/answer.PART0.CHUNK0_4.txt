[1] "The importance of the automotive three-way catalyst is widely recognized for the simultaneous conversion of emissions of three pollutants in engine exhaust gases: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC)."
[2] "The conventional three-way catalyst consists of fine particles of precious metals dispersed on ceramic support materials such as alumina, ceria, or zirconia; however, the catalytic activity of such catalysts deteriorates, owing to the agglomeration and growth of precious-metal particles during use."
[3] "An innovative intelligent catalyst that exhibits a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regenerative function of Pd nanoparticles has been developed. Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment."
[4] "That is, Pd atoms move back and forth between the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) and the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases."
[5] "As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle."
[6] "This self-regenerative function provides a new and useful tool for the development of future automotive catalysts."

The self-regenerative function of the palladiumperovskite catalyst allows Pd atoms to move between the inside of the perovskite crystal as cations and the outside as nanoparticles. This movement synchronizes with the fluctuating redox atmospheres in automotive exhaust gases. The cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd prevents the growth of Pd nanoparticles, maintaining high catalytic activity throughout the vehicle's lifetime. This feature provides a valuable tool for developing future automotive catalysts.
