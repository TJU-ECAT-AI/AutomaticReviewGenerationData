[1] "The intelligent catalyst has been developed that has a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regeneration function of Pd nanoparticles."
[2] "Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment."
[3] "As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle."
[4] "This self-regenerative function provides a new and useful tool for the development of future automotive catalysts."
[5] "The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is described, and it is shown by ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analyses that the self-regenerative function occurs at an extremely high speed over a wide range of temperatures."

The self-regenerative function of the palladiumperovskite catalyst allows it to maintain its catalytic activity by undergoing a cycle of solid solution and segregation of palladium nanoparticles within the perovskite crystal. This process, which occurs naturally without external treatment, involves a redox reaction that suppresses the growth of palladium nanoparticles throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. This function provides a novel approach for enhancing the durability of automotive catalysts and is supported by detailed analyses conducted through ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic methods. The self-regenerative mechanism operates efficiently across a broad range of temperatures, ensuring consistent performance under varying environmental conditions.
