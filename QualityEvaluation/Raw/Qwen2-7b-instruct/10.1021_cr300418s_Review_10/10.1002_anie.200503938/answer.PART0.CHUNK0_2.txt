<p>Automotive catalysts deteriorate as a result of a decrease in the active surface area of the precious metals, this is caused by the growth of grains under the inherent redox environment of exhaust gases at high temperatures of up to 1000C.</p>
<p>To compensate for this deterioration, conventional catalysts are loaded with an excess amount of precious metals, although this leads to over-consumption and supply problems.</p>
<p>Self-regenerating catalysts, which suppress the grain growth of precious metals, have recently been successfully developed and are based on the repeated movement of the precious metals in and out of perovskite oxides between a solid solution and metallic nanoparticles during the natural changes in the redox conditions.</p>
<p>The structure of perovskite, which has the generalized formula ABO3, where A is the larger cation and B is the smaller cation, is adaptable and gives rise to materials that have a wide array of properties.</p>
<p>Under oxidizing conditions, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, SrTi0.95Rh0.05O3, BaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3, and CaZr0.95Pt0.05O3 form perfect solid solutions and show a large difference in the proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice during the redox alternations.</p>
<p>The proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice as a solid solution was calculated from the coordination number of the first nearest neighbor with oxygen (PdO, RhO, or PtO bonds).</p>
<p>We have therefore demonstrated that a precious-metal-containing perovskite catalyst can function as an intelligent catalyst that regenerates itself to maintain a high activity in a cycle that involves a solid solution and segregation even in a harsh redox environment at high temperatures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the precious metals Pd, Rh, and Pt can all be used in new self-regenerating catalysts that suppress the grain growth.</p>

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by altering the electronic structure and modifying the surface chemistry of the NiO catalysts. This can lead to improved selectivity and activity for the desired reaction products. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of the catalytic systems, the intricate interactions between niobium oxides and NiO, and the difficulty in accurately modeling the multiscale phenomena involved in the catalytic process. These challenges often stem from the lack of comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the behavior of niobium oxides in these systems, as well as limitations in experimental techniques for characterizing the catalysts under dynamic conditions.
