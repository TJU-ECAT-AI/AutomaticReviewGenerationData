[1] "Automotive catalysts deteriorate as a result of a decrease in the active surface area of the precious metals, this is caused by the growth of grains under the inherent redox environment of exhaust gases at high temperatures of up to 1000C."
[2] "To compensate for this deterioration, conventional catalysts are loaded with an excess amount of precious metals, although this leads to over-consumption and supply problems."
[3] "Self-regenerating catalysts, which suppress the grain growth of precious metals, have recently been successfully developed and are based on the repeated movement of the precious metals in and out of perovskite oxides between a solid solution and metallic nanoparticles during the natural changes in the redox conditions."
[4] "Perovskite, which has the generalized formula ABO3, where A is the larger cation and B is the smaller cation, is adaptable and gives rise to materials that have a wide array of properties."
[5] "The structure factor for the (100) reflection can be expressed approximately in the form: F(100)fAfBfO, where fA, fB, and fO are the atomic scattering factors for the A-site, B-site, and oxygen atoms, respectively."
[6] "The proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice as a solid solution was calculated from the coordination number of the first nearest neighbor with oxygen (PdO, RhO, or PtO bonds) and is given in Figure 3 for various combinations of precious metals with perovskite-type oxides."
[7] "The following considerations are important when designing an intelligent catalyst: the oxide, which makes the perovskite component, should maintain a stable structure so that it can capture and release the precious metal at high temperatures under a redox environment."
[8] "Under reducing conditions, the precious metal emerges from the oxide to form metallic clusters or nanoparticles that demonstrate a higher catalytic activity."
[9] "At the same time, the perovskite oxide releases oxygen and retains its electroneutrality."
[10] "This release of oxygen is detectable by a weight change."
[11] "Under oxidizing conditions, the precious metal and oxygen are reabsorbed into the perovskite oxide."
[12] "The precious metal repeats the cycle of forming a solid solution and segregation as a result of the inherent cycling between an oxidizing and a reducing environment."
[13] "In conclusion, the precious metals Pd, Rh, and Pt can all be used in new self-regenerating catalysts that suppress the grain growth."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the electronic structure and redox properties of the catalyst. The presence of niobium can lead to the formation of mixed-valent centers, which can act as Lewis acids or bases depending on the oxidation state, influencing the adsorption and activation of reactants. However, the challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations often stem from the complexity of the interplay between the dopant's electronic properties, the support material's structure, and the reaction conditions. Theoretical models might struggle to accurately predict the precise electronic effects or the dynamic behavior of dopant species under catalytic conditions, necessitating the development of more sophisticated computational methods or the use of complementary experimental techniques to validate theoretical predictions.

铌氧化物的多种特性，包括它们的不同稳定形式和氧化态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中乙烯氧化脱氢的掺杂剂的行为，通过影响催化剂的电子结构和还原性。铌的存在可能导致形成混合价中心，这些中心根据氧化状态可以作为路易斯酸或碱，影响反应物的吸附和激活。然而，理论预测与实验观察之间的整合挑战往往源于掺杂物的电子性质、支持材料结构和反应条件之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。理论模型可能难以准确预测精确的电子效应或掺杂物物种在催化条件下的动态行为，需要开发更先进的计算方法或使用补充的实验技术来验证理论预测。
