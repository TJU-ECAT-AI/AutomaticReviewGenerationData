[1] "Automotive catalysts deteriorate as a result of a decrease in the active surface area of the precious metals, this is caused by the growth of grains under the inherent redox environment of exhaust gases at high temperatures of up to 1000C."
[2] "To compensate for this deterioration, conventional catalysts are loaded with an excess amount of precious metals, although this leads to over-consumption and supply problems."
[3] "Self-regenerating catalysts, which suppress the grain growth of precious metals, have recently been successfully developed and are based on the repeated movement of the precious metals in and out of perovskite oxides between a solid solution and metallic nanoparticles during the natural changes in the redox conditions."
[4] "The structure of perovskite, which has the generalized formula ABO3, where A is the larger cation and B is the smaller cation, is adaptable and gives rise to materials that have a wide array of properties."
[5] "The self-regenerating properties, perovskite catalysts containing Pd, Rh, or Pt were prepared by the alkoxide method."
[6] "Under oxidizing conditions, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, SrTi0.95Rh0.05O3, BaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3, and CaZr0.95Pt0.05O3 form perfect solid solutions and show a large difference in the proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice during the redox alternations."
[7] "This difference is defined the self-regeneration ratio."
[8] "The Pt grains on alumina grew to over 100 nm, whereas only fine metallic grains about 13 nm in diameter were found on the perovskite surface."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, play a crucial role in influencing their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties enable the materials to adapt to the changing conditions within the catalyst, facilitating the self-regeneration process. This allows the precious metals, such as palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and platinum (Pt), to move in and out of the perovskite oxide lattice between a solid solution and metallic nanoparticles, maintaining their effectiveness despite the inherent redox environment at high temperatures. This self-regeneration mechanism helps suppress the growth of metal grains, preventing the loss of active surface area and ensuring the catalyst's performance remains consistent over time. The perovskite structure, characterized by its adaptable formula ABO3, contributes to the wide range of properties that these materials can exhibit, making them suitable for use in complex catalytic systems like ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations can be challenging due to the intricate nature of these systems and the variability in operational conditions.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们稳定的形态和氧化态，对作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂行为产生了关键影响。这些性质使材料能够适应催化条件的变化，促进自我再生过程。这使得贵金属如钯(Pd)、铑(Rh)和铂(Pt)能够在氧化物晶格中在固溶体和金属纳米粒子之间移动，即使是在高温下具有内在的氧化还原环境。这种自我再生机制有助于抑制金属颗粒的生长，防止活性表面积的损失，确保催化剂性能的一致性。普鲁士蓝结构由其可适应的公式ABO3构成，为这些材料提供了广泛的性质范围，使其适用于复杂催化系统如乙烷氧化脱氢。然而，在理论预测与实验观察之间达成一致可能具有挑战性，因为这些系统的复杂性和操作条件的变异性。
