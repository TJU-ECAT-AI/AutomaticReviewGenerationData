<p>The amount of Rh available from mining is limited, and the supply of Rh has been especially unstable in recent years.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, a technology based on the self-regenerating function of Pd-perovskite was introduced.</p>
<p>In automotive catalysts, Pd shows the biggest deterioration among these precious metals because it has the lowest melting point.</p>
<p>To study the self-regenerating properties, perovskite catalysts containing Pd, Rh, or Pt were prepared by the alkoxide method.</p>
<p>The proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice as a solid solution was calculated from the coordination number of the first nearest neighbor with oxygen (PdO, RhO, or PtO bonds).</p>
<p>The Pt grains on alumina grew to over 100 nm, whereas only fine metallic grains about 13 nm in diameter were found on the perovskite surface.</p>
<p>Although perovskite-type oxides are very useful because of their structural stability and their abundance of combinations, the possibility of using other oxides with different crystal structures cannot be neglected.</p>

The document discusses the development of self-regenerating rhodium (Rh)- and platinum (Pt)-based perovskite catalysts for automotive emissions control. These catalysts are designed to regenerate themselves, potentially allowing for the use of lower amounts of precious metals. The catalysts' self-regenerating function enables the repeated movement of precious metals between a solid solution and metallic nanoparticles within the perovskite oxide matrix, depending on the redox conditions. The authors report that this self-regenerating mechanism is realizable not only for palladium (Pd) but also for Rh and Pt. The goal of these catalysts is to address the increasing demand for precious metals due to their use in automotive catalysts and to mitigate supply issues, especially concerning Pt, which is also utilized in diesel engines and fuel cells. The perovskite structure, characterized by its adaptability and variety of properties, allows for the formation of perfect solid solutions with Rh and Pt, contributing to the catalysts' self-regenerating capabilities. The document also highlights that perovskite catalysts can maintain high activity in a harsh redox environment at high temperatures, acting as "intelligent catalysts." The authors further mention that this technology could extend to diesel after-treatment and pharmaceutical synthesis, potentially solving socio-economic issues related to the supply and demand of precious metals.

文档讨论了用于汽车排放控制的自再生铑（Rh）和铂（Pt）基氧化铅催化剂的发展。这些催化剂旨在自我再生，可能允许使用较少的贵金属。催化剂的自我再生功能使贵金属在氧化铅氧化物矩阵中的固体溶液与金属纳米颗粒之间反复移动，取决于还原环境条件。作者报告称，不仅钯（Pd），而且Rh和Pt也可以实现自我再生机制。这些催化剂的目标是解决由于它们在汽车催化剂中的使用而对贵金属需求增加的问题，并缓解供应问题，特别是关于Pt，它还用于柴油发动机和燃料电池中。氧化铅结构以其适应性和各种性质的特点，允许与Rh和Pt形成完美的固体溶液，从而促进催化剂的自我再生能力。文档还强调，氧化铅催化剂可以在高温下的苛刻还原环境中保持高活性，充当“智能催化剂”。作者进一步提到，这项技术可以扩展到柴油后处理和制药合成，可能解决与贵金属供应和需求相关的社会经济问题。
