[1] "To study the self-regenerating properties, perovskite catalysts containing Pd, Rh, or Pt were prepared by the alkoxide method."
[2] "The proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice as a solid solution was calculated from the coordination number of the first nearest neighbor with oxygen (PdO, RhO, or PtO bonds) and is given in Figure 3 for various combinations of precious metals with perovskite-type oxides."
[3] "Under oxidizing conditions, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, SrTi0.95Rh0.05O3, BaTi0.95Rh0.05O3, CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3, and CaZr0.95Pt0.05O3 form perfect solid solutions and show a large difference in the proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice during the redox alternations."

The document discusses the preparation of perovskite catalysts containing Pd, Rh, or Pt through the alkoxide method. It further explains that under oxidizing conditions, various perovskite catalysts, including those with combinations of precious metals and perovskite-type oxides, form perfect solid solutions. The document also calculates the proportion of precious metal present in the perovskite lattice as a solid solution, which varies depending on the specific perovskite type.
