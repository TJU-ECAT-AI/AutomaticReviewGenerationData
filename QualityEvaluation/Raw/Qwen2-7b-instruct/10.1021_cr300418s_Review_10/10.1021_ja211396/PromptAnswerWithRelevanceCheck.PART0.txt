[1] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[2] "We note that only dopants close to the interface participate in this electron transfer, while near-surface species retain their original charge state due to the large tunneling barrier to the Mo metal."
[3] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, particularly their ability to act as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, significantly influence their behavior. These properties allow for the modification of catalyst activity and selectivity. However, challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations often arise due to the complexity of these systems and the dynamic interactions involved in catalytic processes. Theoretical models may not always accurately capture the intricate mechanisms at play, leading to discrepancies between predicted outcomes and real-world performance.
