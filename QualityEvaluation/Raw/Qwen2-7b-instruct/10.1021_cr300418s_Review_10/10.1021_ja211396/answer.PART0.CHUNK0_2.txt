[1] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[2] "Inserting overvalent Mo species leads to the growth of 2D metal islands that are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions."
[3] "Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants."

1. The study demonstrates that modifying the shape of metal ad-particles can be achieved by doping the oxide support. 
2. By introducing overvalent molybdenum (Mo) species, the researchers observed the formation of 2D metal islands on the surface, which is attributed to an electron transfer process from the impurity ions to stabilize the structure.
3. Codoping with lithium (Li) effectively prevents this charge exchange, as excess electrons are captured by oxygen 2p-type holes formed by the alkali dopants.
4. This leads to the creation of charge-compensated lithium-molybdenum ion pairs, which are incapable of altering the growth behavior of the metal particles.

1. 我们的研究揭示了通过掺杂氧化物支持物来塑造金属吸附粒子形状的可能性。
2. 通过引入过量的钼（Mo）物种，研究人员观察到表面形成2D金属岛屿，这归因于杂质离子向稳定结构的电子转移过程。
3. 与锂（Li）共掺杂有效地阻止了这种电荷交换，因为过剩的电子被由碱性掺杂剂形成的氧2p类型空位捕获。
4. 这导致形成电荷补偿的锂-钼离子对，它们无法改变金属颗粒的生长行为。
