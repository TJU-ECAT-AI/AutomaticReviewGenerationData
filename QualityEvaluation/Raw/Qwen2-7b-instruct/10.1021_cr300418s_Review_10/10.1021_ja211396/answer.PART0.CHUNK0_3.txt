[1] "The formation of monolayer islands is also revealed on various thin-film supports, where a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands reinforces the metaloxide adhesion."
[2] "Inserting 4% of Mo into the CaO matrix changes the particle shapes from 3D to 2D."
[3] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."
[4] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[5] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."
