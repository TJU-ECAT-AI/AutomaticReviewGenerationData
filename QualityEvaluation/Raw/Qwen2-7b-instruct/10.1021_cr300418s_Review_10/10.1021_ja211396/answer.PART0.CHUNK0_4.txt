1. The research demonstrates that oxide doping can be utilized to adjust the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on metal catalyst supports.
2. The presence of Mo dopants in the CaO films has been confirmed through Auger spectroscopy, showing characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy.
3. When the Li content reaches 8%, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions move to higher energies, resulting in VB = 4.0 V and CB = +3.0 V.
4. The aspect ratio of Au islands on CaOMo films at 6.0 V sample bias is (0.07 ± 0.02), indicating that the deposits are akin to a monolayer.
5. The charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs prevent the modification of Au growth behavior.
