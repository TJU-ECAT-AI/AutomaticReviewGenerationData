[1] "Our work demonstrates how oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts."
[2] "For this purpose, we have prepared CaO films of 50 ML thickness via Ca vapor deposition onto a Mo(001) single crystal in 5 × 107 mbar of O2."
[3] "The presence of Mo dopants in the CaO films has been confirmed with Auger spectroscopy, revealing the characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy."
[4] "Adding small amounts of Li to the Mo-doped CaO reinstalls the initial 3D growth regime."
[5] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."

1. The oxide doping technique enables the modification of the equilibrium shape of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts.
2. CaO films were synthesized with a 50 ML thickness through vapor deposition onto a Mo(001) single crystal within 5 × 107 mbar of O2 pressure.
3. The Mo dopants' presence in the CaO films was confirmed through Auger spectroscopy, displaying characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy.
4. Small quantities of Li added to the Mo-doped CaO materials revert the growth pattern back to the initial 3D configuration.
5. The alteration in Au particle geometry on doped CaO films is attributed to charge-transfer phenomena between the dopants and the ad-metal.
