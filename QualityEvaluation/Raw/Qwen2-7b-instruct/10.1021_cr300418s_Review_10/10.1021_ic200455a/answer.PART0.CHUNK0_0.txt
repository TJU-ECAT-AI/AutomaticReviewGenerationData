<p>The title compounds, YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ (0  x  0.07) crystallizing in the noncentrosymmetric YMnO3 structure, were prepared using a solgel process at 800 C, and the structures were refined from high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data.</p>
<p>In contrast to the previously studied complex oxide host compounds, YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ is only modestly tolerant to cycling: repeated redox cycling leads to the formation of PdO, which, on the time-scale of the oxidation cycles, does not reincorporate in the complex oxide lattice.</p>
<p>Both oxidized and reduced samples were tested for the oxidation of CO to CO2 under CO-lean conditions. YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ performs essentially as well as previously studied YFe1xPdxO3δ. The CO oxidation light-off characteristics of the hexagonal hosts are very similar to finely dispersed PdO.</p>

The solgel process was used to prepare YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ at 800°C, and the structures were refined from high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. The compound shows only modest tolerance to redox cycling, leading to the formation of PdO which does not reincorporate into the lattice. The hexagonal hosts, including YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ, perform similarly to finely dispersed PdO in CO oxidation under CO-lean conditions.

在800°C下，使用溶胶过程制备了YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ，并通过高分辨率同步辐射X射线粉末衍射数据进行结构精修。该化合物仅表现出适度的可循环性，导致形成PdO，但该物质不会重新融入晶格中。六角形宿主，包括YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ，在CO稀薄条件下对CO氧化表现出与分散的PdO相似的性能。
