<p>While the platinum group and noble metals are the most oxophobic transition elements, the selection and development of host lattices requires an understanding of the factors that promote stabilization of PGM ions in oxide environments.</p>
<p>The only reported nonperovskite complex oxide redox host for Pd2+ that displays egress/ingress behavior was described by us: metastable hexagonal YFe1xPdxO3δ.</p>
<p>Both oxidized and reduced samples were tested for the oxidation of CO to CO2 under CO-lean conditions. YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ performs essentially as well as previously studied YFe1xPdxO3δ.</p>
<p>Despite evidence that Pd is almost fully dispersed as divalent ions in the host lattice, which is presumably accompanied by the concurrent creation of oxygen vacancies (2 Pd2+:1 VO2), the as-prepared hexagonal materials do not display any significant improvement in catalytic activity as a function of Pd substitution level.</p>
<p>The factors that differentiate YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ from perovskite-type host compounds are discussed, suggesting crystal chemical criteria for selecting other complex oxides that may offer improved efficacy toward redox cycling of the precious metal substituent and catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The study casts light on factors in the solid-state chemistry of precious metal-substituted complex oxides that influence the efficacy of redox cycling of the precious metal, and catalytic performance.</p>

The literature discusses the redox cycling behavior of palladium (Pd) in various complex oxide hosts, including YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 and YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ. The authors explore how the properties of these hosts, such as their crystal structure and the presence of electropositive cations, affect the stability and re-dispersion of Pd ions under redox conditions. They find that YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 can accommodate Pd2+ ions, but the location of Pd within the host lattice is poorly defined. The literature highlights that the hexagonal YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ is less capable of supporting redox cycling behavior compared to YMnO3, leading to the formation of PdO after repeated redox cycles. The authors also note that the hexagonal hosts do not promote the catalytic oxidation of CO by Pd, possibly due to the inability to transport oxygen through the lattice. This study provides insights into the factors influencing the efficacy of redox cycling in precious metal-substituted complex oxides and their catalytic performance.

文献讨论了钯（Pd）在各种复杂氧化物宿主中的氧化还原循环行为，包括YMn0.5Fe0.5O3和YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ。作者探索了这些宿主的性质，如它们的晶体结构和正电性离子的存在，如何影响Pd离子在氧化还原条件下的稳定性和再分散。他们发现YMn0.5Fe0.5O3可以容纳Pd2+离子，但Pd在宿主晶格中的位置定义不明确。文献指出，与YMnO3相比，六方YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ更难以支持氧化还原循环行为，导致经过多次氧化还原循环后形成PdO。作者还注意到，六方宿主无法促进Pd对CO的催化氧化，这可能是因为无法通过晶格运输氧。这项研究提供了有关影响珍贵金属替代复杂氧化物中氧化还原循环效率以及催化性能的因素的见解。
