<p>While the host offers stability to the substituent, the driving force to reincorporate as ions after being expelled as Pd0 nanoparticles appears to be rather low. YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 is notably less effective at reincorporating Pd2+ than hexagonal YFeO3. (18)</p>
<p>It was shown through a combination of density functional modeling and neutron pair distribution function analysis, (17, 80) and more recently using EXAFS, (41) that the vacancy sits adjacent to Pd in the BaCeO3 lattice, leaving Pd square planar next to a five-coordinate square pyramidal Ce. The uncertainty about the local Pd environment in YFeO3 and YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 prevents a direct comparison with BaCeO3.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the hexagonal hosts, consisting of layers of corner-connected trigonal bipyramids, do not present labile oxygen, that is, that the polyhedral connectivity does not accommodate transportation of oxide ions through the lattice.</p>

1. YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 is less effective than hexagonal YFeO3 at reincorporating Pd2+ ions after redox cycling. 
2. In BaCeO3, the oxygen vacancy is adjacent to the Pd atom, leaving Pd in a square planar arrangement next to a five-coordinate square pyramidal Ce. This arrangement cannot be directly compared with the local Pd environment in YFeO3 and YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 due to uncertainties about the local Pd environment in these materials.
3. The hexagonal hosts, made up of layers of corner-connected trigonal bipyramids, are hypothesized to not provide labile oxygen, meaning the polyhedral connectivity does not facilitate the transportation of oxide ions through the lattice.

1.YMn0.5Fe0.5O3在循环氧化还原后，对于再整合Pd2+离子的能力比六方YFeO3低。
2.在BaCeO3中，氧空位位于Pd原子附近，使得Pd以正方形平面排列紧邻一个五坐标正方形锥形Ce。这种排列不能直接与YFeO3和YMn0.5Fe0.5O3中的局部Pd环境进行比较，因为这些材料中局部Pd环境的不确定性。
3.假设六方主体由角连接的三角双锥层组成，不会提供可动的氧，即，多面体连接无法通过晶格传输氧离子。
