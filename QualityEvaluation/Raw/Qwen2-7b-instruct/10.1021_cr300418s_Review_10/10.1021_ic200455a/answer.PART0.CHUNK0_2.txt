<p>While the host offers stability to the substituent, the driving force to reincorporate as ions after being expelled as Pd0 nanoparticles appears to be rather low. YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 is notably less effective at reincorporating Pd2+ than hexagonal YFeO3. (18)</p>
<p>Reoxidation of Pd in YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 requires rather high temperatures and does not lead to complete redispersion of Pd ions, whereas in the case of YFeO3, reoxidation at 500 C is sufficient to fully reincorporate Pd ions in the host.</p>
<p>As-prepared YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ samples show similar light-off temperatures irrespective of the level of Pd substitution, as does YFe1xPdxO3. (18)</p>
<p>However, the extent to which the differing polyhedral connectivities of the hosts promote oxygen mobility may explain the difference in activities as a function of substitution level. Oxide ion conduction occurs in both oxygen-deficient layered perovskites (81) as well as those containing excess oxygen in interstitials, (82) suggesting that the lowered dimensionality of the layered hexagonal materials is not responsible for the low mobility. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of high oxygen mobility (oxide ion conductivity) in oxides that adopt the Be3N2 or related structures containing corner-connected trigonal bipyramids. This is consistent with the hypothesis that YFeO3 and YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 do not promote catalytic oxidation of CO by substituted Pd.</p>

1. YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 is less effective at reincorporating Pd2+ ions compared to hexagonal YFeO3 after redox cycling. Reoxidation of Pd in YMn0.5Fe0.5O3 requires higher temperatures and does not fully redisperse Pd ions, unlike in YFeO3 where reoxidation at 500°C is enough for full reincorporation.

2. As-prepared YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ samples exhibit similar light-off temperatures regardless of the level of Pd substitution, similar to YFe1xPdxO3. 

3. The polyhedral connectivities of the hosts affect the mobility of oxygen ions. Layered perovskites and those with excess oxygen in interstitials demonstrate oxide ion conductivity, indicating that the lower dimensionality of hexagonal materials doesn't explain the low mobility. There are no reports of high oxygen mobility in oxides with Be3N2 or related structures containing corner-connected trigonal bipyramids.

This behavior can be attributed to the differing polyhedral connectivities and oxygen mobility in the hosts, which influence the catalytic activity of Pd in these complex oxides.

1.YMn0.5Fe0.5O3在红氧化循环后对Pd2+离子的重新整合效率低于六角形YFeO3。YMn0.5Fe0.5O3需要更高的温度进行氧化还原，并不能完全重新分散Pd离子，而YFeO3在500°C的氧化还原足以实现完全整合。

2.YMn0.5Fe0.5xPdxO3δ样品在准备时显示出相似的CO氧化光致转换温度，无论Pd的取代程度如何，这与YFe1xPdxO3相同。

3.不同类型的骨架结构对氧离子的迁移能力有影响。层状钙钛矿和含有过量氧的骨架中存在氧离子导电性，表明这些六角形材料的低维性不是解释低迁移性的原因。在具有Be3N2或相关结构，包含角连接三棱锥的骨架中，没有关于高氧移动性的报告。

这种行为可以归因于宿主骨架中不同的多面体连接性和氧迁移性，这影响了Pd在这些复杂氧化物中的催化活性。
