[1] "On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place."
[2] "On reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K."
[3] "Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups since otherwise methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K."
[4] "Water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, which finally stabilises a layer of methoxy."
[5] "STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage."

1. Methanol adsorbs only in molecular form on non-reduced surfaces, hence no formaldehyde production happens.
2. Reduced surfaces enable methanol to form methoxy groups that react to produce formaldehyde at temperatures between 400 K to 550 K.
3. Methoxy groups at room temperature require the absence of hydroxyl groups to stabilize, as their reaction leads to methanol formation, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K.
4. Water formation eliminates all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy.
5. STM images reveal a decrease in surface defect density due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows that increase in density upon methanol dosage.

1. 在非还原表面上，甲醇仅以分子形式吸附，因此不会产生甲醛。
2. 减少表面使甲醇形成甲氧基，该甲氧基在400 K到550 K的温度范围内与氧气反应生成甲醛。
3. 房间温度下的甲氧基仅需要无羟基基团来稳定，因为它们的反应导致甲醇形成，在230至300 K之间脱附。
4. 水形成会消除所有羟基基团从表面，稳定一层甲氧基。
5. STM图像显示由于甲氧基的形成，表面缺陷密度下降，除了垂直于钒酰双行的对缺陷密度增加，这是在甲醇剂量时。
