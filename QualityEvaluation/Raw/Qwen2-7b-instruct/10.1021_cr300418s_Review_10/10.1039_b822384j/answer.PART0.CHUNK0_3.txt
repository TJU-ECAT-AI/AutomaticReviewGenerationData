The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde was studied on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111). Non-reduced surfaces do not produce formaldehyde, while reduced surfaces do. Formaldehyde is produced between 400 K and 550 K without other reaction products. Methanol forms methoxy groups on vanadyl oxygen vacancies. Room temperature dosing leads to full coverage of the adsorption sites with methoxy groups.

在Au(111)支持的V2O5(001)薄膜上研究了甲醇部分氧化到甲醛。未还原的表面不会产生甲醛，而还原的表面会。甲醛在400 K至550 K之间产生，没有其他反应产物。甲醇在范德酰氧基氧空位上形成甲氧基团。室温剂量会导致吸附位点完全覆盖甲氧基团。

[1] "On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place."
[2] "Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups since otherwise methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K."
[3] "Hydroxyl groups can also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which probably desorbs in the same temperature regime."
[4] "If large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, which finally stabilises a layer of methoxy."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
On un-reduced surfaces, methanol only adsorbs in a molecular form, resulting in no formaldehyde production. Methoxy groups can only be stabilized at room temperature when the surface lacks hydroxyl groups, as otherwise they could react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K. Hydroxyl groups can also react with each other to form water, which probably desorbs within the same temperature range. When large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy.

在未还原的表面上，甲醇仅以分子形式吸附，因此不产生甲醛。只有当表面不含羟基时，甲氧基团才能在室温下稳定化，否则它们可能会与羟基反应形成甲醇，该甲醇在230至300 K之间脱附。羟基也可以与其他羟基反应形成水，这可能在相同的温度范围内脱附。当大量甲醇在室温下剂量时，水形成从表面上移除所有羟基，最终稳定一层甲氧基。
