[1] "The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place. On reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed."
[2] "STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage. We attribute this to the promotion of water formation from hydroxyl groups near to a single defect via a reduction of the energy barrier. Water desorption produces another oxygen vacancy so that a vacancy pair results."

The properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of these catalytic systems. The literature suggests that on reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed. Additionally, the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage. This is attributed to the promotion of water formation from hydroxyl groups near to a single defect via a reduction of the energy barrier.

铌氧化物的各种稳定形式和氧化状态对其作为NiO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢的影响显著。在理论上与实验观察之间的平衡因这些催化系统的复杂性而面临挑战。文献表明，在还原表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些团通过在400 K至550 K的温度范围内产生甲醛进行反应。未观察到其他产物。此外，表面缺陷的密度由于甲氧基的形成而减少，除了垂直于钒双行的对缺陷密度的增加，则在甲醇剂量增加后。这被归因于在单个缺陷附近从羟基团促进水形成通过能量壁垒的降低。
