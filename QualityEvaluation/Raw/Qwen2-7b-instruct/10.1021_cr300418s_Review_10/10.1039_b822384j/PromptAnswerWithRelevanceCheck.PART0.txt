[1] "The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced surfaces methanol adsorbs only in molecular form, consequently no formaldehyde production takes place. On reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed."
[2] "STM images show that the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage. We attribute this to the promotion of water formation from hydroxyl groups near to a single defect via a reduction of the energy barrier. Water desorption produces another oxygen vacancy so that a vacancy pair results."

The properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complexity of these catalytic systems. The literature suggests that on reduced surfaces, methanol forms methoxy groups, which react to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed. Additionally, the density of surface defects decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density increases upon methanol dosage. This is attributed to the promotion of water formation from hydroxyl groups near to a single defect via a reduction of the energy barrier.

铌氧化物的各种稳定形式和氧化状态对其作为NiO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢的影响显著。在理论上与实验观察之间的平衡因这些催化系统的复杂性而面临挑战。文献表明，在还原表面上，甲醇形成甲氧基团，这些团通过在400 K至550 K的温度范围内产生甲醛进行反应。未观察到其他产物。此外，表面缺陷的密度由于甲氧基的形成而减少，除了垂直于钒双行的对缺陷密度的增加，则在甲醇剂量增加后。这被归因于在单个缺陷附近从羟基团促进水形成通过能量壁垒的降低。

[3] "Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups since otherwise methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Methanol adsorbs only in molecular form on non-reduced surfaces, hence no formaldehyde production happens.
2. Reduced surfaces enable methanol to form methoxy groups that react to produce formaldehyde at temperatures between 400 K to 550 K.
3. Methoxy groups at room temperature require the absence of hydroxyl groups to stabilize, as their reaction leads to methanol formation, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K.
4. Water formation eliminates all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy.
5. STM images reveal a decrease in surface defect density due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows that increase in density upon methanol dosage.

1. 在非还原表面上，甲醇仅以分子形式吸附，因此不会产生甲醛。
2. 减少表面使甲醇形成甲氧基，该甲氧基在400 K到550 K的温度范围内与氧气反应生成甲醛。
3. 房间温度下的甲氧基仅需要无羟基基团来稳定，因为它们的反应导致甲醇形成，在230至300 K之间脱附。
4. 水形成会消除所有羟基基团从表面，稳定一层甲氧基。
5. STM图像显示由于甲氧基的形成，表面缺陷密度下降，除了垂直于钒酰双行的对缺陷密度增加，这是在甲醇剂量时。

The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is regarded as a prototype reaction for the oxidative dehydrogenation of organic molecules. Vanadium oxides, often supported on other oxides,form an important class of catalysts for partial oxidation reactions.1,2 The activity of vanadia oxidation catalysts is strongly dependent on the metal oxide support.1,3 Since supported oxides are complex systems, detailed understanding of the reaction processes and atomistic mechanisms on these systems is hard to achieve. Studies of simpler systems, such as vanadium oxide single crystals or well-ordered thin films can help to elucidate some of these aspects. Previous studies in this direction include methanol adsorption on sub-monolayer to multilayer vanadia layers on TiO2(110)4,5 and CeO2(111).6,7 For vanadia on TiO2(110) it was shown that (sub)-monolayers of vanadia are active, whereas multilayers of vanadia are inactive.5 This was attributed to the involvement of MOV bonds (where M denotes the metal atom of the supporting metal oxide) in the partial oxidation reaction. Theoretical studies for the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde are presented in ref. 8 and 9.

On un-reduced surfaces, methanol only adsorbs in a molecular form, resulting in no formaldehyde production. Methoxy groups can only be stabilized at room temperature when the surface lacks hydroxyl groups, as otherwise they could react to form methanol, which desorbs between 230 and 300 K. Hydroxyl groups can also react with each other to form water, which probably desorbs within the same temperature range. When large amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface, stabilizing a layer of methoxy.
