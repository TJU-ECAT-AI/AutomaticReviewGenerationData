[1] "The modern gasoline engine has adopted a feedback control system that uses an oxygen sensor for three-way catalysts to function, and the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas component is always fluctuating."
[2] "In the intelligent catalyst, all the precious metals used in automotive catalysts, Pd, Rh and Pt,are always rejuvenated itself into an active state in a rapid fluctuation typically encountered in the exhaust gas from the gasoline engine, and thereby degradation of the catalyst is prevented."
[3] "The intelligent catalyst provides a new material design technology, and it is expected that this technology will contribute considerably to the solution of the supply-and- demand problems of precious metals in the automotive industries."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties allow niobium oxides to alter the electronic structure and surface chemistry of NiO, affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations presents challenges due to the complexity of these interactions. The specific effects depend on factors such as the dopant concentration, the type of niobium oxide used, and the reaction conditions. Despite these challenges, the study of niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts offers opportunities for enhancing the efficiency of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation processes, contributing to the development of cleaner and more sustainable chemical synthesis methods.
