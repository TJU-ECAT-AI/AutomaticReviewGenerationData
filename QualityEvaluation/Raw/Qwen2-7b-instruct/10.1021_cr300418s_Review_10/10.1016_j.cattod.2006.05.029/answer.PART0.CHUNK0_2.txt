<p>The modern gasoline engine has adopted a feedback control system that uses an oxygen sensor for three-way catalysts to function, and the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas component is always fluctuating.</p>
<p>In the intelligent catalyst, all the precious metals used in automotive catalysts, Pd, Rh and Pt,are always rejuvenated itself into an active state in a rapid fluctuation typically encountered in the exhaust gas from the gasoline engine, and thereby degradation of the catalyst is prevented.</p>
<p>The intelligent catalyst provides a new material design technology, and it is expected that this technology will contribute considerably to the solution of the supply-and-demand problems of precious metals in the automotive industries.</p>
<p>The intelligent catalyst is also expected to be an important technology, not only for automobiles, but also for various internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>By further development of this technology, a vehicle that emits an exhaust gas that is cleaner than ambient air could be achieved.</p>
<p>Intelligent catalyst technology is expected to be the key that opens the window for clean air to blow in.</p>

The intelligent catalyst technology enables the self-regeneration of precious metals like Pd, Rh, and Pt, maintaining their high catalytic activity throughout the vehicle's lifetime. This is achieved through the metals' reversible movement between the perovskite crystal structure and metallic nanoparticles, responding to the inherent redox fluctuations in the exhaust gases. The technology provides a new design approach for catalysts, addressing the issue of precious metal supply and demand in automotive applications. It is anticipated to contribute significantly to cleaner air emissions and could extend beyond automotive use to other internal combustion engines. Further development promises vehicles emitting cleaner exhaust than the surrounding air, with intelligent catalyst technology serving as a key enabler for cleaner air.
