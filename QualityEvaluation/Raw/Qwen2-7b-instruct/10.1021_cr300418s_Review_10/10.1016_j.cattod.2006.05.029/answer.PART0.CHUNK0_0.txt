[1] "The perovskite-type oxides are very useful because of their structural stability and the abundance of possible combinations."
[2] "Under reductive conditions, the precious metal emerges from the framework of the perovskite to form metallic clusters or nanoparticles."
[3] "Under oxidative conditions, the precious metal comes back to the perovskite framework to refresh itself."
[4] "The intelligent catalyst is also expected to be an important technology, not only for automobiles, but also for various internal combustion engines."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties lead to a complex interplay between the dopant and the NiO matrix, affecting the overall catalytic activity. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the intricate nature of the dopant-catalyst interactions. This complexity necessitates a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms to optimize the catalyst performance.
