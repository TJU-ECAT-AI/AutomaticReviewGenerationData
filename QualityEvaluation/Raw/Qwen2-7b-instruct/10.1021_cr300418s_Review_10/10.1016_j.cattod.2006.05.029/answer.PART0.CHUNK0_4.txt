<p>In order to explain this unique phenomenon, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was carried out at the bending-magnet beam lines BL01B1 and BL14B1 of the 8- GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8, Japan.</p>
<p>The XAFS spectra were measured near the PdK edge in transmission mode because of the high transmissivity of the X-ray.</p>
<p>This successive treatment creates a separate model for each of the key stages of the evolution of the engine exhaust atmosphere at various temperatures.</p>
<p>The local structure parameters of the first nearest neighbor around the Pd in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 after redox treatments at 800 8C are shown in Table 1 [18].</p>
<p>At first, Pd in the sample oxidized at 800 8C (800-O) occupied the B-site, in the six-fold coordination with oxygen,of the unit formula of ABO3 in the perovskite structure.</p>
<p>Note that the summation of the weight of both the PdPd and PdFe bonds is only 0.64, implying that the deposited metal particle is very small.</p>
<p>For comparison with XAFS, the behavior of surface Pd in the reduction treatment was also analyzed by X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy (XPS).</p>
<p>Specific surface area (SSA) of Pd/Al2O3 was ten times as large as that of LaFePdO3.</p>
<p>That is, the redox changes in Pd that accompany its segregation from the perovskite crystal are faster than the simple reduction from PdO to Pd on alumina.</p>
<p>Here it is proved that the dynamic movements of Pd with the perovskite crystal can respond to the control frequency (1 4 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine.</p>
<p>The XANES spectrum near Rh K-edge for LaFe0.95Rh0.05O3 after each treatment is shown in Fig. 8a, and the calculated radial structure function around Rh is shown in Fig. 8b.</p>
<p>The XANES spectrum near the Rh K-edge for reduced CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3 shifted towards the energy for metallic Rh powder, implying that a greater proportion of Rh segregates and is in the metallic state (Fig. 9a).</p>
<p>All the Pt of CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3 was present as a solid-solution in perovskite in oxidation, segregated to metallic Pt particles in reduction, and the Pt particles were restored in the perovskite framework completely in re-oxidation at 800 8C.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that the precious metals Pd, Rh, and Pt in a Intelligent catalyst move back and forth between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the metallic nanoparticles when exposed to inherent redox fluctuations of the actual engine exhaust, and thus the catalytic activity is maintained during the lifetime of a vehicle (Fig. 12).</p>

The literature discusses the self-regenerative function of precious metals, such as Pd, Rh, and Pt, in automotive catalysts. These metals can move between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the metallic nanoparticles when exposed to the inherent redox fluctuations in the engine exhaust. This movement helps maintain the catalytic activity of the catalyst during the vehicle's lifetime. The literature also examines the behavior of these metals in perovskite catalysts and how they respond to redox changes. It includes XAFS analysis to understand the structure of the catalysts and XPS to analyze the surface properties of the metals. The study shows that the precious metals can regenerate themselves in a rapid fluctuation typical of the exhaust gas from gasoline engines, preventing degradation of the catalyst. The self-regenerative function of these metals in the perovskite catalysts contributes to the maintenance of high activity and longevity of the catalysts.
