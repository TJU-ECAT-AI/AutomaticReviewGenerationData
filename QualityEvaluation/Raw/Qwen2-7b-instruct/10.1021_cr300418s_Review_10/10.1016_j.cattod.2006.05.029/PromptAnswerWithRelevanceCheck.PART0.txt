The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. These properties allow niobium oxides to alter the electronic structure and surface chemistry of NiO, affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations presents challenges due to the complexity of these interactions. The specific effects depend on factors such as the dopant concentration, the type of niobium oxide used, and the reaction conditions. Despite these challenges, the study of niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts offers opportunities for enhancing the efficiency of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation processes, contributing to the development of cleaner and more sustainable chemical synthesis methods.

The self-regenerative function of the intelligent catalyst allows it to maintain high activity by regenerating itself through the movement of precious metals between the B-site in the perovskite structure and metallic nanoparticles in response to inherent redox fluctuations in the exhaust gas. This function enables the catalytic activity to be sustained throughout the vehicle's lifetime, even with a reduced amount of precious metals. The perovskite catalysts containing palladium, rhodium, and platinum demonstrate this self-regenerative property, which provides a new tool for designing future catalyst technologies. The catalysts have been successfully implemented in vehicles, achieving the Japanese Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (J-ULEV) standard in 2002 and the new Super-Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (J-SULEV) standard in 2004. The development aims to reduce the use of palladium in automotive industries, aligning the demand for precious metals with their natural source ratios. The catalysts have been studied using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, which revealed that the movement of palladium between the perovskite structure and metallic nanoparticles is reversible and responds to redox fluctuations. In situ measurements have shown that the catalysts can respond to the control frequency of gasoline engine exhaust gases. The self-regenerative function is not limited to palladium, as similar properties have been observed in catalysts containing rhodium and platinum. These findings suggest that the self-regenerative function can be extended to various catalyst technologies, potentially solving supply-demand issues for precious metals in automotive applications. The technology is expected to contribute to cleaner air emissions and could be applicable beyond automobiles to various internal combustion engines. Further development of this technology may lead to vehicles emitting exhaust gases cleaner than ambient air. The intelligent catalyst technology represents a significant advancement in material design and is anticipated to play a crucial role in addressing the socioeconomic problem related to the supply and demand for precious metals.
