[1] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."
[2] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution."
[3] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
[4] "The key component for this excellent catalytic behavior seems to be the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping NiO with Nb. Even small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to a very efficient ODH material."

1. NiO contains cationic vacancies capable of holding large quantities of electrophilic oxygen radicals, which are powerful oxidizers responsible for the complete oxidation of ethane to CO2 on the NiO surface.
2. Nb ions have suitable ionic radii to fill the cationic vacancies and replace nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, creating a NiNb solid solution.
3. This substitution process likely reduces the nonstoichiometry and cationic defects on the surface, decreasing the unselective oxygen species and boosting ethane oxidative dehydrogenation activity.
4. Introducing even small amounts of Nb in NiO transforms it from a total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature ODH catalyst, producing ethylene with a yield of 46% at 400°C.

1.NiO包含可以容纳大量电磷亲性氧自由基的阳离子空位，这些自由基是负责在NiO表面完全氧化乙烷至CO2的强氧化剂。
2.Nb离子具有合适的离子半径，可以填充阳离子空位并替换NiO晶格中的镍原子，形成NiNb固溶体。
3.这个取代过程很可能减少了表面的非等价性和阳离子缺陷，减少了不选择性的氧物种，从而提高了乙烷氧化脱氢活性。
4.即使只添加少量Nb到NiO中，也能将其从全氧化催化剂转变为高效的低温ODH催化剂，在400°C时产生乙烯的产率为46%。
