[1] "NiNbO mixed oxides prove to be highly active and selective catalytic materials for the production of ethene via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, exhibiting an overall ethylene yield of 46% at 400 C."
[2] "The key component for this excellent catalytic behavior seems to be the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping NiO with Nb. Even small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to a very efficient ODH material."
[3] "Based on this observation, we postulate that nickel centers constitute the reactive sites for the activation of alkane, whereas niobium seems to mainly affect the selectivity pattern modifying the route of the reaction from total to selective oxidation to olefin."
[4] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1. NiNbO mixed oxides demonstrate high potential as catalytic materials for the production of ethene through ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving an overall ethylene yield of 46% at 400°C. 
2. The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide (NiO) forms a NiNb solid solution, which converts NiO from a total oxidation catalyst into an efficient catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 
3. The active sites for alkane activation are believed to be nickel centers, while niobium influences the selectivity pattern, shifting the reaction pathway from total to selective oxidation towards olefin formation. 
4. The enhancement of ethene selectivity in NiNbO mixed oxides is attributed to the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by the niobium doping.

1.NiNbO复合氧化物在通过乙烷氧化脱氢制备乙烯方面显示出巨大的潜力，能够在400°C时获得46%的整体乙烯产率。
2. 将铌引入镍氧化物（NiO）中形成NiNb固溶体，将NiO从总氧化催化剂转化为高效的乙烷氧化脱氢催化剂。
3. 认为烷烃活化的作用中心是镍中心，而铌主要影响选择性模式，改变反应路径从总氧化向烯烃氧化转变。
4. NiNbO复合氧化物中乙烯选择性的提高归因于铌掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除。
