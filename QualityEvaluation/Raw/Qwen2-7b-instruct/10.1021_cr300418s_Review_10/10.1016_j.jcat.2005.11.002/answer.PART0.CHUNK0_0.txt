[1] "An optimum in the catalytic behavior is achieved for the catalyst containing Nb/Ni in an intermediate ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), which exhibits the highest per weight activity and selectivity to ethylene (90%)."
[2] "Electronically, the dissolution of heterovalent ions in the lattice of a host oxide creates free charge carriers (electrons or holes) to maintain electrical neutrality."
[3] "The introduction of Nb in NiO converts nickel oxide from an effective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature ODH catalyst, producing ethylene with a yield of 46% at 400 C."
[4] "The surface composition of the catalysts, determined by XPS, indicates that the relative exposure of nickel and niobium on the surface is constant irrespective of the nominal Nb/Ni ratio, with the exception of the highest-Nb content catalyst, probably due to the high inhomogeneity and extended segregation of the two phases detected on this sample."

1. An intermediate Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 leads to the best catalytic performance, showing the highest activity and ethylene selectivity (90%) among the catalysts tested.
2. In the host oxide lattice, the insertion of heterovalent ions generates free charge carriers (electrons or holes) to ensure electrical neutrality.
3. The addition of niobium to nickel oxide transforms it into an efficient catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation at low temperatures, yielding ethylene with a 46% conversion rate at 400°C.
4. The surface composition of the catalysts, analyzed by XPS, reveals a consistent exposure of nickel and niobium across different Nb/Ni ratios, except for the catalyst with the highest niobium content, which may be influenced by its high inhomogeneity.

1. 在0.176的Nb/Ni比例下，催化剂表现出最佳的催化性能，具有最高的活性和90%的乙烯选择性。
2. 在宿氧化物晶格中，异价离子的插入产生自由电荷载体（电子或空穴）以保持电气中性。
3. 将铌添加到镍氧化物中将其转化为在低温下高效乙烷氧化脱氢催化剂，400°C时可将乙烷转化成46%的乙烯。
4. XPS分析显示催化剂的表面组成，在不同的Nb/Ni比例下，镍和铌的表面暴露一致，除了含铌量最高的催化剂，可能受到其高非均匀性和相分离的影响。
