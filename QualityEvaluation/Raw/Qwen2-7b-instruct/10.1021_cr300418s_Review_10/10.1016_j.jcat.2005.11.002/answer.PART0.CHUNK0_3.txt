[1] "NiNbO mixed oxides prove to be highly active and selective catalytic materials for the production of ethene via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, exhibiting an overall ethylene yield of 46% at 400 C."
[2] "In comparison with the alumina-supported NiNb mixed oxide catalyst recently presented in one of our previous work [13], the binary NiNbO mixed oxides exhibit an impressive improvement (160%) in ethene yield."
[3] "The key component for this excellent catalytic behavior seems to be the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping NiO with Nb. Even small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to a very efficient ODH material."
[4] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.NiNbO mixed oxides are highly effective catalysts for producing ethene through ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving a 46% ethylene yield at 400°C.
2.Compared to the alumina-supported NiNb mixed oxide catalyst from our previous study, the binary NiNbO mixed oxides show a significant enhancement of 160% in ethene yield.
3.The main factor contributing to the superior catalytic performance of NiNbO mixed oxides is the formation of a NiNb solid solution when niobium is added to nickel oxide. Even tiny amounts of niobium can transform nickel oxide into a highly efficient oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst.
4.It is highly probable that the reduction of nonstoichiometric oxygen by niobium doping is the key factor behind the high ethene selectivity displayed by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

1.NiNbO复合氧化物是通过乙烷氧化脱氢制取乙烯的有效催化剂，在400°C时可实现46%的乙烯产率。
2.与我们之前研究中所报道的以氧化铝为载体的NiNb复合氧化物催化剂相比，二元NiNbO复合氧化物在乙烯产率上表现出显著的提高（160%）。
3.NiNbO复合氧化物展现出优越催化性能的主要原因是通过铌掺杂将镍氧化物转化为NiNb固溶体。即使是微量的铌也能使镍氧化物转变为一种高效的氧化脱氢催化剂。
4.高度可能的是，通过铌掺杂减少非化学计量氧是NiNbO复合氧化物展现出高乙烯选择性的关键因素。
