[1] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."
[2] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[3] "Therefore, Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence [25] for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
[4] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1. NiO possesses cationic vacancies allowing it to hold significant quantities of electrophilic oxygen radicals, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 on the NiO surface.
2. By substituting nickel atoms or filling cationic vacancies in the defective NiO surface, niobium reduces the nonstoichiometry and the electrophilic oxygen species on the surface, thereby minimizing the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.
3. Nb doping decreases the electrical conductivity of NiO in accordance with the controlled valence principle, which signifies that Nb acts as an electron donor, decreasing the concentration of positive holes in the NiO lattice.
4. The substantial reduction of nonstoichiometric oxygen through Nb doping is the primary reason for the high ethene selectivity shown by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

1.NiO具有空位，可以容纳大量的亲电氧自由基，这些是NiO表面发生全氧化作用于CO2的强氧化剂。
2.通过替换镍原子或填充非等价NiO表面的空位，铌减少了非等价性并减少了表面的亲电氧物种，从而最小化了乙烷的全氧化为二氧化碳。
3. Nb掺杂降低了NiO的电导率，遵循了控制价原理，这表明Nb作为电子供体，降低了NiO晶格中正离子空穴的浓度。
4.通过Nb掺杂显著减少的非等价氧是NiNbO复合氧化物展现出高乙炔选择性的主要原因。
