Applied Catalysis A: General 389 (2010) 155164

Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a significant industrial impact because it upgrades low cost feedstock into valu- able olefins [13].

Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [13]. 

Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11].

Catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UVvis (ultra violet visible), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR).

The catalysts were synthesized via the supramolecular templating technique.

Depending on loading, chromium species occurred as two surface species each possessing one short terminal Cr O (mono oxo) bond and polymeric species.

The surface chromium species occurred in two chemical states as Cr(VI) and Cr(III).

Adsorption of ethane and propane on 9CrAl catalyst revealed the presence of various surface species such as acetaldehyde/acetone, acetate and formate.

Regenerated catalysts exhibited lower activity than the corresponding fresh catalysts.

During alkane dehydrogenation a portion of chromium species is converted to inaccessible Cr(III) species. These inactive Cr(III) could not be converted to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of industrial applications and research focus areas. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes, upgrading low-cost feedstock into valuable olefins. Key areas of focus include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, studying promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. Research on chromium oxide catalysts has concentrated on enhancing their activity, selectivity, and the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions during alkane dehydrogenation. The structure-reactivity relationship is a significant focus, with attention given to the nature and distribution of surface chromium species, which are strongly dependent on the nature of the oxide support and chromium content.

3. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly supported chromium oxide catalysts, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their effectiveness in this industrial process. Studies have shown that these catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation, likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous materials.

4. Detailed characterization techniques like N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UVvis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction are utilized to understand the catalyst's properties and behavior during dehydrogenation.

5. The synthesis of the catalysts often involves innovative methods such as the supramolecular templating technique, which helps in creating materials with specific properties, including high surface area and mesoporous structures.

6. Surface chromium species on these catalysts are found to exist in two forms: surface accessible sites and buried subsurface species. The presence of one short terminal Cr O (mono oxo) bond and polymeric species indicates the complex nature of these species.

7. Chromium species on the catalyst surface occur in two chemical states, Cr(VI) and Cr(III), which influence the catalyst's performance and stability.

8. During the adsorption of ethane and propane onto the catalyst, various surface species like acetaldehyde, acetone, acetate, and formate are identified, highlighting the role of these species in the dehydrogenation reaction.

9. After the first cycle of reaction, the catalysts' activity decreases upon regeneration, indicating that a portion of the active sites gets deactivated irreversibly. This is associated with the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species, which cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.
