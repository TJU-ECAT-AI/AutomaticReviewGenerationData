The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstocks into valuable olefins, particularly through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on developing catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts, especially those supported on alumina, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation. The nature of surface chromium, strongly dependent on the oxide support and chromium content, determines the catalytic activity. The presence of two surface species with one short terminal Cr O bond and polymeric species indicates the dispersion of chromium oxide. The surface chromium is found in two chemical states, Cr(III) and Cr(VI), which influence the catalytic performance. Adsorption studies reveal the formation of acetaldehyde, acetone, formate, and acetate species, followed by detection of acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species during dehydrogenation. Increasing chromia loading enhances alkane dehydrogenation activity. However, regenerated catalysts exhibit lower activity compared to fresh catalysts, suggesting some deactivation is irreversible. Detailed characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts points to the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species as the reason for permanent loss of activity.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their initial discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstocks into valuable olefins through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on understanding the catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. 

2. Chromium oxide catalysts show enhanced dehydrogenation activity with increased chromia loading, up to the monolayer coverage level (approximately 4 Cr/nm²). However, the activity plateaus or decreases beyond this point.

3. The activity of regenerated catalysts is lower than that of fresh catalysts, indicating a permanent loss of activity. This suggests that a portion of active sites becomes deactivated irreversibly during the dehydrogenation process.

4. Detailed characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts reveals that the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation is responsible for the permanent loss of activity. These inactive Cr(III) species cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during regeneration.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstock into valuable olefins through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on understanding catalyst structures, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts, when subjected to alkane dehydrogenation, exhibit distinct behavior depending on the loading of chromium oxide (chromia). Chromium is predominantly found in two surface species on the catalyst, each featuring a single short terminal Cr-O bond and polymeric species. 

3. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) studies on ethane and propane adsorption reveal the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate, and acetate species. These findings suggest that alkoxide species (ethoxide and isopropoxide) are formed initially through hydrogen abstraction from ethane or propane, which is the first step in the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. During alkane dehydrogenation, acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species are detected, indicating the progression of the dehydrogenation reaction on the catalyst surface. 

5. When compared to chromia-silica catalysts, chromia-alumina catalysts do not fully recover their activity upon oxidative regeneration. This suggests that a portion of the active sites becomes permanently deactivated, possibly due to the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species that cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.

2. 根据铬氧化物负载的不同，当铬氧化物催化剂参与烷烃脱氢时，铬主要存在于两种表面物种上，每种物种都包含一个短末端Cr-O键和聚合物种。

3. 原位差分反射傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFT）研究发现，乙烷和丙烷吸附后形成吸附的乙醛、丙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐物种。这些发现表明，通过从乙烷或丙烷中提取氢形成的醇盐（乙醇盐和异丙醇盐）是脱氢反应的第一步。

4. 在烷烃脱氢过程中，检测到乙酸盐/羧酸盐和碳氢化合物物种，这表明脱氢反应在催化剂表面上进展。

5. 相比于含铬氧化硅催化剂，含铬氧化铝催化剂在氧化再生后并未完全恢复其活性。这表明一部分活性位点永久性失活，可能是因为形成了无法在再生过程中转化为更高氧化状态的不可达Cr(III)物种。

Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a significant industrial impact because it upgrades low cost feedstock into valu- able olefins [13].

Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [13]. 

Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11].

Catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UVvis (ultra violet visible), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR).

The catalysts were synthesized via the supramolecular templating technique.

Depending on loading, chromium species occurred as two surface species each possessing one short terminal Cr O (mono oxo) bond and polymeric species.

The surface chromium species occurred in two chemical states as Cr(VI) and Cr(III).

Adsorption of ethane and propane on 9CrAl catalyst revealed the presence of various surface species such as acetaldehyde/acetone, acetate and formate.

Regenerated catalysts exhibited lower activity than the corresponding fresh catalysts.

During alkane dehydrogenation a portion of chromium species is converted to inaccessible Cr(III) species. These inactive Cr(III) could not be converted to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.

They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes, upgrading low-cost feedstock into valuable olefins. Key areas of focus include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, studying promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. Research on chromium oxide catalysts has concentrated on enhancing their activity, selectivity, and the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions during alkane dehydrogenation. The structure-reactivity relationship is a significant focus, with attention given to the nature and distribution of surface chromium species, which are strongly dependent on the nature of the oxide support and chromium content.

3. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly supported chromium oxide catalysts, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their effectiveness in this industrial process. Studies have shown that these catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation, likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous materials.

4. Detailed characterization techniques like N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UVvis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction are utilized to understand the catalyst's properties and behavior during dehydrogenation.

5. The synthesis of the catalysts often involves innovative methods such as the supramolecular templating technique, which helps in creating materials with specific properties, including high surface area and mesoporous structures.

6. Surface chromium species on these catalysts are found to exist in two forms: surface accessible sites and buried subsurface species. The presence of one short terminal Cr O (mono oxo) bond and polymeric species indicates the complex nature of these species.

7. Chromium species on the catalyst surface occur in two chemical states, Cr(VI) and Cr(III), which influence the catalyst's performance and stability.

8. During the adsorption of ethane and propane onto the catalyst, various surface species like acetaldehyde, acetone, acetate, and formate are identified, highlighting the role of these species in the dehydrogenation reaction.

9. After the first cycle of reaction, the catalysts' activity decreases upon regeneration, indicating that a portion of the active sites gets deactivated irreversibly. This is associated with the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species, which cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.
