The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstocks into valuable olefins, particularly through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on developing catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts, especially those supported on alumina, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation. The nature of surface chromium, strongly dependent on the oxide support and chromium content, determines the catalytic activity. The presence of two surface species with one short terminal Cr O bond and polymeric species indicates the dispersion of chromium oxide. The surface chromium is found in two chemical states, Cr(III) and Cr(VI), which influence the catalytic performance. Adsorption studies reveal the formation of acetaldehyde, acetone, formate, and acetate species, followed by detection of acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species during dehydrogenation. Increasing chromia loading enhances alkane dehydrogenation activity. However, regenerated catalysts exhibit lower activity compared to fresh catalysts, suggesting some deactivation is irreversible. Detailed characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts points to the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species as the reason for permanent loss of activity.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展在结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解方面取得了进展。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢过程升级低成本原料以制备有价值的烯烃。研究重点集中在开发具有高活性、选择性和抑制热裂解反应能力的催化剂上。特别是那些以氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物催化剂广泛用于烷烃脱氢。表面铬的性质依赖于氧化物支持和铬含量，决定了催化活性。存在两种表面物种，每个物种具有一个短末端Cr O键和聚合物物种，表明铬氧化物的分散。表面铬存在于两种化学状态Cr(III)和Cr(VI)，影响催化性能。吸附研究表明形成了乙醛、丙酮、碳酸盐和丙酸盐物种，随后在脱氢过程中检测到乙酸盐/羧基和碳氢化合物物种。增加铬含量提高了烷烃脱氢活性。然而，再生催化剂的活性低于新鲜催化剂，表明部分失活是不可逆的。对耗尽和再生催化剂的详细表征指出，在脱氢过程中形成亚表面Cr(III)物种是永久性失活的原因。
