1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstock into valuable olefins through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on understanding catalyst structures, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts, when subjected to alkane dehydrogenation, exhibit distinct behavior depending on the loading of chromium oxide (chromia). Chromium is predominantly found in two surface species on the catalyst, each featuring a single short terminal Cr-O bond and polymeric species. 

3. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) studies on ethane and propane adsorption reveal the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate, and acetate species. These findings suggest that alkoxide species (ethoxide and isopropoxide) are formed initially through hydrogen abstraction from ethane or propane, which is the first step in the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. During alkane dehydrogenation, acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species are detected, indicating the progression of the dehydrogenation reaction on the catalyst surface. 

5. When compared to chromia-silica catalysts, chromia-alumina catalysts do not fully recover their activity upon oxidative regeneration. This suggests that a portion of the active sites becomes permanently deactivated, possibly due to the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species that cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process.

1. 自1933年以来，含铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢过程升级低成本原料以生成有价值的烯烃。研究重点集中在理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、优化支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。

2. 根据铬氧化物负载的不同，当铬氧化物催化剂参与烷烃脱氢时，铬主要存在于两种表面物种上，每种物种都包含一个短末端Cr-O键和聚合物种。

3. 原位差分反射傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFT）研究发现，乙烷和丙烷吸附后形成吸附的乙醛、丙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐物种。这些发现表明，通过从乙烷或丙烷中提取氢形成的醇盐（乙醇盐和异丙醇盐）是脱氢反应的第一步。

4. 在烷烃脱氢过程中，检测到乙酸盐/羧酸盐和碳氢化合物物种，这表明脱氢反应在催化剂表面上进展。

5. 相比于含铬氧化硅催化剂，含铬氧化铝催化剂在氧化再生后并未完全恢复其活性。这表明一部分活性位点永久性失活，可能是因为形成了无法在再生过程中转化为更高氧化状态的不可达Cr(III)物种。
