[1] "Depending on chromia loading, chromium was found to be present essentially as two surface species, each possessing one short terminal Cr O bond and polymeric species."
[2] "Investigation of ethane and propane adsorption by in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFT) revealed the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate and acetate."
[3] "Under otherwise the same conditions, the alkane dehydrogenation activity increased with increasing chromia loading."
[4] "The activity of regenerated catalysts was found to be lower than the corresponding fresh catalysts, suggesting that the deactivation is partly permanent."
[5] "Detailed characterization studies of spent and regenerated catalysts indicated that the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation may be the reason for the permanently lost activity."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their initial discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include upgrading low-cost feedstocks into valuable olefins through dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on understanding the catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. 

2. Chromium oxide catalysts show enhanced dehydrogenation activity with increased chromia loading, up to the monolayer coverage level (approximately 4 Cr/nm²). However, the activity plateaus or decreases beyond this point.

3. The activity of regenerated catalysts is lower than that of fresh catalysts, indicating a permanent loss of activity. This suggests that a portion of active sites becomes deactivated irreversibly during the dehydrogenation process.

4. Detailed characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts reveals that the formation of inaccessible Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation is responsible for the permanent loss of activity. These inactive Cr(III) species cannot be converted back to higher oxidation states during regeneration.

1. 自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂经历了显著的发展。关键的工业应用包括通过脱氢过程升级低成本原料为有价值的烯烃。研究重点集中在理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、优化支持材料、探索促进剂效果以及阐明反应机制。

2. 随着铬氧化物负载量的增加，催化剂的脱氢活性会增强，直到达到单分子层覆盖水平（大约4 Cr/nm²）。然而，在此之后，活性可能会停滞或下降。

3. 再生催化剂的活性低于新鲜催化剂，表明存在永久性失活。这表明部分活性位点在脱氢过程中不可逆地失活。

4. 对使用过的和再生后的催化剂进行详细的表征揭示了脱氢过程中形成不可访问的Cr(III)物种是导致活性永久损失的原因。这些无活性的Cr(III)物种在再生过程中无法转化为更高的氧化状态。
