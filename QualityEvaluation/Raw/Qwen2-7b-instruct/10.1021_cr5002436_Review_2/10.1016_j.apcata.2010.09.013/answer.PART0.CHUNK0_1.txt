[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a significant industrial impact because it upgrades low cost feedstock into valu- able olefins [13]. Nowadays, dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and iso-butane has become an important route to meet the increas- ing demand for light olefins."
[2] "The catalytic activity is related to the nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly depen- dent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content [4,5]."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly impacted industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts are crucial for upgrading low-cost feedstocks into valuable olefins. The activity of these catalysts, especially surface chromium species, depends heavily on the nature of the oxide support and chromium content. Surface chromium can exist in monomeric, polymeric forms, or a combination, based on the loading. The authors of the document discuss the importance of understanding the structure-reactivity relationships and active sites in these catalysts. Detailed studies of spent and regenerated catalysts reveal that the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation reactions might lead to permanently lost activity, which is a significant focus area in the research.

自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂在工业应用中经历了显著的发展，特别是在脱氢化过程中。这些催化剂对于升级低成本原料为有价值的烯烃具有重要意义。这些催化剂的活性，尤其是表面铬物种，强烈依赖于氧化物支持物的性质和铬含量。根据负载量，表面铬可以以孤立的单体物种、聚合物种或二者的组合形式存在。作者讨论了理解催化剂结构反应性关系和活性位点的重要性。对使用过的和再生催化剂的详细研究表明，在脱氢化反应过程中形成亚表面Cr(III)物种可能是永久性失活的原因，这是研究的一个重要焦点领域。
