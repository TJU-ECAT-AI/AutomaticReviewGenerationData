[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."
[2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."

Vanadium oxide catalysts, when supported on oxide supports like alumina, titania, silica, etc., have been widely utilized in commercial applications for oxidation reactions. These include the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Their distinct physical and chemical properties make them particularly effective for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions compared to other metal oxide catalysts.

当用氧化物支持（如氧化铝、二氧化钛、二氧化硅等）支撑时，钒氧化物催化剂在商业应用中被广泛用于氧化反应。这些应用包括选择性氧化邻二甲苯为邻苯二甲酸酐、烷基芳烃的氨氧化、选择性催化还原NOx与氨，以及在选择性催化还原（SCR）过程中控制二氧化硫氧化为三氧化硫。它们独特的物理和化学性质使得它们在烃类氧化反应中比其他金属氧化物催化剂更有效。

[1] "The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites."
[2] "Furthermore, the reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdena and chromia catalysts [103,104]."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The increased surface density of surface vanadia species enhances the number of catalytically active sites and reduces unintended side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Moreover, the reactivity per site, specifically the turnover frequency (TOE) for surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions, is often notably higher than that over supported molybdenum and chromium oxide catalysts [103,104].

表面钒氧化物种的更高表面密度增加了催化活性位点的数量，并减少了暴露于氧化物支撑位点的非期望副反应。此外，在氧化反应中，表面钒氧化物种的单个位点的反应活性，即周转频率（TOE），通常明显高于支持的钼或铬氧化物催化剂 [103,104]。

[1] "Comparison of the molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."
[2] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[3] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
[4] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing the molecular structural details with their respective reactivity/selectivity profiles has shed light on the reactivity characteristics of surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond doesn't seem to significantly impact the reactivity of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. While the bridging V-O-V bond may not influence many oxidation reactions, for those that might be affected by this bridging bond, the turnover frequency (TOF) could increase by merely an order of magnitude. Conversely, the bridging V-O-support bond is deemed the most crucial connection, as alterations in its properties can dramatically affect the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by up to four orders of magnitude.

将分子结构信息与相应的反应活性/选择性信息进行比较，为了解表面钒氧化物种的反应特性提供了见解。末端V=O键似乎并未对表面钒氧化物种在烃类氧化反应中的活性产生显著影响。对于可能受此桥接键影响的那些反应，转盘频率（TOF）仅可能增加一个数量级。然而，连接V-O-支持键被认为是最重要的连接，因为其性质的变化可以极大地改变烃类氧化反应的TOF达四个数量级。
