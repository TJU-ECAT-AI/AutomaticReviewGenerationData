[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."
[2] "These supported vanadium oxide catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts."
[3] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are dynamic and are strongly dependent on the environment (oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture and temperature)."

[5] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[6] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF."
[7] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts incorporate a vanadium oxide phase onto the surface of oxide supports like Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, etc. They are widely used as oxidation catalysts in industry.

2. The molecular structures of the surface vanadium oxide species are responsive to the environment, including oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture, and temperature.

3. Calcined supported vanadium oxide catalysts predominantly contain V(5+) species, with only minor amounts of V(4+) species.

4. The terminal oxygen in the V=O bond doesn't seem to significantly impact the reactivity of the surface vanadium oxide species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

5. The bridging V-O-support bond is crucial for the oxygen required in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, as altering the oxide support phase markedly affects the reaction rate.

6. Neither the specific phase of the oxide support nor the specific preparation method influences the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadium oxide species.

7. The number of surface vanadium oxide sites needed for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction varies depending on the specific reactant molecule involved.
