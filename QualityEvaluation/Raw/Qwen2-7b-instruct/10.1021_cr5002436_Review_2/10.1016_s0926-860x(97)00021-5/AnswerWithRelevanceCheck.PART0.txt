          [1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."
          [2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."

          Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are characterized by a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of oxide supports such as Al2O3, TiO2, and SiO2. These catalysts have found extensive commercial use in oxidation processes, including the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx using NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The higher surface density of vanadia species leads to an increased number of catalytic active sites, thereby reducing unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Comparative studies between molecular structure and reactivity/selectivity information offer insights into the properties of surface vanadia species. These catalysts exhibit unique characteristics among supported metal oxide catalysts, with bulk vanadia having a weaker acidic nature compared to other transition metal oxides, which may minimize unwanted side reactions. The role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support bonds has been explored, with the bridging V-O-support bond being crucial for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The specific phase of the oxide support and the preparation method do not significantly affect the molecular structure or reactivity of surface vanadia species, and the number of surface vanadia sites required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is determined by the specific reactant molecule involved.

          支持的钒氧化物催化剂在氧化铝、二氧化钛和二氧化硅等氧化物支持的表面上含有钒氧化物相。这些催化剂在氧化过程中的广泛应用包括选择性氧化对甲苯到邻苯二甲酸酐、烷基芳烃的氨氧化、使用NH3选择性催化还原NOx以及控制SO2氧化为SO3期间的SCR。表面钒氧化物种的更高表面密度导致了更多的催化活性位点，从而减少了暴露于氧化物支撑位点的非期望副反应。分子结构和反应活性/选择性信息之间的比较提供了关于表面钒氧化物种特性的洞察。这些催化剂在支持的金属氧化物催化剂中具有独特的特性，与其它过渡金属氧化物相比，块状钒的弱酸性可能有助于减少非期望的副反应。已经研究了终端V=O、桥接V-O-V和桥接V-O支持键的作用，其中桥接V-O支持键对于烃类氧化反应至关重要。氧化物支持的具体相态以及制备方法对表面钒氧化物种的分子结构或活性影响不大，而烃类氧化反应所需表面钒氧化物种的数量则取决于特定的反应物分子。

          [1] "In the case of silica supported vanadia, the surface vanadia coverage was found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm 2."
          [2] "However, the polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more concentrated at higher surface concentrations, are more easily reduced than the isolated surface vanadia species."
          [3] "For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.)."
          [4] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [5] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."

          In the context of silica-supported vanadia, the observed surface vanadia coverage is approximately 7-8 VOx per square nanometer. It is noted that polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more prevalent at higher surface concentrations, are more susceptible to reduction compared to isolated surface vanadia species. When the turnover frequency (TOF) in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions increases with surface vanadia coverage, it is uncertain whether this pattern is attributed to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors such as surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not seem to affect the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites necessary for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is contingent upon the specific reactant molecule involved.

          对于硅基支持的钒酸盐，观察到的表面钒酸盐覆盖度约为每平方纳米7-8个VOx。指出的是，聚合的表面钒酸盐物种在较高表面浓度下更为集中，相较于孤立的表面钒酸盐物种更容易被还原。在烃类氧化反应中，当表面钒酸盐覆盖度增加导致转盘频率（TOF）上升时，这种趋势是否归因于表面桥接V-O-V键浓度的增加或其他因素（例如表面酸性、侧向交互作用、活性位点数量等）尚不清楚。氧化物支持的具体相态以及特定制备方法似乎对表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构或活性没有影响。烃类氧化反应所需表面钒酸盐位点的数量取决于特定的反应物分子。
