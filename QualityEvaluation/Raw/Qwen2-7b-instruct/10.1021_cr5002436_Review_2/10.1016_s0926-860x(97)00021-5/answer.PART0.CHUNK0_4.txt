[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase."
[3] "The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are also discussed."
[4] "In spite of the importance of supported vanadia catalysts, many significant fundamental questions still remain unanswered about these oxidation catalysts."
[5] "In the case of silica supported vanadia, the surface vanadia coverage was found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm 2."
[6] "However, the polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more concentrated at higher surface concentrations, are more easily reduced than the isolated surface vanadia species."
[7] "For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.)."
[8] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
[9] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."

1. Supported vanadia catalysts are widely used for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.
2. New insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions include the roles of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support bonds, the number of required surface vanadia sites, the impact of metal oxide additives, the effect of surface acidic/basic sites, the influence of preparation methods, and the effect of specific oxide support phase.
3. Supported vanadia catalysts have unique physical and chemical characteristics for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.
4. There are still many unanswered fundamental questions about supported vanadia catalysts.
5. Silica-supported vanadia typically has a surface vanadia coverage of around 7-8 VOx per nm 2.
6. Polymerized surface vanadia species are more prone to reduction than isolated ones at higher surface concentrations.
7. The increase in TOF with surface vanadia coverage in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions might not solely be due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds, but also other factors such as surface acidity, lateral interactions, and the number of active sites.
8. The specific phase of the oxide support and the preparation method do not significantly affect the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species.
9. The number of surface vanadia sites required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions varies depending on the specific reactant molecule.
