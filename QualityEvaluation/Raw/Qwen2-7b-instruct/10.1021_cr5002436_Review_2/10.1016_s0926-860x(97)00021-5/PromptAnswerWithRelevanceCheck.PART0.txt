Vanadium oxide catalysts, when supported on oxide supports like alumina, titania, silica, etc., have been widely utilized in commercial applications for oxidation reactions. These include the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Their distinct physical and chemical properties make them particularly effective for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions compared to other metal oxide catalysts.

[1] "The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites."
[2] "Furthermore, the reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdena and chromia catalysts [103,104]."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The increased surface density of surface vanadia species enhances the number of catalytically active sites and reduces unintended side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Moreover, the reactivity per site, specifically the turnover frequency (TOE) for surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions, is often notably higher than that over supported molybdenum and chromium oxide catalysts [103,104].

表面钒氧化物种的更高表面密度增加了催化活性位点的数量，并减少了暴露于氧化物支撑位点的非期望副反应。此外，在氧化反应中，表面钒氧化物种的单个位点的反应活性，即周转频率（TOE），通常明显高于支持的钼或铬氧化物催化剂 [103,104]。

[1] "Comparison of the molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."
[2] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[3] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
[4] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing the molecular structural details with their respective reactivity/selectivity profiles has shed light on the reactivity characteristics of surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond doesn't seem to significantly impact the reactivity of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. While the bridging V-O-V bond may not influence many oxidation reactions, for those that might be affected by this bridging bond, the turnover frequency (TOF) could increase by merely an order of magnitude. Conversely, the bridging V-O-support bond is deemed the most crucial connection, as alterations in its properties can dramatically affect the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by up to four orders of magnitude.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

将分子结构信息与相应的反应活性/选择性信息进行比较，为了解表面钒氧化物种的反应特性提供了见解。末端V=O键似乎并未对表面钒氧化物种在烃类氧化反应中的活性产生显著影响。对于可能受此桥接键影响的那些反应，转盘频率（TOF）仅可能增加一个数量级。然而，连接V-O-支持键被认为是最重要的连接，因为其性质的变化可以极大地改变烃类氧化反应的TOF达四个数量级。

[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts possess unique properties among supported metal oxide catalysts. The surface density of the surface vanadia monolayer is typically about twice that of other supported metal oxide catalysts (e.g., oxides of Mo, Cr, Re, etc.) [103]. The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites [104]. The weak acidic character of bulk vanadia relative to other transition metal oxides (e.g., oxides of Mo, Cr, Re, etc.) may also minimize unwanted side reactions [76,105]. Furthermore, the reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdena and chromia catalysts [103,104]. As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

Hydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the conversion of alkanes to alkenes and the production of ammonia. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its activity and selectivity. The active sites are often dispersed on a support material, such as alumina, to improve stability and activity. Promoters like tin, tungsten, and molybdenum can enhance the performance of chromium catalysts by improving the dispersion of active sites or by altering the surface chemistry. The reaction mechanisms involve hydrogen transfer from hydrogen donors to the chromium center, followed by hydrogen abstraction from the alkane molecule to form an alkene. The presence of promoters can influence the rate and selectivity of this process. The main challenge in research is to optimize the catalyst composition and operating conditions to achieve high activity and selectivity while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的氢化催化剂经历了显著的发展。关键的工业应用包括烷烃转化为烯烃以及氨的生产。研究集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。催化剂结构在决定其活性和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。活性位点通常分散在支撑材料上，如氧化铝，以提高稳定性和活性。促进剂，如锡、钨和钼，可以通过改善活性位点的分散或改变表面化学性质来增强铬催化剂的性能。反应机制涉及从氢供体向铬中心的氢转移，随后是从烷烃分子中抽取氢原子形成烯烃。促进剂的存在可以影响此过程的速度和选择性。研究的主要挑战是优化催化剂组成和操作条件，以实现高活性和选择性的同时，最小化意外副反应。

[4] "The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4].

[5] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
[6] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives.

1. Supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application in various oxidation processes including the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR.

2. The study of molecular structures and reactivity of surface vanadia species offers new insights into their catalytic properties during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. These insights include the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support bonds, the number of surface vanadia sites required, the influence of metal oxide additives, the impact of surface acidic and basic sites, the effect of preparation methods, and the effect of the specific oxide support phase.

3. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not significantly influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species.

4. The study of terminal V=O bonds in supported vanadia catalysts has suggested that they do not necessarily contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Instead, the reaction properties might be related to other structural features.

5. The bridging V-O-support bond plays a crucial role in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Changing the specific oxide support leads to a dramatic alteration in the reaction rate, approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.

6. The number of surface vanadia sites required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions depends on the specific reactant molecule. Some reactions require only one surface vanadia site, which is insensitive to surface vanadia coverage and noninteracting metal oxide additives. Other reactions necessitate multiple surface vanadia sites, which are highly sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives.
