[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts possess unique properties among supported metal oxide catalysts. The surface density of the surface vanadia monolayer is typically about twice that of other supported metal oxide catalysts (e.g., oxides of Mo, Cr, Re, etc.) [103]. The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites [104]. The weak acidic character of bulk vanadia relative to other transition metal oxides (e.g., oxides of Mo, Cr, Re, etc.) may also minimize unwanted side reactions [76,105]. Furthermore, the reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdena and chromia catalysts [103,104]. As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

Hydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the conversion of alkanes to alkenes and the production of ammonia. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its activity and selectivity. The active sites are often dispersed on a support material, such as alumina, to improve stability and activity. Promoters like tin, tungsten, and molybdenum can enhance the performance of chromium catalysts by improving the dispersion of active sites or by altering the surface chemistry. The reaction mechanisms involve hydrogen transfer from hydrogen donors to the chromium center, followed by hydrogen abstraction from the alkane molecule to form an alkene. The presence of promoters can influence the rate and selectivity of this process. The main challenge in research is to optimize the catalyst composition and operating conditions to achieve high activity and selectivity while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的氢化催化剂经历了显著的发展。关键的工业应用包括烷烃转化为烯烃以及氨的生产。研究集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。催化剂结构在决定其活性和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。活性位点通常分散在支撑材料上，如氧化铝，以提高稳定性和活性。促进剂，如锡、钨和钼，可以通过改善活性位点的分散或改变表面化学性质来增强铬催化剂的性能。反应机制涉及从氢供体向铬中心的氢转移，随后是从烷烃分子中抽取氢原子形成烯烃。促进剂的存在可以影响此过程的速度和选择性。研究的主要挑战是优化催化剂组成和操作条件，以实现高活性和选择性的同时，最小化意外副反应。
