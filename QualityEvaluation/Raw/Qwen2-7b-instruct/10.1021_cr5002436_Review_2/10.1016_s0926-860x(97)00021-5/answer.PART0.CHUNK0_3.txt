[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."
[2] "Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase."
[3] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
[4] "The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4]. However, the combination of in situ Raman and hydrocarbon oxidation reactivity studies have recently suggested that the reaction properties are not related to the characteristics of the terminal V=O bonds in supported vanadia catalysts."
[5] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
[6] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."

1. Supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application in various oxidation processes including the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR.

2. The study of molecular structures and reactivity of surface vanadia species offers new insights into their catalytic properties during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. These insights include the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support bonds, the number of surface vanadia sites required, the influence of metal oxide additives, the impact of surface acidic and basic sites, the effect of preparation methods, and the effect of the specific oxide support phase.

3. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not significantly influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species.

4. The study of terminal V=O bonds in supported vanadia catalysts has suggested that they do not necessarily contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Instead, the reaction properties might be related to other structural features.

5. The bridging V-O-support bond plays a crucial role in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Changing the specific oxide support leads to a dramatic alteration in the reaction rate, approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.

6. The number of surface vanadia sites required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions depends on the specific reactant molecule. Some reactions require only one surface vanadia site, which is insensitive to surface vanadia coverage and noninteracting metal oxide additives. Other reactions necessitate multiple surface vanadia sites, which are highly sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives.

1. 支持型钒酸盐催化剂在多种氧化过程中找到了广泛应用，包括选择性氧化对甲苯到邻苯二甲酸酐、烷基芳烃的氨氧化、使用NH3选择性催化还原NOx以及控制SO2氧化为SO3期间的SCR。

2. 对表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构和反应性的研究提供了关于它们在烃类氧化反应中催化性能的新见解。这些见解包括终端V=O、桥接V-O-V和桥接V-O支持键的作用，表面钒酸盐位点的数量要求，金属氧化物添加剂的影响，表面酸性和碱性位点的影响，制备方法的影响，以及特定氧化物支持相的影响。

3. 氧化物支持的具体相态以及具体的制备方法对表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构或反应性影响不大。

4. 关于支持型钒酸盐催化剂中的终端V=O键的研究表明，它们不一定包含参与烃类氧化反应的关键氧。相反，反应特性可能与其它结构特征相关联。

5. 桥接V-O支持键在烃类氧化反应中扮演着关键角色。改变特定氧化物支持会导致反应速率发生显著变化，大约为甲醛氧化四个数量级和丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐两个数量级。

6. 需要用于烃类氧化反应的表面钒酸盐位点的数量取决于特定的反应物分子。一些反应只需要一个表面钒酸盐位点，其对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的影响不敏感。其他反应需要多个表面钒酸盐位点，这些位点对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在非常敏感。
