The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes in refining, air purification, CO gas sensor technology, and utilization in closed-cycle CO2 lasers. While precious metals like platinum, palladium, rhodium, and gold are traditionally used for their efficiency near ambient temperatures, efforts have been made to develop less costly alternatives using base metals and multi-component systems. Chromium oxide surfaces have been studied for their impact on the adsorption behavior of CO, CO2, and O2, with recent investigations focusing on the effects of gamma irradiation on the surface and catalytic properties of Cr2O3/Al2O3. The role of chromium oxide content and calcination temperature in influencing the physical, surface, and catalytic properties of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system has been a focus of research. The catalyst activity has been found to increase with the content of chromium oxide, suggesting that while increasing the amount of chromium oxide and the calcination temperature does not alter the reaction mechanism, it does affect the concentration of active catalyst components without changing their energetic nature.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了对结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解提升。关键工业应用包括精炼过程中的脱氢、空气净化、CO气体传感器技术和在封闭循环CO2激光中的应用。尽管铂、钯、铑和金等贵金属因其接近室温的CO氧化反应效率而传统上被使用，但已经努力开发成本较低的替代品，如使用基础金属和多组分系统。已经研究了铬氧化物表面对其吸附CO、CO2和O2行为的影响，近期研究关注了伽马辐射对Cr2O3/Al2O3表面和催化性质的影响。研究重点在于铬氧化物含量和煅烧温度在影响Cr2O3/Al2O3系统的物理、表面和催化性质方面的作用。催化剂活性随铬氧化物含量增加而提高，表明虽然增加铬氧化物含量和煅烧温度不会改变反应机制，但它会影响活性催化剂成分的浓度而不改变其能量性质。
