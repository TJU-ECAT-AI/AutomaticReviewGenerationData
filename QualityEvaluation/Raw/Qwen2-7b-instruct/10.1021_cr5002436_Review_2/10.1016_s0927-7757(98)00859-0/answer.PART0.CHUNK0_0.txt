<p>The catalystic oxidation of CO by O2 is of environmental and industrial importance. This re- action is being utilized in an increasing number of practical applications. The CO oxidation catalysts are often an integral component of pollution con- trol devices designed to reduce industrial and automotive emissions [1,2]. Air purification devices and CO gas sensors commonly employ CO-oxidation catalysis. Recently, CO oxidation has been utilized in closed-cycle CO2 lasers [1,3 * Corresponding author.

The document does not provide specific information on how chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, or the key industrial applications and research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. It focuses on the physicochemical and engineering aspects of chromium oxide/alumina systems related to catalytic oxidation of CO by O2. It discusses the preparation, characterization, and catalytic properties of chromium oxide/alumina mixed solids, but does not cover the historical evolution or broader industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts.

文献没有提供自1933年催化剂发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂如何演变的信息，也没有涵盖其在脱氢过程中的关键工业应用和研究重点领域。它关注了与CO通过O2催化氧化相关的铬氧化物/氧化铝系统的物理化学和工程特性。它讨论了不同铬氧化物/氧化铝混合固体的制备、表征和催化性能，但并未覆盖催化剂的历史演变或更广泛的工业应用。
