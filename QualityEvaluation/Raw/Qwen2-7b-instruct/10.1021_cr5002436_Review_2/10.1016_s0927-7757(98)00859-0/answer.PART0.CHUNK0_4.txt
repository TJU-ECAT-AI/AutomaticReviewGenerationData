[1] "The catalystic oxidation of CO by O2 is of environmental and industrial importance. This re- action is being utilized in an increasing number of practical applications."

[4] "The activation energy of sintering (DEs) decreases markedly from 21 to 7.6 kJ mol1 by increasing the amount of Cr2O3 from 4.3 to 8.3 wt.% then increases progressively reaching to 33 kJ mol1 in the presence of 42.7 wt.% Cr2O3."
[5] "The curves relating the catalystic activity (reaction rate constant per unit surface area) and precalcination temperature exhibited a maximum at 700 or 800C depending on the amount of Cr2O3 present."
[6] "The rise in both Cr2O3 content and precalcination temperature of Cr2O3/Al2O3 system did not modify the mechanism of CO oxidation by O2 but changed the concentration of catalytically ac- tive constituents (surface chromium oxide species)."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been crucial in various industrial applications due to their environmental and industrial importance. They are utilized in numerous practical applications, especially in the dehydrogenation process.

2. The study of chromium oxide's impact on the adsorption behavior of CO, CO2, and O2 has been explored through infrared techniques. 

3. Heating the system to 1000°C resulted in the appearance of small amounts of aluminum oxide (a-Al2O3) and chromium trioxide (Cr3O4) in addition to other phases like a-Cr2O3, u-Al2O3, and k-Al2O3.

4. By increasing the chromium oxide content from 4.3 to 8.3 wt%, the activation energy for sintering significantly decreased to 7.6 kJ/mol. Further increasing the chromium oxide content to 42.7 wt% led to an increase in the activation energy up to 33 kJ/mol.

5. The curves representing the catalystic activity (reaction rate constant per unit surface area) against the precalcination temperature showed a peak at around 700°C or 800°C, depending on the chromium oxide content.

6. Both the increase in chromium oxide content and the precalcination temperature of the chromium oxide/aluminum oxide system did not alter the CO oxidation by O2 mechanism but changed the concentration of the catalytically active components, specifically the surface chromium oxide species.

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂在环境和工业领域具有重要性，被广泛应用于多种实际应用中，尤其是在脱氢过程。

2. 通过红外技术对铬氧化物对CO、CO2和O2吸附行为的影响进行了研究。

3. 将系统加热至1000°C后，出现了少量的氧化铝（a-Al2O3）和三氧化二铬（Cr3O4），以及其他如a-Cr2O3、u-Al2O3和k-Al2O3等相。

4. 当铬氧化物含量从4.3增加到8.3wt%时，烧结的活化能显著降低至7.6kJ/mol。进一步增加至42.7wt%时，活化能增加至33kJ/mol。

5. 表示催化剂活性（单位表面积的反应速率常数）与预热温度的关系曲线显示，在不同铬氧化物含量下，峰值出现在约700°C或800°C。

6. 系统中铬氧化物含量和预热温度的增加没有改变CO由O2氧化的机制，而是改变了催化活性成分（表面铬氧化物物种）的浓度。
