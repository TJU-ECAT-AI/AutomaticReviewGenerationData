[1] "The nCrSiAl and nCrSiZr catalysts are active for propane ODH, with 10CrSiZr having an activity (based on propylene production) that is among the highest values reported for this reaction."
[2] "Unfortunately, the selectivity toward propylene production is low for all catalysts examined."
[3] "Ki-netic analyses indicate that the poor selectivities arise from very high rates for propylene combustion (k3)."
[4] "For the nCrSiZr catalysts, an increase in the rate of propane ODH (k1) and a decrease in the rate of propylene combustion (k3) with increasing chromium content indicate that different sites are at least partially responsible for these reactions."
[5] "Comparisons to previously reported Al2O3-supported Cr catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation reveal that the catalysts prepared here exhibit higher ODH activities, but lower selectivities for propylene formation [33]."
[6] "In addition,comparisons of the Cr-based catalysts reported here with previously reported V/Zr/O ODH catalysts synthesized via thermolytic molecular precursor methods reveal that the cat- alysts have comparable activities, but that selectivities for propylene are superior for the vanadium-based species [30]."
[7] "Propane DH reactions under mild conditions (723 K) using the nCrSiAl and nCrSiZr catalysts are characterized by high selectivities at low propane conversions."
[8] "The nCrSiZr catalysts are generally more active than their nCrSiAl counterparts."
[9] "Lower Cr contents give rise to higher activities on a per Cr basis, suggesting that isolated sites are preferred."
[10] "Detailed investigations using 2.5CrSiZr led to propane conversions greater than 35%, with propylene selectivities approaching 95%. These values are among the best reported for propane DH catalysts, particularly at such a low reaction temperature."
