[1] "The nCrSiAl and nCrSiZr catalysts are active for propane ODH, with 10CrSiZr having an activity (based on propylene production) that is among the highest values reported for this reaction."
[2] "Unfortunately, the selectivity toward propylene production is low for all catalysts examined."
[3] "Ki-netic analyses indicate that the poor selectivities arise from very high rates for propylene combustion (k3)."
[4] "It appears that well-dispersed Cr species are not selective for propylene,and that polymeric chromium oxides are preferred [33]."
[5] "For the nCrSiZr catalysts, an increase in the rate of propane ODH (k1) and a decrease in the rate of propylene combustion (k3) with increasing chromium content indicate that different sites are at least partially responsible for these reactions."
[6] "Comparisons to previously reported Al2O3-supported Cr catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation reveal that the catalysts prepared here exhibit higher ODH activities, but lower selectivities for propylene formation [33]."
[7] "In addition,comparisons of the Cr-based catalysts reported here with previously reported V/Zr/O ODH catalysts synthesized via thermolytic molecular precursor methods reveal that the cat- alysts have comparable activities, but that selectivities for propylene are superior for the vanadium-based species [30]."
[8] "Propane DH reactions under mild conditions (723 K) using the nCrSiAl and nCrSiZr catalysts are characterized by high selectivities at low propane conversions."
[9] "The nCrSiZr catalysts are generally more active than their nCrSiAl counterparts."
[10] "Lower Cr contents give rise to higher activities on a per Cr basis, suggesting that isolated sites are preferred."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These advancements have led to more efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

2. Key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include cracking of hydrocarbons for fuel production, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons for the production of olefins, and oxidation reactions. Research focuses on improving selectivity, activity, stability, and cost-effectiveness.

3. In dehydrogenation processes, structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role. Well-dispersed active sites enhance reactivity, while support materials improve stability and activity. Promoters such as alkali metals can increase activity, but may affect selectivity.

4. The reaction mechanism involves adsorption of reactants onto the catalyst surface, followed by activation, reaction, and desorption of products. Understanding this mechanism helps in designing more efficient catalysts.

5. Active sites in chromium oxide catalysts can be well-dispersed or in the form of polymers. Polymeric sites tend to have higher activity, but may lack selectivity. Well-dispersed sites, on the other hand, are selective but less reactive.

6. Comparisons with Al2O3-supported chromium catalysts show that the catalysts prepared via thermolytic molecular precursor routes exhibit higher activity but lower selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. 

7. Chromium-based catalysts have comparable activities to vanadium-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, but with better selectivity. This highlights the potential of chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

8. Propane dehydrogenation under mild conditions (723 K) using nCrSiAl and nCrSiZr catalysts is characterized by high selectivities at low propane conversions, indicating efficient catalysts for this process.

9. nCrSiZr catalysts generally outperform nCrSiAl catalysts in terms of activity for propane dehydrogenation. 

10. Lower chromium contents lead to higher activities per unit of chromium, suggesting that isolated sites are preferred for better catalytic performance.
