[1] "The solgel process has been widely employed for the low-temperature preparation of oxide materials."
[2] "Significantly, multi-component oxide materials with isolated (well-dispersed) catalytic centers are often metastable, requiring use of low-temperature synthetic procedures that provide a degree of atomic-level control over the resulting active sites."
[3] "We have recently extended the TMP method to the cothermolyisis of precursor complexes."
[4] "This cothermolytic method has allowed the syntheses of catalytic V/Si/Zr/O and V/Zr/O materials via thermolyses of solutions containing OV[OSi(O tBu)3]3 and Zr[OCMe2Et]4, or OV(O tBu)3 and Zr[OCMe2Et]4, respectively."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has seen significant advancements since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were primarily utilized in petrochemical industries for refining and cracking processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane, ethylene from naphtha, and ammonia synthesis. Research focus areas have included understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters for enhanced performance, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxides are favored for their high reactivity and stability, particularly in the presence of oxygen, leading to improved efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions. Prominent applications involve the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to produce propylene and the non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane to yield higher olefin yields. The cothermolysis method, employing (tBuO)3CrOSi(O tBu)3 and metal alkoxides or acetates, enables the synthesis of homogeneous chromium oxide-based catalysts with high surface areas, well-dispersed active sites, and tailored compositions, enhancing their performance in dehydrogenation processes. This method facilitates the production of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, particularly for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the use of chromium-zirconia (Cr/ZrO2) catalysts has shown increased activity over aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) counterparts. The development of such catalysts aims to overcome challenges such as high reaction temperatures and the formation of coke, thereby optimizing energy consumption and reducing environmental impacts in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on improving their structure, identifying the active sites, selecting suitable support materials, incorporating promoters, and understanding the reaction mechanisms. These catalysts play a crucial role in various industrial applications, such as petrochemical processing, where they enable the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals like propylene. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst performance, enhancing selectivity, and reducing side reactions, especially concerning the formation of coke, which can deactivate catalysts over time.

2. In dehydrogenation processes, the structure of chromium oxide catalysts plays a critical role. Highly dispersed chromium centers are essential for efficient catalysis, allowing for better contact between reactants and active sites. The active sites themselves are typically chromium oxides, which can vary in their chemical environment (tetrahedral, octahedral, etc.), affecting the type of reaction that occurs.

3. Support materials are chosen for their ability to maintain the dispersion of active sites and enhance the mechanical stability of the catalyst. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) are commonly used due to their high thermal stability and ability to support dispersed chromium species. Promoters like alkali metals can improve selectivity in certain reactions, but they can also introduce unwanted side reactions.

4. Reaction mechanisms in dehydrogenation involve the activation of the substrate, followed by the attack of the activated species by a reactive molecule (like oxygen or another hydrocarbon). The active sites facilitate these reactions by lowering the activation energy barrier. For example, in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, chromium oxides act as catalysts for the formation of propylene by converting propane into propylene and water, with oxygen as the oxidant.

5. The evolution of catalysts has led to the development of advanced synthesis techniques, such as thermolytic molecular precursor routes, which allow for the creation of materials with precisely controlled compositions and structures. These methods enable the generation of catalysts with tailored properties, such as high surface areas and dispersion of active sites, which are crucial for efficient catalysis.

2. 在脱氢化过程中，催化剂的结构至关重要。高度分散的铬中心对于高效的催化作用至关重要，可以更好地接触反应物和活性位点。活性位点通常是铬氧化物，它们的化学环境（四面体、八面体等）不同，影响着发生反应的类型。

3. 支撑材料的选择基于它们维持活性位点分散的能力和增强催化剂机械稳定性的能力。氧化铝（Al2O3）和氧化锆（ZrO2）是常用的材料，由于它们的高热稳定性以及支持分散铬物种的能力。助剂如碱金属可以提高某些反应的选择性，但也可能引入不希望的副反应。

4. 反应机制涉及基团的激活，随后由活性分子（如氧气或另一种烃类）攻击激活的物种。活性位点通过降低活化能壁垒来促进这些反应。例如，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中，铬氧化物作为催化剂，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和水，利用氧气作为氧化剂进行转化。

5. 催化剂的发展导致了高级合成技术的开发，如热解分子前体途径，这允许创建具有精确控制组成和结构的材料。这些方法使得能够生成具有定制性质的催化剂，如高比表面积和活性位点的分散，这对于有效的催化至关重要。
