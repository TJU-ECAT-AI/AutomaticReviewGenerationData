[1] "The solgel process has been widely employed for the low-temperature preparation of oxide materials."
[2] "Significantly, multi-component oxide materials with isolated (well-dispersed) catalytic centers are often metastable, requiring use of low-temperature synthetic procedures that provide a degree of atomic-level control over the resulting active sites."
[3] "We have recently extended the TMP method to the cothermolyisis of precursor complexes."
[4] "This cothermolytic method has allowed the syntheses of catalytic V/Si/Zr/O and V/Zr/O materials via thermolyses of solutions containing OV[OSi(O tBu)3]3 and Zr[OCMe2Et]4, or OV(O tBu)3 and Zr[OCMe2Et]4, respectively."
[5] "By altering the ratio of precursors, this method allows the synthesis of high surface area, uniform materials with a wide range of predetermined compositions."
[6] "The conversion of propane to propylene is an important industrial process, and the demand for propylene is rapidly increasing given its use in the production of propylene oxide,acrylonitrile, and polypropylene."
[7] "Unfortunately, these propane DH reactions require high temperatures (up to 873 K) which lead to cracking and the deposition of carbon."
[8] "In studies on various chromium-based catalysts, DeRossi and co-workers found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited increased activity over similarly prepared Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials."
[9] "However, it was also concluded that the practical use of these Cr/ZrO2 catalysts would require an increase in their surface areas and greater thermal stability under the reaction conditions."
[10] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolyisis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."
[11] "We previously reported synthesis of the molecular precursor (tBuO)3CrOSi(O tBu)3 (1) and demonstrated its efficient conversion to high surface area (300 m2 g1) Cr/Si/O materials via TMP methods."
[12] "Herein, we describe the use of 1 for the generation of high surface area Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O catalytic materials via cothermolyses with [Al(O tBu)3]2 (2) or Zr[OCMe2Et]4 (3) in a nonpolar solvent."
[13] "The efficiency of these materials for the dehydrogenation of propane was tested under oxidative (ODH) and non-oxidative (DH) conditions, and the results of these investigations are presented here."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has seen significant advancements since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were primarily utilized in petrochemical industries for refining and cracking processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane, ethylene from naphtha, and ammonia synthesis. Research focus areas have included understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters for enhanced performance, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxides are favored for their high reactivity and stability, particularly in the presence of oxygen, leading to improved efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions. Prominent applications involve the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to produce propylene and the non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane to yield higher olefin yields. The cothermolysis method, employing (tBuO)3CrOSi(O tBu)3 and metal alkoxides or acetates, enables the synthesis of homogeneous chromium oxide-based catalysts with high surface areas, well-dispersed active sites, and tailored compositions, enhancing their performance in dehydrogenation processes. This method facilitates the production of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, particularly for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the use of chromium-zirconia (Cr/ZrO2) catalysts has shown increased activity over aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) counterparts. The development of such catalysts aims to overcome challenges such as high reaction temperatures and the formation of coke, thereby optimizing energy consumption and reducing environmental impacts in industrial dehydrogenation processes.
