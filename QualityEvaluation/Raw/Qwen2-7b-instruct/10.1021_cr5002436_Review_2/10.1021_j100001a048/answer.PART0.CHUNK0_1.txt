[1] "The most important industrial application is in the production of polyethylene, known as the Phillips Particle Form Process."
[2] "The ESR spectra are quantified and related to the previously published quantitative DRS data."
[3] "The intensities of the y-signal follow the Curie-Weiss law, independently of the pretreatment and Cr loading."
[4] "The extent to which 8 deviates from zero is a measure of the extent of CrS+-CI5+ interaction."
[5] "The /3-signal on alumina is due to CrzOs-like clusters, which are, however, too small in size or too small in number to be detected by XRD."
[6] "The d-signal of dispersed Cr3+ ions appears on all the supports after reduction."
[7] "The position of the signal is also a function of the support: the maximum of the d-signal is at higher fields for Cr/SA100 (g around 4.4) than for the other supports (g around 5.0-5.5)."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in their industrial applications, particularly in the production of polyethylene through the Phillips Particle Form Process. They have become pivotal in dehydrogenation processes due to their unique properties and effectiveness in chemical transformations. The research focus areas encompass the study of catalyst structure, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and understanding of reaction mechanisms.

2. Quantitative determination of chromium species, such as Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+, is possible by comparing with a reference sample with known spin density. This method allows for a precise analysis of the chromium species present in the catalysts, providing insights into their distribution and stability.

3. The y-signal, indicative of isolated, mononuclear Cr5+ species, exhibits Curie-Weiss behavior, implying that its magnetic properties are influenced by the support composition. The degree of deviation from zero in the 8 value serves as a measure of the dispersion of Cr over the support, with the data suggesting an increased dispersion order of SiO2 < < Al2O3 < SiO2Al2O3.

4. The presence of CrzOs-like clusters, characterized by the /3-signal, is observed on alumina after reduction and recalcination. The size of these clusters grows with an increase in reduction temperature, Cr loading, and recalcination, as indicated by decreasing peak-to-peak line widths (ppw) and g values.

5. Dispersed Cr3+ ions appear on all supports after reduction, with their intensity increasing with Cr loading and reduction temperature. The position of the d-signal varies based on the support type, with the maximum occurring at higher fields for Cr/SA100 compared to other supports.

6. Isolated Cr3+ ions are stabilized on alumina and silica-alumina supports, as evidenced by the absence of the d-signal after recalcination on Cr/SA100 samples but remaining on other supports. This suggests that these isolated ions are resistant to oxidation, contributing to their stabilization on specific support materials.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在工业应用中取得了显著进展，特别是在聚乙烯生产方面，即菲利普粒子形成过程。它们在脱氢反应中的重要性得益于其独特的性质和化学转化的有效性。研究重点包括催化剂结构、活性位点识别、支撑材料选择、促进剂添加以及反应机制理解。

2. 可以通过比较具有已知自旋密度的参考样品来定量确定铬物种，如Cr2+、Cr3+和Cr6+。这种方法允许对催化剂中存在的铬物种进行精确分析，提供有关其分布和稳定性的见解。

3. y信号表示孤立的单核Cr5+物种，显示出库仑-魏斯行为，意味着其磁性质受支撑组成的影响。8值偏离零的程度作为Cr在支撑上分散程度的度量，数据显示了SiO2 < < Al2O3 < SiO2Al2O3的增加顺序。

4. 在铝酸盐上经过还原和再煅烧后观察到CrzOs-like簇的存在，由/3信号指示。这些簇的大小随着还原温度的升高、Cr负载的增加以及再煅烧的增加而增大，表现为ppw宽度和g值的减少。

5. 所有支持物在还原后均出现分散的Cr3+离子，其强度随Cr负载和还原温度的增加而增加。d信号的位置根据支撑类型而变化，对于Cr/SA100而言，最大值发生在高于其他支持物的磁场中。

6. 独立的Cr3+离子在铝酸盐和硅酸铝酸盐支撑上被稳定化，这从再煅烧后Cr/SA100样品中d信号的消失但其他支撑上保留的情况可以得出。这表明这些独立离子抵抗氧化，对特定支撑材料的稳定性有贡献。
