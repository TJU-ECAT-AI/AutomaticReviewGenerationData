[1] "The most important industrial application is in the production of polyethylene, known as the Phillips Particle Form Process."
[2] "Our knowledge of these catalysts is—despite large efforts—largely qualitative: different oxidation states (Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+) and different molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, etc.) have been identified with infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and electron spin resonance (ESR)."
[3] "The redox behavior and dispersion of Cr between the catalysts are discussed in terms of the support properties and in relation with previous results obtained by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)."
[4] "The extent to which δ deviates from zero is a measure of the extent of Cr3+CI5+ interaction. Small δ values mean magnetically dilute Cr3+ systems, and high δ values mean magnetically concentrated Cr3+ systems."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have gained significant importance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of polyethylene via the Phillips Particle Form Process. Despite considerable efforts, much of our knowledge remains qualitative, focusing on identifying various oxidation states and molecular structures through techniques like infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance. The redox behavior and dispersion of chromium across different catalysts are influenced by the properties of the support material, as demonstrated by previous studies involving diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have seen evolution in their industrial applications, particularly in the production of polyethylene. Key research focuses include understanding the structure of the catalysts, identification of active sites, selection of appropriate support materials, the role of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. The catalysts' performance is closely tied to the redox behavior and dispersion of chromium, which varies based on the support material's properties.

3. The quantitative determination of chromium species (Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+) and their molecular structure in chromium oxide-based catalysts is crucial for relating these species to catalytic performance. This involves utilizing techniques such as diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The redox behavior and dispersion of chromium are discussed in terms of the support properties and previous results obtained through diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

4. The interaction strength between chromium and the support material influences the stability of chromium species under different conditions. For instance, the presence of chromium3+ ions in octahedral A1 sites, as indicated by the quenching of 27Al lines by paramagnetic Cr3+, demonstrates how chromium interacts with the support. This interaction strength increases from silica over silica-alumina to alumina, affecting the stability of chromium species and their dispersion.
