Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in both industrial applications and research focus areas. They are primarily utilized in the production of polyethylene, notably in the Phillips Particle Form Process. Research has identified various oxidation states and molecular structures of chromium species, including Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+, using techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance. However, relating these species to catalytic performance requires quantitative measurements. Studies have quantified Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+ using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, elucidated their molecular structure, and investigated their interactions with probe molecules. The redox behavior and dispersion of chromium are influenced by the properties of the support material and previous findings from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The ability to quantify Cp+ and Cr3+ species using electron spin resonance and compare them to a reference sample allows for a deeper understanding of the catalyst's structure and activity.

自1933年发现以来，含铬氧化物催化剂在工业应用和研究重点领域经历了显著发展。它们主要应用于聚乙烯的生产，尤其是在菲尔斯粒子形成过程中。研究已识别出铬的不同氧化态和分子结构，包括Cr2+、Cr3+、Cr5+和Cr6+，使用红外光谱、X射线光电子光谱、拉曼光谱、漫反射光谱和电子自旋共振等技术。然而，将这些物种与催化性能联系起来需要定量测量。研究表明，通过漫反射光谱可以定量地测定Cr2+、Cr3+和Cr6+，并根据公式2确定它们的分子结构，其中NO+和NF分别代表Cr+和参考样本中的自旋数量；Acp+和AF是Cr+和参考样本的ESR信号的积分强度；gcp+和gREF分别是Cr+和参考样本的g值。红氧化性和分散性之间的关系受到支持材料性质的影响，并且与之前从漫反射光谱得到的结果相关。通过电子自旋共振定量测定Cp+和Cr3+物种，并将其与参考样本进行比较，可以更深入地了解催化剂的结构和活性。
