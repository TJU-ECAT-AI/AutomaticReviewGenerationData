[1] "Supported chromium catalysts are known to possess interesting catalytic properties."
[2] "The most important industrial application is in the production of polyethylene, known as the Phillips Particle Form Process."
[3] "Our knowledge of these catalysts is largely qualitative: different oxidation states (Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+) and different molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, etc.) have been identified with infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and electron spin resonance (ESR)."
[4] "Therefore, a research program has been set up for the development of methods to quantify Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+ species."
[5] "The redox behavior and dispersion of Cr between the catalysts are discussed in terms of the support properties and in relation with previous results obtained by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)."
[6] "Quantitative determination of Cr2+ and Cr3+ species is possible by comparison with a reference sample with known spin density."

The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the production of polyethylene through the Phillips Particle Form Process. The catalysts' properties are largely qualitative, with various oxidation states and molecular structures identified through different spectroscopic techniques. A research program aims to develop methods for quantifying specific chromium species. The redox behavior and dispersion of chromium are influenced by support properties and have been studied using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Quantitative analysis of chromium species is facilitated by comparing them to a reference sample with known spin density.
