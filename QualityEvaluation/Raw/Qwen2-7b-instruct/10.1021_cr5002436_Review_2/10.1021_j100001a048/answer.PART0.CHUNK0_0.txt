The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the production of polyethylene through the Phillips Particle Form Process. Research focuses on identifying the various oxidation states (Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+) and molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, etc.), utilizing techniques such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and electron spin resonance (ESR). A research program has been established to develop methods for quantifying Cr2+ species and elucidating the molecular structure of Cr in inorganic oxides. The study aims to discuss the redox behavior and dispersion of Cr in terms of support properties and in relation to previous results obtained by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展已经显著提高了对它们结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。主要工业应用包括通过菲利普斯颗粒形成过程生产聚乙烯。研究重点在于识别各种氧化状态（Cr2+、Cr3+、Cr5+和Cr6+）和分子结构（铬酸盐、二铬酸盐等），利用红外光谱法（IR）、X射线光电子光谱法（XPS）、拉曼光谱法（RS）、漫反射光谱法（DRS）和电子自旋共振（ESR）技术。已建立一个研究计划，以开发量化Cr2+物种的方法并阐明Cr在无机氧化物中的分子结构。研究旨在根据支持性质以及之前由漫反射光谱法获得的结果讨论Cr的还原性行为和分散情况。
