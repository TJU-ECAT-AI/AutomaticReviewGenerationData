[1] "Therefore it should be possible to prepare silica analogues of other silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolites such as ZSM-11 (ref. 3), ZSM-12 (ref. 4), ZSM-21 (ref. 5) and ZSM-34 (ref. 6)."
[2] "We report here the preparation of what we believe is the analogue of ZSM-11, which we call silicalite-2."
[3] "The silicalite-1, ZSM-5, ZSM-11 and, by inference, silicalite-2 frameworks contain 4-, 5- and 6-membered rings linked to form a system of channels with 10-membered ring openings."
[4] "In silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 the channels are a combination of linear and zig-zag1,2, while in ZSM-113 and silicalite-2 all the channels are linear."

Silicalite-2 is considered as the aluminum-free end member of the zeolite series that includes ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-21, and ZSM-34. It shares structural similarities with these zeolites, featuring a framework composed of 4-, 5-, and 6-membered rings that connect to form a network of channels with 10-membered ring openings. In contrast to ZSM-11 and ZSM-5, where the channels combine linear and zig-zag structures, silicalite-2 has exclusively linear channels.

我们认为，硅硅酸盐是ZSM-11、ZSM-12、ZSM-21和ZSM-34等硅基铝硅酸盐沸石系列的无铝末端成员。它与这些沸石具有相似的结构，其框架由4-、5-和6元环组成，这些环连接形成具有10元环开口的通道网络。与ZSM-11和ZSM-5不同，它们的通道结合了线性和锯齿形结构，硅硅酸盐-2具有完全线性通道。
