[1] "Therefore it should be possible to prepare silica analogues of other silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolites such as ZSM-11 (ref. 3), ZSM-12 (ref. 4), ZSM-21 (ref. 5) and ZSM-34 (ref. 6)."
[2] "We report here the preparation of what we believe is the analogue of ZSM-11, which we call silicalite-2."
[3] "In silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 the channels are a combination of linear and zig-zag1,2, while in ZSM-113 and silicalite-2 all the channels are linear."
[4] "The lack of substitutional aluminium results in silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared with the zeolites."
[5] "However, silicalites are unusual in that they are the only known hydrophobic forms of silica and are capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter."
[6] "Thermogravimetric studies of silicalites-1 and -2 containing absorbed long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C4C16) show that degassing occurs in two stages, which we consider to be due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points."

Silicalite-2 has been prepared as an analogue of ZSM-11. It is characterized by linear channel structures, unlike ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 which have a combination of linear and zig-zag channels. Silicalite-2 lacks catalytic and cation exchange properties due to the absence of substitutional aluminium. Notably, silicalites are hydrophobic and capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Studies on silicalites-1 and -2 show that the degassing process occurs in two stages, indicating self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

我们已经制备了硅酸盐-2，作为ZSM-11的类似物。它具有线性通道结构，与ZSM-11和ZSM-5中结合的线性和折线通道不同。由于缺乏取代铝，硅酸盐缺乏催化和阳离子交换性质。值得注意的是，硅酸盐是已知的唯一疏水性二氧化硅形式，并且能够吸收高达6 Å动力学直径的有机分子。对硅酸盐-1和-2的研究表明，脱气过程分为两个阶段，这表明在交点处通道自我阻塞。
