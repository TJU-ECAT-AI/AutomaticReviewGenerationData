[1] "Therefore it should be possible to prepare silica analogues of other silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolites such as ZSM-11 (ref. 3), ZSM-12 (ref. 4), ZSM-21 (ref. 5) and ZSM-34 (ref. 6)."
[2] "We report here the preparation of what we believe is the analogue of ZSM-11, which we call silicalite-2."
[3] "The lack of substitutional aluminium results in silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared with the zeolites."
[4] "However, silicalites are unusual in that they are the only known hydrophobic forms of silica and are capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter."
[5] "Thermogravimetric studies of silicalites-1 and -2 containing absorbed long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C4C16) show that degassing occurs in two stages, which we consider to be due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points."

Silicalite-2 is considered an analogue of ZSM-11, differing in its lack of substitutional aluminium. This absence of aluminium leads to silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared to aluminosilicate zeolites. Silicalites are unique in being hydrophobic forms of silica, capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric studies reveal that degassing of silicalites-1 and -2, containing long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds, occurs in two stages, attributed to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

硅铝酸盐ZSM-11的无铝同系物被认为是硅酸盐-2。缺乏铝导致硅酸盐没有与铝硅酸盐沸石相比的显著催化或阳离子交换性质。硅酸盐是已知的唯一疏水性二氧化硅形式，能够吸收直径为6 Å的有机分子。热重分析研究表明，含长直链烃化合物的硅酸盐-1和-2的脱气发生在两个阶段，归因于通道在交点处的自堵塞。
