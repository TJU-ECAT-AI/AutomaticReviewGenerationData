[1] "The structure of silicalite, a new polymorph of silica which was first prepared by Flanigen et al.1, is so similar to that of the silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-5 (ref. 2) that we suggest that it should be regarded as the aluminium-free end member of this zeolite series."
[2] "Therefore it should be possible to prepare silica analogues of other silica-rich aluminosilicate zeolites such as ZSM-11 (ref. 3), ZSM-12 (ref. 4), ZSM-21 (ref. 5) and ZSM-34 (ref. 6)."
[3] "We report here the preparation of what we believe is the analogue of ZSM-11, which we call silicalite-2, adopting the terminology silicalite-1 for the form prepared by Flanigen et al.1"
[4] "The silicalite-1, ZSM-5, ZSM-11 and, by inference, silicalite-2 frameworks contain 4-, 5- and 6-membered rings linked to form a system of channels with 10-membered ring openings13."
[5] "In silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 the channels are a combination of linear and zig-zag1,2, while in ZSM-113 and silicalite-2 all the channels are linear."
[6] "The lack of substitutional aluminium results in silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared with the zeolites."
[7] "However, silicalites are unusual in that they are the only known hydrophobic forms of silica and are capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter."
[8] "Thermogravimetric studies of silicalites-1 and -2 containing absorbed long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C4C16) show that degassing occurs in two stages, which we consider to be due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points."

Silicalite-2 is an aluminum-free end member of the zeolite series similar to ZSM-5 in structure. It has been successfully synthesized as an analogue of ZSM-11, differing from ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 in channel structures, where all channels in silicalite-2 are linear, unlike the combination of linear and zig-zag channels found in ZSM-11 and ZSM-5. Due to the absence of aluminum, silicalites lack significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared to aluminosilicate zeolites. However, they possess unique hydrophobic characteristics, capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric studies on silicalites-1 and -2 reveal that degassing occurs in two stages, likely due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

硅酸盐-2是铝系列的无铝末端成员，其结构与ZSM-5相似。它已成功合成作为ZSM-11的类似物，与ZSM-11和ZSM-5不同，在硅酸盐-2中所有通道都是线性的，而ZSM-11和ZSM-5中的通道组合为线性和锯齿形。由于缺少铝，硅酸盐缺乏与铝硅酸盐沸石相比的显著催化或阳离子交换性质。然而，它们具有独特的疏水性特征，能够吸收直径为6 Å的有机分子。热重分析研究表明，硅酸盐-1和-2中的退气过程发生在两个阶段，可能是因为通道在交点处自堵塞。
