Silicalite-2 is considered an analogue of ZSM-11, differing in its lack of substitutional aluminium. This absence of aluminium leads to silicalites having no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared to aluminosilicate zeolites. Silicalites are unique in being hydrophobic forms of silica, capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric studies reveal that degassing of silicalites-1 and -2, containing long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds, occurs in two stages, attributed to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

Silicalite-2 is an aluminum-free end member of the zeolite series similar to ZSM-5 in structure. It has been successfully synthesized as an analogue of ZSM-11, differing from ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 in channel structures, where all channels in silicalite-2 are linear, unlike the combination of linear and zig-zag channels found in ZSM-11 and ZSM-5. Due to the absence of aluminum, silicalites lack significant catalytic or cation exchange properties compared to aluminosilicate zeolites. However, they possess unique hydrophobic characteristics, capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric studies on silicalites-1 and -2 reveal that degassing occurs in two stages, likely due to self-blocking of the channels at intersection points.

Silicalite-2, a silica analogue of ZSM-11, shares similarities with ZSM-5, suggesting it as an aluminium-free end member of the zeolite series. Its framework consists of 4-, 5-, and 6-membered rings forming channels with 10-membered ring openings. Unlike ZSM-11 and ZSM-5, silicalite-2 features exclusively linear channels. Due to the absence of aluminum, silicalites exhibit no significant catalytic or cation exchange properties. Notably, they are hydrophobic and capable of absorbing organic molecules up to 6 Å kinetic diameter. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates two stages of degassing in silicalites-1 and -2 containing long straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds, attributed to channel self-blocking at intersection points.

硅酸盐-2，一种硅酸盐类沸石ZSM-11的类似物，与ZSM-5有相似性，因此被视作该沸石系列中的铝自由端元成员。其框架由4-、5-和6-成员环组成，形成具有10-成员环开口的通道。与ZSM-11和ZSM-5不同的是，硅酸盐-2具有唯一的直线通道。由于缺乏铝，硅酸盐没有显著的催化或阳离子交换性质。值得注意的是，它们是已知的唯一疏水性硅酸盐，并且能够吸收直径至6 Å的有机分子。热重分析显示，在含长直链烃化合物的硅酸盐-1和-2中，退气过程分为两个阶段，我们将其归因于通道在交点处的自我堵塞。

Silicalite-2 is considered as the aluminum-free end member of the zeolite series that includes ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-21, and ZSM-34. It shares structural similarities with these zeolites, featuring a framework composed of 4-, 5-, and 6-membered rings that connect to form a network of channels with 10-membered ring openings. In contrast to ZSM-11 and ZSM-5, where the channels combine linear and zig-zag structures, silicalite-2 has exclusively linear channels.
