[1] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis. It will be shown that the information collected has good potential to be used as a tool to more efficiently operate a propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "The newly developed system (Fig. 1) consists of a 6 mm diameter quartz reactor tube with a special square section in which the tube wall is made of optical grade quartz windows."
[3] "Typically, 300 mg of catalyst is placed in the reactor as a packed bed supported on a sintered glass grid just below the optical windows."
[4] "As an example, in this paper we will discuss the results obtained for a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[5] "Probing events taking place on a supported metal oxide catalyst under reaction conditions has attracted considerable attention in recent years."
[6] "It is, however, very advantageous to combine two or more time-resolved spectroscopic techniques in one catalytic reactor set-up because complementary information can be obtained simultaneously for the same catalyst material under identical catalytic conditions."
[7] "The potential of this experimental set-up has been explored by studying the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over supported chromium oxide, vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide catalysts."
[8] "The fact that it is now possible to use fast and easily applicable operando spectroscopic techniques using fiber optics allows the use of it in the chemical industry as a means of advanced process control in the near future."
[9] "The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated."

The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes, where the focus lies on understanding the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The document highlights the importance of combining multiple time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, such as UV-VIS and Raman, for operando catalyst characterization. It demonstrates the use of fiber-optic technology to enable real-time monitoring of catalyst performance, including coke formation and deactivation. The information gathered through these techniques can be crucial for advanced process control and efficient operation of dehydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.
