[1] "In this work, we present a novel experimental set-up, which combines two operando time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely UV-VIS and Raman, directly coupled to a regular fixed-bed catalytic reactor via optical fiber technology."
[2] "This catalyst is similar to the one used in industrial processes."
[3] "Per year, close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes."
[4] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis."
[5] "Having a pure alkane feed will drastically decrease the timescale in which changes on the catalyst are taking place (oxidation state and coke formation) compared to our observations."
[6] "Since in industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These developments have significantly contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide catalysts have been optimized for various industrial applications, including the production of olefins through catalytic dehydrogenation. The structure of these catalysts has been studied to identify and enhance the active sites responsible for the dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials, such as alumina, have been tailored to improve the stability and activity of the catalysts. Promoters, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been introduced to enhance the catalyst's performance by altering the redox properties and promoting the formation of active sites. Research has focused on understanding the reaction mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation, including the role of chromium oxide in the conversion of alkanes to olefins, the formation of coke, and the redox cycling of the active species. These studies have led to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
