[1] "In this work, we present a novel experimental set-up, which combines two operando time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely UV-VIS and Raman, directly coupled to a regular fixed-bed catalytic reactor via optical fiber technology."
[2] "This catalyst is similar to the one used in industrial processes. The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime."
[3] "In industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."
[4] "The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly impacted their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts have been crucial in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in converting hydrocarbons to olefins. Key areas of focus include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, utilizing promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Research efforts have aimed to optimize these aspects to enhance catalyst efficiency, stability, and selectivity, making them indispensable in industries such as petrochemical manufacturing. Advanced characterization techniques like UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy have been pivotal in gaining insights into catalyst behavior under operational conditions. These studies have revealed that catalysts, especially chromium oxide-based ones, degrade over time through coke formation, affecting their activity and lifetime. Monitoring such degradation in real-time using operando spectroscopy enables better process control and maintenance, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency in industrial operations.
