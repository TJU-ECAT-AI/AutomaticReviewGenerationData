The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts have been pivotal in the production of olefins, accounting for nearly 10 million metric tons annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the conversion of alkanes to olefins, a process that requires highly active and selective catalysts. Research focus areas encompass understanding the structure of these catalysts, identifying the active sites involved in the reactions, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters to enhance catalytic properties, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The dehydrogenation process, characterized by a relatively short catalyst lifetime, necessitates the development of efficient regeneration procedures, such as regenerating the catalyst in air every 20 to 30 minutes. This has led to advancements in operando spectroscopic techniques, allowing real-time monitoring of catalyst performance, including the tracking of coke formation and the assessment of long-term deactivation. The integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques, such as UV-VIS and Raman, enables comprehensive insights into the evolving states of active metal oxide phases and facilitates the optimization of dehydrogenation processes. The novel experimental setup discussed here represents a promising tool for the characterization and monitoring of catalysts in real-time, contributing to the advancement of catalytic science and the efficiency of industrial dehydrogenation processes.
