The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values. In view of their high water gas shift (WGS) activity, iron catalysts are an attractive option for the conversion of CO-rich syngas derived from coal or biomass because an additional H2/CO ratio adjustment step is not necessary. Many catalyst formulations containing iron or other FT-active metals have been proposed for the synthesis of light olefins from synthesis gas. In this review we have divided these catalytic systems into two major groups: bulk or unsupported catalysts, including those materials with structural promoter content below 50 wt %, and supported catalysts.

The use of iron-based catalysts for FTO offers several advantages. Iron is less expensive than cobalt, less reactive to secondary hydrogenation, and produces more olefins. It also has lower methane selectivity at high temperatures, which is crucial for driving the alpha parameter to lower values. Iron catalysts are particularly advantageous for converting CO-rich syngas derived from coal or biomass, as they have high WGS activity and do not require an additional step for adjusting the H2/CO ratio. This makes them an attractive option for the synthesis of light olefins from such syngas.

对于FTO，使用铁基催化剂具有多种优势。铁比钴更便宜，对二级氢化反应的活性较低，产生的烯烃含量更高。它在高温下也显示出更低的甲烷选择性，这对于驱动alpha参数到较低值至关重要。铁催化剂特别适用于从煤炭或生物质中获得的CO富集合成气的转化，因为它们具有高WGS活性，并不需要额外步骤来调整H2/CO比例。这使它们成为从此类合成气合成轻烯烃的有吸引力的选择。

Another strategy used by several researchers to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts for the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis gas is the use of Fe-based bimetallic catalysts. Among them, CoFe (67, 68, 72-74) and FeMn (23, 69, 71, 72, 75-80, 103) catalysts are the most studied systems. In the case of CoFe catalysts, the researchers intended to improve catalytic stability and activity of the already olefin-selective Fe catalysts by alloying it with a more active FischerTropsch catalyst like Co. The bulk CoFe catalysts are generally prepared by coprecipitation, and they are usually promoted with chemical promoters such as K, Cu, and/or Mn and modified with structural promoters such as SiO2 or Al2O3.

另一种提高合成气直接生产轻烯烃催化剂性能的策略是使用铁基双金属催化剂。研究者关注于如CoFe（67, 68, 72-74）和FeMn（23, 69, 71, 72, 75-80, 103）等系统。通过将铁与更活跃的费歇尔-特罗斯催化剂（如钴）合金化，旨在提高已经具有烯烃选择性的铁催化剂的稳定性和活性。批量CoFe催化剂通常通过共沉淀制备，通常用化学添加剂如钾（K）、铜（Cu）和/或锰（Mn）进行促进，并用结构促进剂如二氧化硅（SiO2）或氧化铝（Al2O3）进行改性。

The design strategy used by Kang et al. (133) for a zeolite supported FTO catalyst was to use a bifunctional catalyst where the FT active metal transformed syngas into a primary straight hydrocarbon chain that underwent cracking on the acid zeolite to produce hydrocarbons of limited chain length. For the preparation Kang and co-workers used aqueous solutions or iron and copper nitrates and potassium carbonate to impregnate ZSM-5, mordenite, and beta-zeolite.

The FeMn catalysts prepared by Wang et al. (23) showed a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) at a very high CO conversion (>90%) along with a methane selectivity of about 30%. They attributed the higher yield of alkenes obtained with coprecipitated catalysts to better carbidization and reduction properties. The results obtained by Wang et al. pointed out that catalyst preparation is a key aspect that can determine the performance during reaction.
