          [1] "The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values."
          [2] "Another strategy used by several researchers to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts for the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis gas is the use of Fe-based bimetallic catalysts."
          [3] "The design strategy used by Kang et al. (133) for a zeolite supported FTO catalyst was to use a bifunctional catalyst where the FT active metal transformed syngas into a primary straight hydrocarbon chain that underwent cracking on the acid zeolite to produce hydrocarbons of limited chain length."
          [4] "The FeMn catalysts prepared by Wang et al. (23) showed a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) at a very high CO conversion (>90%) along with a methane selectivity of about 30%."
          [5] "The highest light olefins selectivity was obtained with a catalyst prepared with the precursor Fe4(CO)13H2 which was impregnated on alumina (presumably alpha alumina, surface area 10 m2/g)."

          Iron-based catalysts are widely used for FTO due to their lower cost, lower activity, higher olefin content, and lower methane selectivity compared to cobalt-based catalysts. Researchers have explored the use of Fe-based bimetallic catalysts to improve performance. Kang et al. designed a zeolite-supported FTO catalyst using a bifunctional catalyst that converts syngas into a primary straight hydrocarbon chain, which undergoes cracking on the acid zeolite to produce short-chain hydrocarbons. Wang et al.'s FeMn catalyst demonstrated a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) at a high CO conversion rate (>90%) with a methane selectivity of around 30%. The highest light olefins selectivity was achieved with a catalyst prepared using the precursor Fe4(CO)13H2, which was impregnated on alumina.

          铁基催化剂广泛应用于FTO过程，由于其成本更低、活性更低、烯烃含量更高且甲烷选择性更低，相较于钴基催化剂。研究人员探索了使用铁基双金属催化剂来提高性能。康等人设计了一种分子筛支持的FTO催化剂，使用双功能催化剂将合成气转化为主要的直链烷烃链，该链在酸性分子筛上裂解产生短链烃类。王等人制备的FeMn催化剂在高CO转化率（>90%）下展现出高C2C4烯烃选择性（50%），同时甲烷选择性约为30%。最高轻烯烃选择性是在使用前体Fe4(CO)13H2制备的催化剂上实现的，该催化剂被浸渍在氧化铝（可能是α氧化铝，表面积10 m2/g）上。

          [1] "Despite of the number of publications on the direct production of lower olefins via the FischerTropsch reaction, there has been no commercial application for this process in view of the low C2C4 olefins selectivity, low mechanical or chemical stability, or high methane production of some of the catalysts proposed up to now."
          [2] "Researchers have developed different catalytic systems based on metals that exhibit CO hydrogenation activity. Among these metals only iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium have been found to be sufficiently active for their application."
          [3] "Iron is more robust than other metals and can withstand some contaminants present in coal or biomass-based syngas."
          [4] "The FTO route becomes more feasible with every improvement on activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system. Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
          [5] "The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of CO2 into olefins might gain importance in the future as an alternative pathway for light olefins production."

          Although numerous publications discuss the direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, commercial applications have been limited due to issues with low olefin selectivity, poor mechanical or chemical stability, and high methane production from some catalysts. Researchers have developed catalytic systems based on metals with CO hydrogenation activity, with iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium being the most active. Iron is noted for its robustness and ability to handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. Improvements in catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability make the FTO route more viable, with iron being a preferred choice due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and potential to achieve methane selectivities below predictions. The future development of CO2-to-olefin conversion processes could become increasingly significant as an alternative pathway for light olefins production.

          尽管有大量的出版物讨论通过费歇尔-特罗普希反应直接生产低级烯烃的过程，但由于一些催化剂选择性低、机械或化学稳定性差、以及高甲烷生成的问题，商业应用一直受到限制。研究人员开发了基于具有CO氢化活性的金属的催化系统，铁、钴、镍和钌被认为是最具活性的。铁以其耐久性和处理煤或生物质基合成气中的杂质的能力而著称。随着催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的改进，FTO路径变得更加可行，铁因其成本低廉、高烯烃选择性以及可能达到ASF产品分布预测以下的甲烷选择性，被认为是FTO反应的理想选择。未来将开发的二氧化碳转化为烯烃的催化过程有可能变得越来越重要，作为生产轻烯烃的替代途径。
