[1] "The FTO process displays lower ethylene and propylene selectivities in comparison to MTO or DMTO."
[2] "The FTO process offers feedstock flexibility."
[3] "Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[4] "The design of effective iron-based catalysts for the selective production of light olefins involves several factors: the selection of a support that enables the formation of the active phase and its intimate contact with the chemical promoters, the adequate choice of promoters to increase the selectivity to light olefins and minimize methane production, the use of preparation methods that allow obtaining a homogeneous spatial distribution of iron-containing particles with narrow size distribution in the optimum size range, and the selection of optimum process conditions to maximize the catalyst life without compromising product selectivity."

The FTO process offers lower selectivities for ethylene and propylene in comparison to MTO or DMTO. It provides flexibility in feedstock usage, particularly when using iron-based catalysts, which are cost-effective, selective towards olefins, and can handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. The key factors in designing effective iron-based catalysts for FTO include selecting a support that facilitates the formation of the active phase and its contact with chemical promoters, choosing appropriate promoters to enhance light olefin selectivity and reduce methane production, employing preparation methods to achieve a uniform spatial distribution of iron particles with optimal size, and setting optimal process conditions to prolong catalyst life without sacrificing product selectivity.

FTO过程在与MTO或DMTO相比时，对于乙烯和丙烯的选择性较低。它提供了一种灵活性，特别是在使用铁基催化剂时，这些催化剂成本低廉、对烯烃选择性高，并能承受煤炭或生物质基合成气中的杂质。设计有效的铁基催化剂用于FTO的关键因素包括选择能够促进活性相形成并与其化学促动剂紧密接触的支持物，选择适当的促动剂以增强轻烯烃选择性和减少甲烷生成，采用制备方法来实现铁颗粒的均匀空间分布和最佳尺寸范围，以及设置最佳工艺条件以延长催化剂寿命而不牺牲产品选择性。
