The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values. In view of their high water gas shift (WGS) activity, iron catalysts are an attractive option for the conversion of CO-rich syngas derived from coal or biomass because an additional H2/CO ratio adjustment step is not necessary. Many catalyst formulations containing iron or other FT-active metals have been proposed for the synthesis of light olefins from synthesis gas. In this review we have divided these catalytic systems into two major groups: bulk or unsupported catalysts, including those materials with structural promoter content below 50 wt %, and supported catalysts.

The use of iron-based catalysts for FTO offers several advantages. Iron is less expensive than cobalt, less reactive to secondary hydrogenation, and produces more olefins. It also has lower methane selectivity at high temperatures, which is crucial for driving the alpha parameter to lower values. Iron catalysts are particularly advantageous for converting CO-rich syngas derived from coal or biomass, as they have high WGS activity and do not require an additional step for adjusting the H2/CO ratio. This makes them an attractive option for the synthesis of light olefins from such syngas.

对于FTO，使用铁基催化剂具有多种优势。铁比钴更便宜，对二级氢化反应的活性较低，产生的烯烃含量更高。它在高温下也显示出更低的甲烷选择性，这对于驱动alpha参数到较低值至关重要。铁催化剂特别适用于从煤炭或生物质中获得的CO富集合成气的转化，因为它们具有高WGS活性，并不需要额外步骤来调整H2/CO比例。这使它们成为从此类合成气合成轻烯烃的有吸引力的选择。

Another strategy used by several researchers to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts for the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis gas is the use of Fe-based bimetallic catalysts. Among them, CoFe (67, 68, 72-74) and FeMn (23, 69, 71, 72, 75-80, 103) catalysts are the most studied systems. In the case of CoFe catalysts, the researchers intended to improve catalytic stability and activity of the already olefin-selective Fe catalysts by alloying it with a more active FischerTropsch catalyst like Co. The bulk CoFe catalysts are generally prepared by coprecipitation, and they are usually promoted with chemical promoters such as K, Cu, and/or Mn and modified with structural promoters such as SiO2 or Al2O3.

另一种提高合成气直接生产轻烯烃催化剂性能的策略是使用铁基双金属催化剂。研究者关注于如CoFe（67, 68, 72-74）和FeMn（23, 69, 71, 72, 75-80, 103）等系统。通过将铁与更活跃的费歇尔-特罗斯催化剂（如钴）合金化，旨在提高已经具有烯烃选择性的铁催化剂的稳定性和活性。批量CoFe催化剂通常通过共沉淀制备，通常用化学添加剂如钾（K）、铜（Cu）和/或锰（Mn）进行促进，并用结构促进剂如二氧化硅（SiO2）或氧化铝（Al2O3）进行改性。

The design strategy used by Kang et al. (133) for a zeolite supported FTO catalyst was to use a bifunctional catalyst where the FT active metal transformed syngas into a primary straight hydrocarbon chain that underwent cracking on the acid zeolite to produce hydrocarbons of limited chain length. For the preparation Kang and co-workers used aqueous solutions or iron and copper nitrates and potassium carbonate to impregnate ZSM-5, mordenite, and beta-zeolite.

[1] "The FTO process displays lower ethylene and propylene selectivities in comparison to MTO or DMTO."
[2] "The FTO process offers feedstock flexibility."
[3] "Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[4] "The design of effective iron-based catalysts for the selective production of light olefins involves several factors: the selection of a support that enables the formation of the active phase and its intimate contact with the chemical promoters, the adequate choice of promoters to increase the selectivity to light olefins and minimize methane production, the use of preparation methods that allow obtaining a homogeneous spatial distribution of iron-containing particles with narrow size distribution in the optimum size range, and the selection of optimum process conditions to maximize the catalyst life without compromising product selectivity."

The FTO process offers lower selectivities for ethylene and propylene in comparison to MTO or DMTO. It provides flexibility in feedstock usage, particularly when using iron-based catalysts, which are cost-effective, selective towards olefins, and can handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. The key factors in designing effective iron-based catalysts for FTO include selecting a support that facilitates the formation of the active phase and its contact with chemical promoters, choosing appropriate promoters to enhance light olefin selectivity and reduce methane production, employing preparation methods to achieve a uniform spatial distribution of iron particles with optimal size, and setting optimal process conditions to prolong catalyst life without sacrificing product selectivity.

[1] "Despite of the number of publications on the direct production of lower olefins via the FischerTropsch reaction, there has been no commercial application for this process in view of the low C2C4 olefins selectivity, low mechanical or chemical stability, or high methane production of some of the catalysts proposed up to now."
[2] "Researchers have developed different catalytic systems based on metals that exhibit CO hydrogenation activity. Among these metals only iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium have been found to be sufficiently active for their application. (38) From the commercial standpoint only Fe and Co are used as they are more readily available and less expensive compared to ruthenium. Ni is very active as well, but it produces much more methane than Co or Fe and it forms volatile carbonyls at the reaction conditions at which FT plants operate, resulting in continuous loss of the metal."
[3] "Iron is more robust than other metals and can withstand some contaminants present in coal or biomass-based syngas. In fact, it is shown from this review that iron can be even more selective to light olefins in the presence of low concentrations of sulfur."
[4] "The FTO route becomes more feasible with every improvement on activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system. Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[5] "The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of CO2 into olefins might gain importance in the future as an alternative pathway for light olefins production. (168-175) The environmental impact of FTO might be further reduced using CO2 and solar hydrogen as feedstock."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction has faced challenges such as low olefin selectivity, instability, and high methane production, which have prevented commercial applications.
2. Iron and cobalt are preferred over nickel for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts due to their lower cost and better stability. Nickel is too active, leading to high methane production and metal loss.
3. Iron catalysts can maintain selectivity towards olefins even in the presence of sulfur, a common contaminant in coal and biomass syngas.
4. Iron remains a promising catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) reactions due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and ability to withstand syngas contaminants.
5. Future development may explore using CO2 and solar hydrogen as feedstocks for the conversion of CO2 into olefins, potentially reducing the environmental impact of Fischer-Tropsch processes.
