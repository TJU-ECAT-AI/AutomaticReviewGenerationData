1. The AndersonSchulzFlory (ASF) model can predict the product selectivity in the FischerTropsch synthesis, with the maximum selectivity for C2C4 olefins occurring at an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5.
2. Sulfur can promote the FischerTropsch synthesis on iron catalysts, enhancing light olefins selectivity, reducing methane production, and increasing catalytic activity under certain conditions.
3. Yao et al. observed a high selectivity to light olefins when using a ZrAl catalyst in the FischerTropsch reaction at 400 C and 18 bar.
4. Supported catalysts offer high selectivity to light olefins, low methane production, low cost, and simple synthesis procedures, making them attractive for FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO) processes.
5. Researchers have extensively studied the influence of the support's nature on catalyst performance in FTO processes to optimize the combination of active metal, support, and modifiers.
