[1] "Despite of the number of publications on the direct production of lower olefins via the FischerTropsch reaction, there has been no commercial application for this process in view of the low C2C4 olefins selectivity, low mechanical or chemical stability, or high methane production of some of the catalysts proposed up to now."
[2] "Researchers have developed different catalytic systems based on metals that exhibit CO hydrogenation activity. Among these metals only iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium have been found to be sufficiently active for their application. (38) From the commercial standpoint only Fe and Co are used as they are more readily available and less expensive compared to ruthenium. Ni is very active as well, but it produces much more methane than Co or Fe and it forms volatile carbonyls at the reaction conditions at which FT plants operate, resulting in continuous loss of the metal."
[3] "Iron is more robust than other metals and can withstand some contaminants present in coal or biomass-based syngas. In fact, it is shown from this review that iron can be even more selective to light olefins in the presence of low concentrations of sulfur."
[4] "The FTO route becomes more feasible with every improvement on activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system. Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[5] "The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of CO2 into olefins might gain importance in the future as an alternative pathway for light olefins production. (168-175) The environmental impact of FTO might be further reduced using CO2 and solar hydrogen as feedstock."

1. The direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction has faced challenges such as low olefin selectivity, instability, and high methane production, which have prevented commercial applications.
2. Iron and cobalt are preferred over nickel for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts due to their lower cost and better stability. Nickel is too active, leading to high methane production and metal loss.
3. Iron catalysts can maintain selectivity towards olefins even in the presence of sulfur, a common contaminant in coal and biomass syngas.
4. Iron remains a promising catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) reactions due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and ability to withstand syngas contaminants.
5. Future development may explore using CO2 and solar hydrogen as feedstocks for the conversion of CO2 into olefins, potentially reducing the environmental impact of Fischer-Tropsch processes.

1. 直接通过费休斯-特罗普希反应生产低级烯烃的技术由于选择性低、稳定性差以及甲烷产量高，目前尚未实现商业化应用。
2. 铁和钴因其成本低廉和稳定性好，成为费休斯-特罗普希催化剂的首选，而镍则因活性过高导致大量甲烷生成并造成金属损耗。
3. 铁催化剂在硫化物等常见煤和生物质合成气杂质存在的情况下仍能保持向烯烃的选择性。
4. 铁仍然是费休斯-特罗普希到烯烃（FTO）反应的理想催化剂，因为它具有低成本、高烯烃选择性和能够承受合成气杂质的优点。
5. 将来可能会探索使用二氧化碳和太阳能氢气作为原料将二氧化碳转化为烯烃，以进一步降低费休斯-特罗普希过程的环境影响。
