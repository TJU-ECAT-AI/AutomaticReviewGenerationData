[1] "The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values."
[2] "The highest light olefins selectivity was achieved with a coprecipitated catalysts (15:85 Mn:Fe). At a very high CO conversion (>90%), this catalyst showed a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) and a methane selectivity of about 30%."
[3] "The highest selectivity to light olefins (25%) was observed for an FeK-nitride/SiO2 at low CO conversion (1%), when it was tested under the FischerTropsch reaction at 250 C, 8 bar, and a H2/CO ratio of 1."
[4] "A high C2C4 olefins selectivity (63%) and low methane production (7%) were observed when using an FePr/heat-treated γ-alumina at 280 C, 8 bar, and H2/CO ratio of 0.5."
[5] "The highest light olefins selectivity was obtained with a catalyst prepared with the precursor Fe4(CO)13H2 which was impregnated on alumina (presumably alpha alumina, surface area 10 m2/g)."

The literature discusses various aspects of catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process. Key points include:

1. Iron-based catalysts are the most commonly used for FTO due to their cost-effectiveness, lower activity, higher olefin content, and lower methane selectivity compared to cobalt-based catalysts.

2. Coprecipitated Fe:Mn catalysts show high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) and low methane selectivity (30%) at high CO conversion (>90%).

3. Iron carbide-based catalysts exhibit high light olefins selectivity (25%) at low CO conversion (1%).

4. Iron-praseodymium (FePr) catalysts supported on gamma alumina have high olefins selectivity (63%) and low methane production (7%) at 280°C, 8 bar, and a H2/CO ratio of 0.5.

5. Catalysts prepared with the precursor Fe4(CO)13H2 impregnated on alumina have high light olefins selectivity.

The literature focuses on catalysts' structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms contributing to their effectiveness in FTO processes.

文献讨论了Fischer-Tropsch到烯烃（FTO）过程中的催化剂的各种方面。关键点包括：

1. 铁基催化剂由于其成本效益、较低的活性、较高的烯烃含量以及在高温度下驱动α值至较低值时较低的甲烷选择性，是使用最广泛的FTO催化剂。

2. 共沉淀的Fe:Mn催化剂显示出高C2C4烯烃选择性（50%）和高CO转化率（>90%）时低的甲烷选择性（30%）。

3. 铁碳化物基催化剂在低CO转化率（1%）下表现出高达25%的高轻烯烃选择性。

4. 铁镨（FePr）催化剂支持在γ氧化铝上具有高烯烃选择性（63%）和低甲烷生成（7%）在280°C、8巴和H2/CO比为0.5的条件下。

5. 用前体Fe4(CO)13H2浸渍的催化剂表现出高的轻烯烃选择性。

文献重点研究了催化剂的结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，这些因素都对FTO过程的有效性做出了贡献。
