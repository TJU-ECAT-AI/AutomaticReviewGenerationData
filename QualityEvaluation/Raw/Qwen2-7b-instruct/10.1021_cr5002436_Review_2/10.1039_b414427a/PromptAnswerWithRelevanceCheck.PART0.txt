1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, adapting to various industrial applications. Their importance in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to facilitate reactions efficiently. Research focuses on understanding their structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance.

2. The aim of this work is to investigate the capabilities of an operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR setup for quantitative Raman spectroscopy, using the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-grade chromium-alumina catalyst as a model system.

3. Both methods of Raman quantitation—using an internal boron nitride standard and a diffuse reflectance correction factor—prove suitable for determining the amount of coke present in a catalytic reactor. The operando setup offers the advantage of not requiring additional compounds for quantification, aligning well with industrial applications.

<p>As stated in the Introduction, two different approaches to quantify the time-resolved Raman spectra are compared in this work. The first method makes use of a correction factor based on the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra, further denoted as the G(RN) correction factor.</p>
<p>We found that RN and thus G(RN) are decreasing as the reaction time proceeds except for the first minutes-on-stream. Here, the reduction of Cr61 to Cr31 is mainly responsible for a small increase in G(RN).</p>
<p>In a second step, the corresponding Raman spectra of Fig. 2 were divided by the corresponding values of G(RN) according to eqn. (1) to obtain the true Raman intensities.</p>
<p>Instead, the data obtained after applying one of the correction methods results in coke uptake patterns, very similar to those obtained with the TEOM technique.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra.</p>
<p>Comparing the results to TGA/TEOM data has proven the validation of the method. They all are in good agreement with each other.</p>
<p>It was also found that propene is the precursor for coke formation at the catalyst surface and the first coke made is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Thus, the amount of coke formed seems to be critical for the catalyst performance.</p>

1. The study compares two methods for quantifying Raman spectra. The first uses a correction factor based on UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra, named G(RN). As reaction time increases, G(RN) decreases, except during the initial stages when Cr61 is reduced to Cr31, causing a slight rise in G(RN). Applying G(RN) to Raman spectra yields accurate coke uptake patterns, matching those from TEOM techniques. The method's key advantage is that it doesn't require adding extra substances to the catalytic system.

2. The research validates the method by comparing its outcomes with those from TGA/TEOM data. All methods show consistent results, proving the technique's reliability. The study reveals that propene serves as the precursor for coke formation on the catalyst surface. Initially, this coke benefits propane dehydrogenation by facilitating propane adsorption. However, as the reaction progresses, the increased coke formation turns more graphitic, hindering propene production and causing activity to drop. Thus, the amount of coke produced significantly impacts catalyst performance.

1. 研究比较了两种定量拉曼光谱的方法。第一种方法使用基于紫外-可见近红外漫反射光谱的校正因子，称为G(RN)。随着反应时间的增加，G(RN)下降，除了最初的几分钟，在此期间，Cr61被还原为Cr31，导致G(RN)略有上升。将G(RN)应用于拉曼光谱可以得到准确的焦油积累模式，与TEOM技术获得的数据相匹配。该方法的主要优点是无需向研究系统中添加额外的物质即可量化测量的拉曼光谱。

2. 通过将研究结果与TGA/TEOM数据进行比较，证实了方法的有效性。所有方法的结果一致，证明了技术的可靠性。研究发现，丙烯是催化剂表面焦油形成的前体。最初，这种焦油促进了丙烷脱氢作用，通过促进丙烷吸附。然而，随着反应的进行，越来越多的焦油转化为石墨状焦油，阻碍了丙烯的生成，导致活性下降。因此，焦油的产生量对催化剂性能有重要影响。

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Their industrial applications include processes such as dehydrogenation, where they play a crucial role. The research focus areas often involve understanding how these catalysts maintain their activity and selectivity over time, especially considering factors like the type of support material used (like Al2O3) and the presence of promoters that enhance their performance. The dehydrogenation of propane over a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst serves as a model system to study these aspects. Continuous monitoring through UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroscopy during the reaction process provides insights into the catalyst's behavior and the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Quantitative Raman spectroscopy, without the need for an internal standard, enables precise measurement of the amount of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which is critical for understanding and optimizing the dehydrogenation process.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become indispensable in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into higher-value chemicals. Research focuses on optimizing the catalyst's composition, enhancing its stability, and improving its selectivity to desired products. Chromium oxides, being robust and selective, are widely used in petrochemical industries for processes such as alkane dehydrogenation, where they facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. Key areas of interest include the identification of active sites, the role of support materials in promoting catalytic activity, and the impact of promoters in enhancing the catalyst's performance. Understanding the reaction mechanisms underlying these processes aids in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques.

Propene, a crucial intermediate in dehydrogenation processes, plays a pivotal role in coke formation at the catalyst surface. The study reveals that as the reaction progresses, propene serves as the precursor for coke formation. Initially, the formation of coke benefits the dehydrogenation process by facilitating the adsorption of propane near the active sites. However, as the amount of coke increases, it eventually transforms into a graphitic form, obstructing the dehydrogenation sites and leading to a decline in catalyst activity. The balance between coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance is critical for maintaining optimal dehydrogenation efficiency.

The quantitative Raman spectroscopy methodology developed in this work enables the measurement of the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. This approach offers a non-invasive way to monitor the degradation of catalysts in real-time, providing insights into the deactivation mechanisms and the dynamics of coke formation. By correlating the Raman spectra with the diffuse reflectance spectra, researchers can assess the changes in the catalyst's properties during the reaction, offering valuable information for the optimization of dehydrogenation processes and the development of advanced catalysts.

在脱氢过程中，作为中间体的丙烯在催化剂表面形成焦炭的作用至关重要。研究表明，在反应过程中，丙烯是焦炭形成的前驱体。初期，焦炭的形成促进了脱氢过程，通过促进丙烷在活性位点附近的吸附。然而，随着焦炭量的增加，它最终转化为石墨状形式，阻碍了脱氢位点，导致催化剂活性下降。焦炭形成与催化剂性能之间的平衡对于保持最佳脱氢效率至关重要。

本文中开发的定量拉曼光谱方法能够测量催化剂材料上碳质沉积物的量，随反应时间及催化剂床高度变化。这种方法提供了一种实时监控催化剂降解的非侵入式方式，为了解催化剂失活机制和焦炭形成动态提供了宝贵信息，对于优化脱氢过程和开发先进催化剂具有重要意义。
