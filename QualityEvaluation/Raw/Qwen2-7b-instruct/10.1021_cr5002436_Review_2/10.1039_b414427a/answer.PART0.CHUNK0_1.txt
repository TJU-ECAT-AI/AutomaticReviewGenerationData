<p>As stated in the Introduction, two different approaches to quantify the time-resolved Raman spectra are compared in this work. The first method makes use of a correction factor based on the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra, further denoted as the G(RN) correction factor.</p>
<p>We found that RN and thus G(RN) are decreasing as the reaction time proceeds except for the first minutes-on-stream. Here, the reduction of Cr61 to Cr31 is mainly responsible for a small increase in G(RN).</p>
<p>In a second step, the corresponding Raman spectra of Fig. 2 were divided by the corresponding values of G(RN) according to eqn. (1) to obtain the true Raman intensities.</p>
<p>Instead, the data obtained after applying one of the correction methods results in coke uptake patterns, very similar to those obtained with the TEOM technique.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra.</p>
<p>Comparing the results to TGA/TEOM data has proven the validation of the method. They all are in good agreement with each other.</p>
<p>It was also found that propene is the precursor for coke formation at the catalyst surface and the first coke made is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

1. The study compares two methods for quantifying Raman spectra. The first uses a correction factor based on UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra, named G(RN). As reaction time increases, G(RN) decreases, except during the initial stages when Cr61 is reduced to Cr31, causing a slight rise in G(RN). Applying G(RN) to Raman spectra yields accurate coke uptake patterns, matching those from TEOM techniques. The method's key advantage is that it doesn't require adding extra substances to the catalytic system.

2. The research validates the method by comparing its outcomes with those from TGA/TEOM data. All methods show consistent results, proving the technique's reliability. The study reveals that propene serves as the precursor for coke formation on the catalyst surface. Initially, this coke benefits propane dehydrogenation by facilitating propane adsorption. However, as the reaction progresses, the increased coke formation turns more graphitic, hindering propene production and causing activity to drop. Thus, the amount of coke produced significantly impacts catalyst performance.

1. 研究比较了两种定量拉曼光谱的方法。第一种方法使用基于紫外-可见近红外漫反射光谱的校正因子，称为G(RN)。随着反应时间的增加，G(RN)下降，除了最初的几分钟，在此期间，Cr61被还原为Cr31，导致G(RN)略有上升。将G(RN)应用于拉曼光谱可以得到准确的焦油积累模式，与TEOM技术获得的数据相匹配。该方法的主要优点是无需向研究系统中添加额外的物质即可量化测量的拉曼光谱。

2. 通过将研究结果与TGA/TEOM数据进行比较，证实了方法的有效性。所有方法的结果一致，证明了技术的可靠性。研究发现，丙烯是催化剂表面焦油形成的前体。最初，这种焦油促进了丙烷脱氢作用，通过促进丙烷吸附。然而，随着反应的进行，越来越多的焦油转化为石墨状焦油，阻碍了丙烯的生成，导致活性下降。因此，焦油的产生量对催化剂性能有重要影响。
