[1] "Recent technical developments have tremendously increased the popularity of Raman spectroscopy as a characterization tool to obtain physico-chemical information on heteroge- neously catalzed reaction systems."
[2] "The goal of this work is to explore the possibilities of the developed set-up for performing quantitative Raman spectroscopy taking the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like Cr/ Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst as a case study."
[3] "It was found that both approaches are suitable, but the use of a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up clearly has the advantage that no additional compounds have to be added to the catalytic system under investigation."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, adapting to various industrial applications. Their importance in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to facilitate reactions efficiently. Research focuses on understanding their structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance.

2. The aim of this work is to investigate the capabilities of an operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR setup for quantitative Raman spectroscopy, using the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-grade chromium-alumina catalyst as a model system.

3. Both methods of Raman quantitation—using an internal boron nitride standard and a diffuse reflectance correction factor—prove suitable for determining the amount of coke present in a catalytic reactor. The operando setup offers the advantage of not requiring additional compounds for quantification, aligning well with industrial applications.
