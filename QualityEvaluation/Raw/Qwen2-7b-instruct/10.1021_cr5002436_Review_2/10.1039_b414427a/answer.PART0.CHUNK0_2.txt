Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Their industrial applications include processes such as dehydrogenation, where they play a crucial role. The research focus areas often involve understanding how these catalysts maintain their activity and selectivity over time, especially considering factors like the type of support material used (like Al2O3) and the presence of promoters that enhance their performance. The dehydrogenation of propane over a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst serves as a model system to study these aspects. Continuous monitoring through UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroscopy during the reaction process provides insights into the catalyst's behavior and the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Quantitative Raman spectroscopy, without the need for an internal standard, enables precise measurement of the amount of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which is critical for understanding and optimizing the dehydrogenation process.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制等方面。其工业应用包括脱氢等过程，在这些过程中起着关键作用。研究重点领域通常涉及理解这些催化剂如何在时间中保持其活性和选择性，特别是考虑所使用的支持材料类型（如Al2O3）和增强其性能的促进剂。13 wt% Cr/Al2O3催化剂作为模型系统用于研究这些方面。在反应过程中通过紫外-可见-近红外和拉曼光谱的连续监测提供了有关催化剂行为和碳沉积物形成的信息。无须内部标准的定量拉曼光谱允许精确测量催化剂表面上的碳沉积物量，这对于理解和优化脱氢过程至关重要。
