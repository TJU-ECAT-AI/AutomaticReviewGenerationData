The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become indispensable in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into higher-value chemicals. Research focuses on optimizing the catalyst's composition, enhancing its stability, and improving its selectivity to desired products. Chromium oxides, being robust and selective, are widely used in petrochemical industries for processes such as alkane dehydrogenation, where they facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. Key areas of interest include the identification of active sites, the role of support materials in promoting catalytic activity, and the impact of promoters in enhancing the catalyst's performance. Understanding the reaction mechanisms underlying these processes aids in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques.

Propene, a crucial intermediate in dehydrogenation processes, plays a pivotal role in coke formation at the catalyst surface. The study reveals that as the reaction progresses, propene serves as the precursor for coke formation. Initially, the formation of coke benefits the dehydrogenation process by facilitating the adsorption of propane near the active sites. However, as the amount of coke increases, it eventually transforms into a graphitic form, obstructing the dehydrogenation sites and leading to a decline in catalyst activity. The balance between coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance is critical for maintaining optimal dehydrogenation efficiency.

The quantitative Raman spectroscopy methodology developed in this work enables the measurement of the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. This approach offers a non-invasive way to monitor the degradation of catalysts in real-time, providing insights into the deactivation mechanisms and the dynamics of coke formation. By correlating the Raman spectra with the diffuse reflectance spectra, researchers can assess the changes in the catalyst's properties during the reaction, offering valuable information for the optimization of dehydrogenation processes and the development of advanced catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了从结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制等多方面的进步。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中因其高效地将烃类转化为高价值化学品的能力而变得不可或缺。研究重点包括催化剂组成优化、稳定性增强、选择性提高等关键领域。由于其稳健性和选择性，铬氧化物广泛应用于石油化学工业中，用于烷烃脱氢等过程，促进烃类转化为烯烃。主要研究方向涉及活性位点的识别、支撑材料在促进催化活性中的作用以及促进剂对催化剂性能的影响。理解这些过程的反应机制有助于开发更高效、更环保的制造技术。

在脱氢过程中，作为中间体的丙烯在催化剂表面形成焦炭的作用至关重要。研究表明，在反应过程中，丙烯是焦炭形成的前驱体。初期，焦炭的形成促进了脱氢过程，通过促进丙烷在活性位点附近的吸附。然而，随着焦炭量的增加，它最终转化为石墨状形式，阻碍了脱氢位点，导致催化剂活性下降。焦炭形成与催化剂性能之间的平衡对于保持最佳脱氢效率至关重要。

本文中开发的定量拉曼光谱方法能够测量催化剂材料上碳质沉积物的量，随反应时间及催化剂床高度变化。这种方法提供了一种实时监控催化剂降解的非侵入式方式，为了解催化剂失活机制和焦炭形成动态提供了宝贵信息，对于优化脱氢过程和开发先进催化剂具有重要意义。

通过将拉曼光谱与漫反射光谱相关联，研究人员可以评估反应期间催化剂属性的变化，提供有关催化剂优化和先进催化剂开发的重要信息。
