[1] "In continuation to the possibility of using a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up for conducting qualitative Raman spectroscopy, the possibilities for quantitative Raman spectroscopic measurements of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions without the need of an internal standard have been explored."
[2] "During reaction, the catalytic solid was continuously monitored by both UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroscopy."
[3] "As the dehydrogenation proceeds, the catalyst gradually darkens due to coke formation and consequently the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and Raman scattered signal progressively decrease in intensity."
[4] "The formation of coke was confirmed with TEOM, TGA and Raman."
[5] "The measured Raman spectra can be used as a quantitative measure of the amount of carbonaceous deposits at the catalyst surface provided that a correction factor G(RN) is applied."
[6] "The validity of the approach is compared with one, in which an internal boron nitride standard is added to the catalytic solid."
[7] "It will be shown that the proposed methodology allows measurement of the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material inside a reactor as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height."
[8] "The goal of this work is to explore the possibilities of the developed set-up for performing quantitative Raman spectroscopy taking the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like Cr/ Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst as a case study."
[9] "All flows given are at standard temperature and pressure."
[10] "With the experi-mental set-up described by Nijhuis et al.32 carbon deposits could be measured as a function of the catalyst bed height during and after propane dehydrogenation."
[11] "We believe it can be generally applied for studying supported metal oxide catalysts in a quantitative manner under working conditions."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 includes advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include use in dehydrogenation processes, where their effectiveness is crucial. The research focus has expanded to encompass detailed studies on the catalyst's structure, aiming to optimize active sites, select appropriate support materials, and identify effective promoters. Understanding reaction mechanisms has also been pivotal in enhancing catalyst performance and efficiency. This work explores the capabilities of quantitative Raman spectroscopy in measuring the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation of propane over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The methodology is validated against techniques like TEOM and TGA, showing its suitability for measuring the amount of carbon deposits in reactors as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. This approach can be generally applied to study various supported metal oxide catalysts in a quantitative manner under operating conditions.
