The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become significant in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into valuable chemical intermediates. Research focuses on optimizing their performance for various applications, such as the production of propylene from propane, which is of renewed interest due to the rise in shale gas exploitation and the growing demand for propylene compared to ethylene for plastic production. As temperatures increase, the conversion of propane enhances, albeit at the cost of decreased selectivity towards propylene due to increased cracking of reaction products. The success of these catalysts relies on factors such as the stability of chromium species, the properties of the alumina support, and the presence of promoters that enhance activity and selectivity. The design and provision of UV-Vis probes by Avantes have enabled researchers to study these catalysts in real-time under industrial conditions, providing insights into their behavior during reactions and aiding in the optimization of dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展已经通过对其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制的理解进步，成为了催化固体工作的重要研究领域。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的显著性，归因于它们能够有效地将碳氢化合物转化为有价值的化学中间体。研究重点在于优化它们在各种应用中的性能，如从丙烷生产丙烯，这与页岩气开采的兴起和丙烯相对于乙烯用于塑料生产的增长需求密切相关。随着温度的升高，丙烷的转化率增加，但选择性向丙烯降低，因为反应产物的裂解变得更为普遍。这些催化剂的成功依赖于铬物种的稳定性、氧化铝支持的特性以及增强活性和选择性的促进剂的存在。Avantes设计并提供的紫外可见光谱探头的成功，使得研究人员能够在工业条件下实时研究这些催化剂，提供有关其行为的信息，并帮助优化脱氢过程。
