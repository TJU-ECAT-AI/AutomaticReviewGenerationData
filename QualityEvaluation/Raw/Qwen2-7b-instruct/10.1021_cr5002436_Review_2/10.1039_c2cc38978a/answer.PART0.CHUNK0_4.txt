[1] "The development and use of spectroscopic methods has matured into an important field of research to characterize catalytic solids at work."
[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids."
[3] "Despite the fact that coke species do not present absorption bands, their formation can be observed indirectly by UV-Vis as the formation of coke leads to darkening of the catalyst and as a consequence an overall increase of the UV-Vis absorption of the catalyst material."
[4] "In order to study the coke deposition and combustion rate at different catalyst bed heights over time, the absorption was determined in the region between 600700 nm by averaging all data points."
[5] "From Fig. 4a it is clearly visible that the formation of coke during the dehydrogenation step is faster at the top of the reactor as compared to the bottom where coke deposition is a gradual process."
[6] "Moreover, by using probes located along the catalyst bed, it is possible to follow the spatiotemporal differences in the rate of coke deposition and combustion."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on optimizing these aspects to enhance catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity. The spectroscopic methods, particularly UV-Vis spectroscopy, have played a pivotal role in this evolution by allowing detailed insights into the working and deactivation principles of heterogeneous catalysts. This method has proven capable of probing the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in the catalysts. The ability to observe indirect signs of coke formation through changes in UV-Vis absorption has further enhanced the utility of these techniques in monitoring catalyst behavior under real-world reaction conditions. The spatial and temporal analysis of coke deposition rates across different positions within the catalyst bed showcases the potential of integrating UV-Vis spectroscopy with industrial-scale reactors for real-time diagnostics and optimization of catalyst performance.
