[1] "The development and use of spectroscopic methods has matured into an important field of research to characterize catalytic solids at work."
[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids."
[3] "The showcase example is the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene over an industrial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, shaped in the form of 3 mm-sized catalyst bodies."
[4] "UV-Vis spectra of the catalyst are collected continuously during the reaction in order to monitor coke deposition."
[5] "The authors would like to thank Avantes for designing and providing the UV-Vis probes."
[6] "This new design allows for in situ monitoring of coke formation and combustion by following the UV-Vis absorption intensity."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They are now widely used in various industrial applications, particularly in the dehydrogenation processes. Key advancements include the optimization of catalyst structures, identification of active sites, selection of effective support materials, introduction of promoters to enhance activity, and detailed understanding of reaction mechanisms. These developments have led to more efficient and selective catalysts for converting hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals such as propylene and ethylene. Research focuses on improving catalyst stability, reducing deactivation rates, and enhancing the overall yield of desired products.
