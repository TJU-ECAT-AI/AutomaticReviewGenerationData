[1] "In the last decade the development and use of spectroscopic methods has matured into an important field of research to characterize catalytic solids at work."
[2] "Amongst them, UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids."
[3] "So far, UV-Vis spectroscopy has been combined with other characterization methods, including but not limited to EPR, NMR, Raman, IR and XAFS, or integrated with an optical microscope to analyse heterogeneities within and between catalyst grains."
[4] "This new design allows for in situ monitoring of coke formation and combustion by following the UV-Vis absorption intensity."
[5] "Moreover, by using probes located along the catalyst bed, it is possible to follow the spatiotemporal differences in the rate of coke deposition and combustion."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of their industrial applications and research focus areas. Key developments include advancements in understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness in dehydrogenation processes. For instance, UV-Vis spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the electronic transitions of organic deposits and transition metal species within these catalysts. This method, when combined with others like EPR, NMR, Raman, IR, XAFS, and optical microscopy, enhances the ability to analyze heterogeneities within and between catalyst grains. The integration of UV-Vis spectroscopy into pilot-scale reactors enables real-time monitoring of phenomena such as coke formation and combustion, allowing researchers to gain insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of these processes.
