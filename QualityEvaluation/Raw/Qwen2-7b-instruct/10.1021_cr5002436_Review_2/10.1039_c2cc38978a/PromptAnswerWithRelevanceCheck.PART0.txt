[1] "Amongst them, UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids."
[2] "Cr3+-species characterized by UV-Vis bands at around 300, 450 and 620 nm are identified."
[3] "This process becomes more prevalent during the rest of the cycle resulting in featureless and noisy spectra."
[4] "UV-Vis spectra of the catalyst material have also been collected for the top probe during dehydrogenation and oxidationregeneration (Fig. S4, ESI)."
[5] "In both cases, the drop in UV-Vis absorption is rapid, which suggests that coke combustion is fast and that it takes place as a front, travelling through the reactor bed over time."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become significant in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into valuable chemical intermediates. Research focuses on optimizing their performance for various applications, such as the production of propylene from propane, which is of renewed interest due to the rise in shale gas exploitation and the growing demand for propylene compared to ethylene for plastic production. As temperatures increase, the conversion of propane enhances, albeit at the cost of decreased selectivity towards propylene due to increased cracking of reaction products. The success of these catalysts relies on factors such as the stability of chromium species, the properties of the alumina support, and the presence of promoters that enhance activity and selectivity. The design and provision of UV-Vis probes by Avantes have enabled researchers to study these catalysts in real-time under industrial conditions, providing insights into their behavior during reactions and aiding in the optimization of dehydrogenation processes.
