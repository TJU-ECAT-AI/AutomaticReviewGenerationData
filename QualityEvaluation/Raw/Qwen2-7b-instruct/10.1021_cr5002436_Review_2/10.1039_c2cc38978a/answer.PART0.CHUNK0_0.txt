[1] "Amongst them, UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and dd transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids."
[2] "Cr3+-species characterized by UV-Vis bands at around 300, 450 and 620 nm are identified."
[3] "This process becomes more prevalent during the rest of the cycle resulting in featureless and noisy spectra."
[4] "UV-Vis spectra of the catalyst material have also been collected for the top probe during dehydrogenation and oxidationregeneration (Fig. S4, ESI)."
[5] "In both cases, the drop in UV-Vis absorption is rapid, which suggests that coke combustion is fast and that it takes place as a front, travelling through the reactor bed over time."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are crucial in dehydrogenation processes, such as the conversion of propane to propylene. Key research focus areas include optimizing the structure of chromium oxide to enhance its activity and stability, identifying the specific active sites that facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, selecting appropriate support materials to improve the catalyst's performance, incorporating promoters to modulate the reaction pathways, and elucidating the detailed mechanisms of how these catalysts interact with reactants and products under various reaction conditions.
