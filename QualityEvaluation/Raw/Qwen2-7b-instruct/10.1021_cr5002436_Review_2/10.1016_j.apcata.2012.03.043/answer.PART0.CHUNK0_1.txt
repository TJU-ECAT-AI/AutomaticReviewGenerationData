Among these materials, TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides in het- erogeneous catalysis because of its broad functionality,long-term stability and nontoxicity.
High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can now be easily and reproducibly prepared [3,4],but there are still some disadvantages such as the limited active sites on its surface and the aggregation of its mesostructure under high temperatures [5,6].
Thus,the incorporation of various heteroatoms into the meso- porous or nano-sized structure to embed a catalytic function is of tremendous interest [710].
Catalytic dehydrogenation represents a route to obtain olefins from low-cost alkanes,especially propane and ethane,and pos- sesses both theoretical and industrial significance [11].
For propane dehydrogenation,vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been extensively studied,while supported chromium catalysts also show competitive performance.
The oxidation state of chromium,structure (amorphous or crystalline,chromate or dichromate) and the interaction of chromium with the support are the main factors that determine its catalytic performance.
More interestingly,these factors could be controlled by varying the metallic content,the Corresponding author.

Catalysts using TiO2 as the support have been extended to the
PODH
reaction as well [1317].  Moreover,for chromium catalysts, TiO2 even appears to be the most suitable support compared by the dispersion amount of chromium oxide on different supports and the catalytic performance in
PODH
[18].
However,despite having great potential,reports about the application of mesoporous TiCr materials are still seldom.
Meso- porous structure allows the reactants access additional active sites in the pores and has advantages in mass diffusion and transporta- tion,as well as other unpredicted beneficial properties,which may improve catalytic activity.
In view of the above,it is quite interesting for us to synthe- size mesoporous materials and test their catalytic performance in
PODH
reaction.
In this work,we prepared a series of TiCr oxide catalysts and studied the influence of Cr content on meso- pores (surface area,pore volume and stability),surface properties (chromium valence distribution,reducibility,and acid property of the chromium species) and catalytic performance (propane con- version,yield to propylene) of these catalysts.
Attempts have been made to correlate the
PODH
results with the composition of the catalysts and the nature of the active sites.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has led to significant advancements in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts are valued for their broad functionality, long-term stability, and nontoxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 has been easily and reproducibly prepared, though it faces limitations in active site density and aggregation under high temperatures. Incorporating heteroatoms into mesoporous or nanoscale structures enhances their catalytic function. For propane dehydrogenation, chromium catalysts show competitive performance alongside vanadium and molybdenum catalysts. The oxidation state, structure, and interaction of chromium with the support material are crucial factors affecting its catalytic performance. These factors can be manipulated through variations in metallic content, precursor selection, support characteristics, and calcination conditions. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a preferred support material for chromium catalysts, as it outperforms other supports in terms of chromium dispersion and catalytic activity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH). Despite their potential, the application of mesoporous TiCr materials remains scarce. The mesoporous structure provides additional active sites within the pores, facilitating mass diffusion, transportation, and potentially enhancing catalytic activity. This study aimed to synthesize mesoporous materials and evaluate their catalytic performance in PODH reactions, focusing on the impact of chromium content on mesopore properties, surface properties, and catalytic performance indicators such as propane conversion and propylene yield. Efforts were made to correlate the PODH outcomes with the catalyst composition and active site nature.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在异质催化领域取得了显著进步，特别是在脱氢反应中。这些催化剂因其广泛的功能性、长期稳定性和无毒性而受到重视。高质量的介孔TiO2可以容易且可重复地制备，但其表面活性位点有限和高温下结构聚集仍然是其面临的挑战。通过将不同类型的杂原子引入到介孔或纳米级结构中，以嵌入催化剂功能，这一领域受到了极大的关注。对于丙烷脱氢而言，钼、钨等催化剂已经得到了广泛研究，而支持型铬催化剂也表现出竞争力。铬的氧化状态、结构（非晶态或晶体状，铬酸盐或二铬酸盐）以及铬与支撑材料之间的相互作用是决定其催化性能的主要因素。这些因素可以通过改变金属含量、前驱体选择、支撑材料特性和煅烧条件来控制。二氧化钛（TiO2）作为支撑材料在铬催化剂中的应用被扩展到了氧化脱氢反应中，而且研究表明，在不同的支撑材料上，TiO2是铬氧化物分散量最多、在PODH反应中表现最佳的支撑材料。尽管它们具有巨大的潜力，但关于应用介孔TiCr材料的报告仍然很少见。介孔结构允许反应物在孔内获取额外的活性位点，并且在质量扩散、运输以及可能增强催化活性方面具有优势。鉴于此，我们对合成介孔材料并测试它们在PODH反应中的催化性能产生了兴趣。本研究准备了一系列TiCr氧化物催化剂，研究了铬含量对介孔（表面积、孔体积和稳定性）、表面性质（铬物种的价态分布、可还原性和酸性）以及这些催化剂的催化性能（丙烷转化率、丙烯产率）的影响。尝试将PODH结果与催化剂组成和活性位点性质联系起来。
