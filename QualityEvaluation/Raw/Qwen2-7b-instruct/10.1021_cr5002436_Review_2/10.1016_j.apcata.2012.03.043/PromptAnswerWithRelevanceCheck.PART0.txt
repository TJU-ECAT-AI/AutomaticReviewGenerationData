1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have become significant in heterogeneous catalysis due to their broad functionality, long-term stability, and non-toxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can be prepared efficiently and consistently, but it has limitations such as a limited number of active sites on its surface and aggregation issues under high temperatures.

2. Catalytic dehydrogenation offers a cost-effective method to produce olefins from low-cost alkanes, particularly propane and ethane, presenting both theoretical and practical importance. 

3. The catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts is primarily influenced by the chromium's oxidation state, its structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromate or dichromate), and its interaction with the support material.

4. Despite the potential benefits, there are few reports on the application of mesoporous TiCr materials. 

5. Meso-porous structures enable additional active sites within the pores, enhancing mass diffusion and transportation, and potentially improving catalytic activity. 

6. A series of TiCr oxide catalysts were synthesized, focusing on studying how chromium content affects mesopores, surface properties (chromium valence distribution, reducibility, and acid properties), and catalytic performance (propane conversion, propylene yield) of these catalysts. Efforts were made to correlate the results of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) with the catalyst composition and the nature of the active sites.

Among these materials, TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides in het- erogeneous catalysis because of its broad functionality,long-term stability and nontoxicity.
High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can now be easily and reproducibly prepared [3,4],but there are still some disadvantages such as the limited active sites on its surface and the aggregation of its mesostructure under high temperatures [5,6].
Thus,the incorporation of various heteroatoms into the meso- porous or nano-sized structure to embed a catalytic function is of tremendous interest [710].
Catalytic dehydrogenation represents a route to obtain olefins from low-cost alkanes,especially propane and ethane,and pos- sesses both theoretical and industrial significance [11].
For propane dehydrogenation,vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been extensively studied,while supported chromium catalysts also show competitive performance.
The oxidation state of chromium,structure (amorphous or crystalline,chromate or dichromate) and the interaction of chromium with the support are the main factors that determine its catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has led to significant advancements in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts are valued for their broad functionality, long-term stability, and nontoxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 has been easily and reproducibly prepared, though it faces limitations in active site density and aggregation under high temperatures. Incorporating heteroatoms into mesoporous or nanoscale structures enhances their catalytic function. For propane dehydrogenation, chromium catalysts show competitive performance alongside vanadium and molybdenum catalysts. The oxidation state, structure, and interaction of chromium with the support material are crucial factors affecting its catalytic performance. These factors can be manipulated through variations in metallic content, precursor selection, support characteristics, and calcination conditions. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a preferred support material for chromium catalysts, as it outperforms other supports in terms of chromium dispersion and catalytic activity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH). Despite their potential, the application of mesoporous TiCr materials remains scarce. The mesoporous structure provides additional active sites within the pores, facilitating mass diffusion, transportation, and potentially enhancing catalytic activity. This study aimed to synthesize mesoporous materials and evaluate their catalytic performance in PODH reactions, focusing on the impact of chromium content on mesopore properties, surface properties, and catalytic performance indicators such as propane conversion and propylene yield. Efforts were made to correlate the PODH outcomes with the catalyst composition and active site nature.

The key industrial applications and research focus areas of chromium oxide-based catalysts include structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The structure of chromium oxide catalysts is crucial for determining their performance in dehydrogenation processes. Active sites, often in the form of redox-active chromium species, play a critical role in the conversion of reactants. Support materials such as TiO2 provide a stable matrix for the catalyst and can affect the dispersion of the active sites. Promoters like alkali metals can modulate the acid properties of the catalyst, influencing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction. Reaction mechanisms involve complex interactions between the chromium species, the support, and the reactants, leading to the formation of desired products through redox and acid-base catalysis. These areas of research are aimed at improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, which have significant implications for the production of valuable olefinic compounds from low-cost alkanes.
