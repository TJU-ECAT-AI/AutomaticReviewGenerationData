1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have become significant in heterogeneous catalysis due to their broad functionality, long-term stability, and non-toxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can be prepared efficiently and consistently, but it has limitations such as a limited number of active sites on its surface and aggregation issues under high temperatures.

2. Catalytic dehydrogenation offers a cost-effective method to produce olefins from low-cost alkanes, particularly propane and ethane, presenting both theoretical and practical importance. 

3. The catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts is primarily influenced by the chromium's oxidation state, its structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromate or dichromate), and its interaction with the support material.

4. Despite the potential benefits, there are few reports on the application of mesoporous TiCr materials. 

5. Meso-porous structures enable additional active sites within the pores, enhancing mass diffusion and transportation, and potentially improving catalytic activity. 

6. A series of TiCr oxide catalysts were synthesized, focusing on studying how chromium content affects mesopores, surface properties (chromium valence distribution, reducibility, and acid properties), and catalytic performance (propane conversion, propylene yield) of these catalysts. Efforts were made to correlate the results of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) with the catalyst composition and the nature of the active sites.

1. 自1933年以来，由于其广泛的用途、长期稳定性和无毒性，含铬氧化物催化剂在异质催化中变得非常重要。高质量的介孔TiO2可以高效且一致地制备，但其表面活性位点有限，并且在高温下会聚集。

2. 催化脱氢提供了一种从低成本烷烃中生产烯烃的有效途径，特别是丙烷和乙烷，具有理论和工业上的重要性。

3. 铬氧化物催化剂的催化性能主要由铬的氧化状态、其结构（非晶态或晶体态、铬酸盐或二价铬）及其与支撑材料的相互作用决定。

4. 尽管有巨大的潜力，关于应用介孔TiCr材料的报告仍然很少。

5. 介孔结构允许反应物进入孔内获取额外的活性位点，并且在质量扩散和运输方面具有优势，可能提高催化活性。

6. 制备了一系列TiCr氧化物催化剂，研究了铬含量对微孔的影响（表面积、孔体积和稳定性）、表面性质（铬物种的电荷分布、可还原性和酸性）以及这些催化剂的催化性能（丙烷转化率、丙烯产率）。尝试将PODH结果与催化剂组成和活性位点的性质进行关联。
