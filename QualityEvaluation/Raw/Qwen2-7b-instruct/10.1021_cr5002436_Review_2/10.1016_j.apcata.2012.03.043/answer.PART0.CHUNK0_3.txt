Since the discovery of M41S silicate materials, the extension of the surfactant templating procedure to form non-silica mesoporous oxides has never been stopped due to their various applications such as catalysis, sorption, chemical and biological separation, photonics and electronic devices, and drug delivery. Among these materials, TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides in heterogeneous catalysis because of its broad functionality, long-term stability, and nontoxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can now be easily and reproducibly prepared, but there are still some disadvantages such as the limited active sites on its surface and the aggregation of its mesostructure under high temperatures. Thus, the incorporation of various heteroatoms into the meso- porous or nano-sized structure to embed a catalytic function is of tremendous interest. Catalytic dehydrogenation represents a route to obtain olefins from low-cost alkanes, especially propane and ethane, and possesses both theoretical and industrial significance. For propane dehydrogenation, vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been extensively studied, while supported chromium catalysts also show competitive performance. The oxidation state of chromium, structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromate or dichromate), and the interaction of chromium with the support are the main factors that determine its catalytic performance. More interestingly, these factors could be controlled by varying the metallic content, the precursor, the support characteristics, and calcination conditions.

自发现M41S硅酸盐材料以来，通过表面活性剂模板法形成非硅质介孔氧化物的过程从未停止，由于这些材料在催化、吸附、化学和生物分离、光子学和电子设备以及药物递送等领域的广泛应用。其中，TiO2是异质催化中最重要的金属氧化物之一，因其广泛的功能性、长期稳定性和无毒性而受到重视。现在可以轻松且可重复地制备高质量的介孔TiO2，但其表面活性位点有限，在高温下会聚集体结构。因此，将不同类型的杂原子引入到介孔或纳米结构中以嵌入催化功能具有巨大的研究价值。催化脱氢是一种从低成本烷烃获取烯烃的途径，尤其是丙烷和乙烷，既具有理论意义也具有工业应用价值。对于丙烷脱氢，钒和钼催化剂已经被广泛研究，而负载型铬催化剂也显示出竞争力。铬的氧化态、结构（非晶态或晶体，铬酸盐或二价铬）以及铬与支撑物之间的相互作用是决定其催化性能的主要因素。更有趣的是，可以通过调整金属含量、前体、支撑物特性和煅烧条件来控制这些因素。

The key industrial applications and research focus areas of chromium oxide-based catalysts include structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The structure of chromium oxide catalysts is crucial for determining their performance in dehydrogenation processes. Active sites, often in the form of redox-active chromium species, play a critical role in the conversion of reactants. Support materials such as TiO2 provide a stable matrix for the catalyst and can affect the dispersion of the active sites. Promoters like alkali metals can modulate the acid properties of the catalyst, influencing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction. Reaction mechanisms involve complex interactions between the chromium species, the support, and the reactants, leading to the formation of desired products through redox and acid-base catalysis. These areas of research are aimed at improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, which have significant implications for the production of valuable olefinic compounds from low-cost alkanes.
