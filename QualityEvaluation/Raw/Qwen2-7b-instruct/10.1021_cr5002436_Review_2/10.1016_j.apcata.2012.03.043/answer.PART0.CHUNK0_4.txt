1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, finding extensive use in industrial applications like catalysis, sorption, chemical and biological separation, photonic and electronic devices, and drug delivery. The focus areas of research include the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

2. The dehydrogenation process using chromium oxide catalysts provides an economical method to produce olefins from low-cost alkanes, particularly propane and ethane, offering both theoretical and practical benefits.

3. Controlling factors such as metallic content, precursor selection, support characteristics, and calcination conditions enable the adjustment of catalyst properties. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include chromium's oxidation state, whether the structure is amorphous or crystalline, and the relationship between chromium and the support.

4. Despite their potential, there are few reports on the application of mesoporous TiCr materials. These materials' mesoporous structure offers additional active sites within the pores, enhancing mass diffusion and transport, potentially boosting catalytic activity.
