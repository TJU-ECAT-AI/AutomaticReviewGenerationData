[1] "After the discovery of M41S silicate materials, the extension of the surfactant templating procedure to form non-silica mesoporous oxides has never been stopped, due to their various applications such as catalysis, sorption, chemical and biological separation, photonic and electronic devices and drug delivery."
[2] "Among these materials, TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides in heterogeneous catalysis because of its broad functionality, long-term stability and nontoxicity."
[3] "High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can now be easily and reproducibly prepared."
[4] "Catalytic dehydrogenation represents a route to obtain olefins from low-cost alkanes, especially propane and ethane, and possesses both theoretical and industrial significance."
[5] "For propane dehydrogenation, vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been extensively studied, while supported chromium catalysts also show competitive performance."
[6] "The oxidation state of chromium, structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromate or dichromate), and the interaction of chromium with the support are the main factors that determine its catalytic performance."
[7] "More interestingly, these factors could be controlled by varying the metallic content, the precursor, the support characteristics, and calcination conditions."
[8] "Catalysts using TiO2 as the support have been extended to the PODH reaction as well."
[9] "Moreover, for chromium catalysts, TiO2 even appears to be the most suitable support compared by the dispersion amount of chromium oxide on different supports and the catalytic performance in PODH."
[10] "However, despite having great potential, reports about the application of mesoporous TiCr materials are still seldom."
[11] "Meso- porous structure allows the reactants access additional active sites in the pores and has advantages in mass diffusion and transportation, as well as other unpredicted beneficial properties, which may improve catalytic activity."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 includes their adaptation to form non-silica mesoporous oxides through surfactant templating. These materials have found significant applications in areas like catalysis, sorption, chemical and biological separation, photonic and electronic devices, and drug delivery. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is highlighted as a crucial metal oxide in heterogeneous catalysis, valued for its versatility, durability, and non-toxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can be easily synthesized, and catalytic dehydrogenation offers a method to produce olefins from inexpensive alkanes, particularly propane and ethane. Vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been widely researched for propane dehydrogenation, while chromium catalysts have shown competitive performance. The oxidation state, structure, and interaction of chromium with the support are key factors influencing catalytic activity, which can be manipulated through variations in metallic content, precursor, support properties, and calcination conditions. Using TiO2 as a support in dehydrogenation reactions has proven effective, with TiO2 being identified as the most suitable support for chromium catalysts compared to others. Despite their potential, the use of mesoporous TiCr materials is still less explored. The mesoporous structure enhances access to active sites, improves mass diffusion and transportation, and potentially boosts catalytic activity.

自1933年发现M41S硅酸盐材料以来，通过表面活性剂模板化过程形成非硅质介孔氧化物的方法一直在不断发展，这些材料在催化、吸附、化学和生物分离、光子学和电子设备以及药物递送等领域有广泛应用。二氧化钛（TiO2）被认定为异相催化中的重要金属氧化物，因其功能广泛、长期稳定性和无毒性而受到重视。高质量的介孔TiO2可以方便且重现性地制备。催化脱氢是通过低成本烷烃获取烯烃的一种途径，特别是丙烷和乙烷，它具有理论和工业上的重要意义。对于丙烷脱氢，钒和钼催化剂已被广泛研究，而支持型铬催化剂也表现出竞争力。铬的氧化状态、结构（非晶态或晶体，铬酸盐或二价铬）、与支持材料的相互作用是决定其催化性能的主要因素，这些因素可以通过调整金属含量、前体、支持材料特性和煅烧条件来控制。使用TiO2作为支持材料在脱氢反应中得到扩展，并且TiO2被证明是铬催化剂的最佳支持材料之一，与不同支持材料上铬氧化物的分散量和在PODH反应中的催化性能相比。尽管它们具有巨大的潜力，但关于应用介孔TiCr材料的研究仍然很少。介孔结构允许反应物在孔内访问额外的活性位点，并在扩散和运输方面具有优势，可能提高催化活性。
