[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[4] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[5] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with advancements in industrial applications, research focusing on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are widely applied in ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydroisomerization of n-butane, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia. Recently, they have been utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, enhancing the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. Research focuses on understanding the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation, promoting its weak oxidative properties, and the redox mechanisms involving chromium species.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts include ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydroisomerization of n-butane, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia. Research is also focused on utilizing these catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, particularly propane, isobutane, ethane, and ethylbenzene, considering CO2 as a promoter for increased propene yield and catalyst stability.

3. The research focus areas include understanding the structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The structure affects the dispersion of chromium species, influencing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Active sites are crucial for the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. Support materials determine the surface area and acid/base properties, impacting the stability and activity of the catalyst. Promoters like CO2 enhance the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction mechanisms involve the role of CO2 in reducing high-valent chromium species to more active forms.

4. The catalysts' activity is primarily associated with the presence of reducible chromium sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites). This cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation, with reduced forms of chromium (Cr3+ and Cr2+) being active in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Non-redox chromium species (CrOy) may also contribute to the nonoxidative pathway. The reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) occurs over redox and non-redox chromium sites, enhancing propene yield by consuming hydrogen.

5. Partial catalyst deactivation is primarily caused by coke formation, resulting from excessive cracking and carbonization of hydrocarbons. This process leads to a darkening of the catalysts, which can be monitored through in situ UVvis DR spectroscopy. The intensity of the UVvis DR signal at 1000 nm is proposed for tracking coke formation and burning. The darkening rate varies with CO2 concentration in the feed, indicating a higher reactivity of propane to produce more coke under CO2-assisted conditions.

1. 自1933年以来，铬氧化物催化剂在工业应用、研究重点（如催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制）方面经历了演变。这些催化剂广泛应用于乙烯聚合、有机化合物氧化、烃类氢化脱氢、正丁烷异构化以及氨选择性催化还原NOx。近年来，它们被用于含CO2条件下各种烃类的氧化脱氢，以提高丙烯产率并稳定催化剂。研究集中在理解CO2在脱氢中的作用，促进其微弱的氧化性质，以及铬物种之间的还原机制。

4. 催化剂的主要活性与存在可还原的铬位点形成的氧化还原循环CrOx(氧化位点)/CrOx1(还原位点)相关。这种循环在氧化脱氢中起作用，非氧化条件下丙烷脱氢过程中的Cr3+和Cr2+物种是活性位点。非还原铬物种（CrOy）也可能参与非氧化路径。逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS）在红氧化和非氧化铬位点上发生，通过消耗氢气增强丙烯产率。

5. 催化剂的部分失活主要由焦炭形成引起，导致碳氢化合物的过度裂解和碳化。这个过程使催化剂变暗，可以通过原位UVvis DR光谱法监测。1000 nm波长下UVvis DR信号的强度被提议用于跟踪焦炭的形成和燃烧。焦炭形成速率随CO2在进料中的浓度变化，表明在CO2辅助条件下丙烷的更高活性导致更多焦炭的生成。
