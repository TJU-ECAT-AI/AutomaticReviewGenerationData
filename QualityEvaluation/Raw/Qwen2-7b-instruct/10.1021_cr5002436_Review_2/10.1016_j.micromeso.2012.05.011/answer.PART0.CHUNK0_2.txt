[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[3] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content."
[4] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[5] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[6] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[7] "The resultant Cr2+ and Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles responsible for high catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials."
[8] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with advancements in industrial applications, research focus areas, and understanding of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, and others like dehydroisomerization, selective catalytic reduction, and oxidative dehydrogenation. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting effective support materials, understanding promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. The catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts varies with chromium loading and species. Below 7 wt.% of Cr, mainly Cr6+ species dominate, while above this, Cr6+ and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3 coexist. The catalytic activity rises with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species.

3. In situ UVvis DR studies show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr2+ and Cr3+ species at the start of the dehydrogenation process, triggering redox cycles that contribute to high catalytic activity.

4. Partial deactivation of catalysts is attributed to excessive coke formation, which affects the catalyst's performance over time.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在工业应用、研究重点领域、结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制等方面取得了进展。关键工业应用包括乙烯聚合、有机化合物氧化、烃类氢化脱氢、异构化、选择性催化还原和氧化脱氢。研究重点集中在优化催化剂结构、识别活性位点、选择有效支撑材料、理解促进剂效应以及阐明反应机制。

2. 铬氧化物基催化剂的催化活性随着铬负载和物种的变化而变化。在低于7 wt.%的Cr下，主要为Cr6+物种，而高于此值，则同时存在Cr6+和以结晶a-Cr2O3形式存在的聚集Cr3+物种。随着高电荷Cr物种数量的增加，催化活性提高。

3. 在原位UVvis DR研究中，发现Cr6+物种在脱氢过程开始时迅速被还原为Cr2+和Cr3+物种，触发红ox循环，这是导致高催化活性的原因。

4. 催化剂的部分失活归因于过量焦炭形成，这影响了催化剂的性能随时间的衰减。
