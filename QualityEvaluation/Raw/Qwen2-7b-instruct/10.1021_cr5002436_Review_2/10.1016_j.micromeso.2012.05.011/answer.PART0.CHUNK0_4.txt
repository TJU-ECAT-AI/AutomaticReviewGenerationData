[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content. In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[3] "The catalytic performance of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts was compared with the results obtained for the Cr/SBA-1 catalysts prepared by the direct method and reported by us previously."
[4] "In both cases the yield rises sharply at a low Cr content and remains almost constant for the catalysts obtained by impregnation, whereas in the case of the catalysts obtained by the direct method the yield of propene drops rapidly above 3.5 wt.% of Cr."
[5] "The primary reason of deactivation during the propane dehydrogenation reaction is indeed coke formation."
[6] "Similar good thermal stability has been reported in the case of other mesoporous chromium catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes in the presence and absence of CO2."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were primarily used in ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, and hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Key industrial applications include the Phillips process for ethene polymerization, oxidation of various organic compounds, and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Research focus areas encompass structure optimization, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, inclusion of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms.

2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved through advancements in preparation techniques, modification of support materials, and understanding of the structure-activity relationships. This includes the development of mesoporous materials like SBA-1, which offer enhanced surface area and improved dispersion of chromium species. 

3. The research focus areas include the investigation of the oxidation state and structures of chromium species on the catalyst surface, which are influenced by factors such as the type of chromium precursor, preparation conditions, chromium content, and properties of the support material. High surface area supports facilitate the stabilization of redox chromium species due to increased adsorption sites.

4. The performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes varies with chromium loading. The impregnation method yields catalysts with better catalytic performance than those prepared by the direct method. This is attributed to the higher number of redox chromium species obtained through the impregnation method.

5. The primary reason for the deactivation of chromium oxide-based catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction is coke formation. Irreversible deactivation due to pore structure destruction or the formation of inactive species has a minor impact.

6. Other mesoporous chromium catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes, both in the presence and absence of CO2, exhibit similar good thermal stability characteristics. This indicates that the catalysts maintain their performance under various reaction conditions.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展。最初，它们主要用于乙烯聚合、有机化合物氧化和烃类的氢化脱氢。关键工业应用包括菲利普斯过程中的乙烯聚合、有机化合物的氧化以及烃类的氢化脱氢。研究重点领域涵盖结构优化、活性位点识别、支持材料选择、促进剂的加入以及反应机制的阐明。

2. 铬氧化物基催化剂通过改进制备技术、修改支撑材料以及深入理解结构-活性关系而发展。这包括使用如SBA-1这样的多孔材料，它们提供了增强的比表面积和铬物种的更好分散。

3. 研究重点领域包括探索表面铬物种的氧化状态和结构，这些状态受多种因素的影响，如铬前体类型、制备条件、铬含量以及支撑材料的性质。高表面面积支撑物由于增加了吸附位点而有利于稳定还原性铬物种。

4. 在脱氢过程中，铬氧化物基催化剂的性能随铬负载变化。浸渍法得到的催化剂在催化性能上优于直接法制备的催化剂。这是由于浸渍法能够获得更多的可还原铬物种。

5. 铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中失效的主要原因是焦炭形成。由于孔结构破坏或形成不活性物种导致的不可逆失活影响较小。

6. 其他多孔铬催化剂用于在存在和不存在CO2的情况下脱氢烷烃，表现出相似的良好的热稳定性特性。这表明催化剂能够在各种反应条件下保持其性能。
