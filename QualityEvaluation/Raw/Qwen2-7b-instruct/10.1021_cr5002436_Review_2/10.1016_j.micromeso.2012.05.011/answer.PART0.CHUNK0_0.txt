[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content."
[3] "In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[4] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[5] "The catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[6] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[7] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydroisomerization of n-butane, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia. Research focuses on optimizing the structure of the catalysts, enhancing dispersion of active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms.

2. The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by improvements in their structure and the nature of active sites. Chromium species such as Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr3+ contribute to their effectiveness in various processes. The presence of these species varies depending on the chromium loading, influencing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

3. In the calcined catalysts, chromium species are primarily stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+. The structure and oxidation state of these species are influenced by the total chromium content (Crtotal).

4. At lower chromium loadings, Cr6+ species, mainly in the form of chromates and dichromates, dominate. Above 7 wt.% Cr, both Cr6+ species in dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3 coexist.

5. The catalytic performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts improves with the increase in the number of high-valent Cr species, enhancing their activity in dehydrogenation processes.

6. The rapid reduction of Cr6+ species to Cr2+ and Cr3+ during dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2, indicates their critical role in the redox cycles that drive the catalytic activity.

7. Partial deactivation of the catalysts is attributed to excessive coke formation, which negatively impacts their performance and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制等方面取得了进步。关键工业应用包括乙烯聚合、有机化合物氧化、烃类氢化脱氢、异丁烷脱异构化以及氨选择性催化还原NOx。研究重点在于优化催化剂结构、增强活性位点分散、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明详细的反应机理。

2. 铬氧化物基催化剂的演变是通过提高其结构和活性位点的特性驱动的。铬物种如Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和晶格化的Cr3+对各种过程的有效性至关重要。这些物种的存在取决于总铬含量（Crtotal）。

3. 在煅烧的催化剂中，铬物种主要稳定为Cr6+物种、分散的Cr5+和聚集体Cr3+。这些物种的结构和氧化状态受总铬含量的影响。

4. 在较低的铬负载下，Cr6+物种，主要以铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在，占主导地位。超过7 wt.% Cr时，Cr6+物种以二铬酸盐形式存在，同时聚集体Cr3+物种以结晶a-Cr2O3的形式共存。

5. 随着高电荷Cr物种数量的增加，铬氧化物基催化剂的催化性能提高，增强了它们在脱氢过程中的活性。

6. 炔烃脱氢过程中，无论是否存在CO2，Cr6+物种在过程开始时迅速还原到Cr2+和Cr3+，这表明它们在红ox循环中的关键作用，该循环驱动催化剂活性。

7. 催化剂的部分失活归因于过量焦炭形成，这会负面影响其在脱氢反应中的性能和效率。
