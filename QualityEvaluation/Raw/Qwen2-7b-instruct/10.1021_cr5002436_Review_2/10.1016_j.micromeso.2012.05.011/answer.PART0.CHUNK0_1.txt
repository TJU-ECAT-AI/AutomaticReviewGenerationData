[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content."
[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[4] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[5] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[6] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include ethene polymerization, oxidation of organic compounds, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydroisomerization of n-butane, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia.

2. Research focuses on understanding how the oxidation state and structure of chromium species on the surface of catalysts change with varying chromium content, affecting their activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

3. Below 7% chromium loading, mainly high-valent chromium species such as Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate. Above this, both Cr6+ and crystalline a-Cr2O3 form, contributing to increased catalytic activity.

4. The catalysts' activity rises with an increase in the number of high-valent chromium species, enhancing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. During the dehydrogenation of propane, chromium(III) species are rapidly reduced to chromium(II) and chromium(IV) species, which are crucial for the catalytic activity.

6. Partial catalyst deactivation is primarily attributed to excessive coke formation, which affects the catalyst's performance over time.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，研究重点集中在理解其结构、活性位点、支持材料优化、促进剂探索以及反应机制阐明。主要工业应用包括乙烯聚合、有机化合物氧化、烃类氢化脱氢、正丁烷异构化以及氨选择性催化还原。

2. 研究集中在了解不同铬含量下表面催化剂上铬物种的氧化状态和结构变化，影响它们在脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。

3. 当铬负载低于7%时，主要为高电荷铬物种，如以铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+占据主导地位。高于此值时，不仅存在Cr6+，还形成结晶态a-Cr2O3，这增加了催化剂的活性。

4. 随着高电荷铬物种数量的增加，催化剂的活性提升，提高了其在脱氢反应中的性能。

5. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，三价铬物种迅速还原为二价和四价物种，这些物种对催化活性至关重要。

6. 催化剂部分失活主要是由于过量焦炭生成导致，这影响了催化剂的长期性能。
