[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, with significant advancements in industrial applications and research focus areas. These areas include the development of catalyst supports, understanding of active sites, the incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. The key industrial applications involve the conversion of alkanes into alkenes, particularly through dehydrogenation processes.

2. The structure of chromium oxide catalysts is crucial in determining their performance. This includes the dispersion of chromium species on the support material, which affects the accessibility of substrates and the formation of active sites. The coordination environment of chromium ions also plays a vital role in their catalytic activity.

3. Support materials play a significant role in enhancing the stability and activity of chromium oxide catalysts. These materials can alter the dispersion of chromium species, affect the surface area and porosity, and influence the overall structure of the catalyst.

4. Promoters can improve the catalytic properties of chromium oxide catalysts by altering the electronic structure, promoting specific reaction pathways, or enhancing the dispersion of chromium species. They can also influence the stability and longevity of the catalyst.

5. Reaction mechanisms often involve the interplay between the structure of the catalyst, the coordination environment of chromium ions, and the specific substrate. For example, in dehydrogenation processes, chromium ions undergo reduction-oxidation cycles, which facilitate the transformation of alkanes into alkenes. The specific coordination states of chromium ions, such as Cr(VI) and Cr(III), are critical in these catalytic processes.
