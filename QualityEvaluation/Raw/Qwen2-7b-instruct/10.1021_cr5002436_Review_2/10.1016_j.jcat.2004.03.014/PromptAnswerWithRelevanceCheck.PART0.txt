The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has led to significant advancements in industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. Initially, chromium oxide catalysts were used for producing lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. However, their usage has expanded to include oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen, and now, utilization of carbon dioxide as a source of carbon in dehydrogenation processes. 

Research focuses on understanding the structure of catalysts, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. For instance, in the context of dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, chromium species play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Chromium species, specifically Cr(VI) and Cr(III), undergo a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate the active Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from the less active Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

The key industrial applications include refining and petrochemical processes where alkanes are converted into alkenes. The research emphasis lies on optimizing catalyst properties, enhancing selectivity and yield, and understanding the dynamics of active sites and reaction pathways. The inclusion of carbon dioxide as a reactant opens new avenues for sustainable chemistry, aligning with environmental concerns and resource utilization.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展在工业应用中取得了显著进展，特别是在脱氢化过程中。最初，铬氧化物催化剂用于通过烷烃的脱氢产生乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。然而，它们的应用范围已经扩展到包括烷烃的氧化脱氢、与其他有机化合物的氧气氧化，以及现在利用二氧化碳作为碳源的脱氢化过程。

研究重点在于理解催化剂的结构、识别活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂，并阐明反应机制。例如，在使用二氧化碳进行丙烷脱氢的过程中，铬物种在反应机制中起着关键作用。铬物种，尤其是Cr(VI)和Cr(III)，经历Cr(VI)O4四面体与Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环，促进丙烷转化为丙烯。氧气和二氧化碳可以将不活跃的Cr(III)O6八面体再生为活跃的Cr(VI)O4四面体，从而促进丙烷脱氢。

关键的工业应用包括石油精炼和石油化工过程，其中烷烃被转化为烯烃。研究的重点在于优化催化剂性能、提高选择性和产率、理解和反应路径动态。将二氧化碳作为反应物的引入为可持续化学开辟了新的途径，符合环境考虑和资源利用的需求。

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with industrial applications focusing on dehydrogenation processes. Key research areas include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, utilizing promoters, and exploring reaction mechanisms.
2. The significance of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes, notably through endothermic reactions controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium. Chromium-based catalysts are widely utilized for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. Additionally, they are investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes or the oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen.
3. The research focuses on developing catalysts with desirable properties by introducing metals like chromium into mesoporous materials such as MCM-41. This includes understanding the locations and coordination environments of chromium species, their role in catalytic reactions, and the effects of support materials and promoters on the catalyst's performance.
4. The dehydrogenation process involves the conversion of propane to propene with a high selectivity, typically above 90%. Carbon dioxide acts as a mild oxidant in these reactions, enhancing the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The presence of chromium species, particularly chromium(VI) and chromium(III), plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.
5. The regeneration of deactivated chromium oxide catalysts is possible through treatments with oxygen or carbon dioxide. Oxygen facilitates the reoxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI), while carbon dioxide can also regenerate chromium(VI) tetrahedra from reduced chromium(III) octahedra, albeit with lower efficiency.
6. During the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, chromium(VI) tetrahedra are active in converting propane to propene, which is then reduced to chromium(III) octahedra. This reduction-oxidation cycle between chromium(VI) and chromium(III) species is essential for the efficient dehydrogenation process over chromium-MCM-41 catalysts.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming indispensable in numerous industrial applications. They have been widely utilized in processes like dehydrogenation, where they facilitate the conversion of alkanes into alkenes. The focus has shifted from understanding the basic chemistry to exploring how catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms can be optimized for specific applications.

2. In the context of dehydrogenation processes, chromium oxide catalysts have been refined to improve their activity and selectivity. The study focuses on the development of more efficient catalysts, such as Cr-MCM-41, which show high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. This process results in the production of propene with a high conversion rate and selectivity.

3. The research emphasizes the coordination environment of chromium species on the catalyst. It is suggested that during the dehydrogenation reactions, chromium species exist in tetrahedral coordination forming active monochromate species. These species are reduced to less active polychromate species in octahedral coordination. This reduction-oxidation cycle is crucial for the dehydrogenation process over chromium catalysts.

4. The regeneration of deactivated chromium catalysts is another key area of research. It involves treatments with gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which can restore the catalyst's activity. Oxygen is particularly effective in regenerating the active tetrahedral Cr(VI)O4 species, while carbon dioxide can also regenerate these species but with lower efficiency.
