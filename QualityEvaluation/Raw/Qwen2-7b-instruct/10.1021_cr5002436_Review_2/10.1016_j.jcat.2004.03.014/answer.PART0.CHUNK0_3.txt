[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in industrial applications and research focused on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications have expanded to include a wide range of chemical transformations, particularly in the petrochemical industry. The research focus has centered on optimizing catalyst properties, such as enhancing selectivity, improving stability, and increasing activity. This has led to the development of new materials and synthesis techniques, such as direct hydrothermal synthesis, to create catalysts with tailored structures and functionalities. Promoters have been identified and incorporated to modify the catalyst's behavior, while the study of active sites and their coordination environments has shed light on the underlying reaction mechanisms. The integration of these advancements has significantly contributed to the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
