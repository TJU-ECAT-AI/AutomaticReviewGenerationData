[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with industrial applications focusing on dehydrogenation processes. Key research areas include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, utilizing promoters, and exploring reaction mechanisms.
2. The significance of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes, notably through endothermic reactions controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium. Chromium-based catalysts are widely utilized for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. Additionally, they are investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes or the oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen.
3. The research focuses on developing catalysts with desirable properties by introducing metals like chromium into mesoporous materials such as MCM-41. This includes understanding the locations and coordination environments of chromium species, their role in catalytic reactions, and the effects of support materials and promoters on the catalyst's performance.
4. The dehydrogenation process involves the conversion of propane to propene with a high selectivity, typically above 90%. Carbon dioxide acts as a mild oxidant in these reactions, enhancing the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The presence of chromium species, particularly chromium(VI) and chromium(III), plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.
5. The regeneration of deactivated chromium oxide catalysts is possible through treatments with oxygen or carbon dioxide. Oxygen facilitates the reoxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI), while carbon dioxide can also regenerate chromium(VI) tetrahedra from reduced chromium(III) octahedra, albeit with lower efficiency.
6. During the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, chromium(VI) tetrahedra are active in converting propane to propene, which is then reduced to chromium(III) octahedra. This reduction-oxidation cycle between chromium(VI) and chromium(III) species is essential for the efficient dehydrogenation process over chromium-MCM-41 catalysts.

1. 自1933年以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了演变，其在脱氢过程中的工业应用集中在将烷烃转化为烯烃。关键研究领域包括理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、选择支撑材料、利用促进剂以及探索反应机制。
2. 铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中显著性的原因在于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃，特别是通过控制热力学平衡的吸热反应。铬基催化剂广泛用于通过脱氢相应的烷烃来生产低级烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。此外，它们还被研究用于脱氢较低烷烃或与其他有机化合物与氧气的氧化。
3. 研究的重点在于通过将诸如铬这样的金属引入介孔材料中，如MCM-41，开发具有理想性能的催化剂。这包括了解铬物种的位置和配合环境、它们在催化反应中的作用以及支持材料和促进剂对催化剂性能的影响。
4. 脱氢过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，通常选择性高于90%。二氧化碳作为轻度氧化剂，在这些反应中增强烷烃的脱氢作用。铬物种，特别是六价铬和三价铬，在脱氢过程中起着至关重要的作用。
5. 催化剂的失活可以通过氧或二氧化碳的处理进行再生。氧气有助于三价铬还原为六价铬，而二氧化碳也能从三价铬八面体中再生六价铬四面体，尽管效率较低。
6. 在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢过程中，六价铬四面体是活性的，将丙烷转化为丙烯，随后被还原为三价铬八面体。六价铬与三价铬物种之间的还原-氧化循环对于铬-MCM-41催化剂上的脱氢过程至关重要。
