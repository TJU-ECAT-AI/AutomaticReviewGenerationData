[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming indispensable in numerous industrial applications. They have been widely utilized in processes like dehydrogenation, where they facilitate the conversion of alkanes into alkenes. The focus has shifted from understanding the basic chemistry to exploring how catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms can be optimized for specific applications.

2. In the context of dehydrogenation processes, chromium oxide catalysts have been refined to improve their activity and selectivity. The study focuses on the development of more efficient catalysts, such as Cr-MCM-41, which show high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. This process results in the production of propene with a high conversion rate and selectivity.

3. The research emphasizes the coordination environment of chromium species on the catalyst. It is suggested that during the dehydrogenation reactions, chromium species exist in tetrahedral coordination forming active monochromate species. These species are reduced to less active polychromate species in octahedral coordination. This reduction-oxidation cycle is crucial for the dehydrogenation process over chromium catalysts.

4. The regeneration of deactivated chromium catalysts is another key area of research. It involves treatments with gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which can restore the catalyst's activity. Oxygen is particularly effective in regenerating the active tetrahedral Cr(VI)O4 species, while carbon dioxide can also regenerate these species but with lower efficiency.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，成为了众多工业应用不可或缺的一部分。它们广泛应用于诸如脱氢等过程，能够促进烷烃转化为烯烃。研究重点已经从基础化学理解转移到如何优化催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制以适应特定应用。

2. 在脱氢过程中，针对铬氧化物催化剂进行了改进，以提高其活性和选择性。研究集中在开发更高效的催化剂，如Cr-MCM-41，它在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢过程中表现出高活性。该过程能产生高转化率和选择性的丙烯。

3. 研究强调催化剂上铬物种的配位环境。研究建议，在脱氢反应中，存在四面体配位形成活性单铬酸盐物种的铬物种。这些物种被还原为在八面体配位中较不活跃的多铬酸盐物种。这种还原-氧化循环对于铬催化剂的脱氢过程至关重要。

4. 失活的铬催化剂的再生是另一个关键的研究领域。这涉及到使用气体如氧气和二氧化碳进行处理，以恢复催化剂的活性。氧气特别有效于再生活性的四面体Cr(VI)O4物种，而二氧化碳也可以再生这些物种，但效率较低。
