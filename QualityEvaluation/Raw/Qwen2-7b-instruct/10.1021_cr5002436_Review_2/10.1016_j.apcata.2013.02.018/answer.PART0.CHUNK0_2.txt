[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane over the chromia/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalyst is an industrially important route for producing isobutene, a vital component for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tert-butyl ether), which are increasingly demanded as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline in the worldwide recently."
[2] "Dehydration is typically performed at relatively high temperatures and low pressures due to thermodynamic requirements."
[3] "However, reaction conditions, such as high temperature, usually facilitate the thermal cracking and coke formation, thus result in reduced isobutane conversion, decreased isobutene selectivity, and severe deactivation of the catalyst."
[4] "It is therefore the key issue to develop catalyst with the ability of possessing high and stable activity and selectivity and suppressing the coke formation during the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobu- tane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years."
[6] "Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation."
[7] "De Rossi et al. reported that Cr6+ species with minor amount of Cr5+ species were produced on -Al2O3 and silica carriers, whereas Cr6+ and Cr5+ species in comparable amounts on the zirconia support."
[8] "Cavani et al. observed that the relative concentration of surface Cr3+ and Cr6+ species increased with the increasing chromia loading."
[9] "They also found that only Cr3+ species were produced over the surface of the reduced catalyst."
[10] "It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation."
[11] "The similar reports for this method were employed to prepare the nickel catalysts in the reaction of methane decomposition."
[12] "MIL-101 (Cr3F(H2O)2O(BDC)3·nH2O, n = 25, MIL = Matrial Institut Lavoisier, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) is one of the porous Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)."
[13] "Its two large mesopores with 2.9 and 3.4 nm pore diameters together with its considerable chromium content (21.7%) stimulate us to prepare the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst using it as a molecular flask and chromium precursor."
[14] "In the current work, the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst with large specific surface area and high pore volume was synthesized by utilizing the MIL-101 framework as a molecular host and chromium precursor, aluminium isopropoxide (Al(i-OC3H7)3) as the aluminium precursor."
