<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane over the chromia/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalyst is an industrially important route for producing isobutene, a vital component for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tert-butyl ether).</p>
<p>The nature of the surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia depends on the type of the support, the chromium content, and calcination treatment.</p>
<p>The researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. The addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation.</p>
<p>The utilization of the method that the precursor containing aluminum source impregnated into the Cr-based framework to prepare the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation has been paid little attention so far. MIL-101 (Cr3F(H2O)2O(BDC)3·nH2O) is one of the porous Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a large BET specific surface area about 4100 m2 g1 and high pore volume about 2.0 cm3 g1.</p>
<p>In the current work, the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst with large specific surface area and high pore volume was synthesized by utilizing the MIL-101 framework as a molecular host and chromium precursor, aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-OC3H7)3) as the aluminum precursor.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They have been pivotal in various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. The key focus areas include the development of catalyst structures, identification of active sites, optimization of support materials, incorporation of promoters like alkali metals, and understanding the reaction mechanisms involved.

2. Industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts primarily revolve around the production of MTBE and ETBE, which are essential components in the synthesis of unleaded gasoline to enhance octane numbers. These catalysts enable the dehydrogenation of isobutane, a crucial step in the production process.

3. Research efforts have concentrated on enhancing the activity and selectivity of these catalysts while simultaneously mitigating the risks associated with thermal cracking and coke formation. The addition of alkali metals, such as potassium, to the catalyst system often results in improved selectivity towards olefin products and increased resistance to deactivation.

4. Preparation methods for chromium oxide catalysts, including impregnation techniques, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation, and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), have been widely explored for the synthesis of catalysts that can effectively handle alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), like MIL-101, as precursors offers unique advantages in synthesizing chromium oxide catalysts with tailored properties. These frameworks provide a high surface area, large pore volume, and a controlled amount of metal ions, facilitating the creation of catalysts with improved dehydrogenation performance.
