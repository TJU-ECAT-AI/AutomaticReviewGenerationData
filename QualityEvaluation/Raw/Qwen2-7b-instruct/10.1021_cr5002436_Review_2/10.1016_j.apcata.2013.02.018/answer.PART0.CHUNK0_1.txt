[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane over the chromium oxide/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalyst is an industrially important route for producing isobutene, a vital component for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tert-butyl ether), which are increasingly demanded as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline in the worldwide recently."
[2] "Dehydration is typically performed at relatively high temperatures and low pressures due to thermodynamic requirements. However, reaction conditions, such as high temperature, usually facilitate the thermal cracking and coke formation, thus result in reduced isobutane conversion, decreased isobutene selectivity and severe deactivation of the catalyst."
[3] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromium is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromium is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content, and calcination treatment."
[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literature, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method, and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydration."
[5] "MIL-101 (Cr3F(H2O)2O(BDC)3·nH2O, n 25, MIL = Material Institut Lavoisier, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) is one of the porous Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). It has a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area about 4100 m2 g−1 and high pore volume about 2.0 cm3 g−1."
[6] "The two large mesopores with 2.9 and 3.4 nm pore diameters together with its considerable chromium content (21.7%) stimulate us to prepare the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst using it as a molecular flask and chromium precursor."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, with advancements focusing on industrial applications, structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the production of isobutene, a key component in MTBE and ETBE, used as octane number boosters in unleaded gasoline. Research emphasizes the importance of surface chromium speciation, influenced by the type of support, chromium content, and calcination treatment. Various preparation methods, including ALE, co-precipitation, and EISA, have been utilized for alkanes dehydration. The use of MIL-101, a porous Cr-based metal-organic framework, with its large BET surface area and high pore volume, has enabled the synthesis of mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts with large surface areas and high pore volumes for isobutane dehydrogenation.
