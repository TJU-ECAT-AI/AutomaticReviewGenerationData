[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane over the chromia/alumina (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalyst is an industrially important route for producing isobutene, a vital component for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tert-butyl ether), which are increasingly demanded as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline in the worldwide recently."
[2] "Dehydration is typically performed at relatively high temperatures and low pressures due to thermodynamic requirements. However, reaction conditions, such as high temperature, usually facilitate the thermal cracking and coke formation, thus result in reduced isobutane conversion, decreased isobutene selectivity, and severe deactivation of the catalyst."
[3] "It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation."
[4] "The nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content, and calcination treatment."
[5] "MIL-101 (Cr3F(H2O)2O(BDC)3·nH2O, n = 25, MIL = Material Institut Lavoisier, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) is one of the porous Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). It has a large BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) specific surface area about 4100 m2 g−1 and high pore volume about 2.0 cm3 g−1."
[6] "In the current work, the mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst with large specific surface area and high pore volume was synthesized by utilizing the MIL-101 framework as a molecular host and chromium precursor, aluminium isopropoxide (Al(i-OC3H7)3) as the aluminium precursor."
[7] "The chromia loadings, addition of potassium oxide (K2O), and calcination temperature of the catalyst were investigated in detail over the isobutane dehydrogenation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were used in various industrial processes, including petrochemical production. Over time, the focus has shifted towards optimizing their structure, identifying the key active sites, exploring suitable support materials, understanding the role of promoters like alkali metals, and elucidating the reaction mechanisms. This evolution has been driven by the need to enhance efficiency, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

2. Industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the production of isobutene for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline. Research focus areas encompass improving catalyst stability against deactivation caused by high temperatures and coke formation, optimizing the structure of catalysts for better performance, and developing new catalyst supports that enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Key research focuses include the nature of surface chromia, which significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity. Surface speciation of chromia depends on factors such as the type of support material, chromium content, and calcination conditions.

4. The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically MIL-101, as a molecular host for chromium precursors offers potential for the synthesis of chromium oxide catalysts with tailored properties. This approach aims to improve the dispersion of chromium species, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The addition of alkali metals, particularly potassium, is studied for its effect on promoting the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improving the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation. This is crucial for maintaining high conversion rates while reducing unwanted side reactions.

6. The synthesis of mesoporous chromium oxide-alumina catalysts, using frameworks like MIL-101 as a molecular host, enables the creation of catalysts with enhanced specific surface areas and pore volumes. These properties contribute to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

7. Detailed investigations into chromia loadings, potassium oxide addition, and calcination temperatures aim to optimize the catalyst's performance parameters, such as isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity, for efficient and selective dehydrogenation reactions.
