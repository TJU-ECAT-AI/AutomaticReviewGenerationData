[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "Adjusting the conditions can bring the reaction toward equilibrium in steam reform- ing, where synthesis gas (H2 and CO) is produced."
[3] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensi- tive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."
[4] "The problem is to both activate the strong CH bonds and, under the same conditions,"

The document does not provide specific details about the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it suggests that new low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries are needed to improve upon traditional methods like cracking and reforming. These new chemistries aim to address the challenge of activating strong CH bonds under conditions that are insensitive to common natural gas impurities. The document focuses on the need for process chemistry improvements to make more efficient use of natural gas as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals, rather than detailing the history or specifics of chromium oxide catalysts.

文档并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的具体演变情况。然而，它表明需要新的低温、高产率烷烃转化化学来改善传统的裂解和重整方法。这些新化学旨在解决在对常见天然气杂质不敏感的条件下激活强CH键的问题。文档侧重于提高使用天然气作为燃料和化学品生产原料的效率需求，而不是详细描述铬氧化物催化剂的历史或具体细节。
