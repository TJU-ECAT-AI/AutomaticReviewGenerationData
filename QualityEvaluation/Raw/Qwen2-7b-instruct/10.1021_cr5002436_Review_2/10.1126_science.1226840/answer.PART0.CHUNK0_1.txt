[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."
[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[4] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."
