[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."
[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
</quotes>

Natural gas, composed largely of methane, is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation due to the lack of cost-effective methods to convert it into higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products. However, advancements in process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation, have allowed a fraction of the heavier alkanes in natural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be converted into more valuable chemical products. Steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, with 15% of them not being high-value chemicals. Steam reforming, another process for converting natural gas, is costly and requires high operating pressures and temperatures, posing challenges for heat transfer and coke management in expensive reactors. Overall efficiencies are typically 75% or lower.

天然气，主要由甲烷组成，主要用于加热和电力发电，因为缺乏将天然气转化为更高价值的化学中间体和液体产品的经济有效方法。然而，过程化学的进步，包括自由基途径或催化部分氧化，已经允许一部分较重的烷烃（乙烷、丙烷和丁烷）在天然气中转化为更有价值的化学产品。蒸汽裂解乙烷会产生一系列产品，其中15%不是高价值化学品。蒸汽重整是另一种转化天然气的过程，成本较高，需要高压和高温（15至40大气压，700至1000摄氏度），对热传递和焦炭管理提出了挑战，在昂贵的反应器中。总体效率通常为75%或更低。

The document does not provide specific details about the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it suggests that new low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries are needed to improve upon traditional methods like cracking and reforming. These new chemistries aim to address the challenge of activating strong CH bonds under conditions that are insensitive to common natural gas impurities. The document focuses on the need for process chemistry improvements to make more efficient use of natural gas as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals, rather than detailing the history or specifics of chromium oxide catalysts.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To address the limitations of current natural gas conversion methods, new process chemistries are required. These chemistries should enable the activation of strong carbon-hydrogen bonds under conditions that prevent complete combustion to carbon dioxide, thereby facilitating the production of higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products. The development of low-temperature, efficient conversion methods that are insensitive to typical natural gas impurities is crucial for improving the overall efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of natural gas utilization. By doing so, we can reduce our dependence on oil and lower the shipping costs associated with oil transportation, making natural gas a more sustainable and economical alternative to petroleum.
