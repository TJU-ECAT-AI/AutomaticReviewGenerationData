[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[3] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensi- tive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

To address the limitations of current natural gas conversion methods, new process chemistries are required. These chemistries should enable the activation of strong carbon-hydrogen bonds under conditions that prevent complete combustion to carbon dioxide, thereby facilitating the production of higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products. The development of low-temperature, efficient conversion methods that are insensitive to typical natural gas impurities is crucial for improving the overall efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of natural gas utilization. By doing so, we can reduce our dependence on oil and lower the shipping costs associated with oil transportation, making natural gas a more sustainable and economical alternative to petroleum.

为了应对当前天然气转换方法的局限性，需要开发新的过程化学。这些化学反应应该能够在不完全燃烧至二氧化碳的情况下激活强碳-氢键的条件下进行，从而促进更高价值的化学中间体和液体产品的生产。发展低温、高效转换方法，并且对典型天然气杂质不敏感是提高整体效率和降低环境影响的关键。通过这样做，我们可以减少对石油的依赖并降低石油运输的成本，使天然气成为石油的可持续替代品，更具经济性和环保性。
