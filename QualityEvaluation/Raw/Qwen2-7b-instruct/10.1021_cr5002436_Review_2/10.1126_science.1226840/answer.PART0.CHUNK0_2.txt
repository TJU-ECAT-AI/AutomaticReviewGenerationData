[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "Further innovations should increase the efficiency and expand the uses of these products and may also lead to ways to harness methane, which is typically between 70 and 90% of the carbon in natural gas."
