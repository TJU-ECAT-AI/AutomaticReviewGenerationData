[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chemicals has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source."
[2] "There are two types of dehydrogenation: simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Recently, research on chromium-based catalysts has tended to be directed toward oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or air as an oxidant."
[3] "Carbon dioxide is a promising nonconventional oxidant (or co-feed gas) for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene 4-7 and light alkanes (C2C4) to alkenes. 8-11 The CO2 serves as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst."
[4] "In our previous work, 27 we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2. This system had several interesting properties. The activity and life of the catalysts depended on the type and the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support."
[5] "The TPR profiles of the four Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, a sharp and clear reduction peak was observed in the more active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(190), H-ZSM-5(1900)], but no peaks or only very small peaks were detected in the less active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(29), H-ZSM-5(90)]."
[6] "Moreover, studies by Weckhuysen et al. 29 have shown that chromium oxide interacts more strongly with aluminum oxide than with silica, forming tetrahedral Cr6+ species. Thus with high Al content zeolites, strong interactions of Cr with Al may interfere with the incorporation of the Cr into the zeolite framework and also with the Cr redox chemistry."
[7] "On the basis of the results of the above-mentioned analyses, we suggest the following reaction scheme for the dehydrogenation of ethane over the active Cr catalysts. The reaction proceeds through a redox cycle involving Cr6+ = O (possibly Cr5+ = O) and Cr3+ species. In fact, a Cr redox cycle can be observed at 773823 K, which is lower than the temperature of ethane dehydrogenation (923 K26)."
[8] "Indeed, the reduction of that species to Cr3+ was demonstrated by TPR analysis. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the high-oxidation-state species was likely Cr6+ (possibly Cr5+)."
[9] "An important role of CO2 is removing carbon by oxidation from the surface of the Cr/H-ZSM-5."

They have become increasingly focused on oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly using oxygen or air as oxidants. Research has also explored the use of unconventional oxidants like carbon dioxide for dehydrogenation reactions. Carbon dioxide is seen as a promising medium for supplying heat, enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes, and removing coke formed on catalyst surfaces.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the production of chemicals from natural gas, polymerization, and oxidation reactions. Prominent research focuses on the structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium is often supported on zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, which allows for efficient dehydrogenation reactions when using carbon dioxide as a co-feed gas.

3. The life and activity of chromium catalysts depend on the specific type and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support. High-silica H-ZSM-5 zeolites with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio greater than 190 are preferred for their ease of preparation and high performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The redox chemistry plays a crucial role in these catalysts, with the Cr species undergoing a cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ states, facilitated by ethane and carbon dioxide treatments.

4. Chromium catalysts supported on zeolites, especially H-ZSM-5 with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, have shown promise in dehydrogenation reactions using carbon dioxide as a co-feed gas. The catalysts' activity is enhanced by the carbon dioxide, which also aids in removing carbon deposits on the surface, improving the catalyst's longevity and efficiency.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, initially used in petrochemical industries for processes such as hydroformylation and hydrogenation. Key industrial applications include refining, petrochemical production, and organic synthesis. Research focuses on catalyst structures, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium catalysts are particularly significant in dehydrogenation processes, especially oxidative dehydrogenation, where they utilize oxygen or air as oxidants. Carbon dioxide has emerged as a non-conventional oxidant for catalytic dehydrogenation, offering advantages in heat supply, enhancing alkane conversion, and coke removal.

2. The significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation efficiently. The catalysts can be characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis. These techniques help understand the structure, active sites, and redox cycles of chromium species. The high-silica H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio greater than 190 is favored for its ability to support high-oxidation-state chromium species, which are crucial for oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The role of carbon dioxide in chromium oxide-based catalysts is multifaceted. It acts as an oxidant to remove carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, improving deactivation resistance. Additionally, CO2 assists in the rapid desorption of products from the surface, enhancing efficiency. The redox cycle involving chromium species, facilitated by ethane and CO2, is essential for the catalyst's high activity in dehydrogenation processes.

4. The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts includes terminal Cr6+ = O species with a tetrahedral structure, which can interconvert to a Cr3+ state. These species are supported on zeolite supports like H-ZSM-5, with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios facilitating the incorporation of chromium. The redox cycle, characterized by reduction to Cr3+ by ethane and subsequent reoxidation to Cr6+ by CO2, plays a critical role in the catalyst's performance. The presence of mononuclear Cr5+ oxide species, even at low chromium contents, indicates the stability of chromium species against hydrogen treatment and their reactivity with carbon dioxide.

5. The activation energy of the formation rate of ethylene over chromium oxide-based catalysts varies depending on the catalyst's structure and the co-feed gas used. For instance, the Cr/H-ZSM-5 (1900) catalyst shows a lower activation energy compared to the Cr/H-ZSM-5 (29) catalyst, indicating a different reaction pathway. The role of carbon dioxide in these systems is not only to remove carbon but also to influence the reaction mechanism and the state of chromium species on the catalyst surface.

6. The spectroscopic studies and thermogravimetric analysis reveal that the formula of the chromium species on the H-ZSM-5 support is CrO2.35, supporting a molar ratio of 57% Cr6+/Cr3+. The regeneration of the CrO double bond on the Cr species after CO2 treatment indicates the reoxidation of reduced chromium species to a highly active state, highlighting the importance of the redox cycle in the dehydrogenation process.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在石油化工行业的应用逐渐增加。它们最初用于氢化和水合等过程，关键工业应用包括精炼、石油化工生产和有机合成。研究重点包括催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制。铬催化剂在脱氢过程中尤为重要，尤其是氧化脱氢，利用氧气或空气作为氧化剂。二氧化碳已发展成为乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯和轻烷烃脱氢制烯烃过程中的非传统氧化剂，提供热能供应、提高轻烷烃转化率，并作为清除催化剂表面焦炭的剂。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性在于其高效促进氧化脱氢的能力。通过温度程序还原（TPR）、温度程序氧化（TPO）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）分析等技术，可以理解铬物种的结构、活性位点和红ox循环。高硅铝比为190以上的H-ZSM-5沸石是支持高氧化状态铬物种的理想选择，这些物种对于氧化脱氢至关重要。在反应条件下，铬物种的氧化还原循环对于催化剂的性能起着决定性作用。

3. 二氧化碳在铬氧化物催化剂中的作用多种多样。它作为一种氧化剂去除催化剂表面的碳沉积，提高脱活抵抗性。此外，二氧化碳帮助快速从表面脱附产物，提高效率。铬物种的氧化还原循环，由乙烷和二氧化碳促进，对于催化剂的性能至关重要。

4. 铬氧化物催化剂的结构包括末端Cr6+ = O物种，具有四面体结构，能够互换为Cr3+状态。这些物种被支撑在H-ZSM-5等沸石上，高SiO2/Al2O3比有助于铬的集成。经过乙烷处理后，铬物种被还原为Cr3+状态，然后通过二氧化碳处理重新氧化为Cr6+状态。这表明，反应条件下的催化剂表面状态对反应机制和铬物种状态有影响。

5. 根据催化剂结构和共馈气体的不同，乙烯形成速率的活化能会有所不同。例如，Cr/H-ZSM-5 (1900)催化剂的活化能低于Cr/H-ZSM-5 (29)催化剂，表明存在不同的反应途径。二氧化碳在这些系统中的作用不仅在于去除碳，还会影响反应机制以及催化剂表面上铬物种的状态。

6. 光谱研究和热重分析揭示了H-ZSM-5支撑物上的铬物种的化学式为CrO2.35，支持Cr6+/Cr3+摩尔比为57%。二氧化碳处理后，Cr物种双键的再生表明还原的铬物种容易被重新氧化到高度活跃的状态，突出了氧化还原循环在脱氢过程中的重要性。
