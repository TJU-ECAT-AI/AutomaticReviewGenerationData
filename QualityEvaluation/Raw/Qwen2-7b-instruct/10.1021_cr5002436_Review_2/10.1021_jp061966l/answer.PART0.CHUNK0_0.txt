[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chemicals has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source."
[2] "There are two types of dehydrogenation: simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Recently, research on chromium-based catalysts has tended to be directed toward oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or air as an oxidant."
[3] "Carbon dioxide is a promising nonconventional oxidant (or co-feed gas) for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene 4-7 and light alkanes (C2C4) to alkenes. 8-11 The CO2 serves as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst."
[4] "In our previous work, 27 we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2. This system had several interesting properties. The activity and life of the catalysts depended on the type and the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support."
[5] "The TPR profiles of the four Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, a sharp and clear reduction peak was observed in the more active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(190), H-ZSM-5(1900)], but no peaks or only very small peaks were detected in the less active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(29), H-ZSM-5(90)]."
[6] "Moreover, studies by Weckhuysen et al. 29 have shown that chromium oxide interacts more strongly with aluminum oxide than with silica, forming tetrahedral Cr6+ species. Thus with high Al content zeolites, strong interactions of Cr with Al may interfere with the incorporation of the Cr into the zeolite framework and also with the Cr redox chemistry."
[7] "On the basis of the results of the above-mentioned analyses, we suggest the following reaction scheme for the dehydrogenation of ethane over the active Cr catalysts. The reaction proceeds through a redox cycle involving Cr6+ = O (possibly Cr5+ = O) and Cr3+ species. In fact, a Cr redox cycle can be observed at 773823 K, which is lower than the temperature of ethane dehydrogenation (923 K26)."
[8] "Indeed, the reduction of that species to Cr3+ was demonstrated by TPR analysis. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the high-oxidation-state species was likely Cr6+ (possibly Cr5+)."
[9] "An important role of CO2 is removing carbon by oxidation from the surface of the Cr/H-ZSM-5."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, initially used for polymerization, oxidation, and photocatalysis. They have become increasingly focused on oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly using oxygen or air as oxidants. Research has also explored the use of unconventional oxidants like carbon dioxide for dehydrogenation reactions. Carbon dioxide is seen as a promising medium for supplying heat, enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes, and removing coke formed on catalyst surfaces.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the production of chemicals from natural gas, polymerization, and oxidation reactions. Prominent research focuses on the structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium is often supported on zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, which allows for efficient dehydrogenation reactions when using carbon dioxide as a co-feed gas.

3. The life and activity of chromium catalysts depend on the specific type and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support. High-silica H-ZSM-5 zeolites with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio greater than 190 are preferred for their ease of preparation and high performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The redox chemistry plays a crucial role in these catalysts, with the Cr species undergoing a cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ states, facilitated by ethane and carbon dioxide treatments.

4. Chromium catalysts supported on zeolites, especially H-ZSM-5 with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, have shown promise in dehydrogenation reactions using carbon dioxide as a co-feed gas. The catalysts' activity is enhanced by the carbon dioxide, which also aids in removing carbon deposits on the surface, improving the catalyst's longevity and efficiency.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，最初用于聚合、氧化和光催化反应。研究重点逐渐转向使用氧气或空气作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢过程。二氧化碳也被视为一种有前景的非传统氧化剂，用于乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯和轻烷烃（C2-C4）转化为烯烃。二氧化碳在提供脱氢反应所需的热能、增强轻烷烃的平衡转化以及去除催化剂表面形成的焦炭方面发挥着重要作用。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的主要工业应用包括从天然气生产化学品、聚合、氧化反应等。研究重点集中在催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料和反应机制上。铬通常被支持在沸石上，如高硅H-ZSM-5，这允许在使用二氧化碳作为共喂料气体时进行高效的脱氢反应。

3. 铬催化剂的寿命和活性取决于具体类型的沸石支持材料和SiO2/Al2O3比率。SiO2/Al2O3比大于190的高硅H-ZSM-5沸石因其易于制备和高脱氢性能而被优选。催化剂的红ox化学起着关键作用，Cr物种在Cr6+和Cr3+状态之间经历循环，由乙烷和二氧化碳处理促进。

4. 支撑在高SiO2/Al2O3比的H-ZSM-5沸石上的铬催化剂在使用二氧化碳作为共喂料气体时显示出在脱氢反应中的潜力。二氧化碳不仅增强了催化剂的活性，还帮助去除表面沉积的碳，从而提高催化剂的寿命和效率。
