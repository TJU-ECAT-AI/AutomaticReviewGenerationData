[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chemicals has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source."
[2] "Chromium is one of the key components in many types of catalysts, including polymerization catalysts 15-18 (Phillips catalyst), oxidation catalysts, 19 and photocatalysts. 20,21"
[3] "In the active catalysts, Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 > 190), Cr6+ = O, or possibly Cr5+ = O was the catalytic species on the zeolite support."
[4] "In our previous work, 27 we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."
[5] "The TPR profiles of the four Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, a sharp and clear reduction peak was observed in the more active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(190), H-ZSM-5(1900)], but no peaks or only very small peaks were detected in the less active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(29), H-ZSM-5(90)]."
[6] "The FTIR spectra of the Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 29, 90, 190, 1900) catalysts are presented in Figure 3. The peaks at 810 and 1060 cm-1 are due to the zeolite support. The peak at 925 cm-1, is assigned to the stretching vibrations of the CrO double bond 30-33 and was observed in the spectra of the two most active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(190), H-ZSM-5(1900)]."
[7] "On the basis of the results of the above-mentioned analyses, we suggest the following reaction scheme for the dehydrogenation of ethane over the active Cr catalysts. The reaction proceeds through a redox cycle involving Cr6+ = O (possibly Cr5+ = O) and Cr3+ species."
[8] "Moreover, because the Cr species exist as Cr3+ species on the Al rich H-ZSM-5 zeolite, a suitable zeolite support should have high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (>190)."
[9] "The Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species was reduced to a Cr3+ species by ethane treatment, and the reduced Cr species was reoxidized to the Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species by CO2 treatment at the relatively low temperature at 673 K. The Cr redox cycle is important for a high dehydrogenation rate."
