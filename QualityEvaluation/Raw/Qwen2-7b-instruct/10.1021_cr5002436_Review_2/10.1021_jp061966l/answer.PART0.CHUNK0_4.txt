[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chemicals has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source."
[2] "Ethane is typically converted by thermal cracking into ethylene, one of the most important intermediates in the chemical industry."
[3] "Thermal conversion is a well-established process in the petrochemical industry. From an energy-savings standpoint, catalytic dehydrogenation is superior to thermal dehydrogenation."
[4] "There are two types of dehydrogenation: simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, research on chromium-based catalysts has tended to be directed toward oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or air as an oxidant."
[6] "Carbon dioxide is a promising nonconventional oxidant (or co-feed gas) for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene."
[7] "The CO2 serves as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst."
[8] "The role of CO2 on the catalyst surface is to remove carbon by oxidation."
[9] "The spectra of the 5% and 10% samples exhibited very small peaks at 985 and 1000 cm-1, which may be assigned to the stretching vibrations of the CrO bond in mononuclear Cr5+ oxide species."
[10] "The peak for the CrO double bond was observed even in the 2% Cr content sample."
[11] "The only uncertainty in these results is that there are no Cr5+ oxide reference materials for comparison of the spectra."
[12] "The ΔH of the reaction Cr2O3 + 3 CO2  2 CrO3 + 3 CO is calculated from the ASTM Chetah program to be +951 kJ mol-1 at 823 K."
[13] "The reaction mechanism may be the same whether CO2 or He co-feed gas is used on the same state of the catalyst."
[14] "These results agree with the reaction test for 6.5 h and the spectroscopic studies discussed earlier."
[15] "The reduction of that species to Cr3+ was demonstrated by TPR analysis."
[16] "On the basis of the current results, as well as our previous research, we believe that a high-oxidation-state Cr species is effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation."
[17] "A Cr redox cycle (Scheme 1) may occur during the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, initially used in petrochemical industries for processes such as hydroformylation and hydrogenation. Key industrial applications include refining, petrochemical production, and organic synthesis. Research focuses on catalyst structures, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium catalysts are particularly significant in dehydrogenation processes, especially oxidative dehydrogenation, where they utilize oxygen or air as oxidants. Carbon dioxide has emerged as a non-conventional oxidant for catalytic dehydrogenation, offering advantages in heat supply, enhancing alkane conversion, and coke removal.

2. The significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes lies in their ability to facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation efficiently. The catalysts can be characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis. These techniques help understand the structure, active sites, and redox cycles of chromium species. The high-silica H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio greater than 190 is favored for its ability to support high-oxidation-state chromium species, which are crucial for oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The role of carbon dioxide in chromium oxide-based catalysts is multifaceted. It acts as an oxidant to remove carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, improving deactivation resistance. Additionally, CO2 assists in the rapid desorption of products from the surface, enhancing efficiency. The redox cycle involving chromium species, facilitated by ethane and CO2, is essential for the catalyst's high activity in dehydrogenation processes.

4. The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts includes terminal Cr6+ = O species with a tetrahedral structure, which can interconvert to a Cr3+ state. These species are supported on zeolite supports like H-ZSM-5, with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios facilitating the incorporation of chromium. The redox cycle, characterized by reduction to Cr3+ by ethane and subsequent reoxidation to Cr6+ by CO2, plays a critical role in the catalyst's performance. The presence of mononuclear Cr5+ oxide species, even at low chromium contents, indicates the stability of chromium species against hydrogen treatment and their reactivity with carbon dioxide.

5. The activation energy of the formation rate of ethylene over chromium oxide-based catalysts varies depending on the catalyst's structure and the co-feed gas used. For instance, the Cr/H-ZSM-5 (1900) catalyst shows a lower activation energy compared to the Cr/H-ZSM-5 (29) catalyst, indicating a different reaction pathway. The role of carbon dioxide in these systems is not only to remove carbon but also to influence the reaction mechanism and the state of chromium species on the catalyst surface.

6. The spectroscopic studies and thermogravimetric analysis reveal that the formula of the chromium species on the H-ZSM-5 support is CrO2.35, supporting a molar ratio of 57% Cr6+/Cr3+. The regeneration of the CrO double bond on the Cr species after CO2 treatment indicates the reoxidation of reduced chromium species to a highly active state, highlighting the importance of the redox cycle in the dehydrogenation process.

3. 二氧化碳在铬氧化物催化剂中的作用多种多样。它作为一种氧化剂去除催化剂表面的碳沉积，提高脱活抵抗性。此外，二氧化碳帮助快速从表面脱附产物，提高效率。铬物种的氧化还原循环，由乙烷和二氧化碳促进，对于催化剂的性能至关重要。

4. 铬氧化物催化剂的结构包括末端Cr6+ = O物种，具有四面体结构，能够互换为Cr3+状态。这些物种被支撑在H-ZSM-5等沸石上，高SiO2/Al2O3比有助于铬的集成。经过乙烷处理后，铬物种被还原为Cr3+状态，然后通过二氧化碳处理重新氧化为Cr6+状态。这表明，反应条件下的催化剂表面状态对反应机制和铬物种状态有影响。

5. 根据催化剂结构和共馈气体的不同，乙烯形成速率的活化能会有所不同。例如，Cr/H-ZSM-5 (1900)催化剂的活化能低于Cr/H-ZSM-5 (29)催化剂，表明存在不同的反应途径。二氧化碳在这些系统中的作用不仅在于去除碳，还会影响反应机制以及催化剂表面上铬物种的状态。

6. 光谱研究和热重分析揭示了H-ZSM-5支撑物上的铬物种的化学式为CrO2.35，支持Cr6+/Cr3+摩尔比为57%。二氧化碳处理后，Cr物种双键的再生表明还原的铬物种容易被重新氧化到高度活跃的状态，突出了氧化还原循环在脱氢过程中的重要性。
