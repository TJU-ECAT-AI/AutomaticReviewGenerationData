[1] "Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure."
[2] "The combination of different techniques (chemical analysis with Bunsen-Rupp method, ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS and quantitative/qualitative H2-TPR) in the characterization of the calcined catalysts revealed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports show structural properties similar to those on the conventional silicas, but a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using mesoporous supports due to their much higher SBET."
[3] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions: (i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[4] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[5] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."
[6] "In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in catalyst structure, active site development, support material optimization, promoter utilization, and reaction mechanism understanding. Key industrial applications have included the production of valuable petrochemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. Research focus areas have centered around improving catalyst activity and selectivity, understanding the role of different chromium species (Cr3+, Cr2+, and Cr6+) in the dehydrogenation process, the impact of support materials on catalyst performance, and the synergistic effects of co-catalysts like carbon dioxide (CO2).

Answer: The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has significantly advanced the field of petrochemical production, particularly in the synthesis of essential compounds like polypropylene, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. These catalysts have been optimized for better activity, selectivity, and stability through advancements in structure, active site engineering, and support material selection. Research efforts have concentrated on elucidating the roles of chromium species, especially Cr3+, Cr2+, and Cr6+, in the dehydrogenation process.
