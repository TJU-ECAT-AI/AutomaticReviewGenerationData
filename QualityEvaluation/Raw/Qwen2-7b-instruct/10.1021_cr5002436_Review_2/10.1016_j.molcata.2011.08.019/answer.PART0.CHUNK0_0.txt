1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Their key industrial applications and research focus areas involve the structure of the catalysts, the nature of active sites, the type of support materials, the role of promoters, and understanding reaction mechanisms. This includes studying how chromium species interact with silica surfaces, the dispersion of chromium, and the impact of chromium oxidation states on catalytic activity.

2. The catalysts investigated include chromium oxide on conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p and SiO2-a) with BET surface areas of 261 m2/g and 477 m2/g respectively, as well as mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structures having BET surface areas of 1181 m2/g and 750 m2/g respectively. These catalysts were prepared by impregnation with chromium nitrate.

3. The study compared the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports, including mesoporous sieves with cubic and hexagonal pore structures, and commercially available silica.

4. The presence of CO2 leads to simultaneous dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways for propane to produce propene.

5. Among the materials tested, those containing chromium or gallium showed the highest activity and selectivity.

6. CO2 negatively affects the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst but promotes the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

7. The activity of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts depends on factors such as chromium oxidation states, the structure of chromium species, and the interaction between chromium and silica.

8. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, chromium species in higher oxidation states, primarily as Cr6+ species, dominate.

9. The formation of the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, α-Cr2O3, is enhanced by high temperatures and excess water.

10. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the silica surface negatively impacts catalytic activity because not all chromium atoms are accessible to reactant molecules.

11. Moreover, α-Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, making it ineffective as a catalyst.

12. Achieving a high dispersion of chromium species is essential for obtaining high catalytic activity in chromium/silica systems.
