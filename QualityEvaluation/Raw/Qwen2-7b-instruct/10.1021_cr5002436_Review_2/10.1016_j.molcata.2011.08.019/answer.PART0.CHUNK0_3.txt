[1] "Many recent investigations have focused on dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "These investigations have been encouraged by a strong demand for propene,which has become one of the most important petrochemicals used for the production of a variety of polymers and chemical intermediates,such as:polypropylene,acrylonitile,OXO alcohols,isopropyl alcohol,acrylic acid and propylene oxide."
[3] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[4] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[5] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become indispensable in various industrial applications, notably in the production of petrochemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. 

2. The primary focus of research in this field has been on understanding and enhancing the catalytic properties of chromium oxide catalysts. This includes the investigation of their structure, the role of active sites, and the impact of support materials. Promoters, like CO2, have also garnered considerable interest, particularly in their ability to promote or inhibit reactions depending on the specific catalyst.

3. The presence of CO2 in dehydrogenation processes leads to simultaneous dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. This dual mechanism explains the efficiency and versatility of chromium oxide catalysts in converting propane to propene under CO2 conditions.

4. Chromium (Cr) and gallium (Ga) containing catalysts have emerged as the most active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. These materials offer superior performance compared to other investigated catalysts.

5. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials is influenced by several factors, including the oxidation state of Cr, the structure of the Cr species, and the interaction between Cr and silica. These factors are critical in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制等方面经历了显著发展。它们在生产聚丙烯、丙烯酸等各类聚合物和化学中间体等重要化工产品中发挥了关键作用。

2. 研究的重点在于理解并增强铬氧化物催化剂的催化性能。这包括对催化剂结构、活性位点和支撑材料影响的探索。二氧化碳作为促进剂在促进或抑制反应方面也引起了广泛关注，特别是其在不同催化剂上的不同效果。

3. 在二氧化碳存在下进行脱氢过程时，同时发生脱氢和氧化脱氢路径。这种双重机制解释了铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯的高效性和灵活性。

4. 含有Cr或Ga的催化剂在丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下转化为丙烯中表现出最高活性和选择性。这些材料在与其他研究催化剂相比时显示出优越的性能。

5. 铝硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物材料的催化活性受到多种因素的影响，包括Cr的氧化状态、Cr物种的结构以及Cr与硅酸盐的相互作用。这些因素对于确定催化剂的效率和选择性至关重要。
