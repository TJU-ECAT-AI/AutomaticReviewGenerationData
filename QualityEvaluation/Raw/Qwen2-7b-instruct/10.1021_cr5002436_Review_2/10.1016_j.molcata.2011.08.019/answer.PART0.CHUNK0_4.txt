The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has primarily centered around their industrial applications and research focus areas. These include understanding their structure, identifying the active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The key contributions to their significance in dehydrogenation processes involve:

1. **Structure**: Chromium oxide catalysts can exist in multiple oxidation states, such as Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+, which influence their activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

2. **Active Sites**: The active sites for dehydrogenation are believed to be the highly dispersed and fully accessible Cr species, particularly those in the higher oxidation states, especially Cr6+ species, which are crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

3. **Support Materials**: The use of high surface area mesoporous materials, like SBA-1 and SBA-15, as supports allows for better dispersion of chromium species, enhancing the catalyst's performance compared to conventional silica supports.

4. **Promoters**: CO2 acts as both a promoter and poison for certain catalysts, depending on the support material. For example, it suppresses the activity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 but promotes the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: The presence of CO2 influences the dehydrogenation process, leading to simultaneous dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. The Cr6+ species play a critical role in this process, acting as precursors for the active sites involved in nonoxidative pathways of propene formation.

6. **Optimization**: The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials depends on factors such as the type of chromium precursor, preparation conditions, chromium content, and the properties of the silica support, including its isoelectric point (IEP).

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变主要集中在它们在工业应用和研究重点领域的贡献。这些包括理解其结构、识别活性位点、优化支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。在脱氢作用过程中的显著贡献涉及：

1. **结构**：铬氧化物催化剂可以存在于多种氧化状态，如Cr3+、Cr5+和Cr6+，这影响了它们在脱氢反应中的活性和选择性。

2. **活性位点**：脱氢作用的关键活性位点被认为是高度分散且完全可访问的Cr物种，尤其是较高氧化状态的Cr物种，特别是Cr6+物种，在丙烷与CO2共存下的脱氢过程中至关重要。

3. **支撑材料**：使用高表面面积的介孔材料（如SBA-1和SBA-15）作为支撑物，允许更好地分散铬物种，相对于传统硅胶支撑物，这种做法提高了催化剂的性能。

4. **促进剂**：二氧化碳既作为催化剂的促进剂，也作为毒物，具体取决于支撑材料。例如，它抑制了Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的活性，但促进了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性。

5. **反应机制**：二氧化碳的存在影响了脱氢过程，导致同时发生脱氢和氧化脱氢途径。Cr6+物种在这一过程中扮演关键角色，作为非氧化途径中形成丙烯的活性位点的前体。

6. **优化**：二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物材料的催化活性依赖于多种因素，包括铬前体的类型、制备条件、铬含量以及二氧化硅支持物的特性，包括其等电点（IEP）。
