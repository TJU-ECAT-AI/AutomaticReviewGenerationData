          [1] "Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure."
          [2] "Using various physicochemical characterization techniques we investigated the influence of Cr loading and supports properties on the surface composition and Cr dispersion."
          [3] "In this work we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica."
          [4] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
          [5] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [6] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [7] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium-silica interaction."
          [8] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate."
          [9] "The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [10] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [11] "Moreover, crystalline α-Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."
          [12] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in catalyst structure, active site development, support material optimization, promoter utilization, and reaction mechanism understanding. These catalysts have played a crucial role in industrial applications such as the production of petrochemicals, notably polypropylene, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. Research has focused on improving catalyst activity and selectivity, understanding the role of different chromium species (Cr3+, Cr2+, and Cr6+) in the dehydrogenation process, the impact of support materials on catalyst performance, and the synergistic effects of co-catalysts like carbon dioxide (CO2). Key findings include the ability of chromium species to participate in alternative oxidative pathways for propene formation, the contrasting effects of CO2 on different chromium oxide catalysts, and the importance of achieving high dispersion of active sites for optimal catalytic performance.

          [2] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."
          [3] "In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts show contrasting effects when exposed to CO2. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 negatively impacts catalytic properties, whereas it exhibits a positive effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites can engage in alternative oxidative pathways for propene formation and participate in the consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

          铬氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳存在下显示出相反的作用效果。对于Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂，二氧化碳对催化性能产生负面影响，但对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂则显示出正向促进效果。在二氧化碳存在下，Cr3+和Cr2+位点可以参与丙烯形成的不同氧化途径，并参与逆水煤气转换反应中生成的氢气的消耗过程。
