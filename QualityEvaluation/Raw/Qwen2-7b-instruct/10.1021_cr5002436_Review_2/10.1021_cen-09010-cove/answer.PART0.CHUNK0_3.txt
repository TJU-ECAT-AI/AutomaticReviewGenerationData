[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Since last spring, five companies...have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Beyond large projects, nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[4] "For example, the rosy North American outlook was important to Indoramas $795 million purchase of an ethylene glycol plant in Clear Lake, Texas, from Old World Industries last month."
[5] "Chemical executives can be forgiven for having to get up to speed in short order."
[6] "Until 2005, shale deposits...were an eccentric source of natural gas."
[7] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[8] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[9] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons."
[10] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."

The shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, forcing executives to adapt and reevaluate their strategies. This shift has led to a surge in investments, as evidenced by plans from companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical to establish multi-billion-dollar complexes focusing on ethylene and derivative production. This development is in response to the abundance of ethane resources in North America, which is now more cost-effective than alternatives in many other regions, including Europe and Asia. This change in the industry landscape is driving significant expansions among producers, who are now looking to capitalize on the low raw material costs associated with natural gas liquids. As a result, the petrochemical sector in North America is experiencing a rebirth, characterized by a focus on utilizing ethane as a primary feedstock for ethylene production. While this transition has led to reduced production of coproducts like propylene, butadiene, and aromatics, the overall impact on the industry remains positive, with increased profitability and growth prospects.

页岩革命极大地影响了北美化工行业，迫使高管们重新评估他们的策略。这一转变导致了大量的投资增加，例如，雪佛龙菲利普化学、杜邦化学、福尔摩沙塑料、萨索和壳牌化学等公司宣布计划建立价值数十亿美元的大型复合体，专注于乙烯及其衍生物的生产。这种发展是基于北美丰富的页岩资源，这些资源在成本上比世界上许多其他地区（包括欧洲和亚洲）的石油资源更为经济。这促使行业发生变化，推动了生产商的大规模扩张，他们现在寻求利用天然气液体的低廉原材料成本。因此，北美化工部门正在经历一场复兴，其特点是重点利用乙烷作为乙烯生产的主原料。虽然这一过渡导致了丙烯、丁二烯和芳香族等副产品的产量减少，但从整体上看，行业仍然保持积极态势，盈利能力增强，并具有增长前景。
