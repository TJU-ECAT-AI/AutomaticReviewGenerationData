[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Since last spring, five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[4] "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
[5] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[6] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."
[7] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants arent making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[8] "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."
[9] "Novas Thomson expects North American output of polyethylene, the largest-volume ethylene derivative, to rise 1.5%-2.0%."
[10] "Thus, the market will see only incremental capacity additions until 2016."

The shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, leading to substantial changes in investment strategies and production practices. Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical have announced plans for new complexes focusing on the production of ethylene and its derivatives. Shale has emerged as a major source of natural gas, driving down prices and making natural gas liquids (NGLs) a predominant feedstock for petrochemical facilities. This shift has resulted in a substantial cost advantage for North American producers compared to those relying on petroleum-derived feedstocks, such as naphtha. Consequently, there is a growing trend towards investing in the region, with expectations for a continued prosperous period. Ethane cracking has become increasingly favored, impacting the production of coproducts like propylene, butadiene, and aromatics. Profit margins for ethylene have reached their highest level since 1988, and forecasts predict a moderate increase in the production of polyethylene, the largest-volume ethylene derivative. However, capacity additions are expected to be gradual until 2016.

页岩气革命已经显著地影响了北美化工行业，导致投资策略和生产实践发生了重大变化。Chevron Phillips Chemical、Dow Chemical、Formosa Plastics、Sasol和Shell Chemical等公司宣布计划建设新的综合体，专注于乙烯及其衍生物的生产。页岩已成为天然气的主要来源，推动价格大幅下降，使得天然气液体（NGLs）成为化工设施的主要原料。这种转变为北美生产商带来了与依赖石油衍生原料（如石脑油）的生产商相比的成本优势。因此，对地区的投资兴趣正在增加，预计会有一个长期繁荣的时期。乙烷裂解正变得越来越受欢迎，这影响了丙烯、丁二烯和芳香族化合物等副产品的生产。乙烯的利润率达到了1988年以来的最高水平，并预测聚乙烯（最大的乙烯衍生物）的产量将适度增长。然而，直到2016年，产能增加才会逐渐进行。
