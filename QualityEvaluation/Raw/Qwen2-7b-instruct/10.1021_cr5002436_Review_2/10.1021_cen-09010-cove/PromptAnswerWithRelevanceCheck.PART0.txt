The shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, leading to substantial changes in investment strategies and production practices. Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical have announced plans for new complexes focusing on the production of ethylene and its derivatives. Shale has emerged as a major source of natural gas, driving down prices and making natural gas liquids (NGLs) a predominant feedstock for petrochemical facilities. This shift has resulted in a substantial cost advantage for North American producers compared to those relying on petroleum-derived feedstocks, such as naphtha. Consequently, there is a growing trend towards investing in the region, with expectations for a continued prosperous period. Ethane cracking has become increasingly favored, impacting the production of coproducts like propylene, butadiene, and aromatics. Profit margins for ethylene have reached their highest level since 1988, and forecasts predict a moderate increase in the production of polyethylene, the largest-volume ethylene derivative. However, capacity additions are expected to be gradual until 2016.

COVER STORY
Experiences early in the previous decade taught the regions executives that their reliance on raw materials derived from natural gas to make ethylene put them at a cost disadvantage to the many other areas of the world that use petroleum-derived naphtha. Now ethane is so cheap that only the Middle East can produce ethylene more cost-effectively than North America can.
And while petrochemical companies in other regions, notably Europe, are strug gling to turn a profit, North American firms are raking in substantial returns.
Executives are learning to invest in North America again.

The shale boom has significantly impacted the North American petrochemical industry, forcing executives to adapt their strategies and embrace new investments. This shift has led to the development of multi-billion-dollar complexes for ethylene and derivatives production. Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemicals have disclosed plans for such large-scale projects. The abundance of low-cost raw materials has encouraged not only large-scale investments but also expansions across the industry to capitalize on reduced costs. Shale resources have become crucial in chemical deals, with examples such as Indorama's $795 million acquisition of an ethylene glycol plant in Texas. Chemical executives are quickly adapting to the new dynamics of the industry, recognizing the potential for growth and profitability. Until 2005, shale deposits were an unconventional source of natural gas, but advancements in drilling and fracturing techniques have transformed them into a significant contributor to the US natural gas supply. This has resulted in a substantial shift towards natural gas liquids as a primary feedstock, providing a significant cost advantage over traditional naphtha-derived feedstocks. As a result, US petrochemical facilities now rely heavily on natural gas liquids for their operations, making the industry more competitive globally. Despite the dominance of shale gas, the global financial turmoil, especially concerns over Greek debt, has affected the industry, causing fluctuations in prices and volumes. The North American petrochemical industry, with its higher operating rates, appears to be in a more advanced phase of recovery compared to global peers. The industry's reliance on natural gas liquids has increased significantly, with over 70% of US ethylene production now based on ethane. While cheap natural gas liquids offer substantial advantages, the industry faces challenges in maintaining a stable supply chain amidst uncertainties in financial markets and economic conditions. Gas exploration companies have responded to lower drilling activity, while the high prices of oil have maintained a premium for natural gas liquids, making them economically viable for chemical production. However, a sharp correction in oil prices could impact the drilling activities for natural gas liquids. Major companies such as Dow Chemical, LyondellBasell, and Sasol have announced plans for new crackers, emphasizing the importance of propylene in their strategies. Eastman Chemicals and LyondellBasell are among those investing in metathesis units to enhance propylene production. The anticipation of a downturn in the petrochemical business cycle in 2017 highlights the cyclical nature of the industry, despite the current positive trends.

页岩气革命对北美石化行业产生了深远影响，迫使高管们重新审视其战略并采取新举措。这一转变导致了数十亿美元大型乙烯和衍生物生产设施的开发。Chevron Phillips Chemical、Dow Chemical、Formosa Plastics、Sasol 和Shell Chemicals等公司公布了这样的大型项目计划。低原材料成本的丰富资源鼓励了不仅大规模投资，而且整个行业进行扩张，以利用成本降低的机会。页岩资源在化学交易中变得至关重要，例如Indorama以7.95亿美元收购德克萨斯州Clear Lake的乙二醇工厂。化学高管们迅速适应了新的行业动态，认识到增长和盈利潜力。直到2005年，页岩沉积物仍然是天然气的非常规来源，但钻探和压裂技术的进步将它们转变为美国天然气供应的主要贡献者。这导致对天然气液体作为主要原料的显著依赖，为美国石化设施提供了相对于传统石脑油衍生原料（如石脑油）的巨大成本优势。因此，北美石化设施现在主要依赖天然气液体运营，使行业在全球范围内更具竞争力。尽管页岩气的主导地位，全球金融动荡，特别是希腊债务违约的可能性，已经影响了行业，导致价格和数量波动。与全球同行相比，北美石化行业的运营率（整体乙烯产能利用率）约为90%，而全球平均水平约为87%。天然气价格的低廉促使勘探公司减少钻探活动，而油价的高昂确保了天然气液体比天然气高出健康的溢价，尽管相对于石油而言，这种溢价足以使其成为经济的化工原料。钻井商每百万英制单位可以收取高达11美元的额外费用。然而，如果出现油价大幅下跌的情况，可能会对天然气液体钻探活动产生重大影响。Dow Chemical是宣布新建裂解装置的第二家公司。丙烯在Dow的战略中占有重要地位。Dow计划建造第二个使用自己技术的丙烯装置。Eastman Chemicals的氧化物业务对丙烯有大量需求。同样，LyondellBasell正在德克萨斯州Channelview建设另一个甲基裂化单元。Sasol正在研究其路易斯安那州Lake Charles的裂解装置，该装置将拥有高达140万吨的产能。Shell也计划建造一个裂解装置，但与其他项目不同，其工厂位于东北部，旨在利用马塞勒斯页岩，一个从纽约州到西弗吉尼亚州延伸的地质构造。Formosa Plastics是最新宣布新建乙烯裂解装置的公司之一。Nova可能是这些公司中最雄心勃勃的。所有新增产能将在2017年前进入市场，美国很可能经历石化业务周期的衰退。尽管当前趋势呈现积极态势，行业仍面临金融市场的不确定性以及经济条件变化带来的挑战。
