<p>Executives are learning to invest in North America again. A decade ago, ex ecutives thought that the investment of capital in domestic petrochemical plants would be limited mostly to maintenance.</p>
<p>Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene.</p>
<p>Executives are more than happy to change their outlook given the long, prosperous period ahead.</p>
<p>The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components.</p>
<p>Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks means that ethylene plants are not making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to.</p>
<p>Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988.</p>
<p>North American producers felt the impact through some slippage in prices and volumes at a time when ethane costs were temporarily spiking.</p>
<p>Novas Thomson expects North American output of polyethylene, the largest-volume ethylene derivative, to rise 1.5%-2.0%.</p>
<p>LyondellBasell Chief Executive Officer James L. Gallogly disclosed that his company's European olefins output fell by 13% during the fourth quarter while profit margins slipped to nearly break-even levels.</p>
<p>Propylene is an important part of Dow's plan. The company recently inked a licensing agreement with Honeywell's UOP engineering unit for a propane dehydrogenation unit that would add 750,000 tons of propylene capacity in Texas by 2015.</p>
<p>Formosa Plastics is the latest firm to announce a new ethylene cracker. Last week, the company disclosed plans to build an 800,000-metric-ton-per-year ethylene cracker at its Point Comfort, Texas, site.</p>

The petrochemical industry in North America is undergoing significant changes due to the shale boom. Executives are now investing heavily in new complexes for ethylene and derivatives, reversing previous beliefs about limited capital investments in domestic plants. The main feedstock for these facilities is natural gas liquids, which are derived from shale gas. This shift has led to a cost advantage for North American producers compared to those relying on petroleum-derived feedstocks. Companies such as Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical have disclosed plans for multi-billion-dollar complexes. Profit margins for ethylene are at their highest level since 1988, despite some temporary slippage in prices and volumes due to ethane cost spikes. The industry expects North American output of polyethylene to rise by 1.5%-2.0%. Meanwhile, European producers, particularly in countries like Germany and Scotland, are experiencing declines in output and profitability, with some companies planning to close small production lines. Propylene is a crucial component in the industry's strategy, with companies like Dow investing in new propane dehydrogenation units to increase propylene capacity. Formosa Plastics has also announced plans for a new ethylene cracker in Texas.

北美石油化学工业正在经历由于页岩革命带来的重大变化。高管们现在正在大量投资新的乙烷和衍生物复合体，这与他们之前关于国内工厂资本投资有限的信念形成了鲜明对比。这些设施的主要原料是来自页岩气的天然气液体。这种转变使得北美生产商在与依赖石油衍生品如石脑油的生产商相比时获得了成本优势。公司如雪佛龙菲利普斯化工、杜邦化学、富士化工、萨索尔和壳牌化工已经公布了数十亿美元的新复合体建设计划。乙烷的利润在1988年以来达到最高水平，尽管价格和数量在短期内有所下滑，这是由于页岩气成本的暂时上涨导致的。预计北美聚乙烯产量将增长1.5%-2.0%。与此同时，欧洲生产商，特别是德国和苏格兰的生产商，正面临产出和盈利能力下降的问题，一些公司计划关闭小型生产线。丙烯是行业策略的关键部分，杜邦化工正在投资新的丙烷脱氢单元以增加丙烯产能。富士化工也宣布将在德克萨斯州建立一个新的乙烷裂解厂。
