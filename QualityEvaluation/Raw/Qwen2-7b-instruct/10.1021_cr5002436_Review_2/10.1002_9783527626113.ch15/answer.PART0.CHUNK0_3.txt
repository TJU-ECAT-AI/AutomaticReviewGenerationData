[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
[3] "The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration."
[4] "In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per - pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K."
[5] "The oxide surfaces have been subject to analysis by a wide range of techniques pre-, during and post-reaction."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced in both industrial applications and research focus areas. Initially used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes during World War II, these catalysts have been refined over decades. Industrial applications now include converting propane to propene, with commercial processes operating under conditions of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and 823 to 923 Kelvin. The catalysts' surfaces undergo detailed analysis using various techniques, encompassing X-ray powder diffraction, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. This multifaceted approach has led to advancements in understanding the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变在工业应用和研究重点领域取得了显著进展。最初用于二战期间丁烷转化为丁烯的过程，这些催化剂在过去几十年里得到了改进。现在，它们被应用于将丙烷转化为丙烯，商业过程在0.3至0.5大气压和823至923开尔文的条件下运行。催化剂表面使用包括X射线粉末衍射、紫外可见漫反射光谱、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱、电子自旋共振、红外光谱和温度程序还原等技术进行详细分析。这种多方面的研究方法导致了对催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的深入理解。
