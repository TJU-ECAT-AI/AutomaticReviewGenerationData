The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s [1] . A comprehensive review of the pre - 1954 literature can be found in Emmett
s book on catalysis [2] . The dehy- drogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C 3

K. Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high - octane aviation fuel.

Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as - prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species. At low loadings the +6 state is favored on alumina. On zirconia however Cr(V) was found to be
50% of the chromium present [22] . As loading increases the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α - Cr 2
O
3 .

A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example

(

) [10

, UV
- Visible diffuse refl ectance spectroscopy (
UV

X
- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (
XPS
) [11,12, 18] ,electron paramagnetic resonance (
EPR
) [12, 19] , infrared spectroscopy [10,20] and temperature programmed reduction (
TPR
) [16, 21] . Given the number of
15.4 Chromia  597

publications we will not review them all but will summarize the main conclusions from this body of work.

Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as - prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species.

The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers
[28] . In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence
[12, 24, 25, 29] . However, it has not been possible to defi nitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18] . In general spectroscopic analyses favor Cr(III), but quantifi cation of the reduction and re -
adsorption/absorption of oxygen suggests that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr 2
O
3 to CrO [26] .

1. Since the early 1930s, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromium oxide systems has been recognized as a catalytic process. This process involves converting propane to propene, which is highly endothermic, and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K. Commercial processes utilizing chromium oxide catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During World War II, chromium-alumina catalysts were employed for the dehydrogenation of butane to produce butenes, which were subsequently dimerized and hydrogenated to create high-octane aviation fuel.

2. Chromium can exist in various oxidation states, including II, III, V, and VI. In freshly prepared catalysts, the predominant species are the +III and +VI states. On zirconia, Cr(V) constitutes approximately 50% of the chromium present. As the loading increases, the surface species transition from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr₂O₃.

3. A diverse array of techniques has been utilized to analyze the nature of the oxide surface, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). These methods have collectively contributed to the understanding of the surface composition of chromium oxide catalysts.

4. Initially, Cr(II) was proposed as the active species by Sachtler and colleagues. However, more recent studies suggest that Cr(III) plays a prominent role as the active species. Despite this, it has not been definitively established that Cr(III) is the active site. Some research proposes a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair as the active species. Spectroscopic analyses generally favor Cr(III), though the reduction and re-adsorption/absorption of oxygen indicate that hydrogen reduction converts Cr₂O₃ to CrO.

1. 自上世纪30年代初以来，轻烷烃通过铬氧化物体系的脱氢反应被确认为催化过程。这一过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是一个高度吸热的过程，并且在低于1000 K的温度下是平衡限制的。超过60年的商业过程中，基于铬氧化物的催化剂一直被使用。在第二次世界大战期间，铬-氧化铝催化剂被用于将丁烷脱氢生成丁烯，然后将其二聚和氢化以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。

2. 铬可以存在于II、III、V和VI等氧化态。在新鲜催化剂中，主要物种是+III和+VI状态。在锆酸盐上，Cr(V)占铬总量的约50%。随着负载量增加，表面物种从单核铬酸盐过渡到多核铬酸盐再到α-Cr₂O₃。

3. 多种技术被用来分析氧化物表面的性质，包括X射线粉末衍射（XRD）、紫外可见漫反射光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、电子自旋共振（EPR）、红外光谱和温度程序还原（TPR）。这些方法共同推动了对铬氧化物催化剂表面组成的理解。

4. 初始时，Sachtler及其同事提出Cr(II)作为活性物种。然而，近期研究表明Cr(III)扮演着更为显著的活性物种角色。尽管如此，仍无法明确证明Cr(III)是活性位点。一些研究提议存在Cr(II)/Cr(III)对作为活性物种。光谱分析通常支持Cr(III)，但还原和再吸附/吸收氧的量化表明氢还原将Cr₂O₃转换为CrO。
