[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
[3] "The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration."
[4] "The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis."
[5] "In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle."
[6] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, and chromium nitrate."
[7] "As loading increases the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3."
[8] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, and chromium nitrate."
[9] "After calcination in air at 823 K, UV-visible analysis of a 6% w/w chrome oxide/γ-alumina revealed the presence of Cr(III) with bands at 280 nm (4 A2g 4 T1g [P]), 354 nm (4 A2g 4 T1g [F]), 454 nm (4 A2g 2 T2g), 590 nm (4 A2g 4 T2g), and 706 nm (4 A2g 2 Eg, 2 T1g)."
[10] "Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V), and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as-prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species."
[11] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers."
[12] "However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site."
[13] "Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."
[14] "In general spectroscopic analyses favor Cr(III), but quantification of the reduction and re-adsorption/absorption of oxygen suggests that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr2O3 to CrO."
[15] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C3D8 or [2H]C3H8) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced (2H2 or D2) catalyst."
[16] "The rate determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia was found to be the loss of the second hydrogen: CHads CHand3 7 3 6 () ( ) + () with an activation energy for propene formation of 72 7 kJ mol−1."
[17] "For butane dehydrogenation, 1-butene is the primary product."
[18] "Both systems deposit carbon, and when run for extended cycles under propane dehydrogenation polynuclear aromatics form."
[19] "Studies using isotopically labeled propane have shown that the route to the coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation goes through a C1 species, probably CH(a)."
[20] "The Raman spectrum is characteristic of polynuclear, aromatic carbon."

[24] "The situation with butane is similar but with significant differences. The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane."
[25] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[26] "Reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8% < 3.5% < 1% but reduction is complete for each sample by 873 K."
[27] "This difference in onset of reduction may be attributed to different reducibilities of vanadia species, monovanadates, polyvanadates, and V2O5 coexisting on the catalyst's surface."
[28] "This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction."
[29] "Using oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6."
[30] "The ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8% > 3.5% > 1%."
[31] "Once reduced, the 3.5%V sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation; however, the reduced 8%V sample did convert to a species that was similar to the original oxidation state."
[32] "In the in situ UV Raman study, V/θ-Al2O3 samples (0.03 V, 1.2 V, 4.4 V, and 14.2 V) that contain surface VOx species with different structures were treated in dilute butane flow at different temperatures and examined by Raman spectra measurements at each temperature."
[33] "At temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm−1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm−1 due to the V=O and VOAl modes of surface VOx species, respectively."
[34] "After butane dehydrogenation at 673 and 773 K, an intense band at 1601 cm−1 due to polyaromatic hydrocarbons develops."
[35] "The band at 1500 cm−1 is usually assigned to conjugated polyalkenes or cyclopentadienyl species."
[36] "The band at 1438 cm−1 is due to the bending mode of CH3/CH2 or CH in aromatic rings."
[37] "The two sharp bands at 1004 and 845 cm−1 are rarely reported for coke species, and thus one might ascribe them to surface VOx species."
[38] "The absence of an isotope shift on an 18O-exchanged V/θ-Al2O3 sample confirms that these bands are due to surface coke deposits."
[39] "As the dehydrogenation temperature is increased to 873 K, the intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm−1 decreases significantly."
[40] "The set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501, and 1603 cm−1 is also observed to grow simultaneously on all other V/θ-Al2O3 samples when treated in butane at high temperatures."
[41] "To aid the assignment of these bands, the adsorption and reaction of different C4 olefins were studied on the V/θ-Al2O3 samples via Raman spectroscopy."
[42] "Comparison of the spectrum from styrene with that after butane dehydrogenation at 673 K on 1.2 V (Figure 15.7) reveals a very similar set of bands."
[43] "Further Raman spectroscopy study of styrene on V/θ-Al2O3 samples heated to 873 K showed that the characteristic Raman bands of polystyrene disappear, owing to its decomposition."
[44] "Investigation of the catalytic surface with multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy should be helpful in determining the chemical nature of this surface carbon."
[45] "Microanalysis of a used 1.2 V catalyst for carbon and hydrogen gave a C:H value of 0.9 as per polystyrene monomer in agreement with the Raman spectra."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of industrial applications and research focus areas. Key areas include the development of catalyst structures, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, optimization of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications are primarily focused on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, with commercial processes based on chromium oxide catalysts having been operational for over 60 years. Research efforts aim at understanding the complex chemistry involved, particularly the role of chromium in different oxidation states and the surface properties that influence catalytic activity. The literature highlights the importance of catalyst regeneration, the design of commercial reactors, and the use of various techniques for characterization of the catalyst surfaces. 

2. The evolution of chromium oxide catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen advancements in the preparation methods, such as impregnation of alumina with chromium-containing solutions like ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, and chromium nitrate. The catalysts can exist in various oxidation states, with chromium(III) and chromium(VI) being the predominant species in as-prepared catalysts. The surface species change with the loading of chromium, transitioning from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3. The active species in the catalysts are believed to be chromium(III), though definitive proof is lacking. The deactivation mechanism involves the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, necessitating periodic regeneration by oxidation. 

3. Industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes and the production of high-octane aviation fuel during World War II. Modern applications involve processes such as propane to propene conversion in fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. These reactors manage deactivation and regeneration through a series of steps including dehydrogenation, steam purge, air re-heating, and coke burning. The catalysts are prepared by impregnation, and their performance is influenced by factors such as loading, support materials, and promoters. The literature emphasizes the complexity of the catalyst chemistry, including the role of chromium in different oxidation states, the formation of carbonaceous deposits, and the regeneration process through oxidation. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromium oxide catalysts involves the loss of hydrogen, leading to the formation of alkenes, with propane to propene conversion being highly exothermic and equilibrium-limited below 1000 K. The literature also discusses the impact of support materials and the presence of promoters on the catalyst's performance.

4. The structure-function relationship in chromium oxide catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation is complex and not yet fully understood. However, the literature provides insights into how the nature and amount of coke formed depend on the structure of the chromium oxide catalysts. Coke formation and its effects on catalyst deactivation are influenced by factors such as the catalyst's composition, loading, and support materials. The research focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind coke formation, identifying the structure of coke species, and exploring ways to mitigate deactivation. The literature reports on the use of various techniques like UV-Vis DRS, NMR, and Raman spectroscopy to analyze the catalysts and coke species, providing valuable information on the structure-function relationship.

5. The research on vanadia catalysts, despite their lack of commercial use, has been extensive, with a focus on understanding the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction conditions is directly related to catalytic performance. Vanadia catalysts are usually reduced during redox reactions, with reduced vanadia species proposed as active sites. The reduction of supported vanadia catalysts is studied using techniques like TPR, XPS, ESR, UV-Vis DRS, XAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. The literature highlights the challenges in using conventional Raman measurements to detect reduced vanadia species due to their small or near-zero Raman cross-section. Recent studies employing multiple excitation wavelengths in UV and visible regions have provided new insights into the molecular structure of supported vanadia species. The catalysts' structure-function relationship is established through combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM, and UV Raman investigations, showing a dependence of coke formation on the structure of vanadia catalysts.

6. The conclusions drawn from the literature emphasize the evolution of chromium oxide and vanadia catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation, highlighting their industrial significance and the ongoing research challenges. The complex chemistry of these catalysts, including the role of chromium and vanadium in different oxidation states, the surface properties influencing catalytic activity, and the mechanisms of coke formation and deactivation, remain areas of active investigation. The literature underscores the importance of understanding these aspects to improve catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity in alkane dehydrogenation processes.
