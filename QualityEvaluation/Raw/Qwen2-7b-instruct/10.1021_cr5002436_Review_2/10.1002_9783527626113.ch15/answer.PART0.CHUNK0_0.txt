[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s."
[2] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high - octane aviation fuel."
[3] "As was so often the case in the early years of the twentieth century, the dehydrogenation process using a chromia/alumina catalyst was fi rst developed and commercialized in Germany at Leuna."
[4] "There was also independent development by UOP (then Universal Oil Products ) in the United States, together with ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries ) in the UK."
[5] "The fi rst UOP - designed plant came on stream in Billingham, in the North - East of England, in 1940."
[6] "The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration."
[7] "Of specifi c interest in the present context is the following system that uses a chromium oxide catalyst."
[8] "The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."
[9] "The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%."
[10] "Typical catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium - containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate."

Answer:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized in dehydrogenation processes since the early 1930s. They have been widely adopted for the conversion of butane to butenes, which were further processed to produce high-octane aviation fuel. The development and commercialization of these catalysts occurred independently in Germany, the United States, and the UK during the Second World War.

2. The dehydrogenation process using chromium oxide catalysts has undergone significant advancements. Modern commercial reactors manage deactivation and regeneration through various methods. The Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process, for instance, uses a chromium oxide catalyst in a fixed-bed configuration. It operates on a cyclic basis, converting propane to propene, and is capable of achieving a high conversion efficiency per pass (around 50%).

Answer:

1. 自1930年代初以来，铬氧化物基催化剂就已用于轻烷烃的脱氢过程。它们广泛应用于将丁烷转化为丁烯，进而将其二聚和氢化以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。第二次世界大战期间，德国、美国和英国独立开发并商业化应用了这些催化剂。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢过程经历了显著的发展。现代商业反应器通过不同方法管理脱活与再生。Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN工艺使用铬氧化物催化剂在固定床配置下进行。它按周期运行，将丙烷转化为丙烯，并能实现每轮转化率约50%的高效转换。
