1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively utilized and studied since their discovery in 1933, particularly in industries involving the Phillips catalyst (Cr/SiO,). The catalysts feature visible Cr3+ (d3) and Cr5+ (d') ions that have been extensively characterized using electron paramagnetic resonance techniques.

2. Numerous studies based on electron paramagnetic resonance have been conducted on heterogeneous chromium catalysts, leading to a significant body of literature focusing on these catalysts' performance and properties.

3. Main findings from literature, primarily derived through visual analysis of experimental spectra, are outlined in Table 1. 

4. The y-signal intensity exhibits the Curie-Weiss law and the x - l  us. T plots, which indicate a true paramagnetic behavior down to 10 K, as measured by SQUID devices.

5. By combining the individually simulated y-, 6-, and /?-signals, the X- and Q-band spectra depicted in Fig. 5 can be accurately reconstructed.
