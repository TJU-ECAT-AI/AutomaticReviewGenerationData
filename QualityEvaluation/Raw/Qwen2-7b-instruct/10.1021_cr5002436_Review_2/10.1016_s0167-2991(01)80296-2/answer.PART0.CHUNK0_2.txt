Answer: 
Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly CrOx/A1203, have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They have become indispensable in various industrial processes, notably in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and in ethene polymerization. Extensive studies have been conducted on these catalysts using different characterization techniques, highlighting their importance. However, significant questions remain regarding their structure under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of their catalytic sites, reaction mechanisms, and the causes of their deactivation. The stability of these catalysts, especially under demanding and rapidly changing conditions, is crucial. The dehydrogenation process requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst to maintain efficiency, and the regeneration process involves the removal of coke. This study aimed to clarify the behavior of high chromium-loading CrOx/A1203 catalysts, focusing on both short-term and long-term performance, as the reasons for deactivation were still uncertain. Advanced analytical tools, such as online FTIR equipment, were utilized to monitor the catalytic activity over time during dehydrogenation, providing insights into the catalyst's behavior during both the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.
