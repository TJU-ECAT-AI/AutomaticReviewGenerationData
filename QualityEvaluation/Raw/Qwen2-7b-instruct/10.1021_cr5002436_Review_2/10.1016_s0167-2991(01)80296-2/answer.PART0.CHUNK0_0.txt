[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes."
[2] "CrOx/A1203 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and/-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiOe in ethene polymerisation."
[3] "Especially CrOx/A1203 has been the object of great interest, as recently reviewed by Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt [2]."
[4] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."
[5] "An essential feature of the dehydrogenation process is the frequent regeneration of the catalyst."
[6] "Because of the demanding and rapidly changing conditions, the structure of the dehydrogenation catalyst should be stable."
