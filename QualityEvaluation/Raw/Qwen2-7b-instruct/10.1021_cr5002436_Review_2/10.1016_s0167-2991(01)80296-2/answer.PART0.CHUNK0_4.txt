[1] "CrOx/A1203 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and/-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiOe in ethene polymerisation."
[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods."
[3] "However, it was recently shown [4,5] that the dehydrogenation activity of the CrOx/A1203 catalysts reaches its maximum value at chromium loadings between 14 and 16 wt-% in the dehydrogenation of/-butane, even though the amount of redox Cr 3+ levels off already at a chromium loading of about 8 wt-%."
[4] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this:1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were used in industrial processes such as the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and ethene polymerization. Their significance lies in their ability to facilitate these reactions efficiently. Research has focused on understanding their structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring the role of promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. Key applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, ethene polymerization, and various other industrial chemical transformations. Studies have aimed to enhance catalyst performance by refining their composition, improving their stability, and increasing their efficiency.

3. The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its performance. Chromium loading affects the catalyst's activity, with studies indicating that the dehydrogenation activity peaks at specific chromium loadings. Redox sites (Cr 3+) and non-redox sites (Cr 3) have been identified as active components, contributing to the catalytic process.

4. The stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is critical. Processes like migration of chromium sites into the alumina lattice and irreversible clustering of active species have been proposed as mechanisms leading to catalyst deactivation. Understanding these phenomena aids in developing more durable catalysts.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。它们最初用于工业过程，如轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）的脱氢和乙烯聚合。它们的重要性在于能够高效地促进这些反应。研究集中在理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、优化支持材料、探索促进剂的作用以及阐明反应机制上。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的主要应用包括轻烷烃的脱氢、乙烯聚合以及各种其他工业化学转化。研究旨在通过改进组成、提高稳定性和增强效率来提升催化剂性能。

3. 催化剂的结构对其性能至关重要。铬负载量影响催化剂的活性，研究表明，脱氢活性在特定的铬负载量下达到峰值。红氧化合物（Cr 3+）和非红氧化合物（Cr 3）被确认为活性成分，参与催化过程。

4. 在反应条件下催化剂的稳定性至关重要。将铬位点迁移到氧化铝晶格中和活性铬物种不可逆聚集体化等过程已被提出作为催化剂失活的机制。理解这些现象有助于开发更耐用的催化剂。
