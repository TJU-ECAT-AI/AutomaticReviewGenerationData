<p>CrOx/A1203 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and/-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiOe in ethene polymerisation.</p>
<p>Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods [ 1 ].</p>
<p>It is notable that the studies done on CrOx/A1203 catalysts have often been performed on samples with a lower chromium content than what is used on the industrial dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
<p>An essential feature of the dehydrogenation process is the frequent regeneration of the catalyst. During the dehydrogenation, the catalyst is fouled with coke. The short dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle enables the heat released in the burning of the coke to be used efficiently in the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>The activity of the catalysts was studied in the dehydrogenation of /-butane. The behaviour of the ALD and FB catalysts was quite different during a single dehydrogenation test run.</p>
<p>The Kissinger peak analysis [10] was performed for H2 consumption data. It gave the apparent activation energy values of 99 and 73 kJ/mol for the ALD and the FB catalyst, respectively.</p>
<p>The kinetic modelling of the TPR patterns was then performed with nonlinear regression analysis to test various reduction mechanisms [12]. The nuclei growth models (Avrami- Erofeev models) were adequate to describe the data, but the conventional models suggested that the dimension of the nuclei growth was different for the studied ALD and FB samples.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the five H2-TPR curves, between which the oxidation at 590° C was performed, showed that the decline in the amount of Cr 6+ was different for the two catalysts: the decline was faster with the catalyst prepared by ALD.</p>
<p>From all these results we may conclude that on the FB catalyst the redox sites are more scattered and structurally stable.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They are widely utilized in various industries, notably in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and in ethene polymerization. Industrial applications often involve studying catalysts with lower chromium content than those used in actual processes. Key research areas focus on understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. The behavior of catalysts in dehydrogenation processes cannot be attributed solely to one active site. Both redox and non-redox Cr3 sites contribute to catalytic activity, each with distinct characteristics. Research indicates that on the fluidized bed catalyst, redox sites are more dispersed and structurally stable, whereas on the ALD catalyst, Cr6 sites appear more mobile and prone to clustering, potentially transforming into less active non-redox species over time.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著发展。它们广泛应用于多个工业领域，特别是在轻烷烃如丙烷和丁烷的脱氢以及乙烯聚合中。工业应用通常涉及研究具有比实际过程使用的更低铬含量的催化剂。关键研究领域包括理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、优化支撑材料、探索促进剂效应以及阐明反应机制。

2. 在脱氢过程中，催化剂的行为不能仅归因于一个活性位点。红氧化物和非红氧化物Cr3位点都对催化活性有贡献，每种位点都有其独特的性质。研究表明，在流化床催化剂上，红氧化物位点更加分散且结构稳定，而在ALD催化剂上，Cr6位点似乎更易移动，并容易聚集成簇，可能转化为更不活跃的非红氧化物物种，从而解释催化剂的长期失活原因。
