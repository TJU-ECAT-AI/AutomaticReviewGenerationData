[1] "CrOx/A1203 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and/-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiOe in ethene polymerisation."
[2] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr 3+, also some non-redox Cr 3 could be responsible for the catalytic activity."
[4] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this:1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

Answer: Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their application to dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane, and ethene polymerization through the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiOe. Research focuses on understanding the catalyst's structure, identifying the nature of catalytic sites, exploring reaction mechanisms, and optimizing support materials and promoters to enhance performance and durability. Studies also delve into the role of both redox and non-redox Cr3 sites in catalysis, as well as the potential for irreversible clustering of active chromium species, which could transform reducible sites into less active forms, affecting catalyst longevity.

铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来，随着对其在脱氢化过程中的应用，已经经历了显著的发展。关键的工业应用包括丙烷和丁烷等轻烷烃的脱氢以及乙烯聚合，通过菲利普斯催化剂CrOx/SiOe。研究集中在理解催化剂结构、确定催化位点的性质、探索反应机制以及优化支持材料和促进剂以提高性能和耐久性。研究还深入探讨了催化活性的红氧化合物和非氧化物Cr3位点的作用，以及活性铬物种不可逆聚集体可能引起的催化剂失效的可能性，这可能导致可还原位点转变为活性较低的形式，影响催化剂的使用寿命。
