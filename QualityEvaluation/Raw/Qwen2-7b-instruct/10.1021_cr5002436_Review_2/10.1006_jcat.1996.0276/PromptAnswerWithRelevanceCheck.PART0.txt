[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1)."
[2] "The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."
[3] "The aim of our work was to study the growth of chromia on γ -alumina during the preparation of chromia/alumina catalysts from vapor phase by ALE and to explore the relationship between the surface species and the behav- ior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene."
[4] "The catalytically active material was found to be evenly distributed through the catalyst particles. Low energy ion scattering measurements showed that, up to 7.4 wt% of Cr, the Cr species was dispersed in a monolayer."
[5] "The results describe an increase in activity with chromium loading, from the low loadings where isolated CrOx species are assumed to exist even after reduction, to monolayer coverage and even above."
[6] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. Chromia/alumina catalysts have been studied intensively since the 1950s and 1960s, and they demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane.

2. The aim of the work presented was to investigate the growth of chromia on γ-alumina during the preparation of catalysts from vapor phase by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), focusing on the relationship between surface species and catalyst behavior in i-butane dehydrogenation.

3. The active material in the chromia/alumina catalyst was found to be evenly distributed throughout the particles, with chromium species dispersed in a monolayer up to 7.4 wt%.

4. Increasing chromium loading led to an increase in catalytic activity, suggesting that mononuclear chromium centers determine activity at low concentrations, and activity continues to rise even after monolayer coverage is exceeded.

5. The findings align with previous studies by De Rossi et al. and Gorritz et al., who also observed increased activity with chromium loading in the dehydrogenation of propane.

1. Chromia/alumina catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s due to their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenating light alkanes like propane and butane. Recent studies continue to explore these catalysts' properties.

2. The saturation level for the adsorption of chromium (Cr) during the ALE process was 0.8 Cr atoms per square nanometer (Cr/nm2). This level remained constant across repeated cycles, indicating a characteristic of the reagent/support interaction.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in catalyst preparation techniques, notably the introduction of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). This method allows for the precise control of surface chemistry and the creation of catalysts with tailored properties. Key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts involve the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane. Research focuses on understanding the structure of these catalysts, identifying the active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring the role of promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The catalysts are typically prepared using precursors like chromium(III) oxide or chromium(VI) oxide, but modern techniques like ALE offer enhanced control over the surface chemistry and distribution of active species. The high activity and selectivity of these catalysts make them crucial in petrochemical industries for processes such as alkane dehydrogenation,芳烃裂解, and the synthesis of olefins. The division in opinions regarding the valence state distribution of chromium oxide species at higher loadings suggests ongoing research into how the oxidation state affects catalytic activity and the potential for improved catalyst performance through optimized preparation methods and support materials.
