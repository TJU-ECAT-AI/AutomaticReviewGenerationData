[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1)."
[2] "The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."
[3] "The aim of our work was to study the growth of chromia on γ -alumina during the preparation of chromia/alumina catalysts from vapor phase by ALE and to explore the relationship between the surface species and the behav- ior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene."
[4] "The catalytically active material was found to be evenly distributed through the catalyst particles. Low energy ion scattering measurements showed that, up to 7.4 wt% of Cr, the Cr species was dispersed in a monolayer."
[5] "The results describe an increase in activity with chromium loading, from the low loadings where isolated CrOx species are assumed to exist even after reduction, to monolayer coverage and even above."
[6] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. Chromia/alumina catalysts have been studied intensively since the 1950s and 1960s, and they demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane.

2. The aim of the work presented was to investigate the growth of chromia on γ-alumina during the preparation of catalysts from vapor phase by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), focusing on the relationship between surface species and catalyst behavior in i-butane dehydrogenation.

3. The active material in the chromia/alumina catalyst was found to be evenly distributed throughout the particles, with chromium species dispersed in a monolayer up to 7.4 wt%.

4. Increasing chromium loading led to an increase in catalytic activity, suggesting that mononuclear chromium centers determine activity at low concentrations, and activity continues to rise even after monolayer coverage is exceeded.

5. The findings align with previous studies by De Rossi et al. and Gorritz et al., who also observed increased activity with chromium loading in the dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 自1950年代和1960年代以来，对含铬氧化铝催化剂的研究一直在持续，它们在轻烷烃如丙烷和丁烷的脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。

2. 工作的目标是通过原子层外延（ALE）方法研究在气相中合成含铬氧化铝催化剂过程中，氧化铝上氧化铬的生长，并探索表面物种与催化剂在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯行为之间的关系。

3. 催化剂中的活性材料被发现均匀分布在粒子中，至7.4 wt%，铬物种以单分子层形式分散。

4. 随着铬负载量的增加，催化活性也随之提升，表明即使在还原后假设存在孤立的CrOx物种的情况下，低负载量时单核铬中心也决定活性，且活性继续上升，即便超过单层覆盖率。

5. 这些发现与De Rossi等人的研究和Gorritz等人的研究结果相符，他们也观察到在丙烷脱氢过程中随着铬含量的增加，活性提升。
