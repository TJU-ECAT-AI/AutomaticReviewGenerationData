[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1)."
[2] "The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."
[3] "In the ALE process of Ni(acac)2 on alumina, a saturation level of 2.0 Ni/nm2 was reported."
[4] "However, a level of 90% was achieved rapidly, at Cr loadings as low as 1.32.5 wt%."
[5] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."
[6] "At low Cr concentrations, the activity of samples in which Hacac and Hthd blocking agents were used to ensure high dispersion of the CrOx species indicated that mononuclear Cr centers determine the catalytic activity."
[7] "The activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene was measured both at low Cr concentrations and above monolayer coverage."

1. Chromia/alumina catalysts have demonstrated high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenating light alkanes like propane and butane since the 1950s and 1960s. Research interest remains strong in recent years.

2. The saturation level for Ni(acac)2 on alumina is 2.0 Ni/nm2.

3. Chromium loading of 1.32.5 wt% allows achieving a conversion rate of 90%.

4. The increase in initial activity with chromium loading aligns with studies on propane dehydrogenation by De Rossi et al. and Gorritz et al.

5. At low chromium concentrations, the active sites are mononuclear chromium centers.

6. The dehydrogenation activity was measured across a range of chromium loadings, including below and above the monolayer coverage.

7. Studies included measurements of activity both at low chromium concentrations and above monolayer coverage.
