[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1)."
[2] "In most of these stud- ies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."
[3] "In contrast to this, the chro- mia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air."
[4] "These saturating and self-terminating reactions ensure a uniformdistributionofthechemisorbedspeciesthroughout the porous catalyst support."
[5] "The aim of our work was to study the growth of chromia on γ -alumina during the preparation of chromia/alumina catalysts from vapor phase by ALE and to explore the relationship between the surface species and the behav- ior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene."
[6] "In the interpretation of the results, note that the re- ported activity includes cracking and isomerization, which occurred in addition to dehydrogenation."
[7] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35)."
[8] "For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different char- acterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in catalyst preparation techniques, notably the introduction of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). This method allows for the precise control of surface chemistry and the creation of catalysts with tailored properties. Key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts involve the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane. Research focuses on understanding the structure of these catalysts, identifying the active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring the role of promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The catalysts are typically prepared using precursors like chromium(III) oxide or chromium(VI) oxide, but modern techniques like ALE offer enhanced control over the surface chemistry and distribution of active species. The high activity and selectivity of these catalysts make them crucial in petrochemical industries for processes such as alkane dehydrogenation,芳烃裂解, and the synthesis of olefins. The division in opinions regarding the valence state distribution of chromium oxide species at higher loadings suggests ongoing research into how the oxidation state affects catalytic activity and the potential for improved catalyst performance through optimized preparation methods and support materials.
