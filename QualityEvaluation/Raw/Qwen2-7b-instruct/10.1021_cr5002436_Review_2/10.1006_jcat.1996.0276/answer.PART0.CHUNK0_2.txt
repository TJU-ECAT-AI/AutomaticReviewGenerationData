1. Chromia/alumina catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s due to their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenating light alkanes like propane and butane. Recent studies continue to explore these catalysts' properties.

2. The saturation level for the adsorption of chromium (Cr) during the ALE process was 0.8 Cr atoms per square nanometer (Cr/nm2). This level remained constant across repeated cycles, indicating a characteristic of the reagent/support interaction.

3. The ALE process resulted in the formation of a monolayer of chromium oxide on the alumina support, similar to the behavior observed in conventional impregnated catalysts. 

4. However, considering the chromium's oxidation state during growth, a distinct picture emerged regarding the ALE catalysts. At low loadings, chromium was stabilized on the alumina surface as Cr6+, while opinions differ at higher loadings due to variations in preparation methods and characterization techniques.

5. The catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane was measured for both low chromium concentrations and above monolayer coverage, revealing an increase in activity with increased chromium loading.

1. 自1950年代和1960年代以来，由于其在脱氢轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）方面的高活性和选择性，铬氧化铝催化剂一直被广泛研究。近年来的研究继续探索这些催化剂的特性。

2. 在原子层外延（ALE）过程中，每轮循环下吸附的铬（Cr）饱和水平为每平方纳米0.8个Cr原子（Cr/nm2）。这一水平在整个循环中保持不变，表明了反应剂/支持物组合的特性。

3. ALE过程导致在氧化铝支持物上形成单层的铬氧化物，这与常规浸渍催化剂的行为相似。

4. 然而，在考虑铬的氧化状态期间，关于ALE催化剂的形成出现了一幅不同的图景。低负载时，铬在氧化铝表面以Cr6+的形式稳定存在，而对较高负载的看法则因制备方法和表征技术的不同而分歧。

5. 对于低铬浓度和超过单层覆盖的情况，测量了脱氢化丁烷的催化活性，结果显示随着铬含量的增加，活性持续提高。
