[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been investigated recently as a new way for obtaining propene from its low cost and poorly reactive saturated analogue, propane."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]."
[3] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."
[4] "Furthermore, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."
[6] "SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural properties."
[7] "Up to now, only a few efforts have been made to incorporate Cr [27] or other heteroatoms like Ga [25], Ti [2830], V [31,32], Co [33], Al [34,35] Mo [36] and Fe [28,3739], Pd [40] into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose."
[8] "In this work we investigated the catalytic activity of Cr-containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings,prepared by the direct method."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has focused on improving their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms for enhanced dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propene from propane through the dehydrogenation process, especially when CO2 is present, as it enhances the yield of propene. Research emphasis has been on optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide species for maximum activity, utilizing mesoporous supports like SBA-1 for greater surface area and redox sites, and incorporating other heteroatoms to broaden the catalytic scope. Promoters such as CO2 play crucial roles in shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium and consuming hydrogen, leading to higher propene yields. Understanding the redox mechanism involving chromium species, particularly Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+, is pivotal for enhancing catalyst stability and efficiency.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展重点在于改进其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，以提高脱氢过程的效率。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢过程从丙烷生产丙烯，特别是当二氧化碳存在时，它能增加丙烯的产率。研究重点集中在优化铬氧化物物种的分散性，以获得最大的活性，利用SBA-1等多孔支撑材料来增加表面面积和还原位点，并整合其他杂原子以扩大催化范围。作为催化剂的促进剂，如二氧化碳，在改变脱氢平衡和消耗氢气方面起着至关重要的作用，从而导致更高的丙烯产率。理解铬物种的还原机制，特别是Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+，对于增强催化剂稳定性和效率至关重要。
