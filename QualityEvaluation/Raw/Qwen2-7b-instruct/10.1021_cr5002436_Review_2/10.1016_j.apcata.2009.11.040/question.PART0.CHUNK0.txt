Investigation of catalytic activity of CrSBA-1 materials obtained by direct method in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 Piotr Michorczyk *, Jan Ogonowski, Marta Niemczyk Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Cracow University of Technology, Warszawska 24, 31-155 Krako w, Poland
1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been investigated recently as a new way for obtaining propene from its low cost and poorly reactive saturated analogue, propane. In this process, propene can be obtained with higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This positive effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) and hydro- gen consumption by reverse watergas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium. Moreover, the side benefit of the new process is utilization of CO2 that is converted to useful co-product, carbon monoxide.
In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]. Furthermore, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different. In the case of gallium oxide- based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]. The experi- mental data has been confirmed recently by DFT study, which revealed that over Ga2O3, in the presence of CO2, the main route of propene formation is the dehydrogenation of propane, while oxidative dehydrogenation is energetically less workable [24]. In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities.
It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13].
The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+),whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading,the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support. In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

A B S T R A C T
A series of the Cr-containing SBA-1 (xCrSBA1) cubic mesoporous catalysts with various Cr/Si molar ratios have been prepared by direct method using cetyltriethylammonium bromide, ammonium dichromate,tetraethyl orthosilicate and hydrochloric acid. The obtained materials have been characterized by different physicochemical techniques including ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS, H2-TPR and N2-adsorption. XRD and N2-adsorption results have revealed that xCrSBA1 materials possess well organized three- dimensional pore structure. However, incorporation of Cr into the SBA-1 framework leads to small perturbation of the structural order. ICP results have shown that the amount of Cr incorporation in SBA-1 can be controlled by adjustment of the molar ratio of (NH4)2Cr2O7 to Si(C2H5O)4 in the gel. Finally, the catalytic activity of pure SBA-1 and Cr-containing SBA-1 materials were investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. In the case of the most active, 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the effect of various reaction parameters such as, reaction temperature, reaction time and feed gas composition on the conversion of propane, yield and selectivity to propene as well as on molar ratio of CO/H2 has been evaluated. Moreover, stability of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation/regeneration conditions was studied as well. It has been found that during the fourth consecutive cycle the catalyst undergoes two types of deactivation processes  reversible and irreversible. The former is caused mainly by the coke deposition, which can easily overcome by air treatment of the catalyst at 550 8C. The latter one,insignificant, is due to partial collapse of mesoporous structure of the catalysts. 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. * Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.040 Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves. A large surface area (>1000 m2 g1) of the mesoporous materials makes it possible to create much higher number of the redox Cr species in compare with traditional SiO2-supports. Several recent inves- tigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315].
The newly discovered SBA-1 mesoporous silica material has high potential to be applied as a catalyst support, because of its unique textural properties. In particular, it has a three-dimensional channels (Pm3n) ranging from 2.1 to 2.6 nm and specific surface area in the range 12001450 m2 g1. Such three-dimensional pore network is more resistant to pore blocking, they provide more adsorption sites due to their high surface area and the pores can be easily accessible to reactant molecules [25]. Moreover, cubic mesoporous phase is mechanically more stable compared to hexagonal mesoporous materials, such as: SBA-15 and MCM-41 [26]. The latter feature is important for industrial applications where the catalyst powders are subjected to shaping process.
Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural prop- erties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are limited, compared with other mesoporous materials such as hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15. Up to now, only a few efforts have been made to incorporate Cr [27] or other heteroatoms like Ga [25], Ti [2830], V [31,32], Co [33], Al [34,35] Mo [36] and Fe [28,3739], Pd [40] into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose. The main reasons for that is difficulty with preparation of template with large head- groups (e.g. alkyltriethylammonium bromide) and incorporation of heteroatoms (mainly in cationic form) into the SBA-1 frame- works under strong acidic conditions.
In this work we investigated the catalytic activity of Cr- containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings,prepared by the direct method. All the xCrSBA1 catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffusion reflectance, N2-adsorption and temperature- programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR). Finally, the catalyt- ic performance of the xCrSBA1 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 was evaluated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Surfactant preparation
Hexadecyltriethylammonium bromide (HTEABr) was synthe- sized by reaction of 1-bromohexadecane (97%, Aldrich) with an equimolar amount of triethylamine (98%, Fluka) in ethanol (99.8%, Chempur) under reflux for 72 h. The surfactant cetyltriethylam- monium bromide (CTEABr) was purified by recrystallization from chloroform/ethyl acetate mixture [41].
2.2. Synthesis of mesoporous CrSBA-1 catalysts
The catalysts were prepared under acidic conditions using cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the surfactant, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source and ammonium dichro- mate as the chromium source according to the modified procedure described in [27]. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of CTEABr, 1157 cm3 of distilled water and 566 cm3 of hydrochloric acid (37%, Chempur) were combined with 0.1581.58 g of ammonium dichromate (99%, Chempur) to form a homogeneous solution, which was cooled to 0 8C and stirred for 30 min. Then 27.90 cm3 of TEOS (98% Aldrich),precooled to 0 8C was added, while vigorous stirring. The molar composition of the reaction mixture was TEOS:CTEABr:HCl:-
H2O:(NH4)2Cr2O7 = 1:0.2:56:700:(0.0050.05). Stirring was con-
tinued for 6 h until the precipitation of the silica-chromium- surfactant assemblies was completed. The resultant precipitate was filtered off and dried (without washing) at 60 8C overnight. The dried material was then calcined in air by rising temperature from ambient to 550 8C over 9 h and keeping it at 550 8C for another 12 h. The samples were labeled xCrSBA1 where x denotes the Cr/Si ratio in the gel (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.1).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were recorded in two ranges of 0.5108 and 10708 (2u) at room temperature, using a Panalytical XPert Pro instrument operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray source.
The crystals size of Cr2O3 was calculated based on Scherrer formula using the Rietveld method in the TOPAS R2.1 program.
Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 196 8C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The samples were degassed at 250 8C before measurements. Specific surface areas were calculated using the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method within the relative pressure range P/P0 = 0.050.15.
Pore size distributions were calculated from the branch of the desorption curve using the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model.
Pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.95 or vicinity.
Diffusion reflectance UVvis spectra (UVvis DRS) were taken on an Ocean Optics HR2000+ instrument (integration time 400 ms,100 scans) equipped with an Ocean Optics DH-2000 BAL halogen- deuterium light source and optical fiber probe (FCR-7UV400A- 2ME-HTX) at room temperature. The spectra were recorded within the wavelength range of 220800 nm using BaSO4 as a standard.
Temperature-programmed reduction, using H2 as the reducing agent was carried out in a modified gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Purified mixture of N2/H2 (95/5 vol.%, Air Liquide) served as a combined carrier and reducing gas at a total flow rate 30 cm3 min1. Before experiment the catalyst sample (100 mg) was preheated in a dry He stream at 550 8C for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was heated at 10 8C min1 to the final temperature of
650 8C.
The
H2
consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector and NiO (99.998%, Aldrich) was used as a
