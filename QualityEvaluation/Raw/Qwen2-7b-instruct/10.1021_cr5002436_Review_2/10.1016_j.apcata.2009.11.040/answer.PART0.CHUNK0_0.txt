[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been investigated recently as a new way for obtaining propene from its low cost and poorly reactive saturated analogue, propane."
[2] "Moreover, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[3] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."
[4] "Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2."
[5] "SBA-1 materials possess a three-dimensional channels (Pm3n) ranging from 2.1 to 2.6 nm and specific surface area in the range 12001450 m2 g1."
[6] "Up to now, only a few efforts have been made to incorporate Cr or other heteroatoms like Ga, Ti, V, Co, Al, Mo, and Fe into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose."
[7] "Cr-containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings, prepared by the direct method."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications involve the dehydrogenation of propane, where chromium catalysts show enhanced activity due to their ability to effectively utilize CO2 as an oxidant, shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium. The redox species of chromium, particularly Cr6+ and Cr3+, play crucial roles in the catalytic process, especially when dispersed at high levels. Mesoporous materials, like SBA-1, have gained attention due to their large surface areas and three-dimensional pore networks, which facilitate more efficient reactions. Incorporating chromium into these materials has led to improved catalytic performance, making them suitable for processes involving propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2. The SBA-1 framework, with its unique properties, provides a stable support system that can handle the high dispersion of chromium species necessary for optimal catalytic activity.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制方面取得了显著进展。关键的工业应用包括丙烷脱氢，其中铬催化剂由于能够有效利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂而表现出增强的活性，从而改变脱氢平衡。特别是当铬以高分散水平存在时，铬的氧化还原物种（Cr6+ 和 Cr3+）在催化过程中扮演着关键角色。介孔材料，如SBA-1，因其大的表面积和三维孔网络而受到关注，这有利于更有效的反应。将铬引入这些材料中导致了催化性能的改进，使它们适合于涉及丙烷脱氢的过程，无论是有还是没有二氧化碳。SBA-1框架以其独特的特性提供了稳定的支撑系统，可以处理实现最佳催化活性所需的高分散铬物种。
