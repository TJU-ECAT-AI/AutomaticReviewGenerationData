[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."
[2] "Furthermore, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[4] "Moreover, the side benefit of the new process is utilization of CO2 that is converted to useful co-product, carbon monoxide."
[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."
[6] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved."
[7] "Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural prop- erties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are limited, compared with other mesoporous materials such as hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15."
[8] "The newly discovered SBA-1 mesoporous silica material has high potential to be applied as a catalyst support, because of its unique textural properties."
[9] "The main reasons for that is difficulty with preparation of template with large head- groups (e.g. alkyltriethylammonium bromide) and incorporation of heteroatoms (mainly in cationic form) into the SBA-1 frame- works under strong acidic conditions."

How have chromium oxide-based catalysts evolved since their discovery in 1933, and what are the key industrial applications and research focus areas (such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms) that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes?

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They are known for their high activity, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation processes, particularly when CO2 is present. Key industrial applications include the conversion of propane to propene with the aid of CO2, which benefits from enhanced propene yield due to CO2's participation in both direct oxidation of propane to propene and hydrogen consumption via the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Research focuses on understanding and enhancing the structure of these catalysts, identifying optimal active sites, utilizing appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. For instance, the redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts involves Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) that are influenced by factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, and the nature of the support. Additionally, the structure of chromium oxide supports, like SBA-1, offers a unique textural property that facilitates more active catalysts through higher dispersion of chromium oxide species. Despite the potential of SBA-1 materials, challenges remain in their preparation and integration into catalyst frameworks due to difficulties in handling large head groups and heteroatoms under acidic conditions.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。它们在脱氢过程中以其高活性、选择性和稳定性而著称，特别是当二氧化碳存在时。主要工业应用包括通过二氧化碳促进丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，该过程能增加丙烯的产率，因为二氧化碳参与了直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯和氢消耗的逆水煤气变换反应。研究重点在于理解并增强催化剂的结构，识别最佳活性位点，使用合适的支撑材料，引入促动剂，以及阐明反应机制。例如，铬氧化物基催化剂中的还原氧化机制涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+），这些物种受到诸如铬负载、制备条件和支持物性质等因素的影响。此外，SBA-1材料的结构提供了独特的纹理特性，促进了更高分散度的铬氧化物物种，从而形成更活跃的催化剂。尽管SBA-1材料具有潜力作为催化支撑，但在其准备和集成到催化框架中时仍面临挑战，主要是由于处理大头基团和在酸性条件下整合异质原子的困难。
