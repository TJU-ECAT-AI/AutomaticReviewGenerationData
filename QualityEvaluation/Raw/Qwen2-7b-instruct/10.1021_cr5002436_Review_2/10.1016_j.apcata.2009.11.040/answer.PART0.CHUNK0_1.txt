[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2."
[2] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."
[3] "From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."
[4] "Several recent inves- tigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2."
[5] "Cr-containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings,prepared by the direct method."
[6] "All the xCrSBA1 catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffusion reflectance, N2-adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR)."
[7] "Finally, the catalytic performance of the xCrSBA1 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 was evaluated."

Cr chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their initial discovery in 1933. Their evolution has been marked by advancements in structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. Recent research has focused on enhancing dispersion and creating redox Cr species, especially at lower chromium loadings. Mesoporous materials, like SBA-1, have attracted significant attention due to their unique textural properties, offering high surface areas and resistance to pore blocking. Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in dehydrogenating propane to propene, both with and without CO2. Specific methods, such as the direct synthesis of CrSBA-1 catalysts, along with characterization techniques including XRD, UV vis DRS, and H2-TPR, have been utilized to evaluate their performance. These catalysts' performance in dehydrogenation reactions has been extensively evaluated, highlighting their importance in the field.

自1933年发现以来，Cr铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的演变。这一演变在结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制方面尤为突出，特别是在脱氢过程中的应用。近年来的研究重点放在提高分散性和创造红氧化合物Cr物种上，尤其是在较低铬负载下。由于独特的纹理特性，如SBA-1等多孔材料引起了极大的关注，这些材料提供了高比表面积并具有抗孔堵塞能力。含Cr的多孔筛在脱氢丙烷生成丙烯过程中显示出优异的催化活性，既适用于有CO2的情况也适用于无CO2的情况。特定的方法，如直接合成CrSBA-1催化剂，以及包括XRD、UV vis DRS和H2-TPR在内的表征技术被用来评估其性能。对这些催化剂在脱氢反应中的性能进行了广泛评估，突显了它们在该领域的关键作用。
