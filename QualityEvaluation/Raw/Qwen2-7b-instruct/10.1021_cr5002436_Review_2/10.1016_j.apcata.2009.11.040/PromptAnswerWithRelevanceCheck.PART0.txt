1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications involve the dehydrogenation of propane, where chromium catalysts show enhanced activity due to their ability to effectively utilize CO2 as an oxidant, shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium. The redox species of chromium, particularly Cr6+ and Cr3+, play crucial roles in the catalytic process, especially when dispersed at high levels. Mesoporous materials, like SBA-1, have gained attention due to their large surface areas and three-dimensional pore networks, which facilitate more efficient reactions. Incorporating chromium into these materials has led to improved catalytic performance, making them suitable for processes involving propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2. The SBA-1 framework, with its unique properties, provides a stable support system that can handle the high dispersion of chromium species necessary for optimal catalytic activity.

How have chromium oxide-based catalysts evolved since their discovery in 1933, and what are the key industrial applications and research focus areas (such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms) that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes?

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They are known for their high activity, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation processes, particularly when CO2 is present. Key industrial applications include the conversion of propane to propene with the aid of CO2, which benefits from enhanced propene yield due to CO2's participation in both direct oxidation of propane to propene and hydrogen consumption via the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Research focuses on understanding and enhancing the structure of these catalysts, identifying optimal active sites, utilizing appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. For instance, the redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts involves Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) that are influenced by factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, and the nature of the support. Additionally, the structure of chromium oxide supports, like SBA-1, offers a unique textural property that facilitates more active catalysts through higher dispersion of chromium oxide species. Despite the potential of SBA-1 materials, challenges remain in their preparation and integration into catalyst frameworks due to difficulties in handling large head groups and heteroatoms under acidic conditions.
