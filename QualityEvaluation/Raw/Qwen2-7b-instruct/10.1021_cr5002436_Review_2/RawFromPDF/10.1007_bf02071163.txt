3 catalysts were activated 
for the metathesis of propene by thermal treatment in 
At. Temperatures up to 1140 K are required for catalysts 
with low metal contents. These exhibit the highest spe- 
cific activities though they are known to be highly 
resistant to reduction. It is proposed that the active 
sites are formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the 
conditions employed.

The active sites of Mo and W based heterogeneous metathesis 
catalysts are widely considered to contain the metal in an oxi- 
dation state lower than +6. This view, which has its origin in 
the pronounced break-in behavior of SiO 
2 supported systems, 
has been substantiated by the work of Yermakov, lwasawa, 
Kazansky [163] and other authors, and Me 
4+ has been identified 
as the precursor of the carbene site active in metathesis.

From this point of view it was easy to account for the very 
small activities found for AI203 supported MoO 
3 and WO 
3 cata- 
lysts with low metal oxide content in the metathesis of propene 
[4]. MoO 
3 and in particular WO 
3 supported on AI203 are reduced 
a~ temperature considerably above the usual rQaction temperatures, 
and their reducibility decreases drastically with decreasing 
metal oxide content [5-8]. However, we report in this paper that 
catalysts with low metal oxide content may be activated at very 
high temperatures and exhibit specific metathesis activities 
superior to those of catalysts with higher metal oxide loadings. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The catalysts were prepared by impregnating AI203 (VEB Leuna- 
Werke) with solutions of MoO 
3 or WO 
3 in NH4OH. After impregna- 
tion the catalysts were dried at 400 K and calcined in air at 
823 K for 2 h. The metal oxide concentrations and BET surfaces 
after calcination at 823 K (in parentheses) amounted to 1.0, 
4.3 and 7.2 wt.% MoO 
3 (288, 262 and 249 m2/g, respectively) and 
1.0, 3.9 and 12.0 wt.% WO 
3 (260, 256 and 211 m2/g,respectively). 
The metathesis of propene as a test reaction was performed in 
a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure at temperatures of 473 K 
with molybdenum catalysts and 573 K with tungsten catalysts. 
The catalysts were heated in Ar (6 s 
the activation tem- 
perature chosen, maintained there for 2 h, cooled in Ar to 473 
(573) K and charged with undiluted propene. Break-in phenomena, 
as common with SiO 
2 supported catalysts,were not observed in 
our experiments. The samples usually withdrawn after 30 min 
time on stream were analyzed by conventional GC methods. The 
catalysts were regenerated in air at 823 K for 2 h. 
Ar and propene were deoxygenated over MnO/AI203 and dried 
with Mg(CI04) 2. An additional oxygen trap (MnO/AI203), which 
had to be reduced prior to each run, was included in the gas 
flow right at the reactor entrance. The air for regeneration 
was dried over Zeosorb 4 A molecular sieve (VEB CK Bitterfeld). 
The data reported below are derived from the propene conversions 
measured. C2-C

librium at 573 K (WO 
3 catalysts)) represented ~99 mole % of the 
samples withdrawn. The ratio between ethylene and the sum of 
the butenes did not differ significantly from I. The coke deposi- 
tion on the catalysts was negligible.

rises considerably with increasing temperature. It exhibits a 
maximum with MoO 
3 and levels off with WO 
3. The maximum or con- 
stant activities as well as the temperatures necessary to achieve 
them depend strongly on the metal oxide content of the catalyst, 
which is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Figure 2, which represents specific activities expressed as 
initial rates related to the total amount of metal oxide in 
the catalyst, reveals that Mo and W attain" their highest specific 
activities in catalysts with low metal oxide contents. Certainly, 
these samples must be activated under very drastic conditions 
and the activation temperatures tend to increase with decreasing 
metal oxide content. Figure 2 shows also what happens when con- 
stant (too low) activation temperatures are applied to catalysts 
of the whole range of metal oxide content. In this case, the 
catalysts with low metal oxide content are not sufficiently ac- 
tivated and seem to possess a low activity as has been reported 
in the literature [4]. 
AI203 supported catalysts exposed to temperatures above 973 
K suffer a considerable breakdown of their micropore structure. 
Thus, a decrease of the BET surface area by approximately 40 % 
was observed upon calcination of samples with 3-9 and I wt.% 
WO 
3 in air at 1143 K for 2 h. Also, the dispersity of the active 
component may be influenced by the thermal treatment. WO 
3 and 
MoO 
3 are known to form monomolecular layers on AI203 [6,9] so 
their dispersity will be very high. Any change of this surface 
structure should lead to a decrease of dispersity. All these 
factors tend to reduce the amount of metal ions accessible in 
the samples activated at the highest temperatures. Hence, the 
increase of specific activity with decreasing metal oxide con- 
tent might be even more pronounced if the activity could be 
related to the amount of accessible metal oxide. 
As a consequence, it can be stated that the specific meta- 
thesis activity of MoO 
3 and WO 
3 is correlated with the stability 
of the hexavalent metal ions rather than with their reducibility. 
This suggests that a reduction of M(VI) to M(IV) is not\neces 
- 
sary for the activation of these catalysts and that the active 
sites are formed starting from M(VI) species, possibly by a 
mechanism as discussed by Rapp~ and Goddard in a theoretical 
study [10]:

This proposal does not contest other reports in which M(IV) has 
been found to be an active site procursor as the presence of 
M(IV) is extremely unlikely after the activation procedures 
applied by us [8,11]. Rather, it shows that alternative routes 
for the formation of the active carbene site may be relevant 
as well. 
Small quantities of W(V) were observed by EPR after the ac- 
tivation procedures typically employed in this study [12]. A 
detailed study of their properties and of the problem of whether 
they are involved in the formation of the active sites of meta- 
thesis is under way.
