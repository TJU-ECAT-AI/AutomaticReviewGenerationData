A series of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was prepared by atomic layer
epitaxy (ALE) from the vapor phase, with use of sequential satu-
rating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air. The loading was varied
from 1.3 to 8.8 wt% of Cr. Lower loadings were achieved by par-
tially blocking the alumina surface with acetylacetone or dipival-
oylmethane before introducing Cr(acac)3. The catalytically active
material was found to be evenly distributed through the catalyst
particles. Low energy ion scattering measurements showed that, up
to 7.4 wt% of Cr, the Cr species was dispersed in a monolayer. XPS
and UV-vis spectrophotometry revealed that, even at the low load-
ings, both Cr3+ and Cr6+ species were present. This was attributed
to a stabilization of Cr3+ on the alumina support during the ALE
process. Loading beyond monolayer coverage was not reﬂected in
the dehydrogenation of i-butane to i-butene: the activity continued
to increase.

INTRODUCTION
Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and se-
lectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as
propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied inten-
sively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show
that the interest continues (2–19). In most of these stud-
ies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using
CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor. In contrast to this, the chro-
mia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared
by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential
saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air.
ALE is a gas-phase technique, the use of which has been
expanded from thin ﬁlm growth to the preparation of cata-
lysts (20–22). Already it shows great promise in the prepa-
ration of tailored catalysts. ALE is distinguished from the
chemical vapor deposition techniques in the use of sat-
urating gas–solid reactions to form the required surface.

These saturating and self-terminating reactions ensure a
uniformdistributionofthechemisorbedspeciesthroughout
the porous catalyst support. The surface of the support and
the reagent selected determine the density of the surface
species during each reaction step. The concentration of the
desired component is not dependent on the dose of the re-
actant provided that the dose exceeds the amount required
for surface saturation. Thus, the earlier work of K¨
ohler et al.
(16, 17) using Cr(acac)3 vapor in the preparation of catalysts
differs from the ALE technique because the concentration
of chromium was there controlled by regulating the contact
time between Cr(acac)3 and oxide supports in a ﬂuidized
bed and not only through the use of saturating reactions.
The aim of our work was to study the growth of chromia
on γ -alumina during the preparation of chromia/alumina
catalysts from vapor phase by ALE and to explore the
relationship between the surface species and the behav-
ior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to
i-butene. Accordingly, a series of catalysts with various Cr
loadings was prepared and the macroscopic homogeneity
of these samples was conﬁrmed by electron microscopy,
XRD, and surface area/porosity measurements. A more de-
tailed investigation of the surface was performed by low
energy ion scattering (LEIS) and XPS. In this way we
were able to monitor the growth process and the nature
of the Cr species on the alumina support during the ALE
preparation. Our ﬁndings on the CrOx/γ -Al2O3 system are
compared with those of earlier work on NiO/γ -Al2O3 (23,
24) and CrOx/SiO2 (25, 26) systems prepared by ALE us-
ing Ni(acac)2 and Cr(acac)3 vapors. Finally, the series of
CrOx/γ -Al2O3 catalysts was tested in the dehydrogenation
of i-butane to i-butene.

of 0.2–0.4 mm or 0.7–1.0 mm. The values of speciﬁc sur-
face area and pore volume for the uncalcined material
were 195 m2/g and 0.49 cm3/g, respectively. Cr(acac)3, i.e.,
Cr(C5O2H7)3, was 99% pure and purchased from Riedel-
de Ha¨
en. Synthetic air was used for the removal of the lig-
ands. Acetylacetone (C5H8O2, Hacac) from Merck and dip-
ivaloylmethane (C11H20O2, Hthd) from Fluka were used as
blocking agents.
The support material (4–10 g) was preheated for 16 h in a
mufﬂefurnaceat600◦C,andthenthepreheattreatmentwas
continued at 200◦C for 3 h in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow-type reactor
(24) (Microchemistry Ltd.) under a pressure of 5–10 kPa in
nitrogen ﬂow. The solid Cr(acac)3 was vaporized at 190◦C,
and then was transported, in nitrogen, downwards through
the solid support bed. The reaction of Cr(acac)3 was carried
out at 200◦C. This reaction sequence was followed by a ni-
trogen purge for at least 2 h at the reaction temperature. To
remove the ligand residues from the samples, air treatment
was started at 200◦C and continued at 600◦C for 3–4 h. The
high preheat and air treatment temperatures used in the
preparation were chosen to correspond to the conditions
in the dehydrogenation reaction. To increase the Cr con-
centration of the samples, the Cr(acac)3, nitrogen, and air
sequences were repeated between one and seven times. To
decrease the Cr concentration, Hacac or Hthd was bound to
the surface at 200◦C, followed by nitrogen purge at 200◦C,
before the introduction of Cr(acac)3 to the reactor. Hacac
and Hthd were vaporized at 60◦C and 80◦C, respectively.
The amount of Cr(acac)3, Hacac, or Hthd vaporized was
always kept sufﬁciently high to ensure surface saturation.
Catalyst Characterization
The carbon content after Cr(acac)3 adsorption was deter-
mined with a Leco CR12 carbon analyzer. The Cr concen-
tration was measured by instrumental neutron activation
analysis (INAA). Cr6+ concentration, after ligand removal,
was determined in basic solution as chromate by UV-vis
spectrophotometry (27). The samples were heated in a muf-
ﬂe furnace in air at 600◦C for 1 h before the dissolution of
the Cr6+ species. To check the inﬂuence of the heating step
on the Cr6+ concentration, the Hacac-blocked sample and
the samples with a loading of one and seven ALE cycles
were subjected to heat treatment of 16 h at 500◦C in air
before dissolution. The Cr concentration of the catalysts is
given as wt% of Cr metal or as number of Cr atoms per nm2
(Cr/nm2), where an average speciﬁc surface area of 190 m2/g
was used for the computation.
Speciﬁc surface areas and pore volumes were determined
by means of nitrogen adsorption and condensation us-
ing Micromeritics ASAP 2400 equipment (BET-method).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were made with
Siemens Diffrac 500 diffractometer and CuKα radiation.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination, the
sample particles were embedded in epoxy resin and the
cured block was cut with a microtome until a sufﬁcient num-
ber of cross-sectioned particles were exposed in the block
face. All samples were coated with carbon to prevent charg-
ing under the electron beam. The examination was carried
out with a Jeol JSM 840A scanning electron microscope ﬁt-
ted with a PGT IMIX III energy dispersive X-ray (EDS)
and image analyzer. The accelerating voltage used in SEM
examinations was 15 keV.
X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured with
an X-probe model 101 spectrometer (Surface Science In-
struments, VG Fisons) equipped with a monochromatized
AlKα X-ray source. The instrument was operated at 10 kV
and 12 mA in the constant pass energy (50 eV) mode using
a spot size of 600 µm. With these settings and a step width of
80 meV/channel, the FWHM value for Au 4f7/2 was 1.05 eV.
After being cooled in ﬂowing nitrogen in the ALE reactor,
the samples were inertly transferred to the instrument. Dur-
ing the XPS analysis, Cr6+ reduction in the sample chamber
was minimized by use of a short analysis time. All bind-
ing energies were referenced to the Al 2p signal for Al2O3
at 74.5 eV. The relative surface concentrations for the el-
ements of interest were calculated from the Cr 2p3/2, Al
2p, and O 1s signal intensities, using atomic sensitivity fac-
tors provided by the instrument manufacturer. The small
amount of carbon, which was observed in all samples, was
not taken into account in the calculations. The base pressure
during data acquisition was below 4 × 10−6 Pa.
Low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) measurements were
made with a NODUS instrument. For a description of its
basic design, as it is used today, and a review of the applica-
tion of the LEIS technique to oxides, the reader is referred
to Ref. (28). The primary 4He+ ions (3 keV) are generated
in a Leybold IQE 12/38 source and are directed perpendic-
ularly onto the target. To keep the exposure of the sample
below 1013 ions/cm2 the ion ﬂux was kept low. Ions scattered
over 142◦are energy selected by a modiﬁed cylindrical mir-
ror analyzer (CMA). Charging of the insulating materials
canbeeffectivelycompensatedforbyﬂoodingfromallsides
with low-energy electrons. The base pressure is in the low
10−6 Pa, which increases during the operation of the ion
beam to the high 10−6 Pa. This is due to the inert gas of the
ion beam, which will not inﬂuence the analysis results. All
catalyst powders were pressed into wafers in an ambient
atmosphere and, before analysis, chemically cleaned in a
calcination step at 200◦C in 3 kPa of oxygen in a connecting
chamber.
Activity Measurements
The activity of the catalysts was studied in the dehydro-
genation of i-butane at atmospheric pressure at 540◦C in
a ﬁxed bed ﬂow reactor (diameter 9 mm). The catalyst
charge was 200 mg and the particle size of the catalyst

0.2–0.4 mm. Before testing, the catalysts were calcined in
situ with synthetic air at 600◦C for 16 h, and then reduced
with hydrogen (1 : 10 in nitrogen) at 540◦C for 0.5 h; i-
butane, diluted with nitrogen (1 : 10), was used as feed. The
total ﬂow rate was 200 cm3/min (STP) during both reduc-
tion and reaction. The product distribution was monitored
with an on-line FT-IR analyzer. Spectra were measured for
1 s at time intervals of 8 s. The multicomponent method
used in the analysis of the measured IR spectra has been
described in detail elsewhere (29, 30); i-butene along with
some cracking and isomerization products were detected
in the product ﬂows. The activity is expressed as a mean
of the conversions measured during the time period of 30–
60 s on stream. Thus, the results describe the initial activ-
ity, to avoid problems associated with deactivation of the
catalysts.
RESULTS
Catalyst Preparation
The ﬁrst ALE sequence of Cr(acac)3 led to a sample
containing 1.3 wt% of Cr. This corresponded to a satura-
tion density of 0.8 Cr/nm2. The carbon concentration of the
sample was determined before ligand removal to study the
binding of Cr(acac)3 to the surface. The value of 3.4 wt% C,
giving a C/Cr ratio of 11, implied that one ligand was re-
leased in the surface reaction, leaving two ligands bound
to the chromium center. To form the ﬁnal oxide surface the
ligands were removed by heating the sample in air at 600◦C.
During this treatment the color of the sample changed from
greentoyellow,indicatingthatCr3+hadbecomeoxidizedto
Cr6+ species. To study the catalysts at lower Cr loadings, the
Cr(acac)3 sequence was preceded by a saturating sequence
of Hthd or Hacac. In this way, part of the surface was effec-
tively blocked for Cr(acac)3, resulting in samples of 0.16 and
0.32 wt% Cr with Hacac and Hthd, respectively (Table 1).
The use of blocking agents for this kind of atomic engi-
neering with ALE has earlier been described by Haukka
et al. (25).
When the ALE sequences of Cr(acac)3 at 200◦C and
air at 600◦C were repeated for a total of seven times, the
Cr loading of the catalysts was increased from 1.3 wt% to
8.8 wt% (Table 1). As Fig. 1 shows, the loading increased
linearly with the number of cycles. The same was found ear-
lier for the NiO/γ -alumina system prepared by ALE with
Ni(acac)2 and air (24). The results indicate that about the
same amount of chromium was bound to the surface after
each Cr(acac)3 sequence. The color of the samples changed
from yellow to dark brown with increasing chromium con-
centration. The average surface densities of the highest
loadings, 7.4 wt% and 8.8 wt% were 4.5 and 5.4 Cr/nm2, re-
spectively. These values exceeded the monolayer coverage
of impregnated chromia/γ -alumina catalysts of 3.7 Cr/nm2
reported by Wachs et al. (7).

The valence state distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ as a func-
tion of loading was determined by measuring the Cr6+ con-
tent by UV-vis spectrophotometry and assuming that only
Cr3+ and Cr6+ were present in the oxidized catalysts. The
results are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1; Cr3+ was observed
in all samples. The amount of Cr6+ in the samples increased
during the ﬁrst cycles but leveled off in the two samples
with the highest Cr concentration. In view of the report of
Vuurman et al. (3) that Cr can be fully oxidized to Cr6+ up
to a monolayer coverage, a calcination at 500◦C for 16 h was
applied to the catalysts with loadings of 0.16 wt%, 1.3 wt%,
and 8.8 wt%. However, this longer heat treatment in air at a
lower temperature did not increase the Cr6+ concentration
measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry, indicating a high
stability or Cr3+ species.
Although all the catalysts had a homogeneous appear-
ance with respect to color, they were examined by SEM to
verify that chromium had penetrated into the heart of the

support particles. With back-scattered imaging mode, the
color of the particles on the gray scale was observed to be
even, indicating uniform Cr concentration. Furthermore,
EDS line scans across the cross-sectioned particle surfaces
conﬁrmed that chromium was evenly distributed through
the particles. An example of the Cr loading measured by
EDS is shown in Fig. 2.
The speciﬁc surface areas and pore volumes are listed
in Table 1. The results show that the surface area of alu-
mina was maintained since the decrease in the values cor-
responded to the weight increase of the catalysts calculated
as CrO3; XRD measurements provided no evidence of for-
mation of an α-Cr2O3 or other chromium phase. We con-
clude, therefore, that the ALE preparation resulted in cata-
lysts where the catalytically active material was distributed
homogeneously through the catalyst.
Surface Characterization
Toobtainamoredetailedpictureofthechromiumdisper-
sion at the atomic level, we carried out surface analysis by
XPS and LEIS. LEIS is more surface sensitive, probing only
the topmost atomic layer (28), while XPS provides chemi-
cal information in addition to the surface composition. In
both techniques it is assumed that the external surface is a
good representation of the internal surface.
The Cr 2p3/2 signal was used in the XPS measurements
to calculate the relative Cr concentration. This signal was
found to increase steadily as a function of Cr concentra-
tion of the samples as depicted in Fig. 3. The Al 2p sig-
nals decreased slightly, while the O 1s signal was constant.
Furthermore, after grinding the 7.4 wt% sample, the XPS
measurements showed, within experimental error, no de-
viation from the unground sample, conﬁrming the good
homogeneity of the catalysts.
The relative abundance of Cr3+ and Cr6+ in the sam-
ples was determined by deconvoluting the Cr 2p3/2 signal.
Symmetric Gaussian components and a Shirley background
were employed. For Cr3+ and its satellite we applied con-
straints close to the reported values (31). An example of

the deconvolution is given in Fig. 4. The amount of Cr6+ in
the inertly transferred samples was in agreement with the
UV-vis spectrophotometric measurements of samples ex-
posed to ambient conditions and extra heating at 600◦C for
1 h (Table 1). The binding energy values measured by XPS,
of577.2 ± 0.2eVforCr3+and579.8 ± 0.3eVforCr6+,corre-
sponded well with the values reported by Gr¨
unert et al. (31)
and by Rahman et al. (15) for chromia/alumina catalysts.
The results of the LEIS experiments are displayed in
Figs. 5 and 6. A light ion (4He+) was used for the analysis,
and the ion ﬂux on the sample was kept as low as possible
by measuring only the interval of interest. Time-dependent
measurements showed that the inﬂuence of damage by the
ion beam on the data could be neglected. The spectra were
calibrated to the oxygen signals, on the assumption that the
oxygen signals were constant for the loadings studied. This

has been proven valid for a number of systems (19, 23, 32).
The ratios were determined in three different ways: with
peak heights, peak areas after linear background subtrac-
tion, and peak areas. A semi-empirical model introduced by
Nelson (33) and adapted for our purposes was used (34).
All three methods showed the same trend and the average
was taken for Fig. 6. The intensity of the Cr signal increased
linearly up to a loading of about 7.5 wt% Cr, after which a
slowing of the rate of increase indicated multilayer growth.
The LEIS results show that, with ALE, a monolayer cover-
age was reached at about 4.5 Cr/nm2.

tion of i-butane after prereduction in H2.
The results describe an increase in activity with chromium
loading, from the low loadings where isolated CrOx species
are assumed to exist even after reduction, to monolayer
coverage and even above.
In the interpretation of the results, note that the re-
ported activity includes cracking and isomerization, which
occurred in addition to dehydrogenation. Both alumina and
chromium oxide surface may be involved in these side reac-
tions. On pure alumina, conversion was 7% and selectivity
for i-butene 43%. On chromium oxide catalysts, the selec-
tivity for i-butene increased with Cr loading to 91%. How-
ever, a level of 90% was achieved rapidly, at Cr loadings as
low as 1.3–2.5 wt%.
DISCUSSION
Dispersion of Chromia/Alumina Prepared by ALE
ALE is based on the use of saturating self-terminating
gas-solid reactions. In the case of Cr(acac)3 on γ -alumina,
the saturation level under the reaction conditions used was
0.8 Cr/nm2. On the basis of the carbon content measured
after a single sequence of Cr(acac)3 it seemed that one of
the acac ligands was released when the molecule was bound
to the surface. These results agree well with the earlier ALE
work with β-diketonates on silica, where a similar satura-
tion density of Cr(acac)3 of 0.8/nm2 was found. There, too,
one of the ligands of the Cr(acac)3 was released (25, 26).
In the ALE process of Ni(acac)2 on alumina, a saturation
level of 2.0 Ni/nm2 was reported. In that case, however, the
acac/Ni ratio of the surface complex was one, which means
that more Ni was deposited per ALE cycle (24).
The running of sequential reactions gave us a series of
samples in which the concentration increased linearly, indi-
cating that the saturation level was the same for each cycle.
This linear behavior is not a self-evident property of the
ALE method, since the surface changes after every ALE
SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF ALE CHROMIA/ALUMINA

cycle; instead, it is a property of the reagent/support com-
bination in question. Apparently in the Cr(acac)3/alumina
system the steric hindrance by the acac groups, and not
the limited number of bonding sites, determined the sat-
uration level. The work of Haukka et al. (25) has shown
that the adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on silica occurs selectively
through reaction with OH groups. Probably OH groups be-
have as bonding sites on alumina as well, at least during
the ﬁrst sequences of Cr(acac)3. In addition, the adsorption
of Cr(acac)3 to coordinatively unsaturated aluminum and
oxygen atoms, i.e., to Lewis sites, present on dehydroxy-
lated alumina cannot be ruled out. Bonding solely through
OH groups would require the formation of new OH groups
during the air treatment after the Cr(acac)3 sequence, be-
cause the original OH density of 600◦C alumina is lower
than the Cr surface density achieved after the cycle runs.
Furthermore, the growth of CrOx on top of CrOx species
fromearliercycleswasexcludedintheLEISmeasurements.
Indeed, the linear increase of the LEIS signals from the
lowest loadings (0.16 wt% and 0.32 wt%), where an atomic
dispersion was guaranteed by the use of blocking agents, to
a loading of 7.4 wt% after six ALE cycles, indicated a dis-
persion of the Cr species until a monolayer coverage was
reached at about 4.5 Cr/nm2. The highest loading showed
no further increase of the LEIS signal, pointing to multi-
layer growth. XPS conﬁrmed the homogeneous deposition
of the Cr species, together with SEM/EDS and surface area
measurements, and XRD gave no evidence of the forma-
tion of any crystalline chromia phases. Evidently, owing to
the controlled binding of Cr on the alumina surface in the
ALEprocess, a highercoveragecanbereachedthanbycon-
ventional impregnation techniques where, above a surface
concentration of about 4 Cr/nm2, agglomeration occurs (3).
As revealed by the LEIS measurements, the ALE growth
of CrOx on alumina differs from that of NiO (23), although
in both systems an acetylacetonate compound was the pre-
cursor for the deposition of the catalytically active species.
In both systems an atomically dispersed species formed on
the alumina support during the ﬁrst ALE sequence. How-
ever, whereas the growth of Ni(acac)2 on nickel oxide dur-
ing the second ALE cycle, Cr(acac)3 preferred bonding to
the alumina in up to six reaction cycles.
Oxidation State of Cr in Chromia/Alumina
In the discussion thus far, the ALE catalysts have been
seen to exhibit similar behavior to conventional impreg-
nated catalyst, namely a monolayer formation. The only
signiﬁcant difference was the higher monolayer coverage
for the ALE catalysts. When the growth mechanism was
considered in the light of the oxidation states of chromium,
however, a different picture emerged of the ALE catalysts.
It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low
loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface
as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions
about the valence state distribution of the chromia are
divided, probably because samples are not always prepared
in the same way and possibly also because different char-
acterization techniques are employed in the determination
of oxidation states. For example, Vuurman et al. (3) report
that up to a monolayer (4 Cr/nm2), all the chromium oxide
species are stabilized in oxidation state 6+ on the alumina
support at moderate calcination temperatures (≤500◦C).
In contrast, KozÃ
lowski (36) reports that only 60% of Cr is in
oxidation state 6+ at a monolayer coverage (3.9 Cr/nm2).
Rahman et al. (15) found Cr3+ at the same loadings, citing
calcination-induced reduction of Cr6+ due to relatively
high calcination temperatures of 600◦C as an explanation.
Above monolayer coverage the picture is consistent: Cr3+
is always found in the samples. This occurrence of Cr3+
is related to the formation of α-Cr2O3 and, according to
Fouad et al. (11), in part to the presence of highly dispersed
Cr3+ species.
In contrast to literature reports, we detected Cr3+ in our
ALE catalysts even at low loadings of the samples. The
same results were obtained by UV-vis spectrophotometry
and XPS. Furthermore, although the amount of Cr6+ in-
creased with the loading, even at a monolayer coverage
only 35% of the Cr occurred as Cr6+. The formation of
Cr3+ in our case may be related to the high state of dehy-
droxylation of alumina, but still the monolayer structure
is maintained. The role of hydroxyl groups in stabilizing
the monolayer and different chromate structures (Cr6+ in
mono-, di- and polychromates) has been emphasized in the
literature. Both Turek et al. (6) and Vuurman et al. (4) ar-
gue that the increase in the chromium concentration up to
monolayer coverage can be linked to the consumption of
the alumina OH groups. Wachs et al. (7) more generally
propose that monolayer coverage is unique for each transi-
tion metal/support pair, with the determining factor being
the surface hydroxyl chemistry of the support. In their study
of Cr on SiO2, SiO2–Al2O3, and Al2O3, Weckhuysen et al.
(10) explain the Cr dispersion on the different supports in
terms of the amount and characteristics of the hydroxyl
groups. The more OH groups available, the better the dis-
persion. Also, Fouad et al. (11) argue that the high surface
OH density on alumina prevents the polymerization of sur-
face CrOx species to α-Cr2O3 bulk phase and thus ensures
the stability of dispersed high valence species.
In addition to studies on valence state distribution af-
ter the ﬁrst calcination after impregnation, the chromia
/alumina system has been studied intensively after reduc-
tion/recalcination processes. Weckhuysen et al. (8–10) in-
vestigated chromia/alumina catalysts of 0.2–0.8 wt% of Cr
showing only chromate species on the surface after cal-
cination at 720◦C and 550◦C. Upon reduction with CO,
these Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+, with further re-
duction to Cr2+ being mainly prevented by a stabilizing

effect of the alumina. They proposed that part of the Cr3+
is incorporated in the vacant octahedral sites of the spinel
surface. Diffusion into these vacant Al3+ sites is facilitated
by the similar ionic radii and charge of Cr3+ and Al3+ (9).
Alternatively, the authors suggest on the basis of 27
Al MAS
NMR measurements that Cr3+ occupies sites on alumina
in the close vicinity of the octahedral Al3+ sites, continuing
the spinel structure of the alumina with structurally similar
Cr2O3. The formation of this structure would then have a
stabilizing effect on the Cr3+ species (10). A similar model
has been proposed for the growth of V2O5 on γ -alumina
(32, 37). Upon recalcination at 550◦C, Weckhuysen et al.
(9, 10) observed that most of the Cr3+ was reoxidized to
Cr6+, while the isolated or dispersed Cr3+ resisted oxida-
tion. This effect was also assigned to the stabilization of the
Cr3+ species by the alumina support. The work of De Rossi
et al. (13) supports the observation. Upon recalcination,
they found that a small fraction of Cr3+ produced in the
reductions could not be reoxidized on alumina, whereas on
silica and zirconia systems the Cr was oxidized reversibly.
They suggested that the Cr3+ species were less exposed on
the surface of γ -alumina.
Consideration of our results in the light of the literature
encourages us to propose the following growth mechanism.
The ALE process ensures a high dispersion over the de-
hydroxylated alumina support and stabilizes Cr3+ even at
low loadings of Cr. Even during the ﬁrst cycle Cr3+ can
be incorporated into sites on the spinel surface. Jacobs et
al. (38) have shown that the surfaces of spinels, including
γ -alumina,exposeonlytheoctahedralsites.TheCr3+would
thus easily be incorporated into just these sites, and it would
still be visible to LEIS. Alternatively, or later in the growth,
the spinel structure of the γ -alumina may be extended. The
successive ALE sequences to increase the Cr loading en-
sure high dispersion, and with an air-treatment step after
every Cr(acac)3 sequence the Cr3+ is likely to be stabi-
lized, resulting in a relatively high fraction of Cr in the
oxidation state 3+ even without any reduction step. Be-
cause of strong chromia-alumina interaction, this stabiliza-
tion makes the formation of Cr3+ irreversible. Chromium
in oxidation state 6+ is probably stabilized on alumina as
mono-, di-, or polychromate structures, depending on the
Cr loading, similarly to impregnated catalysts (3). Hence,
the oxidation step changes the bonding of Cr to the support
from the monodentate species of type-Cr(acac)2 to chro-
mate species which are bound to the surface through more
than one bond.
Catalytic Activity of Chromia/Alumina Catalysts
The measured increase in initial activity with chromium
loading is in agreement with the ﬁndings of De Rossi et al.
(13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogena-
tion of propane. De Rossi et al. measured increased activ-
ity for chromia/γ -alumina catalysts with a loading up to
1.0 Cr/nm2, while Gorritz et al. observed the initial con-
version to increase in a wider concentration range up to
4 wt% of Cr (3.3 Cr/nm2). According to De Rossi et al., the
linear correlation that they found between dehydrogena-
tion activity and Cr concentration indicates mononuclear
chromium to be the active site. Our results are consistent
with this conclusion, because even the low-loaded catalysts,
in which dispersion presumably is at atomic level, were ac-
tive. In other words, Cr did not need to be present in pairs
or in greater ensembles in order to produce active catalysts.
On the other hand, increasing coverage was not deleterious
to the activity. An active Cr site or sites evidently can be
formed in structures including more than one Cr atom.
In the work of Gorritz et al. (18) further increase of
the loading from 4 wt% was accompanied by only a small
increase in the activity, whereas in our work the activity
continued to increase linearly after the monolayer cover-
age was exceeded. In other words, activity increased even
though the Cr atoms were no longer all surface atoms. Ev-
idently the continued increase in the activity can only be
explained by higher reactivity per active site in the second
layer or, if only part of the chromium monolayer surface
species are active, by an increase in the number of active
sites. The latter would mean that Cr in the second layer can
be active and simultaneously it does not destroy the active
site in the ﬁrst layer. Since we studied only one data point
above the monolayer, further speculation is not warranted.
The interesting feature of the catalytic behavior above
monolayer coverage cannot wholly be explained by our
present knowledge or on the basis of the literature. We are
therefore carrying out experiments at still higher loadings,
to shed light on these questions. Furthermore, catalysts pre-
pared by ALE and impregnation techniques will be com-
pared to study in detail the inﬂuence of the preparation
method and oxidation state distribution on the dehydro-
genation activity of the catalysts in detail.
CONCLUSIONS
The chemisorption of Cr(acac)3 on γ -Al2O3 in the ALE
process proved to be independent of the loading of Cr in
repeated ALE sequences of Cr(acac)3 and air. A saturation
coverage of 0.8 Cr/nm2 was found. We believe that the steric
hindrance of the acac groups is the determining factor in
the coverage, since the number of available binding sites
is large. The ALE method resulted in a homogeneously
distributed Cr coverage throughout the catalyst particles,
even after seven ALE cycles. Surface area and pore volume
measurements were in agreement with the weight increase
of Cr.
Characterization of oxidized surfaces by LEIS showed a
monolayer dispersion up to 4.5 Cr/nm2 corresponding to six
ALE cycles. A higher dispersion was reached for the ALE
catalysts than reported in the literature for impregnated
catalysts. The growth mechanism of Cr on γ -alumina sup-

port was different from that of NiO on alumina although an
acetylacetonate compound was used as precursor in both
systems. In the case of Ni, the formation of NiO agglomer-
ateswasobservedbyLEISasearlyasthesecondALEcycle.
XPS and UV-vis spectrophotometry showed that, from
the ﬁrst ALE sequence onwards, a signiﬁcant amount of
the Cr was in the Cr3+ oxidation state. We believe that,
owing to its high dispersion on the dehydrated γ -alumina
surface, the Cr could be easily stabilized and more easily
than in wet-chemical methods where the stabilization oc-
curs only after a few oxidation/reduction cycles. This stabi-
lization could occur as Cr3+ diffused into the vacant octa-
hedral Al3+ positions of the defect spinel structure of the
support, or, alternatively, as a growth of Cr3+ species ex-
tending the γ -alumina spinel structure.
The activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane to
i-butene was measured both at low Cr concentrations and
above monolayer coverage. At low Cr concentrations, the
activity of samples in which Hacac and Hthd blocking
agents were used to ensure high dispersion of the CrOx
species indicated that mononuclear Cr centers determine
the catalytic activity. There was no decline in the rate of
dehydrogenation when the monolayer coverage was ex-
ceeded; rather the activity continued to increase.
