[1] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent technique for the eluci- dation of molecular structures of complex transition metal oxides present as either bulk phases or as two-dimensional surface phases."
[2] "Therefore, this technique can be successfully used to discriminate between different molecular structures on oxide surfaces."
[3] "For example, mono-,di-, tri- and tetrachromate surface species were found to be present on hydrated surfaces of supported chromium oxide catalysts and the polymerization degree of the surface chro- mates species was found to depend on the specific iso-electric point of the inorganic support."
[4] "The developed method is illustrated for chromates with unknown local structure in Bi203 K,CrO, sillenite and for different supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[5] "The obtained results are compared with those previously obtained by X-ray absorption spectroscopy."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They are now widely utilized in various industries due to their unique properties and capabilities. Key research focus areas include understanding the structure of the catalysts, identifying the active sites involved in reactions, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters to enhance performance, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The development of methodologies for analyzing the local structure of chromates, as demonstrated through Raman spectroscopy, has provided insights into the presence of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrachromate surface species on supported chromium oxide catalysts. These studies have also shown that the polymerization degree of surface chromates is influenced by the specific isoelectric point of the inorganic support. Comparative analysis with X-ray absorption spectroscopy validates the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in characterizing the molecular structures of complex transition metal oxides in both bulk and surface phases.
