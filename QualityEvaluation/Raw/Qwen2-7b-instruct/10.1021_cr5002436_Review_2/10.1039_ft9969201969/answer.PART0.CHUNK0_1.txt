[1] "Vibrational spectroscopy has also proven useful in the characterization of simple diatomic molecules."
[2] "The most common empirical expression relating harmonic force constant and interatomic distance for diatomic molecules is Badger's rule, which has been extended to many families of molecules but does not adequately relate bond distances to force constants in polyatomic molecule."
[3] "However, a chromium-oxygen correlation does not exist in the literature and is required for better structural determination of Cr-0 compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[4] "In the present study, the diatomic approximation is used to establish empirical relationships between Cr-0 bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies of chromium oxide reference compounds in the solid state, the gas phase and in solution."
[5] "The presented correlation is an invaluable tool for structural characterization of a chromium oxide compound because its Raman spectrum may be interpreted in terms of Cr-0 bond lengths."
[6] "This is illustrated for supported chromium oxide catalysts and the results are compared with those previously obtained by X-ray absorption spectroscopy."

The development of Raman spectroscopy techniques has significantly advanced the understanding of chromium oxide catalysts since their discovery in 1933. These advancements have primarily focused on elucidating the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of the catalysts. Key industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes, where the catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and selectivity. The ability to determine chromium-oxygen bond distances and bond orders through Raman spectroscopy provides insights into the catalyst's structure, enabling researchers to optimize its performance. This method has been successfully applied to supported chromium oxide catalysts, and the results have been compared with those obtained via X-ray absorption spectroscopy, further validating the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in characterizing these materials.
