[1] "Vibrational spectroscopy has also proven useful in the characterization of simple diatomic molecules."
[2] "The most common empirical expression relating harmonic force constant and interatomic distance for diatomic molecules is Badger's rule, which has been extended to many families of molecules but does not adequately relate bond distances to force constants in polyatomic molecule."
[3] "However, a chromium-oxygen correlation does not exist in the literature and is required for better structural determination of Cr-0 compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[4] "In the present study, the diatomic approximation is used to establish empirical relationships between Cr-0 bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies of chromium oxide reference compounds in the solid state, the gas phase and in solution."
[5] "The presented correlation is an invaluable tool for structural characterization of a chromium oxide compound because its Raman spectrum may be interpreted in terms of Cr-0 bond lengths."

The literature discusses the development and application of chromium oxide catalysts, focusing on their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. It highlights the importance of understanding the chromium-oxygen bond lengths and their relation to the Raman stretching frequencies. This knowledge is crucial for the structural determination of chromium compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts. The literature employs the diatomic approximation to establish empirical relationships between Cr-O bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies, enabling a systematic method for determining coordination and bond lengths. The method is illustrated for chromates with unknown local structures on various surfaces and supported chromium oxide catalysts. Results obtained via this method are compared with those from X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectroscopy technique directly probes the structure and bonding of metal oxide complexes by analyzing their vibrational spectra. For instance, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrachromate surface species are identified on hydrated surfaces of supported chromium oxide catalysts, and their polymerization degree depends on the specific iso-electric point of the inorganic support. The literature also mentions that a chromium-oxygen correlation is lacking in the literature and is essential for better structural determination of Cr-O compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts. An exponential function describes the empirical dependence between Cr-O bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies, facilitating the interpretation of Raman spectra in terms of Cr-O bond lengths. The bond valence reflects the strength of chemical bonds and the distribution of valence electrons in molecular species, while Pauling's valence sum rule ensures the conservation of valency in metal cations. Errors in bond length data might result from misassigned oxidation states or inaccurately determined bond lengths.
