[1] "Vibrational spectroscopy has also proven useful in the characterisation of simple diatomic molecules."
[2] "An exponential function was found to most reasonably describe the empirical dependence between the Cr-0 bond length and Raman stretching frequency."
[3] "The valence state of a chromium cation is calculated by adding the contributions from each Cr-0 bond as determined by eqn. (3)."
