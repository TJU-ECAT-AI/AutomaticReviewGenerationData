The literature discusses the development and application of chromium oxide catalysts, focusing on their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. It highlights the importance of understanding the chromium-oxygen bond lengths and their relation to the Raman stretching frequencies. This knowledge is crucial for the structural determination of chromium compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts. The literature employs the diatomic approximation to establish empirical relationships between Cr-O bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies, enabling a systematic method for determining coordination and bond lengths. The method is illustrated for chromates with unknown local structures on various surfaces and supported chromium oxide catalysts. Results obtained via this method are compared with those from X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectroscopy technique directly probes the structure and bonding of metal oxide complexes by analyzing their vibrational spectra. For instance, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrachromate surface species are identified on hydrated surfaces of supported chromium oxide catalysts, and their polymerization degree depends on the specific iso-electric point of the inorganic support. The literature also mentions that a chromium-oxygen correlation is lacking in the literature and is essential for better structural determination of Cr-O compounds and supported chromium oxide catalysts. An exponential function describes the empirical dependence between Cr-O bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies, facilitating the interpretation of Raman spectra in terms of Cr-O bond lengths. The bond valence reflects the strength of chemical bonds and the distribution of valence electrons in molecular species, while Pauling's valence sum rule ensures the conservation of valency in metal cations. Errors in bond length data might result from misassigned oxidation states or inaccurately determined bond lengths.

文献讨论了铬氧化物催化剂的发展和应用，重点在于其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制。它强调了理解铬-氧键长及其与拉曼伸缩频率关系的重要性。这些知识对于确定铬化合物和支撑铬氧化物催化剂的结构至关重要。文献采用双原子近似来建立铬氧化物参考化合物在固态、气相和溶液中的铬-氧键长和拉曼伸缩频率之间的经验关系，从而实现了一种系统的方法来确定配合物和键长。该方法被用于具有未知局部结构的铬酸盐在Bi203、K,CrO、丝伦石以及不同支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的示例说明。通过这种方法获得的结果与X射线吸收光谱法之前获得的结果进行了比较。文献指出，拉曼光谱技术直接通过分析金属氧化物复合物的振动光谱来探查其结构和结合。例如，在水合表面的支撑铬氧化物催化剂上发现了单、二、三、四价铬酸盐表面物种，并且它们的聚合度取决于无机支持的特定等电点。文献还提到，缺乏文献中存在铬-氧相关性，这对于更好地确定铬-氧化合物和支持的铬氧化物催化剂的结构是必要的。发现了一个描述铬-氧键长和拉曼伸缩频率之间经验依赖性的指数函数，这使得能够用铬-氧键长解释拉曼光谱。文献讨论了化学键的强度和分子物种中可用价电子的分布（即键值），以及保罗的价和规则确保了金属离子的价的守恒。键长数据中的错误可能归因于氧化状态的误指定或错误确定的键长。
