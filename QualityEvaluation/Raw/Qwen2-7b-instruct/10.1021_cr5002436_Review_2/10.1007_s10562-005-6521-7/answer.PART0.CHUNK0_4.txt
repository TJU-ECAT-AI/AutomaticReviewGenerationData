[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world."
[2] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of sup- ported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long- term deactivation routes."
[3] "Indeed, only scattered information about the alkane dehydrogenation mechanism is available for chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems, and none at all for silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[4] "The group of Burwell did seminal work in the 1960s on Cr2O3 by using D-labelled hydrocarbons and deuterium"
[5] "The results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, becoming increasingly active and selective in dehydrogenation processes. They are now widely used in industrial applications across the globe. Researchers have gained considerable insight into the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of their active sites, and the potential pathways for short- and long-term deactivation. However, detailed information on the dehydrogenation mechanism specific to chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems remains scarce. The work of the Burwell group in the 1960s, which utilized D-labelled hydrocarbons and deuterium, laid foundational groundwork for understanding the mechanism. Recent studies have confirmed that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step in the reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，显示出在脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。它们现在在全球的工业脱氢工厂中广泛应用。研究人员对支持的铬氧化物的分子结构、活性位点的性质以及短期和长期失活途径有了深入了解。然而，对于铬-on-alumina和铬-on-zirconia系统特定的脱氢机制的具体信息仍然缺乏。Burwell小组在1960年代的工作，利用D标记的烃类和重水进行了开创性研究，为理解机制奠定了基础。最近的研究表明，乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂反应的限速步骤。
