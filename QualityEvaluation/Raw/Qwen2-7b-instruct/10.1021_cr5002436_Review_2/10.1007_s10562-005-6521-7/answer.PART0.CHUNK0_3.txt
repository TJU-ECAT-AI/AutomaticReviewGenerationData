[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world."
[2] "A significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes."
[3] "Only scattered information about the alkane dehydrogenation mechanism is available for chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems, and none at all for silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[4] "In recent years, it has been suggested that coke deposits could also be active in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The goal of this paper is twofold. First of all, we would like to elucidate if carbon deposits are indeed active in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[6] "The catalytic test results reported in figure 1 are in line with the previous results, since the activity increase continues after the COx formation has vanished."
[7] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane."
[8] "If an elementary step involving an adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediate (b-H transfer or ethene desorption) were the rate-determining step, the intermediate would have a residence time of nearly 4 min on the surface."
[9] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become pivotal in dehydrogenation processes due to their high activity and selectivity. Key industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane, ethylene from ethane, and other light alkenes. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties, elucidating reaction pathways, and understanding deactivation mechanisms. Chromium-on-alumina and silica-supported systems are particularly studied, with a notable emphasis on elucidating the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions. The paper aims to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation, suggesting that while they might initially enhance activity, they could also limit it as the reaction progresses. Theoretical studies support the end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, favoring a mechanism that involves hydrogen transfer or ethene desorption as the rate-determining step, rather than the presence of active intermediates.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了结构、活性中心、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机理等多方面的重大进步。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中因其高活性和选择性而变得至关重要，广泛应用于丙烯生产（从丙烷）、乙烯生产（从乙烷）以及其他轻烯烃的生产中。研究重点集中在优化催化剂性能、阐明反应路径以及理解失活机制。铬-氧化铝和硅酸盐支持系统特别受到关注，对脱氢反应机制的研究尤为显著。论文旨在澄清碳沉积物在乙烷脱氢过程中的作用，表明虽然它们可能最初能增强活性，但在反应过程中也可能限制活性。理论研究表明，乙烷在Cr3+O活性位点上的端向、解离吸附涉及氢转移或乙烷脱氢作为速率决定步骤，而不是存在活性中间体。
