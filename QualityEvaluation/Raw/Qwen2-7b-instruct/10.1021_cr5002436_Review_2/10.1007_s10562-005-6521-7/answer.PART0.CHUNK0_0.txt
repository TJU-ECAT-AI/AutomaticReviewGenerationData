[4] "The goal of this paper is twofold. First of all, we would like to elucidate if carbon deposits are indeed active in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "This can be explained by the reduction of surface Cr6+ by ethane resulting in the initial formation of CO2."
[6] "Recent work on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts has indicated that, in addition to Cr6+ reduction, formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface may contribute to the initial activity increase observed."
[7] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane."
[8] "The absence of bi-deuterated ethane, as would be expected for ethene hydrogenation in the presence of D2, further indicates that there is little back formation of ethane from ethene under the applied reaction conditions."
[9] "If an elementary step involving an adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediate (b-H transfer or ethene desorption) were the rate-determining step, the intermediate would have a residence time of nearly 4 min on the surface."
[10] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into lighter alkenes. Key research focus areas include the detailed molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, identification of the active chromium oxide site, and exploration of various deactivation pathways. Despite these developments, comprehensive insights into the alkane dehydrogenation mechanisms on chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems are still limited, especially for silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. The current study aimed to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation and the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. It was found that carbon deposits do not play a significant role in this process. Instead, the dehydrogenation mechanism involves end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, with little back formation of ethane from ethene. The results suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机理等多方面的进步。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中因其高效将烷烃转化为轻质烯烃而变得至关重要。研究焦点主要集中在支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的识别以及各种失活途径的探索。尽管如此，对于铬-氧化铝和铬-锆石系统中的烷烃脱氢机制，尤其是对于硅基支持的铬氧化物催化剂，仍缺乏全面的了解。当前的研究旨在阐明碳沉积在乙烷脱氢过程中的作用以及Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。研究结果表明，碳沉积并不在这一过程中扮演重要角色。相反，脱氢机制涉及乙烷在Cr3+O活性位点上的端向、离解吸附，且几乎没有从乙烯重新形成乙烷的情况。研究结果表明，乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂上反应的速率决定步骤。
