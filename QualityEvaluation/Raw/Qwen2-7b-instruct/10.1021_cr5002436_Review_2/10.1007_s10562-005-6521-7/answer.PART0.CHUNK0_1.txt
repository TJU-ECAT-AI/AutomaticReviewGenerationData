[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world."
[2] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes."
[3] "Only scattered information about the alkane dehydrogenation mechanism is available for chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems, and none at all for silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts."
[4] "The group of Burwell did seminal work in the 1960s on Cr2O3 by using D-labelled hydrocarbons and deuterium."
[5] "This paper aims to elucidate if carbon deposits are indeed active in the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[6] "Recent work on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts has indicated that, in addition to Cr6+ reduction, formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface may contribute to the initial activity increase observed."
[7] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane."
[8] "The absence of bi-deuterated ethane, as would be expected for ethene hydrogenation in the presence of D2, further indicates that there is little back formation of ethane from ethene under the applied reaction conditions."
[9] "This result is different from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was concluded to be the rate-determining step."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced the field of dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of light alkenes, particularly propylene, which is crucial for polypropylene manufacturing. Research focus areas have centered on understanding the catalyst's structure, identifying the nature of active sites, exploring different support materials, examining the role of promoters, and elucidating the reaction mechanisms. This knowledge has been accumulated over the past decade, with studies focusing on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the active sites, and the deactivation pathways. Despite advancements, there remains a scarcity of detailed information on the alkane dehydrogenation mechanism for chromium-based catalysts, especially when compared to other systems like zirconia or silica supports. Initial work by Burwell in the 1960s laid foundational insights into chromium oxide catalysts. Recent studies aim to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation and have identified a preference for end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site. These findings contrast with previous observations on isobutane dehydrogenation, suggesting that ethane adsorption might be the rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation processes over chromium oxide catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展极大地推动了脱氢过程的应用。关键的工业应用包括轻烯烃的生产，特别是丙烯，这是聚丙烯制造的关键原料。研究焦点领域集中在催化剂结构的理解、活性位点的性质、不同支撑材料的探索、促进剂的作用以及反应机制的阐明。过去十年积累的知识主要涉及支持型铬氧化物的分子结构、活性位点和短期及长期失活途径。尽管如此，对于铬基催化剂的烷烃脱氢机制的研究仍相对匮乏，特别是在与氧化锆或二氧化硅支持相比时。Burwell在20世纪60年代的开创性工作为铬氧化物催化剂提供了基础见解。近期的研究旨在澄清碳沉积物在乙烷脱氢中的作用，并确定了乙烷在Cr3+O活性位点上的端向、解离吸附机制。这些发现与对异丁烷脱氢的观察形成对比，表明乙烷吸附可能是铬氧化物催化剂中脱氢过程的限速步骤。
