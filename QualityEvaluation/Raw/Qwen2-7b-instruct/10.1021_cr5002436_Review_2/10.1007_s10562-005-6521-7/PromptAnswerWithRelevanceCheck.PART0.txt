The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into lighter alkenes. Key research focus areas include the detailed molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, identification of the active chromium oxide site, and exploration of various deactivation pathways. Despite these developments, comprehensive insights into the alkane dehydrogenation mechanisms on chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia systems are still limited, especially for silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. The current study aimed to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation and the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. It was found that carbon deposits do not play a significant role in this process. Instead, the dehydrogenation mechanism involves end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, with little back formation of ethane from ethene. The results suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机理等多方面的进步。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中因其高效将烷烃转化为轻质烯烃而变得至关重要。研究焦点主要集中在支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的识别以及各种失活途径的探索。尽管如此，对于铬-氧化铝和铬-锆石系统中的烷烃脱氢机制，尤其是对于硅基支持的铬氧化物催化剂，仍缺乏全面的了解。当前的研究旨在阐明碳沉积在乙烷脱氢过程中的作用以及Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机制。研究结果表明，碳沉积并不在这一过程中扮演重要角色。相反，脱氢机制涉及乙烷在Cr3+O活性位点上的端向、离解吸附，且几乎没有从乙烯重新形成乙烷的情况。研究结果表明，乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂上反应的速率决定步骤。

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced the field of dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of light alkenes, particularly propylene, which is crucial for polypropylene manufacturing. Research focus areas have centered on understanding the catalyst's structure, identifying the nature of active sites, exploring different support materials, examining the role of promoters, and elucidating the reaction mechanisms. This knowledge has been accumulated over the past decade, with studies focusing on the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the active sites, and the deactivation pathways. Despite advancements, there remains a scarcity of detailed information on the alkane dehydrogenation mechanism for chromium-based catalysts, especially when compared to other systems like zirconia or silica supports. Initial work by Burwell in the 1960s laid foundational insights into chromium oxide catalysts. Recent studies aim to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation and have identified a preference for end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site. These findings contrast with previous observations on isobutane dehydrogenation, suggesting that ethane adsorption might be the rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation processes over chromium oxide catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展极大地推动了脱氢过程的应用。关键的工业应用包括轻烯烃的生产，特别是丙烯，这是聚丙烯制造的关键原料。研究焦点领域集中在催化剂结构的理解、活性位点的性质、不同支撑材料的探索、促进剂的作用以及反应机制的阐明。过去十年积累的知识主要涉及支持型铬氧化物的分子结构、活性位点和短期及长期失活途径。尽管如此，对于铬基催化剂的烷烃脱氢机制的研究仍相对匮乏，特别是在与氧化锆或二氧化硅支持相比时。Burwell在20世纪60年代的开创性工作为铬氧化物催化剂提供了基础见解。近期的研究旨在澄清碳沉积物在乙烷脱氢中的作用，并确定了乙烷在Cr3+O活性位点上的端向、解离吸附机制。这些发现与对异丁烷脱氢的观察形成对比，表明乙烷吸附可能是铬氧化物催化剂中脱氢过程的限速步骤。

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. Research has focused on understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, identifying the nature of the active chromium oxide sites, and exploring potential deactivation pathways. However, there has been limited work dedicated to elucidating the detailed reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts have been shown to be highly active and selective in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are industrially utilized across the globe in dehydrogenation plants. Over the past decade, considerable advancements have been made in understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the characteristics of the active sites, and the mechanisms of short-term and long-term deactivation.

3. The research community has not extensively investigated the reaction mechanism behind the dehydrogenation process using chromium oxide catalysts. This lack of understanding poses a challenge in optimizing the catalyst performance and improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

4. The primary objective of the study is to determine if carbon deposits generated during the initial activation of the catalyst play an active role in the dehydrogenation of ethane. By conducting isotopic labeling experiments, the researchers aim to extend previous work by Burwell on chromium oxide catalysts and relate their findings to recent theoretical studies by Lillehaug et al.

5. The study builds upon earlier research on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts, indicating that apart from Cr6+ reduction, the formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface contributes to the initial increase in activity. The results align with previous observations, suggesting that the observed activity boost persists even after the formation of COx ceases.

6. Proposing the formation of a CrO monolayer on the alumina surface could enhance the dispersion of chromium oxide, potentially improving catalyst performance. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Hakuli et al. (16).

7. The isotopic labeling experiments revealed that only one hydrogen atom is exchanged for deuterium in ethane molecules, indicating an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on the catalyst surface. This finding aligns with previous studies by Burwell and theoretical work by Lillehaug et al.

8. The transient kinetic data suggest that the adsorption of ethane is the rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. This conclusion supports the hydridocomplex route, where ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and hydrogen molecules, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制方面取得了显著进展。它们在各种工业应用中至关重要，特别是在脱氢化过程中。研究集中在理解支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及短期和长期失活途径的可能性上。然而，关于这些催化剂的详细反应机制的研究相对较少。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂已被证明在脱氢化反应中非常活跃且选择性高，并在全球的脱氢化工厂中得到工业应用。在过去十年中，研究人员已经积累了大量有关支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及可能的短期和长期失活途径的知识。

3. 目前，对使用铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢化过程的详细反应机制的研究相对有限。这限制了催化剂性能的优化和脱氢化过程效率的提升。

4. 研究的主要目标是确定在初始激活过程中产生的碳沉积物是否在乙烷脱氢化过程中起积极作用。通过进行同位素标记实验，研究人员旨在扩展Burwell等人的先前工作，并将他们的发现与Lillehaug等人最近发表的理论研究联系起来。

5. 基于对丙烷脱氢化过程中支持铬氧化物催化剂的研究，研究指出除了Cr6+还原之外，催化剂表面形成的烃类物种的形成也可能导致初始活性增加。研究结果与先前观察相符，表明即使COx形成消失后，观察到的活性提升仍然持续。

6. 提出在氧化铝表面上形成CrO单层可以进一步提高铬氧化物的分散度，从而改善催化剂性能。这一假设得到了Hakuli等人的研究支持。

7. 同位素标记实验显示，只有一个氢原子被氘取代在乙烷分子中，表明乙烷在催化剂表面以端向、解离吸附的方式吸附。这一发现与Burwell和Lillehaug等人的理论工作相吻合。

8. 脱氢化反应的瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂上反应的决定性步骤。这一结论支持了氢化复合途径，其中乙烷吸附到CrH位点，导致形成CrC2H5和氢分子，随后重新形成CrH并释放乙烯。

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become pivotal in dehydrogenation processes due to their high activity and selectivity. Key industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane, ethylene from ethane, and other light alkenes. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties, elucidating reaction pathways, and understanding deactivation mechanisms. Chromium-on-alumina and silica-supported systems are particularly studied, with a notable emphasis on elucidating the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions. The paper aims to clarify the role of carbon deposits in ethane dehydrogenation, suggesting that while they might initially enhance activity, they could also limit it as the reaction progresses. Theoretical studies support the end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site, favoring a mechanism that involves hydrogen transfer or ethene desorption as the rate-determining step, rather than the presence of active intermediates.
