1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. Research has focused on understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, identifying the nature of the active chromium oxide sites, and exploring potential deactivation pathways. However, there has been limited work dedicated to elucidating the detailed reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts have been shown to be highly active and selective in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are industrially utilized across the globe in dehydrogenation plants. Over the past decade, considerable advancements have been made in understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the characteristics of the active sites, and the mechanisms of short-term and long-term deactivation.

3. The research community has not extensively investigated the reaction mechanism behind the dehydrogenation process using chromium oxide catalysts. This lack of understanding poses a challenge in optimizing the catalyst performance and improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

4. The primary objective of the study is to determine if carbon deposits generated during the initial activation of the catalyst play an active role in the dehydrogenation of ethane. By conducting isotopic labeling experiments, the researchers aim to extend previous work by Burwell on chromium oxide catalysts and relate their findings to recent theoretical studies by Lillehaug et al.

5. The study builds upon earlier research on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts, indicating that apart from Cr6+ reduction, the formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface contributes to the initial increase in activity. The results align with previous observations, suggesting that the observed activity boost persists even after the formation of COx ceases.

6. Proposing the formation of a CrO monolayer on the alumina surface could enhance the dispersion of chromium oxide, potentially improving catalyst performance. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Hakuli et al. (16).

7. The isotopic labeling experiments revealed that only one hydrogen atom is exchanged for deuterium in ethane molecules, indicating an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on the catalyst surface. This finding aligns with previous studies by Burwell and theoretical work by Lillehaug et al.

8. The transient kinetic data suggest that the adsorption of ethane is the rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. This conclusion supports the hydridocomplex route, where ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and hydrogen molecules, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制方面取得了显著进展。它们在各种工业应用中至关重要，特别是在脱氢化过程中。研究集中在理解支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及短期和长期失活途径的可能性上。然而，关于这些催化剂的详细反应机制的研究相对较少。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂已被证明在脱氢化反应中非常活跃且选择性高，并在全球的脱氢化工厂中得到工业应用。在过去十年中，研究人员已经积累了大量有关支持铬氧化物的分子结构、活性铬氧化物位点的性质以及可能的短期和长期失活途径的知识。

3. 目前，对使用铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢化过程的详细反应机制的研究相对有限。这限制了催化剂性能的优化和脱氢化过程效率的提升。

4. 研究的主要目标是确定在初始激活过程中产生的碳沉积物是否在乙烷脱氢化过程中起积极作用。通过进行同位素标记实验，研究人员旨在扩展Burwell等人的先前工作，并将他们的发现与Lillehaug等人最近发表的理论研究联系起来。

5. 基于对丙烷脱氢化过程中支持铬氧化物催化剂的研究，研究指出除了Cr6+还原之外，催化剂表面形成的烃类物种的形成也可能导致初始活性增加。研究结果与先前观察相符，表明即使COx形成消失后，观察到的活性提升仍然持续。

6. 提出在氧化铝表面上形成CrO单层可以进一步提高铬氧化物的分散度，从而改善催化剂性能。这一假设得到了Hakuli等人的研究支持。

7. 同位素标记实验显示，只有一个氢原子被氘取代在乙烷分子中，表明乙烷在催化剂表面以端向、解离吸附的方式吸附。这一发现与Burwell和Lillehaug等人的理论工作相吻合。

8. 脱氢化反应的瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂上反应的决定性步骤。这一结论支持了氢化复合途径，其中乙烷吸附到CrH位点，导致形成CrC2H5和氢分子，随后重新形成CrH并释放乙烯。
