[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins [11]."
[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrOB or Cr,O, [2]."
[3] "A program has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and presence of moisture [19-211."
[4] "In the O&5% Cr03 loading range, chromium oxide is present as hydrated chromate and dichromate species and that the ratio monomers/dimers decreases with increasing surface coverage [20]."
[5] "The spectra of the 12-24% Cr0JA1203 samples further show a sharp band at 550 cm-, which becomes more pronounced with increasing coverage. This band belongs to metal-oxygen vibration of distorted octahedrally coordinated chromium atoms in crystalline Crz03 [24]."
[6] "The present Raman spectra of the catalysts also reveal the presence of hydrated chromate, dichromate, and trichromate species, respectively, with increasing loading or decreasing pH at PZC."
[7] "The Raman spectrum of y-A1203 (500 C ) is not shown because the y-A&OS phase is Raman inactive. Calcination of the alumina support at 950C transforms the y-A1203 phase into a mixture of 8- and 6-A1203 (major Raman bands at 843, ca. 750, and 254 cm- )."
[8] "The molecular structures of the hydrated chromium (VI) oxide surface species, however, are a function of the surface coverage and calcination temperature. This is because the surface structures are dependent on the net surface pH at PZC of the hydrated oxide surface."
[9] "Monolayer coverage is reached at ca. 12% CrOs/AixOs and crystalline CrzO, particles are found on the alumina surface together with surface chromium oxide species at higher loadings."
[10] "At high calcination temperatures ( &800C) the Cr203 crystalline particles react with the alumina support to form Cr(II1) in solid solution with a-A&O, (corundum)."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively utilized since their discovery in 1933, primarily for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins.
2. The high catalytic activity of these systems is attributed to surface chromium oxide species rather than bulk chromium oxide phases.
3. Researchers have initiated studies focusing on the supported chromium oxide system based on its surface coverage, support material, calcination temperature, and moisture presence.
4. In the 0.5-5% Cr03 loading range, the catalyst consists of hydrated chromate and dichromate species, with the monomer-to-dimer ratio decreasing with increased surface coverage.
5. The 12-24% Cr0JA1203 samples display a distinctive 550 cm- band, indicative of crystalline Crz03, as the coverage increases.
6. The Raman spectra of the catalysts illustrate the presence of hydrated chromate, dichromate, and trichromate species as loading or pH at PZC decreases.
7. Calcination at 950°C transforms the y-A1203 phase into a blend of 8- and 6-A1203, characterized by major Raman bands at 843, ca. 750, and 254 cm-.
8. The molecular structures of hydrated chromium (VI) oxide surface species vary with surface coverage and calcination temperature, influenced by the net surface pH at point of zero charge (PZC).
9. Monolayer coverage is achieved at approximately 12% CrOs/AixOs, with crystalline CrzO, particles appearing on the alumina surface alongside surface chromium oxide species at higher loadings.
10. At high calcination temperatures around 800°C, the Cr203 crystalline particles interact with the alumina support to form chromium (III) in solid solution with a-A&O, (corundum).
