[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins."
[2] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures."
[3] "Further- more, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), pH at point of zero charge measurements,and BET measurements are used to gain additional information on the chromium oxidation state, chromium oxide and alumina phases, surface acidity, and surface areas, respectively."
[4] "The present Raman spectra of the catalysts also reveal the presence of hydrated chromate, dichromate, and trichromate species, respectively, with increasing loading or decreasing pH at PZC."
[5] "It was found that up to a surface coverage of 9% Cr03/AIz03 chromium oxide is stabilized by the alumina support in the + 6 oxidation state after cal- cination at 120-1050C."
[6] "The molecular structures of the hydrated chro- mium (VI) oxide surface species, however, are a function of the surface cover- age and calcination temperature."
[7] "This is because the surface structures are dependent on the net surface pH at PZC of the hydrated oxide surface."
[8] "High calcination temperatures cause a reduction of the BET surface area and results in an increase of the surface density of the chromium oxide overlayer."
[9] "Monolayer coverage is reached at ca. 12% CrOs/AixOs and crystalline CrzO, particles are found on the alumina surface together with surface chromium oxide species."
[10] "At high cakination temperatures ( 3 800  C ) , the CrzOs crystaihne particles react with the aIu- mina support to form Cr (III) in solid solution with CY-A&O,(corundum)."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, gaining importance in various industrial applications including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins.
2. Key research focuses on understanding the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases, determining the factors influencing these structures, and characterizing the chromium oxidation state, chromium oxide and alumina phases, surface acidity, and surface areas through advanced techniques like Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, pH at point of zero charge measurements, and BET surface area measurements.
3. The molecular structures of hydrated chromium(VI) oxide surface species are influenced by surface coverage and calcination temperature, as they depend on the net surface pH at the point of zero charge (PZC) of the hydrated oxide surface.
4. Higher calcination temperatures lead to a reduction in the BET surface area and an increase in the surface density of the chromium oxide layer, affecting the surface structures and properties of the catalyst.
5. Monolayer coverage of chromium oxide is achieved at around 12% coverage on the alumina surface, where crystalline chromium oxide particles coexist with surface chromium oxide species.
6. At extremely high calcination temperatures (around 800°C), the chromium oxide crystalline particles react with the alumina support to form chromium(III) in solid solution with corundum, altering the lattice parameters of the corundum phase.

1. 自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂经历了显著的发展，在各种工业应用中获得了重要性，包括氢化、烃类的脱氢、烷烃的脱氢环化以及烯烃的聚合。
2. 关键研究集中在理解表面铬氧化物相的分子结构、确定影响这些结构的因素，并通过高级技术如拉曼光谱、X射线光电子光谱、X射线衍射分析、零电荷点的表面pH测量和比表面积测量来表征铬氧化物和氧化铝相、表面酸性和表面积。
3. 水合六价铬氧化物表面物种的分子结构受到表面覆盖度和煅烧温度的影响，因为它们依赖于水合氧化物表面的净零电荷点（PZC）的表面pH。
4. 较高的煅烧温度导致比表面积的减少和铬氧化物层表面密度的增加，从而影响催化剂的表面结构和性质。
5. 当覆盖率达到约12%时，实现单层覆盖，此时在氧化铝表面上存在晶态铬氧化物颗粒与表面铬氧化物物种共存。
6. 在极高的煅烧温度（大约800°C）下，铬氧化物结晶颗粒与氧化铝支持物反应形成铬(III)在氧化铝中的固溶体，改变氧化铝的晶格参数。
