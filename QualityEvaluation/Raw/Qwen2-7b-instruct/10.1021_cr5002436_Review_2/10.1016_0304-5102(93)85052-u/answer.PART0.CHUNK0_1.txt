[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins [1]."
[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrOB or Cr,O, [2]."
[3] "The chromium oxide is present as hydrated chromate species at 2% Cr03/A1z03, as hydrated dichromate species between 10 and 30% Cr03/A1203, as hydrated trichromate species at 40% Cr03/A1z03, and as crystalline CrO, and hydrated trichromate species at 60% Cr03/A1203 [19]."
[4] "The Raman spectrum of the 9% Cr03/A1203 sample reveals the same bands as the 5% Cr03/A1203 sample (also included in Fig. 1) and these bands are accordingly assigned to hydrated dichromate surface species."
[5] "The spectra of the 12-24% Cr0JA1203 samples further show a sharp band at 550 cm-, which becomes more pronounced with increasing coverage. This band belongs to metal-oxygen vibration of distorted octahedrally coordinated chromium atoms in crystalline Crz03 [24]."
[6] "The present Raman spectra of the catalysts also reveal the presence of hydrated chromate, dichromate, and trichromate species, respectively, with increasing loading or decreasing pH at PZC."
[7] "Consequently, the hydrated chromium oxide structure changes from chromate to dichromate, trichromate, and tetrachromate, and this is similar to the change in structure in aqueous solution as a function of the pH."
[8] "The Raman spectrum obtained after calcination at 500 C has been discussed above and it was shown that in addition to some laser-induced dehydrated chromium oxide species and hydrated trichromate species, crystalline Cr,O, particles are present on the alumina surface."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced their use in industrial processes. These catalysts are now pivotal in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins. Their catalytic activity is attributed to surface chromium oxide species rather than bulk phases like crystalline chromium oxides. The catalysts exhibit different hydrated chromate, dichromate, trichromate, and tetrachromate species depending on the surface coverage and calcination temperature. At high surface coverages, more polymerized chromium oxide species like dichromates and trichromates form, enhancing catalytic efficiency. High calcination temperatures reduce the BET surface area, increasing the density of the chromium oxide layer. This increase leads to a decrease in the net surface pH, promoting the formation of trichromates on the alumina surface. Monolayer coverage is reached at around 12% Cr03/A1203, with crystalline Crz03 particles found on the alumina surface. At high calcination temperatures, chromium oxides react with alumina to form solid solutions. These advancements in understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms have significantly contributed to the importance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

The research focus areas in the field of chromium oxide catalysts include studying the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide phases, understanding how these structures change under different conditions, exploring the impact of surface coverage and calcination temperature on catalyst performance, investigating the role of support materials and promoters in enhancing catalyst activity, and elucidating the reaction mechanisms involved in various catalytic processes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的演变极大地推动了工业过程的应用。这些催化剂现在在烃类氢化、烃类异构化、烯烃聚合等反应中发挥关键作用。它们的催化活性归因于表面铬氧化物物种，而不是结晶铬氧化物这样的基体相。催化剂表现出不同的水合铬酸盐、二铬酸盐、三铬酸盐和四铬酸盐物种，这取决于表面覆盖度和煅烧温度。高表面覆盖度时，形成更多聚合的铬氧化物物种，如二铬酸盐和三铬酸盐，从而提高催化效率。高温煅烧降低比表面积，增加铬氧化物层的密度。这种增加导致表面pH值下降，促进表面三铬酸盐的形成。单分子层覆盖率在大约12% Cr03/A1203处达到，铝氧化物表面上有结晶Crz03颗粒。高温煅烧时，铬氧化物与铝氧化物反应形成固溶体。这些理解结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的进展对脱氢过程中的催化剂具有重要贡献。

研究重点领域包括：研究表面铬氧化物相的分子结构，了解在不同条件下的结构变化，探索表面覆盖度和煅烧温度对催化剂性能的影响，研究支持材料和促进剂如何增强催化剂活性，并阐明各种催化过程中涉及的反应机制。
