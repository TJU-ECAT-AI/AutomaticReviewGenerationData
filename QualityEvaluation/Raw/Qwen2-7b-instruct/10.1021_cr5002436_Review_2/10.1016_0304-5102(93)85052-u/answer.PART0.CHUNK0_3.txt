[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins [1]."
[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrOB or Cr,O, [2]."
[3] "For the Cr03/A1203 system, it was shown that after impregnation with CrO, solutions and drying at 25 C under vacuum, the chromium oxide is present as hydrated chromate species at 2% Cr03/A1203, as hydrated dichromate species between 10 and 30% Cr03/A1203, as hydrated trichromate species at 40% Cr03/A1203, and as crystalline CrO, and hydrated trichromate species at 60% Cr03/A1203 [19]."
[4] "In situ dehydration of these Cr03/A1203 samples causes the transformation of the hydrated chromate and dichromate species into two dehydrated species, each possessing one short terminal Cr=O bond, and one or more polymeric species [21]."
[5] "The presence of hydrated trichromate species after calcination at 950 and 1050 C is probably caused by two factors. First, the water content will even be lower than in the case of the sample calcined at 5OOC, due to severe dehydroxylation. Second, the significant loss in surface area of the alumina support serves to increase the surface density of the chromium oxide overlayer."
[6] "The net surface pH decreases by the increase of surface density and, consequently, more polymerized chromium oxide species (trichromates) are found on the alumina surface."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, becoming widely recognized for their high catalytic activity in various industrial applications. Key areas of focus in their development and research include:

1. **Structure and Active Sites**: Chromium oxides are known for their ability to exist in various oxidation states, such as Cr(III), Cr(VI), and Cr(VII), which influence their catalytic properties. Their structure, particularly the arrangement of chromium atoms and oxygen bonds, plays a crucial role in determining the active sites available for reactions.

2. **Support Materials**: Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is a common support material used in chromium oxide catalysts. The interaction between chromium oxide and the support material affects the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Factors like calcination temperature and duration impact the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst.

3. **Promoters**: While chromium oxides are typically effective, the use of promoters like vanadium, tungsten, or molybdenum can enhance their performance by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

4. **Reaction Mechanisms**: The mechanism of action for chromium oxide catalysts involves the adsorption of reactants, activation through redox reactions, and subsequent conversion to products. Understanding these mechanisms helps in optimizing the catalyst design for specific reactions.

5. **Dehydrogenation Processes**: Chromium oxide catalysts are particularly useful in dehydrogenation processes, such as the conversion of paraffins to olefins, where the catalysts facilitate the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds to produce olefinic compounds.

Research focuses on understanding how the structure of chromium oxides, their interactions with support materials, and the presence of promoters affect the catalytic performance. This includes studying the molecular structures of the surface species, the influence of calcination temperature and coverage, and the impact on the surface acidity and surface area of the catalyst.
