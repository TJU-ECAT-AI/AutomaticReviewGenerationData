Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved and gained prominence in various industries due to their high catalytic activity in processes such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:

1. **Structure**: Chromium oxide species on the surface play a critical role in the catalytic activity rather than the bulk phases like CrOB or Cr,O. The structure of these surface species changes with factors like surface coverage, calcination temperature, support type, and presence of moisture.

2. **Active Sites**: The active sites are primarily located on the surface of the chromium oxide, where the reactions occur. These sites are influenced by the stabilization of the chromium oxide species by the support material.

3. **Support Materials**: Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is commonly used as a support for chromium oxide catalysts due to its ability to stabilize the chromium oxide species in the desired oxidation state and maintain the catalyst's activity.

4. **Promoters**: Although not mentioned in the document, the use of promoters might enhance the catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts by altering the surface chemistry or modifying the active sites.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: The reaction mechanisms involve the activation of substrates by the surface chromium oxide species, leading to the desired chemical transformations like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and polymerization.

6. **Surface Coverage**: Surface coverage affects the stability and oxidation state of the chromium oxide species. Below 9% coverage, the chromium oxide remains in the +6 oxidation state, whereas at 12% coverage, part of it is reduced to the +3 oxidation state, forming crystalline Cr2O3.

These advancements have significantly contributed to the importance of chromium oxide catalysts in various industrial applications, including petrochemical processing, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，并在诸如氢化、烃类脱氢、烷烃脱氢环化和烯烃聚合等工业过程中获得了重要地位。其关键应用领域及研究重点包括：

1. **结构**：催化剂的活性主要由表面的铬氧化物种决定，而非结晶态的CrOB或Cr,O。这些表面物种的结构会受到覆盖度、煅烧温度、支持材料类型以及水分存在等因素的影响。

2. **活性位点**：活性位点主要位于铬氧化物种表面，是反应发生的场所。这些位点受支持材料对铬氧化物种稳定性的影响而变化。

3. **支持材料**：氧化铝（Al2O3）常被用作铬氧化物催化剂的支持体，因为它能够维持所需氧化状态的铬氧化物种并保持催化剂活性。

4. **促进剂**：虽然文档中未提及，但可能通过改变表面化学或修改活性位点来增强铬氧化物催化剂性能的促进剂。

5. **反应机制**：反应机制涉及通过表面铬氧化物种激活底物，进而引发所需的化学转化如氢化、脱氢、脱氢环化和聚合。

6. **覆盖度**：覆盖度影响铬氧化物种的稳定性及其氧化状态。低于9%的覆盖度时，铬氧化物种保持在+6氧化状态；而在12%覆盖度时，部分物种被还原至+3氧化状态，形成结晶态Cr2O3。

这些进展显著推动了铬氧化物催化剂在多个工业领域的应用，包括石油化学品加工、有机合成和环境修复。
