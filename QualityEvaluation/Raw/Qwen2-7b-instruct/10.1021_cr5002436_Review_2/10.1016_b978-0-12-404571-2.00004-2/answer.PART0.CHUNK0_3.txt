[1] "The Antrim Shale gas, for example, has high nitrogen concentration, as does at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation."
[2] "The compositions have been normalized to the reported compounds."
[3] "The wells showed initial production rates up to twenty or more million cubic feet of gas per day with estimates of 100330 ft3 of gas per ton of shale."
[4] "The Marcellus Shale gas has relatively little carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
[5] "Early indications are that the Marcellus gas has sufficient liquids to require processing."

The document provides details on the composition of shale gas from various formations. Here are summaries for each:

1. The Antrim Shale gas has a high nitrogen concentration, similar to at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation. 
2. The compositions of shale gas have been adjusted to standard compounds for comparison purposes.
3. Wells in the Antrim Shale formation demonstrated initial production rates ranging from twenty to more than twenty million cubic feet of gas daily, with estimates suggesting that 100 to 330 cubic feet of gas could be produced per ton of shale.
4. The Marcellus Shale gas contains relatively little carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It is described as being dry and not requiring the removal of natural gas liquids for transportation through pipelines.
5. Early assessments suggest that the Marcellus gas possesses enough liquid content necessitating processing before utilization.

文档提供了不同沉积层天然气成分的详细信息。以下是每个沉积层的概要：

1. 安特里姆沉积层天然气具有较高的氮浓度，至少一个在巴尼特沉积层测试的井也是如此。
2. 天然气组成已经调整为标准化合物进行比较。
3. 安特里姆沉积层的井展示了从二十到超过二十万立方米的天然气日产量，估计每吨沉积层可以产生100到330立方米的天然气。
4. 马塞勒斯沉积层天然气含有相对较少的二氧化碳和氮。描述为干燥的，不需要去除天然气液体以通过管道运输。
5. 初步评估表明，马塞勒斯天然气含有足够的液体需要处理才能使用。
