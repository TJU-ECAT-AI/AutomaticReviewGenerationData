[1] "The Antrim Shale is a shallow shale gas resource in Michigan."
[2] "The Antrim Shale is unique because the gas is predominantly biogenic: methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale."
[3] "Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring by-product of shale gas produced by desorption and, as a result, the carbon dioxide levels in shale gas increase during the productive life of a well."
[4] "Individual well production varies from 50,000 to 60,000 ft3/day."
[5] "Significant associated water is produced, which requires central production facilities for dehydration, compression and disposal."
[6] "The Antrim Shale gas, for example, has high nitrogen concentration, as does at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation."

The Antrim Shale is a unique resource in Michigan, characterized by its predominantly biogenic methane gas. This gas is produced as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material within the shale. As a result of the gas production process, carbon dioxide levels in the shale gas increase over the productive life of the well. Individual wells in the Antrim Shale produce a volume ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 cubic feet per day. Additionally, significant quantities of associated water are produced alongside the gas, necessitating centralized facilities for dehydration, compression, and disposal. The Antrim Shale gas, as well as at least one well in the Barnett Shale formation, exhibits high nitrogen concentrations.

安特里姆页岩是密歇根州的一种独特的资源，其特征是主要由细菌消耗有机物质产生的生物甲烷气体。这种气体在页岩中作为副产品产生。由于气田生产过程，页岩气中的二氧化碳含量在井的生产周期内增加。单个安特里姆页岩井的日产量从5万到6万立方英尺不等。此外，大量与之相关的水被生产出来，需要集中设施进行脱水、压缩和处置。安特里姆页岩气以及至少一个巴顿页岩形成中的井显示出较高的氮浓度。
