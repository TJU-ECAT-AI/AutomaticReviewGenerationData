[1] "There is an additional issue that must be resolved if shale gas is to be a major contributor to US energy resources (or to the energy plans of any country). The issue is the amenability of the gas to be included in current gas processing scenarios (Mokhatab et al.,2006; Speight, 2007)."
[2] "While shale gas resources represent a significant portion of current and future production, all shale gas is not constant in composition and gas processing requirements for shale gas can vary from area to area (Bullin and Krouskop, 2008; Weiland and Hatcher, 2012)."
[3] "The Antrim Shale is unique because the gas is predominantly biogenic: methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale."
[4] "The compositions have been normalized to the reported compounds."

The document discusses the challenges and complexities involved in utilizing shale gas as a major energy source, particularly focusing on the issues related to its processing and composition variability. It highlights the need to resolve the compatibility of shale gas with existing gas processing methods, given the diverse nature of its composition across different regions and resources. The text also mentions the Antrim Shale's distinctive feature of producing biogenic methane through bacterial consumption of organic material within the shale. Additionally, it notes that the gas compositions presented in Table 4.3 have been adjusted to standardize the reported components.
