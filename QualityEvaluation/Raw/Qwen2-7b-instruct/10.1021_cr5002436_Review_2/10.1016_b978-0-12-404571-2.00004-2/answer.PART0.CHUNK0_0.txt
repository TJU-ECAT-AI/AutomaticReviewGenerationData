4.4.3 Fayetteville Shale Formation
The Fayetteville Shale is an unconventional gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin and ranges in thickness from 50 to 550 ft at a depth of 15006500 ft. The gas (Table 4.3) primarily requires only dehydration to meet pipeline specifications.
The shale formation is estimated to hold between 58 and 65 billion cubic feet (58 to 65 3 106 ft3) per square, and initial production rates were on the order of 0.20.6 million cubic feet per day for vertical wells and 1 to 3.5 million cubic feet per day for horizontal wells. In 2003, the production era exceeded 500 million cubic feet per day (Bullin and Krouskop, 2008).
