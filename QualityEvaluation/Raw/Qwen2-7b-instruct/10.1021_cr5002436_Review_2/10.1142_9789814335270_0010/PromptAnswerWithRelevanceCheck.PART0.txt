[1] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets. Rather, in this decade, Asia has witnessed cycles of marked credit card lending booms and busts in a number of its markets."
[2] "Six factors lay behind the relaxation of lending standards and excessive growth in credit card lending. First, weaker corporate loan demand, ample liquidity in the banking systems and lower interest rates in the wake of the Asian financial crisis put pressure on lenders to focus more on consumers."
[3] "In a matter of two weeks, the outstanding value of the ITC-managed funds fell by 15%. Most card companies found it almost impossible to roll over their maturing debts. Funding difficulties also forced issuers to slow or even cut their lending to cardholders, further pushing up delinquencies and hurting the confidence of bond investors."
[4] "An important question regarding the 2003 Korean credit card crisis concerns whether and to what extent levels of credit card cash advances affect asset quality of card lending portfolios for a number of reasons."
[5] "First, the episodes highlight the importance of placing greater emphasis on detecting early warning signs before imbalances build up excessively for too long."

3. In response to the crisis, the value of funds managed by investment trust companies (ITCs) decreased by 15% within two weeks. Card companies struggled to refinance maturing debts, leading to reduced lending and increased delinquencies.
4. A critical inquiry about the 2003 Korean credit card crisis is whether and how much credit card cash advances influence the quality of card lending portfolios, considering various factors.
5. The lessons from the episodes underscore the necessity of placing greater emphasis on recognizing early warning signs before significant imbalances develop over time.
