[1] "Recently Beguin et al. [18] showed that the retardation of the sintering is caused by the formation of micro-domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface."
[2] "It has been reported that La-P-A1203 rare-earth aluminate with the @-A1203 structure is formed via LnAlO,at a temperature higher than 1400 C by calcination of a Ln,O,-A&O,mixture for 24 h [23, 241."
[3] "The addition of lanthanum leads to nonmonotonic changes in the surface area. For all series of samples (with the exception of those containing cerium), the surface area increases with increasing lanthanide content and reaches a maximum at about 3 wt.% Ln,O, (Ln =La, Pr, Nd and Sm)."
[4] "The data shown in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that samples prepared by means of coprecipitation (N) have higher surface areas than those obtained by impregnation (N*)."
[5] "All samples display three endothermic peaks, with minima at 100, 300 and 400 C. The first peak is related to the elimination of adsorbed water; the second and third are a result of dehydroxylation of hydrated alumina [28]."

1. 粘结剂在氧化铝表面形成的微域导致了烧结速率的减缓。
2. 在高于1400°C的温度下，通过24小时的煅烧，镧氧-氧化铝混合物可以形成具有@-氧化铝结构的镧系氧化铝。
3. 添加镧到氧化铝中会导致表面面积的非单调变化，在大多数系列样品中达到最大值约为3 wt.% 镧氧。
4. 通过共沉淀制备的样品具有比浸渍法更高的表面积。
5. 所有样品都显示了三个吸热峰，与吸附水的去除和水合氧化铝的脱水有关。
