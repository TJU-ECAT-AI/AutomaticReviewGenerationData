The study investigates the impact of lanthanide oxides (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. Lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of y-Al2O3 to γ-Al2O3 and associated sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure contributes to the thermal stabilization of transition alumina. The addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in the surface area, reaching a maximum around 3 wt.% Ln,O, for lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium. For cerium-doped aluminas, two characteristic concentrations of about 1 wt.% and 4 wt.% CeO, are identified. The surface area depends on the elements in the Ln,O,-Al2O3 system with 3 wt.% Ln,O,. There are slight differences in surface area as the atomic number increases from lanthanum to samarium due to the similarity in chemical properties among rare-earth elements.

该研究探讨了镧系氧化物（La、Ce、Pr、Nd、Sm）对过渡氧化铝结构和热稳定性的影响。镧系氧化物的添加延迟了y-Al2O3向γ-Al2O3的转变以及相关的烧结过程。镧系氧化铝的尖晶石型结构的存在对过渡氧化铝的热稳定化起到了作用。镧氧化物的添加导致表面面积的非单调变化，对于镧、镨、钕和钐，最大值约为3 wt.% Ln,O,。对于铈掺杂氧化铝，两个特征浓度分别为约1 wt.%和4 wt.% CeO,。在Ln,O,-Al2O3体系中，当Ln,O,含量为3 wt.%时，表面面积依赖于元素。镧至钐的原子序数增加时，由于所有稀土元素的化学性质相似，表面面积存在微小差异。
