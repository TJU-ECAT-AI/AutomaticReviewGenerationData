[1] "Lanthanide oxide addition has been found to retard the transformation of y-Alz03 to LY-AIO and the associated sintering."
[2] "The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure is responsible for the thermal stabilization of transition alumina."
[3] "The addition of La,O,to Al,O,leads to an increase in the temperature of transition from r-Al,O,to c-A&.0,"
[4] "These authors attributed the stabilization effect to the formation of a lanthanum aluminate surface layer."
[5] "Recent Beguin et al. [18] showed that the retardation of the sintering is caused by the formation of micro-domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface."
[6] "Thus it appears from various studies that the origin of the stabilizing effect is not well documented,since either the lanthanum+-Al,O,phase or LaAIO, could be responsible for inhibiting the transformation of y- Al,O, to (Y-AI,O,"
[7] "Chemical analysis (consisting of extraction of unreacted rare- earth-element oxides with ammonium acetate solution and weighing) as well as by XRD examination,there was about 95% formation of the perovskite phase in this temperature range."
[8] "The general character of the curves is similar in all cases. It should be emphasized that admixed samples maintain the highest surface area in the range 500-1000 C and keep a relatively high specific surface area even after calcination at 1200 C,although the surface area of the pure alumina deteriorates rapidly on calcination at the same temperature."
[9] "It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the addition of lanthanum leads to nonmonotonic changes in the surface area."
[10] "Figure 9 illustrates the dependence of the surface area on the elements for the samples of Ln,O,-A&O,containing 3 wt.% of Ln,O,"

The document investigates the effects of lanthanide oxides on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. Lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3 and reduces sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure stabilizes transition alumina thermally. The stabilization effect is attributed to the formation of a lanthanum aluminate surface layer. Micro-domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface cause the retardation of sintering. The origin of the stabilizing effect is not well documented, as either the lanthanum+-Al2O3 phase or LaAlO3 could inhibit the transformation of γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3. Samples with lanthanide oxide additives maintain high surface area in the range of 500-1000°C and retain a relatively high specific surface area even after calcination at 1200°C. The addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in surface area. The surface area depends on the lanthanide element for samples containing 3 wt.% of lanthanide oxide.

文档研究了镧系氧化物对过渡氧化铝结构和热稳定性的影响。镧系氧化物的添加延迟了γ-Al2O3到θ-Al2O3的转变并减少了烧结。具有钙钛矿型结构的镧系氧化铝稳定了过渡氧化铝的热稳定性。稳定化效果归因于镧氧化铝表面层的形成。镧氧化铝在氧化铝表面的微域导致烧结延迟。稳定作用的起源尚未充分记录，因为镧氧化铝或LaAlO3可能是抑制γ-Al2O3到θ-Al2O3转变的原因。含有镧系氧化物添加剂的样品在500-1000°C范围内保持高表面积，并在1200°C煅烧后仍能保留相对较高的比表面积。镧氧化物的添加导致表面面积的非单调变化。表面面积取决于含镧元素的样品中镧氧化物的质量百分比。
