[1] "Recently Beguin et al. [18] showed that the retardation of the sintering is caused by the formation of micro-domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface."
[2] "It has been reported that La-P-A1203 rare-earth aluminate with the @-A1203 structure is formed via LnAlO,at a temperature higher than 1400 C by calcination of a Ln,O,-A&O,mixture for 24 h [23, 241."
[3] "The addition of lanthanum leads to nonmonotonic changes in the surface area. For all series of samples (with the exception of those containing cerium), the surface area increases with increasing lanthanide content and reaches a maximum at about 3 wt.% Ln,O, (Ln =La, Pr, Nd and Sm)."
[4] "The data shown in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that samples prepared by means of coprecipitation (N) have higher surface areas than those obtained by impregnation (N*)."
[5] "All samples display three endothermic peaks, with minima at 100, 300 and 400 C. The first peak is related to the elimination of adsorbed water; the second and third are a result of dehydroxylation of hydrated alumina [28]."

The document investigates the impact of certain lanthanide oxides on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. It finds that lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of y-Alz03 to LY-AIO and sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with a perovskite-type structure contributes to the thermal stabilization of transition alumina. The document also discusses the differences in surface area and homogeneity between samples prepared through coprecipitation and impregnation methods. It notes that the addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in surface area, with optimal stabilization achieved at around 3 wt.% of the lanthanide oxide admixture. The document further explains that the similarities in chemical properties among rare-earth elements affect the surface area of the aluminas. However, the document does not specifically address how chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 or the key industrial applications and research focus areas related to dehydrogenation processes.

The study investigates the impact of lanthanide oxides (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. Lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of y-Al2O3 to γ-Al2O3 and associated sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure contributes to the thermal stabilization of transition alumina. The addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in the surface area, reaching a maximum around 3 wt.% Ln,O, for lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium. For cerium-doped aluminas, two characteristic concentrations of about 1 wt.% and 4 wt.% CeO, are identified. The surface area depends on the elements in the Ln,O,-Al2O3 system with 3 wt.% Ln,O,. There are slight differences in surface area as the atomic number increases from lanthanum to samarium due to the similarity in chemical properties among rare-earth elements.

该研究探讨了镧系氧化物（La、Ce、Pr、Nd、Sm）对过渡氧化铝结构和热稳定性的影响。镧系氧化物的添加延迟了y-Al2O3向γ-Al2O3的转变以及相关的烧结过程。镧系氧化铝的尖晶石型结构的存在对过渡氧化铝的热稳定化起到了作用。镧氧化物的添加导致表面面积的非单调变化，对于镧、镨、钕和钐，最大值约为3 wt.% Ln,O,。对于铈掺杂氧化铝，两个特征浓度分别为约1 wt.%和4 wt.% CeO,。在Ln,O,-Al2O3体系中，当Ln,O,含量为3 wt.%时，表面面积依赖于元素。镧至钐的原子序数增加时，由于所有稀土元素的化学性质相似，表面面积存在微小差异。

[7] "Chemical analysis (consisting of extraction of unreacted rare- earth-element oxides with ammonium acetate solution and weighing) as well as by XRD examination,there was about 95% formation of the perovskite phase in this temperature range."
[8] "The general character of the curves is similar in all cases. It should be emphasized that admixed samples maintain the highest surface area in the range 500-1000 C and keep a relatively high specific surface area even after calcination at 1200 C,although the surface area of the pure alumina deteriorates rapidly on calcination at the same temperature."

The document investigates the effects of lanthanide oxides on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. Lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3 and reduces sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure stabilizes transition alumina thermally. The stabilization effect is attributed to the formation of a lanthanum aluminate surface layer. Micro-domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface cause the retardation of sintering. The origin of the stabilizing effect is not well documented, as either the lanthanum+-Al2O3 phase or LaAlO3 could inhibit the transformation of γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3. Samples with lanthanide oxide additives maintain high surface area in the range of 500-1000°C and retain a relatively high specific surface area even after calcination at 1200°C. The addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in surface area. The surface area depends on the lanthanide element for samples containing 3 wt.% of lanthanide oxide.

文档研究了镧系氧化物对过渡氧化铝结构和热稳定性的影响。镧系氧化物的添加延迟了γ-Al2O3到θ-Al2O3的转变并减少了烧结。具有钙钛矿型结构的镧系氧化铝稳定了过渡氧化铝的热稳定性。稳定化效果归因于镧氧化铝表面层的形成。镧氧化铝在氧化铝表面的微域导致烧结延迟。稳定作用的起源尚未充分记录，因为镧氧化铝或LaAlO3可能是抑制γ-Al2O3到θ-Al2O3转变的原因。含有镧系氧化物添加剂的样品在500-1000°C范围内保持高表面积，并在1200°C煅烧后仍能保留相对较高的比表面积。镧氧化物的添加导致表面面积的非单调变化。表面面积取决于含镧元素的样品中镧氧化物的质量百分比。
