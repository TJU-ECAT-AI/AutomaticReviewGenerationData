<p>The effects of the kind and amount of certain lanthanide oxides (Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas have been investigated.</p>
<p>Lanthanide oxide addition has been found to retard the transformation of y-Alz03 to LY-AIO and the associated sintering.</p>
<p>The presence of lanthanide aluminate with the perovskite-type structure is responsible for the thermal stabilization of transition alumina.</p>
<p>According to reports [25, 261, the presence of the residues may be a consequence of the parent materials not being homogeneous enough, the calcination time not long enough, and the temperature of sintering not high enough.</p>
<p>In the case of the sample containing cerium in a molar ratio Ce:Al= 1:l (similar to that of the case of samples containing lower amounts of cerium), the formation of CeAlO, phase was not observed.</p>
<p>Chemical and magnetic investigations revealed that under the synthesis conditions applied some of the Ce3+ ions get oxidized to the +4 valency state, which leads to a decrease in the yield of the perovskite-type phase.</p>
<p>The observed differences are a consequence of the different degrees of homogeneity of the parent materials produced by the different methods [26].</p>
<p>Moreover, in each series, alumina peaks broadened with increasing Ln,O, loading,i.e., Ln,O, seemed to reduce the size of the A&O, crystallites.</p>
<p>It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the addition of lanthanum leads to nonmonotonic changes in the surface area.</p>
<p>The data shown in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that samples prepared by means of coprecipitation (N) have higher surface areas than those obtained by impregnation (N).</p>
<p>Figure 9 illustrates the dependence of the surface area on the elements for the samples of Ln,O,-A&O, containing 3 wt.% of Ln,O,</p>
<p>Relatively small differences in the surface area, as the atomic number increases on going from lanthanum to samarium, may result from the great similarity in the chemical properties of all rare-earth elements.</p>

The document investigates the impact of certain lanthanide oxides on the structure and thermal stability of transition aluminas. It finds that lanthanide oxide addition delays the transformation of y-Alz03 to LY-AIO and sintering. The presence of lanthanide aluminate with a perovskite-type structure contributes to the thermal stabilization of transition alumina. The document also discusses the differences in surface area and homogeneity between samples prepared through coprecipitation and impregnation methods. It notes that the addition of lanthanum oxide causes non-monotonic changes in surface area, with optimal stabilization achieved at around 3 wt.% of the lanthanide oxide admixture. The document further explains that the similarities in chemical properties among rare-earth elements affect the surface area of the aluminas. However, the document does not specifically address how chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 or the key industrial applications and research focus areas related to dehydrogenation processes.

文档研究了某些镧系氧化物对过渡氧化铝结构和热稳定性的影响。它发现镧系氧化物的添加延迟了y-Alz03向LY-AIO的转变和烧结。镧系氧化铝具有类似钙钛矿结构的存在对过渡氧化铝的热稳定性有贡献。文档还讨论了通过共沉淀和浸渍方法制备的样品在表面面积和均一性上的差异。它指出镧氧化物的添加导致表面面积非单调变化，最佳稳定化在大约3 wt.%的镧系氧化物添加剂混合物时获得。文档进一步解释了所有稀土元素的化学性质相似性影响了氧化铝的表面面积。然而，文档没有具体说明自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂如何发展，或者与脱氢过程相关的关键工业应用和研究焦点领域。
