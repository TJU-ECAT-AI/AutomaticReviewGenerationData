[1] "In our laboratory a systematic re-search program was started to investigate the role of foreign species on certain solid-state processes of zir-conia, such as crystallization, sintering and phase transition [ 12 ] when the foreign species is added to the previously precipitated xerogel."
[2] "The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 [ 26 ] is ZrMozOs, which is not detected in the X-ray patterns of samples heated at 820 K for 5 h."
[3] "The dispersed state of the molybdate ion for the thermally treated ZMoX( 8 ) samples is also deduced from an IR emission spectroscopy study [ 28 ], which has revealed isolated MoO ]- even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2."
[4] "This point is confirmed by its sensitivity to the formation of surface compounds. Indeed, the anchorage of surface compounds blocks the surface sites and decreases the surface mobility."

The research program in the laboratory focuses on studying the impact of foreign substances, like molybdenum, on zirconia's crystallization, sintering, and phase transitions. The study reveals that molybdenum forms compounds with zirconia, such as ZrMozOs, and can affect the crystallization process. The dispersed state of molybdate ions is confirmed through IR spectroscopy studies, showing isolated MoO3 even after extensive heat treatment. The presence of surface compounds, possibly formed by molybdenum, reduces surface mobility and blocks surface sites, affecting processes like sintering and phase stabilization of zirconia.

实验室的研究计划专注于研究外源物质（如钼）对锆石晶化、烧结和相转变的影响。研究表明，钼可以与锆石形成化合物，如ZrMozOs，影响晶化过程。通过红外光谱分析证实了钼酸盐离子的分散状态，即使在经过长时间高温处理后，仍然存在孤立的MoO3。表面化合物的存在，可能是由钼形成的，减少了表面活性，并阻塞了表面位点，影响了锆石的烧结和单斜相向四方相的转变稳定性。
