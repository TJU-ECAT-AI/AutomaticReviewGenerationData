[1] "Several techniques were applied including X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[2] "The results show that the pH affects the uptake and the nature of the Mo adsorbed species which, by interacting with the ZrO2 surface, exert different effects on the crystallization, sintering and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia."
[3] "The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 is ZrMozOs, which is not detected in the X-ray patterns of samples heated at 820 K for 5 h."
[4] "For the ZMoX( 1 ) samples a different situation is encountered, since in the DTA experiments two peaks, ct and 13, are obtained."
[5] "The two-peak structure shows that zirconia crystallizes in two distinct processes."

The paper discusses the interaction of molybdenum (VI) oxide with zirconia surfaces, affecting crystallization, sintering, and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia. The pH influences the nature of the molybdenum adsorbed species, impacting these processes. The paper also reveals that the only known compound between zirconia and molybdenum oxide is ZrMozOs, not detectable under certain heat treatments. For molybdenum-containing samples, the DTA experiments show two distinct crystallization peaks, indicating that zirconia crystallizes through two separate processes.

该论文研究了六价钼氧化物与锆酸盐表面的相互作用，影响了锆酸盐的结晶、烧结和四斜相稳定化过程。pH值影响吸附钼物种的性质，进而对这些过程产生不同影响。论文还指出，锆酸盐和钼氧化物之间唯一已知的化合物是ZrMozOs，在特定热处理下无法检测到。对于含钼样品，DTA实验显示两个独立的结晶峰，表明锆酸盐通过两种不同的过程结晶。
