The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, focusing on their key industrial applications and research focus areas. These areas include the structure of the catalysts, the nature of active sites, the materials used as supports, promoters, and the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. The catalysts are primarily used in petrochemical industries for processes such as hydrocarbon reforming, cracking, and isomerization. Research efforts aim at understanding and optimizing the catalyst's structure, the location and activity of active sites, the role of support materials in enhancing performance, the use of promoters to improve selectivity and efficiency, and the detailed mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions to achieve better yields and product purity.

The document also delves into the importance of the pH effect on the preparation of hydrous zirconium oxide, which affects the adsorption of impurities and their interaction with zirconium oxide. This impacts the properties of the catalyst, such as densification. Molybdic ions, present in varying degrees of condensation based on solution pH, interact with zirconium oxide during thermal treatment, influencing crystallization, sintering, and the stabilization of tetragonal forms of zirconia.

Regarding the crystallization process, the study reveals that as the molybdenum content increases, the crystallization peak shifts to higher temperatures for molybdenum oxide (MoO3) containing samples. The dispersed state of molybdate ions in thermally treated samples is confirmed through infrared emission spectroscopy, showing isolated MoO] ions even after treatment at high temperatures.

The dispersed state of the molybdate ions in the thermally treated ZMoX(8) samples is also deduced from an infrared emission spectroscopy study, indicating isolated MoO] ions even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2.

文档讨论了自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展，重点是它们在工业应用和研究重点领域的关键作用。这些领域包括催化剂的结构、活性位点的性质、作为支持材料的使用、促进剂以及脱氢反应的机制。这些催化剂主要应用于石油化学工业，用于烃类重整、裂解和异构化等过程。研究努力集中在理解并优化催化剂的结构、活性位点的位置和活性、支持材料如何增强性能、使用促进剂提高选择性和效率，以及详细分析脱氢反应机制以实现更好的产率和产品纯度。

文档还深入探讨了pH值对水合锆氧 化物制备的影响，这影响杂质的吸附及其与锆氧 化物的相互作用，从而影响催化剂的性质，如致密化。溶液中的钼离子根据pH值的不同存在不同的凝聚状态，这影响它们与锆氧 化物的相互作用，在热处理过程中影响结晶、烧结和四方锆石相稳定的稳定性。

对于结晶过程，研究表明随着钼含量的增加，含有钼氧化物（MoO3）的样品的结晶峰向更高的温度移动。通过红外发射光谱研究得出，热处理后ZMoX(8)样品中钼酸盐离子保持分散状态，即使在820 K处理2%的MoO3在ZrO2上也能观察到孤立的MoO]离子。
