[1] "In the past, differences in the reflectance spectra of Mo(VI) dispersed on various supports have been discussed in terms of tetrahedral or octahedral coordination of the molybdenum atom."
[2] "The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 [26] is ZrMozOs, which is not detected in the X-ray patterns of samples heated at 820 K for 5 h."
[3] "For the ZMoX(8) samples, as the Mo content increases, the crystallization peak is shifted to higher temperature, fig. 4A,while for the samples of the ZMoX(1) series, the crystallization peak is split into two components, ct and 13, fig. 4B."
[4] "The dispersed state of the molybdate ion for the thermally treated ZMoX(8) samples is also deduced from an IR emission spectroscopy study [28], which has revealed isolated MoO1- even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2."

The document explores the interaction of molybdenum (VI) with zirconia surfaces, focusing on how the pH of the solution influences the uptake and nature of the adsorbed molybdenum species. These interactions impact zirconia crystallization, sintering, and stabilization. The study uses various techniques like X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Key findings include the effect of molybdenum content on zirconia's crystallization and phase transitions, influenced by the adsorbed species. The document also discusses the crystallization behavior under different pH conditions, showing how the molybdenum content and pH can lead to distinct crystallization processes and peak shifts in thermal analysis.
