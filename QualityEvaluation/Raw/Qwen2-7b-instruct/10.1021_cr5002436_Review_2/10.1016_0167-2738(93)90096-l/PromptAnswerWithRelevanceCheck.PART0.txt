[1] "The results show that the pH affects the uptake and the nature of the Mo adsorbed species which, by interacting with the ZrO2 surface, exert different effects on the crystallization, sintering and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia."
[2] "Zirconia-based ceramics are often prepared using 'hydrous zirconium oxide' as starting material."
[3] "The Mo-containing samples were prepared by suspending a known amount of hydrous zirconium oxide (HZ) in a relatively large volume of a water solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24 • 4H2O, at pH= 1 (fixed by nitric acid) or at pH=8 (fixed by addition of ammonia)."
[4] "The Mo content (table 1) was determined by atomic absorption after dissolution of a sample in 0.40% HF solution, and subsequent dilution."
[5] "The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 [26] is ZrMo2O8."
[6] "Regarding the influence of surface compounds on the zirconia crystallization, it should be recalled that HZ is formed by very small ordered regions with a tetragonal structure exposing the (101) plane [27]."
[7] "The dispersed state of the molybdate ion for the thermally treated ZMoX(8) samples is also deduced from an IR emission spectroscopy study [28], which has revealed isolated MoO3 even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2."
[8] "The two-peak structure shows that zirconia crystallizes in two distinct processes."

The study investigates the interaction of molybdenum (VI) with zirconia surface and its influence on the crystallization, sintering, and phase transformation of zirconia. The pH of the solution affects the nature of the molybdenum adsorbed species, which interact with the zirconium oxide surface and impact the crystallization, sintering, and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia. The molybdenum is added to the hydrous zirconium oxide, and its content and distribution are determined using various analytical methods. The results suggest that the presence of molybdenum alters the crystallization and phase transformation processes in zirconia. The dispersed state of molybdate ions is confirmed through infrared emission spectroscopy studies, and the crystallization process is found to occur in two distinct stages. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between foreign species and zirconia for optimizing the preparation conditions and properties of zirconia-based ceramics.

The paper discusses the interaction of molybdenum (VI) oxide with zirconia surfaces, affecting crystallization, sintering, and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia. The pH influences the nature of the molybdenum adsorbed species, impacting these processes. The paper also reveals that the only known compound between zirconia and molybdenum oxide is ZrMozOs, not detectable under certain heat treatments. For molybdenum-containing samples, the DTA experiments show two distinct crystallization peaks, indicating that zirconia crystallizes through two separate processes.

The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, focusing on their key industrial applications and research focus areas. These areas include the structure of the catalysts, the nature of active sites, the materials used as supports, promoters, and the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. The catalysts are primarily used in petrochemical industries for processes such as hydrocarbon reforming, cracking, and isomerization. Research efforts aim at understanding and optimizing the catalyst's structure, the location and activity of active sites, the role of support materials in enhancing performance, the use of promoters to improve selectivity and efficiency, and the detailed mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions to achieve better yields and product purity.

The document also delves into the importance of the pH effect on the preparation of hydrous zirconium oxide, which affects the adsorption of impurities and their interaction with zirconium oxide. This impacts the properties of the catalyst, such as densification. Molybdic ions, present in varying degrees of condensation based on solution pH, interact with zirconium oxide during thermal treatment, influencing crystallization, sintering, and the stabilization of tetragonal forms of zirconia.

Regarding the crystallization process, the study reveals that as the molybdenum content increases, the crystallization peak shifts to higher temperatures for molybdenum oxide (MoO3) containing samples. The dispersed state of molybdate ions in thermally treated samples is confirmed through infrared emission spectroscopy, showing isolated MoO] ions even after treatment at high temperatures.

The dispersed state of the molybdate ions in the thermally treated ZMoX(8) samples is also deduced from an infrared emission spectroscopy study, indicating isolated MoO] ions even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2.

The research program in the laboratory focuses on studying the impact of foreign substances, like molybdenum, on zirconia's crystallization, sintering, and phase transitions. The study reveals that molybdenum forms compounds with zirconia, such as ZrMozOs, and can affect the crystallization process. The dispersed state of molybdate ions is confirmed through IR spectroscopy studies, showing isolated MoO3 even after extensive heat treatment.
