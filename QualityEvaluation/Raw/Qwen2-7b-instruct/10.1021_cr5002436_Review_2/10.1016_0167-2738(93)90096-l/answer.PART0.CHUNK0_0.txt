[1] "The results show that the pH affects the uptake and the nature of the Mo adsorbed species which, by interacting with the ZrO2 surface, exert different effects on the crystallization, sintering and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia."
[2] "Zirconia-based ceramics are often prepared using 'hydrous zirconium oxide' as starting material."
[3] "The Mo-containing samples were prepared by suspending a known amount of hydrous zirconium oxide (HZ) in a relatively large volume of a water solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24 • 4H2O, at pH= 1 (fixed by nitric acid) or at pH=8 (fixed by addition of ammonia)."
[4] "The Mo content (table 1) was determined by atomic absorption after dissolution of a sample in 0.40% HF solution, and subsequent dilution."
[5] "The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 [26] is ZrMo2O8."
[6] "Regarding the influence of surface compounds on the zirconia crystallization, it should be recalled that HZ is formed by very small ordered regions with a tetragonal structure exposing the (101) plane [27]."
[7] "The dispersed state of the molybdate ion for the thermally treated ZMoX(8) samples is also deduced from an IR emission spectroscopy study [28], which has revealed isolated MoO3 even after treatment at 820 K for a 2% MoO3 on ZrO2."
[8] "The two-peak structure shows that zirconia crystallizes in two distinct processes."

The study investigates the interaction of molybdenum (VI) with zirconia surface and its influence on the crystallization, sintering, and phase transformation of zirconia. The pH of the solution affects the nature of the molybdenum adsorbed species, which interact with the zirconium oxide surface and impact the crystallization, sintering, and stabilization of the tetragonal form of zirconia. The molybdenum is added to the hydrous zirconium oxide, and its content and distribution are determined using various analytical methods. The results suggest that the presence of molybdenum alters the crystallization and phase transformation processes in zirconia. The dispersed state of molybdate ions is confirmed through infrared emission spectroscopy studies, and the crystallization process is found to occur in two distinct stages. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between foreign species and zirconia for optimizing the preparation conditions and properties of zirconia-based ceramics.
