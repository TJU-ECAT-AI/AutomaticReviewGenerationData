<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermal activation of alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts for propene metathesis was studied. Catalysts with low metal oxide content exhibited the highest specific activities despite being highly resistant to reduction. It was proposed that the active sites were formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the conditions employed. Activating these catalysts at high temperatures (up to 1140 K) was possible, leading to specific metathesis activities superior to those of catalysts with higher metal oxide loadings. The active sites of Mo and W-based metathesis catalysts were considered to contain metals in an oxidation state lower than +6, with molybdenum(IV) identified as the precursor of the carbene site active in metathesis.

Alumina-supported MoO3 and WO3 catalysts were activated for the metathesis of propene by thermal treatment in At. Temperatures up to 1140 K are required for catalysts with low metal contents. These exhibit the highest specific activities though they are known to be highly resistant to reduction. It is proposed that the active sites are formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the conditions employed.

The active sites of Mo and W based heterogeneous metathesis catalysts are widely considered to contain the metal in an oxidation state lower than +6. This view, which has its origin in the pronounced break-in behavior of SiO2 supported systems, has been substantiated by the work of Yermakov, lwasawa, Kazansky [163] and other authors, and Me 4+ has been identified as the precursor of the carbene site active in metathesis.

However, we report in this paper that catalysts with low metal oxide content may be activated at very high temperatures and exhibit specific metathesis activities superior to those of catalysts with higher metal oxide loadings.

AI203 supported catalysts exposed to temperatures above 973 K suffer a considerable breakdown of their micropore structure. Thus, a decrease of the BET surface area by approximately 40 % was observed upon calcination of samples with 3-9 and I wt.% WO3 in air at 1143 K for 2 h. Also, the dispersity of the active component may be influenced by the thermal treatment. WO3 and MoO3 are known to form monomolecular layers on AI203 [6,9] so their dispersity will be very high. Any change of this surface structure should lead to a decrease of dispersity. All these factors tend to reduce the amount of metal ions accessible in the samples activated at the highest temperatures.

As a consequence, it can be stated that the specific metathesis activity of MoO3 and WO3 is correlated with the stability of the hexavalent metal ions rather than with their reducibility. This suggests that a reduction of M(VI) to M(IV) is not necessary for the activation of these catalysts and that the active sites are formed starting from M(VI) species, possibly by a mechanism as discussed by Rapp and Goddard in a theoretical study [10].

Small quantities of W(V) were observed by EPR after the activation procedures typically employed in this study [12]. A detailed study of their properties and of the problem of whether they are involved in the formation of the active sites of metathesis is under way.

In the document provided, there is no information regarding chromium oxide-based catalysts or their evolution since their discovery in 1933. The document focuses on alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts for the metathesis of propene. The text discusses the activation of these catalysts through thermal treatment, the relationship between the metal content and specific activities, and the correlation between the stability of hexavalent metal ions and the catalytic activity. It also mentions the potential formation of active sites from molybdenum (VI) and tungsten (VI) species, and the influence of thermal treatment on the dispersion and accessibility of metal ions. However, there is no mention of chromium oxide-based catalysts or their industrial applications or research focus areas. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be provided based on the given document.

The active sites of molybdenum and tungsten based heterogeneous metathesis catalysts are commonly thought to contain the metal in an oxidation state lower than +6. This perspective, originating from the distinct initiation behavior of systems supported by silica, has been confirmed through the work of Yermakov, Iwasawa, Kazansky, and other researchers. Molybdenum tetra+, Me4+, is recognized as the precursor for the active carbene site in metathesis reactions.

These alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts were activated for the metathesis of propene through thermal treatment in argon. High temperatures up to 1140 K are needed for catalysts with low metal oxide content, which surprisingly exhibit superior metathesis activities compared to those with higher metal oxide loads. The active sites are believed to originate from molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) species. It's proposed that the metal in these catalysts is present in an oxidation state lower than +6. The activation process requires stringent conditions, and the activation temperatures rise with decreasing metal oxide content. The formation of active sites starts from the molybdenum(VI) or tungsten(VI) species, suggesting that reduction to molybdenum(IV) or tungsten(IV) is not essential for activation.
