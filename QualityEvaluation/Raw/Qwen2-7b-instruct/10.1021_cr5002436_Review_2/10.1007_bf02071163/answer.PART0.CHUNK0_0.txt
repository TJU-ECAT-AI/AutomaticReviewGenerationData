The thermal activation of alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts for propene metathesis was studied. Catalysts with low metal oxide content exhibited the highest specific activities despite being highly resistant to reduction. It was proposed that the active sites were formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the conditions employed. Activating these catalysts at high temperatures (up to 1140 K) was possible, leading to specific metathesis activities superior to those of catalysts with higher metal oxide loadings. The active sites of Mo and W-based metathesis catalysts were considered to contain metals in an oxidation state lower than +6, with molybdenum(IV) identified as the precursor of the carbene site active in metathesis.

对Al2O3支持的MoO3和WO3催化剂进行热激活以实现丙烯的裂解反应进行了研究。低金属氧化物含量的催化剂表现出最高特定活性，尽管它们在还原过程中具有很高的抵抗力。提出，在所采用的条件下，活性位点是由Mo(VI)和W(VI)物种形成的。通过将这些催化剂在高温（高达1140 K）下活化，可以获得特定裂解活性，这比具有更高金属氧化物负载的催化剂要高。Mo和W基裂解催化剂的活性位点被认为包含在+6以下的氧化状态下的金属，钼(IV)被识别为参与裂解的碳烯基位点的前体。
