These alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts were activated for the metathesis of propene through thermal treatment in argon. High temperatures up to 1140 K are needed for catalysts with low metal oxide content, which surprisingly exhibit superior metathesis activities compared to those with higher metal oxide loads. The active sites are believed to originate from molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) species. It's proposed that the metal in these catalysts is present in an oxidation state lower than +6. The activation process requires stringent conditions, and the activation temperatures rise with decreasing metal oxide content. The formation of active sites starts from the molybdenum(VI) or tungsten(VI) species, suggesting that reduction to molybdenum(IV) or tungsten(IV) is not essential for activation.

这些氧化铝支持的钼酸盐（MoO3）和钨酸盐（WO3）催化剂通过在氩气中进行热处理激活，用于丙烯的裂合反应。对于低金属氧化物含量的催化剂，需要高达1140 K的高温，而其表现出的裂解活性却优于高金属氧化物负载的催化剂。人们认为，这些催化剂中的活性位点来源于钼(VI)和钨(VI)物种。提出钼或钨的氧化态低于+6。活性位点的形成始于钼(VI)或钨(VI)物种，表明将钼还原为钼(IV)或钨还原为钨(IV)不是激活过程的必要条件。激活过程需要严格的条件，随着金属氧化物含量的降低，激活温度会上升。活性位点的形成始于钼(VI)或钨(VI)物种，这表明将钼还原为钼(IV)或钨还原为钨(IV)不是激活过程的必要条件。
