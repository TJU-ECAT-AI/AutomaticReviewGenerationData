</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermal activation of alumina-supported MoO3 and WO3 catalysts for the metathesis of propene requires temperatures up to 1140 K for catalysts with low metal contents. Catalysts with low metal oxide content exhibit the highest specific activities despite being highly resistant to reduction. The active sites are believed to be formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the conditions employed.

The active sites of Mo and W based heterogeneous metathesis catalysts are widely considered to contain the metal in an oxidation state lower than +6. This view, which has its origin in the pronounced break-in behavior of SiO2 supported systems, has been substantiated by the work of Yermakov, lwasawa, Kazansky [163] and other authors, and Me4+ has been identified as the precursor of the carbene site active in metathesis.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The active sites of molybdenum and tungsten based heterogeneous metathesis catalysts are commonly thought to contain the metal in an oxidation state lower than +6. This perspective, originating from the distinct initiation behavior of systems supported by silica, has been confirmed through the work of Yermakov, Iwasawa, Kazansky, and other researchers. Molybdenum tetra+, Me4+, is recognized as the precursor for the active carbene site in metathesis reactions.

<quotes>
Certainly, these samples must be activated under very drastic conditions and the activation temperatures tend to increase with decreasing metal oxide content.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These samples require intense activation under very severe conditions, and the activation temperatures tend to rise as the metal oxide content decreases.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这些样品需要在极其苛刻的条件下进行激活，而激活温度倾向于随着金属氧化物含量的减少而升高。

<quotes>
This suggests that the specific metathesis activity of MoO3 and WO3 is correlated with the stability of the hexavalent metal ions rather than with their reducibility.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This indicates that the specific metathesis activity of MoO3 and WO3 is linked to the stability of the hexavalent metal ions rather than their reducibility.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这表明MoO3和WO3的特定甲基化活性与六价金属离子的稳定性有关，而不是它们的可还原性。
