The thermal activation of alumina-supported molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) catalysts for the metathesis of propene has been studied. Catalysts with low metal oxide content require temperatures up to 1140 K for activation, exhibiting high specific activities despite being resistant to reduction. The active sites are proposed to be formed from Mo(VI) and W(VI) species under the activation conditions. The activity increases with temperature, reaching a peak with MoO3 and leveling off with WO3. Catalysts with lower metal oxide content are activated at higher temperatures and demonstrate superior specific metathesis activities compared to those with higher metal oxide loadings. The results suggest that the high activity of these catalysts is correlated with the stability of the hexavalent metal ions rather than their reducibility.

对于丙烯的均裂，对氧化铝负载的钼氧化物（MoO3）和钨氧化物（WO3）催化剂进行了热活化研究。低金属氧化物含量的催化剂在1140 K的温度下被激活，显示出高特定活性，尽管它们对还原具有高度抵抗力。提出的观点是在激活条件下，活性位点由Mo(VI)和W(VI)物种形成。活性随温度增加而增加，在MoO3中达到峰值，并在WO3中趋于平缓。较低金属氧化物含量的催化剂在更高的温度下被激活，并且表现出与较高金属氧化物负载催化剂相比优越的特定均裂活性。结果表明，这些催化剂的高活性与六价金属离子的稳定性相关，而不是其可还原性。
