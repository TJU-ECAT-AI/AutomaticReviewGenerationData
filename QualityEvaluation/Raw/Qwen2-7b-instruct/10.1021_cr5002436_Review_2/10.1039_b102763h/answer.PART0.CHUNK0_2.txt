The synthesis of ZrCePrO mixed oxides involves substituting cerium (Ce) with praseodymium (Pr) in the ceria lattice, creating solid solutions with a face-centered cubic structure. The Zr0.1Ce0.9O2 compound, prepared through the sol gel method, exhibits the highest oxygen storage capacity. The presence of oxygen vacancies, possibly due to Pr3z/Pr4z ions, contributes to enhanced oxygen storage capacities. The addition of praseodymium increases the oxygen storage capacity up to a certain concentration (x0.50), but beyond this, it negatively impacts the capacity. Praseodymium addition enhances the reducibility of cerium oxides when the solid solution is the only phase present.

合成ZrCePrO混合氧化物涉及在氧化铈晶格中用镨替换铈，形成面心立方结构的固溶体。通过溶胶凝胶法制备的Zr0.1Ce0.9O2化合物具有最高的氧存储容量。氧空位的存在，可能与Pr3z/Pr4z离子有关，对增强氧存储能力有贡献。镨的添加在一定浓度（x0.50）内提高了氧存储容量，但超过这个浓度则会负面影响其容量。镨的添加可以提高氧化铈的还原性，前提是只有单一相的固溶体存在。
