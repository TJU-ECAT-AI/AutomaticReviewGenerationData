The synthesis of ZrCePrO mixed oxides involves substituting cerium (Ce) with praseodymium (Pr) in the ceria lattice, creating solid solutions with a face-centered cubic structure. The Zr0.1Ce0.9O2 compound, prepared through the sol gel method, exhibits the highest oxygen storage capacity. The presence of oxygen vacancies, possibly due to Pr3z/Pr4z ions, contributes to enhanced oxygen storage capacities. The addition of praseodymium increases the oxygen storage capacity up to a certain concentration (x0.50), but beyond this, it negatively impacts the capacity. Praseodymium addition enhances the reducibility of cerium oxides when the solid solution is the only phase present.
