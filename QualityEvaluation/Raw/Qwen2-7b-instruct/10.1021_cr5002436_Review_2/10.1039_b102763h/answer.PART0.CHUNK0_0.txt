[1] "The evolution of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC/ mmol CO g−1) is presented in Fig. 6 as a function of the amount of praseodymium in the solids."
[2] "For both series, the introduction of praseodymium induces an increase of the OSC up to x0.50, whereas above x0.50 a decrease is observed."
[3] "The presence of zirconium leads to smaller size whereas the substitution of Ce by Pr is characterized only by minor effects."
[4] "The ratio of these two values may represent the number of oxygen layers involved in the redox process."
[5] "These results show clearly that praseodymium addition improves the cerium oxide reducibility as long as the solid solution is the sole phase."
[6] "Consequently, high OSCs appear to be the result of the presence of both cerium and praseodymium atoms."

1. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ZrCePrO mixed oxides changes with the amount of praseodymium. 
2. Up to a certain point, the addition of praseodymium enhances the OSC, but beyond that point, the OSC decreases.
3. The presence of zirconium leads to a smaller particle size compared to the substitution of cerium with praseodymium, which has minor effects.
4. The ratio between the calculated and experimental OSC values can indicate the number of oxygen layers involved in the redox process.
5. Praseodymium addition improves the reducibility of cerium oxide, provided the solid solution is the sole phase.
6. High OSCs are achieved through the presence of both cerium and praseodymium atoms in the mixed oxides.

1. ZrCePrO混合氧化物中镨的含量变化影响其氧存储容量（OSC）。
2. 在一定范围内，添加镨可以增强OSC，但超过这个范围，OSC会减少。
3. 存在锆时，颗粒尺寸较小；而铈被镨取代时，仅表现出轻微的影响。
4. 计算值与实验值的比例可能代表参与还原过程的氧层数量。
5. 镨的添加可以提高铈氧化物的可还原性，前提是单一相是固溶体。
6. 高OSC的实现依赖于混合氧化物中铈和镨原子的存在。
