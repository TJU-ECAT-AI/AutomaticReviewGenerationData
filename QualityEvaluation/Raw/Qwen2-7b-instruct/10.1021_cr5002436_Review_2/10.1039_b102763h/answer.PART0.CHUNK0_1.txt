<p>Ceria (CeO2) is a crucial component of modern automotive pollution control catalysts.1 This oxide is a promoter in the water-gas shift reaction and prevents the sintering of the noble metals used as active centers. More important is the ability of this oxide to store oxygen. This phenomenon is associated with a fast Ce4z/Ce3z redox process in the solid, also involving anionic vacancies.</p>
<p>In a previous work, we have evidenced that among the ZrCeO mixed oxides, the compound Zr0.1Ce0.9O2 prepared by the sol gel procedure displays the highest oxygen storage capacity.5,6</p>
<p>The presence of vacancies, associated with Pr3z/Pr4z ions, is thought to be responsible for these enhanced OSCs.</p>
<p>For both series, the introduction of praseodymium induces an increase of the OSC up to x0.50, whereas above x0.50 a decrease is observed.</p>
<p>The ratio of these two values may represent the number of oxygen layers involved in the redox process. In all cases, calculated values are lower than the experimental ones. This observation shows that 2 to 3 layers are involved in the redox process.</p>
<p>These results show clearly that praseodymium addition improves the cerium oxide reducibility as long as the solid solution is the sole phase.</p>
<p>Consequently, high OSCs appear to be the result of the presence of both cerium and praseodymium atoms. Thus, addition of praseodymium atoms into zirconia-ceria oxides appears to be very promising for the design of new automotive catalysts.</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include use in dehydrogenation processes. Research focus areas include understanding the structure of chromium oxides, optimizing active sites for better performance, selecting effective support materials to enhance stability and activity, identifying and incorporating promoters that improve catalytic properties, and elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms. The literature specifically highlights the importance of ceria (CeO2) as a crucial component in modern automotive pollution control catalysts, noting its role as a promoter in water-gas shift reactions and its ability to store oxygen through a fast redox process involving anionic vacancies. The study of mixed oxides, particularly those containing cerium and zirconium, reveals the impact of praseodymium (Pr) on enhancing oxygen storage capacity (OSC), suggesting that the combination of cerium (Ce) and praseodymium (Pr) atoms is crucial for achieving high OSCs in automotive catalysts. The literature also underscores the potential of praseodymium addition in improving the reducibility of ceria-based catalysts, emphasizing the promise of incorporating praseodymium into zirconia-ceria oxides for the development of advanced automotive catalysts.
