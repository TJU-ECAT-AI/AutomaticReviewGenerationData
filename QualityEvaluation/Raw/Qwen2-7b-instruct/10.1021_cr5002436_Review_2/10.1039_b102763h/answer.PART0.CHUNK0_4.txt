1. Ceria (CeO2) plays a crucial role in modern automotive pollution control catalysts, acting as a promoter in the water-gas shift reaction and preventing the sintering of noble metals used as active centers. Up to 50% of zirconium can be substituted for cerium within the ceria lattice to form solid solutions with face-centered cubic structures.

2. The study discusses the results based on differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement, and oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

3. The introduction of praseodymium in the mixed oxides leads to an increase in the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) up to a certain concentration of praseodymium (x=0.50). Beyond this concentration, the OSC starts to decrease.

4. The investigation reveals that approximately 2 to 3 layers participate in the redox process.

5. The addition of praseodymium enhances the reducibility of cerium oxide, provided that the solid solution is the primary phase. 

6. Excess praseodymium results in the formation of a second praseodymium oxide phase (Pr6O11) alongside a significant decrease in reducibility, which correlates with a substantial reduction in surface area.

1. 氧化铈（CeO2）在现代汽车尾气净化催化剂中扮演着关键角色，促进水煤气转换反应，并防止贵金属活性中心的聚集。可将高达50%的锆替换为铈，形成面心立方结构的固溶体。

2. 研究基于差热分析（DTA）、X射线衍射（XRD）、拉曼光谱、比表面面积（BET）测量和氧存储容量（OSC）数据讨论结果。

3. 在一定普赛迪氧化物浓度（x=0.50）下，引入普赛迪会增加氧存储容量（OSC），超过此浓度，OSC开始下降。

4. 调查发现大约2到3层参与还原过程。

5. 普赛迪的添加提高了铈氧化物的可还原性，前提是单一相是固溶体。

6. 过量的普赛迪导致第二相普赛迪氧化物（Pr6O11）形成，同时显著降低了可还原性，并伴随着表面面积的大幅减少。
