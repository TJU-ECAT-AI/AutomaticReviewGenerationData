[1] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pre-treatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."
[2] "When supported by alumina, chromium mainly occurs in its 3+ oxidation state on a reduced surface (3)."
[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57)."
[4] "Simultaneous data relating the initial activity, coke content, and some of the physicochemical properties of the catalyst indicated that the surfaces of all catalysts were modified to some extent by the successive reaction cycles."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key research focuses have centered on optimizing these aspects for enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the production of light olefins, which are crucial components in the manufacturing of reformulated gasoline and city diesel. Their ability to convert heavier hydrocarbons into lighter, more valuable products makes them indispensable in petrochemical industries.

3. Research has shown that the presence of chromium in various oxidation states on the surface of catalysts, depending on pretreatment, chromium content, and support type, plays a significant role in their catalytic activity. Specifically, chromium exists predominantly as a 3+ oxidation state on a reduced alumina surface.

4. The dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts containing 0.042.55 wt% chromium has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. This suggests that the initial activity of these catalysts is closely tied to the formation and stability of these specific chromium species.

5. The study also highlighted that the surfaces of the catalysts undergo modifications over successive reaction cycles, affecting the coke content and overall activity. This implies that the catalyst's performance evolves over time, necessitating a thorough understanding of these changes to optimize catalyst design and utilization.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的演变，主要通过对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解加深。关键的研究焦点集中在优化这些方面以提高脱氢效率和选择性。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的主要工业应用包括轻烯烃的生产，这是生产调和汽油和城市柴油的关键成分。它们能够将较重的碳氢化合物转化为更有价值的轻产品，在石油化工行业中不可或缺。

3. 研究表明，催化剂表面存在不同氧化状态（6+、5+、3+或2+）的铬，具体取决于预处理、铬含量和支撑材料的性质。特别地，铬主要存在于经还原的氧化铝表面上的3+氧化状态。

4. 含有0.042.55 wt%铬的铬氧化铝或铬氧化锆催化剂的脱氢活性被归因于配位不饱和Cr3+物种。这表明这些催化剂的初始活性紧密关联于这些特定铬物种的形成和稳定性。

5. 研究还指出，催化剂的表面在连续反应周期中会发生修改，影响焦炭含量和总体活性。这意味着催化剂的性能随时间变化，需要深入了解这些变化来优化催化剂设计和使用。
