[1] "Because of thermodynamic limitations, the dehydrogenation is carried out at elevated temperatures, and the catalyst is rapidly deactivated by coke deposition."
[2] "One approach to solving these problems is to run exothermic reactions between moderately short dehydrogenation periods (cyclic reactor operation)."
[3] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pre-treatment, Cr content, and nature of the support."
[4] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromium/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species."
[5] "The catalysts were processed in repeated cycles of oxidation, reduction, and dehydrogenation using n-butane, methane, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide as reducing agents."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These advancements have been crucial for their application in dehydrogenation processes, especially in the production of light olefins essential for reformulated gasoline and city diesel components. The catalysts' performance is influenced by factors such as the oxidation state of chromium, the nature of the support material, and the pre-treatment conditions.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts include dehydrogenation processes in the chemical industry, where they facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into lighter olefins. Research focus areas include optimizing the catalyst's structure to enhance its activity and stability, improving the dehydrogenation efficiency, and understanding the role of chromium oxidation states and the support materials in the catalytic activity.

3. In the context of structure, chromium oxide catalysts are characterized by chromium existing in various oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the preparation method, chromium content, and support type. Recent studies attribute the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species.

4. The catalysts undergo a series of processing steps including oxidation, reduction, and dehydrogenation using different reducing agents like n-butane, methane, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide. This cyclic operation helps in maintaining the catalyst's activity and preventing deactivation due to coke deposition.
