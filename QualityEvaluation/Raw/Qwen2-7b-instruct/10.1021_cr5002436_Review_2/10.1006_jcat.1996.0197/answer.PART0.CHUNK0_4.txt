[1] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pre-treatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."
[2] "When supported by alumina, chromium mainly occurs in its 3+ oxidation state on a reduced surface (3)."
[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.04-2.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (5-7)."
[4] "Following the reaction for several hours, while determining the product distribution with a gas chromatograph, they suggested that the main differences occurred during the first 10 min on stream."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins, which are essential in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. Research has concentrated on identifying the precise oxidation states of chromium on the surface, recognizing that under certain conditions, it primarily exists in the +3 oxidation state on a reduced surface when supported by alumina. The dehydrogenation activity of these catalysts has been linked to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. Studies have also explored the influence of various reducing agents on the initial activity and the role of these agents in modifying the catalyst surfaces over time.

1. 自1933年发现以来，氧化铬催化剂经历了显著的发展，研究集中在理解其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。由于它们能够将较重的烃类转化为较轻的烯烃，这些催化剂在生产用于调和汽油和城市柴油的成分方面至关重要。研究重点放在确定表面铬的确切氧化状态上，发现当铬以氧化铝为支持物时，它主要存在于还原表面上的+3氧化态。这些催化剂的脱氢活性被归因于配位不饱和Cr3+物种。还研究了不同还原剂对初始活性的影响以及这些剂在催化剂表面随时间变化的作用。
