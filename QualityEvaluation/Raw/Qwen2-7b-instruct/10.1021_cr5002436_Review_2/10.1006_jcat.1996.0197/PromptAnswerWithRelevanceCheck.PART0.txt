Answer: Chromium oxide-based catalysts, initially discovered in 1933, have evolved significantly over the years due to advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts play crucial roles in various industries, notably in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel through dehydrogenation processes. However, the thermodynamic limitations necessitate high temperatures, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke deposition. Research on these catalysts has shown that chromium exists in different oxidation states on the surface, with alumina-supported catalysts primarily featuring chromium in its 3+ state upon reduction. Recent studies attribute the dehydrogenation activity of such catalysts to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. Moreover, the interplay between initial activity, coke content, and physicochemical properties of the catalysts reveals that the surfaces undergo modifications during successive reaction cycles, highlighting the dynamic nature of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1. 自1933年以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的演变，得益于对其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制的深入理解。这些催化剂在生产调和汽油和城市柴油等组件方面发挥了关键作用，主要通过脱氢化过程使用铬氧化物催化剂实现。
然而，由于热力学限制，脱氢化过程需要在较高温度下进行，导致催化剂迅速因焦炭沉积而失效。对这类催化剂的研究表明，铬可能存在于表面的不同氧化态（6+、5+、3+或2+），这取决于预处理、铬含量以及支持材料的性质。研究表明，在氧化铝支撑下，铬主要以还原表面的3+状态存在。最近的研究将此类催化剂的脱氢化活性归因于配合不饱和的Cr3+物种。此外，初始活性、焦炭含量以及催化剂的一些物理化学性质之间的关联显示，催化剂表面在连续反应周期中会经历一定程度的改性，突显了这些催化剂在脱氢化过程中的动态特性。
