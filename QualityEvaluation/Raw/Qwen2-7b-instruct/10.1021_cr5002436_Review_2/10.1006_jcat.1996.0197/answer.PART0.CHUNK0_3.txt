[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel."
[2] "One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."
[3] "Because of thermodynamic limitations, the dehydrogenation is carried out at elevated temperatures, and the catalyst is rapidly deactivated by coke deposition (1)."
[4] "The combination of the high endothermicity of dehydrogenation and the deactivation of the catalyst represents a particularly difficult challenge for process and catalyst designers."
[5] "Prereduction of the catalyst can also be included in the operation, since high-valence chromium, inactive in dehydrogenation (2), is produced during the regeneration."
[6] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57)."
[7] "Simultaneous data relating the initial activity, coke content, and some of the physicochemical properties of the catalyst indicated that the surfaces of all catalysts were modified to some extent by the successive reaction cycles."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They are now crucial in producing components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel through dehydrogenation processes. These processes often occur at high temperatures due to thermodynamic limitations, which leads to rapid catalyst deactivation through coke deposition. Prereduction of the catalyst is a strategy employed to regenerate high-valence chromium, which becomes inactive in dehydrogenation but is produced during the process. Recent studies suggest that the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts is attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. The surfaces of the catalysts are modified during successive reaction cycles, affecting their physicochemical properties and activity.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。它们现在在通过脱氢反应生产重整汽油和城市柴油的成分中至关重要。由于热力学限制，这些过程通常在高温下进行，这导致催化剂因焦炭沉积而迅速失效。通过预还原催化剂是一种策略，用于再生高价铬，该铬在脱氢过程中变得不活跃，但在过程中产生。最近的研究表明，铬氧化铝或铬氧化锆催化剂的脱氢活性归因于配位不饱和Cr3+物种。催化剂的表面在连续的反应循环中被修改，影响其物理化学性质和活性。
