<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7].</p>
<p>As demand for propylene and the price difference between propane and propylene are rising [8], it is expected that more propylene would be produced this way.</p>
<p>The solgel assisted preparation of continuous silica gel in the presence of dissolved Cr(NO3)3 leads to a hard high surface area (710 m2/g) microporous xerogel.</p>
<p>Formation of the gel in the pore structure of mesoporous Pore-Expanded MCM-41 (PE-MCM-41) and macroporous commercial CabOSil silica results in retention of the mesoporous structure in the case of PE-MCM-41, and the formation of a powder with a broad pore size distribution in the case of CabOSil silica.</p>
<p>Comparison of the catalytic activities in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane revealed a linear correlation of the initial conversion with the surface area for all three samples.</p>
<p>Preparation of chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes includes impregnation, coprecipitation, and atomic layer epitaxy. Solgel preparation affords high surface area silica, alumina, and other oxides.</p>
<p>Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17].</p>
<p>In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to a new class of materials - mesoporous molecular sieves. Apart from having very high surface areas, they possess narrow pore size distributions and ordered pore structure [18].</p>
<p>The pore size of these materials can be controlled within a broad range by using strategies including post-synthesis hydrothermal treatment of uncalcined mesoporous silica in the presence of pore expanding agents as was discovered by Sayari and co-workers [1921].</p>
<p>The use of mesoporous molecular sieves combined with the formation of chromia-doped gel inside their pores may give rise to catalysts with unusual properties as the porous structure can be independently manipulated, whereas the solgel step would favor high chromia dispersion.</p>
<p>The prepared catalysts were tested in the reaction of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 was prepared as follows. First a solution of the required amount of Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O in TEOS/H2O/iPrOH = 40/28/135 mL/mL/mL was prepared. About 15 mL of this solution was gradually added while mixing with a spatula to 2.7 g of pre-calcined PE-MCM-41.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil was prepared through addition of 20 mL of the solution of chromium nitrate in TEOS/H2O/iPrOH = 40/28/135 by volume to 3.48 g of SiO2 CabOSil M-5.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr, CrOx/PE-MCM-41, CrOx/CabOSil catalysts demonstrated much lower activities in comparison with the two most active samples.</p>
<p>The deactivation of catalysts occurred in all cases. The deactivation of CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41, however, slowed down upon reaction progress, whereas the deactivation of CrOx/SiO2xr was fairly slow right from the reaction start.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 with key industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for producing propylene from propane. Their significance lies in their ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene, driven by factors such as demand growth and price disparities.

2. Research focuses on understanding catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The solgel-assisted preparation technique enables the formation of catalysts with desired pore structures and dispersed chromium oxide species, enhancing catalytic performance.

3. Industrial applications include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds, large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene, chlorinated carbon removal processes, and non-oxidative dehydrogenation for propylene production.

4. Active sites and mechanisms of catalytic reactions involve complex interactions between chromium compounds and support materials. Recent studies emphasize the role of chromium species' oxidation states, particularly Cr3+, in determining catalytic efficiency.

5. Mesoporous molecular sieves offer high surface areas, narrow pore size distributions, and ordered pore structures, enabling independent manipulation of pore characteristics and high dispersion of chromium species.

6. Dehydrogenation processes are susceptible to deactivation, particularly through coke formation. Catalyst stability is influenced by surface area, pore structure, and reaction kinetics.
