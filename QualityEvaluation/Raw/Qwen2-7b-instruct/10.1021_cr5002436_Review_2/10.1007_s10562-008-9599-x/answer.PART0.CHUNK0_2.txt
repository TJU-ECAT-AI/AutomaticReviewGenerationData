[1] "Preparation of continuous silica gel in the presence of dissolved Cr(NO3)3 leads to a hard high surface area (710 m2/g) microporous xerogel."
[2] "Comparison of the catalytic activities in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane revealed a linear correlation of the initial conversion with the surface area for all three samples."
[3] "The sample prepared from PE-MCM-41 through a solgel assisted procedure was the most active, particularly with respect to the catalysts prepared by simple wet impregnation with chromium nitrate."
[4] "There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy."
[5] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites or both."
[6] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane."
[7] "The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support."
[8] "Solgel preparation affords high surface area silica, alumina and other oxides."
[9] "Apart from having very high surface areas, they possess narrow pore size distributions and ordered pore structure."
[10] "As the relative amounts of TEOS, water and isopropanol in the preparation of CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 were held the same as for chromium-doped xerogel, CrOx/SiO2xr, to ensure gelation, the concentration of chromium was adjusted to produce the same Cr/Si = 0.45 mol% final ratio as for CrOx/SiO2xr."
[11] "The molar ratios of Cr/Si/Si in CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 and in CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil samples as derived from the preparation recipe were approximately 2/100/340 and 1.9/100/330 mol% respectively."
[12] "The pore size distribution of CrOx/SiO2xr sample is mostly microporous with pores less than 4 nm."
[13] "Though, as shown below, the reduction in the surface area of some samples cannot be ignored, the reaction has little effect on pore size distributions."
[14] "As the relative amounts of TEOS, water and isopropanol in the preparation of CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 were held the same as for chromium-doped xerogel, CrOx/SiO2xr, to ensure gelation, the concentration of chromium was adjusted to produce the same Cr/Si = 0.45 mol% final ratio as for CrOx/SiO2xr."
[15] "For samples whose preparation involved a solgel step, the catalytic activity was found to be proportional to the catalyst surface area, whereas among all the samples tested, an increase in the surface generally entailed higher catalyst stability."
