<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane.</p>
<p>Despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17].</p>
<p>The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support. In the most thoroughly studied method, i.e., incipient wetness impregnation with aqueous solution of chromium(VI) oxide, the anchoring occurs upon heating through esterification-like reaction of chromates with surface hydroxyl groups [9].</p>
<p>There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy.</p>
<p>As demand for propylene and the price difference between propane and propylene are rising [8], it is expected that more propylene would be produced this way.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 was prepared as follows. First a solution of the required amount of Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O in TEOS/H2O/iPrOH = 40/28/135 mL/mL/mL was prepared. About 15 mL of this solution was gradually added while mixing with a spatula to 2.7 g of pre-calcined PE-MCM-41.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil was prepared through addition of 20 mL of Cr(NO3)3 · H2O in H2O/iPrOH = 28/175 mL/mL to 3.48 g of CabOSil M-5.</p>
<p>In the preparation of CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 and CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil samples, TEOS was substituted by a similar volume of isopropanol with amounts of chromium salt adjusted to yield Cr/Si = 0.45 mol% ratios.</p>
<p>Raman spectra of calcined catalysts before their use in the catalytic reaction are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>UVVis spectroscopy provided valuable additional information in regard to the degree of dispersion of supported chromia species.</p>
<p>The degree of catalyst hydration is among the main parameters that govern the nature of supported chromia species.</p>
<p>Based on the results Cavani et al. [15], Liu et al. [34] alternatively suggested that the variation in the position of TPR peak might originate from chromia species with different chromiasupport interactions.</p>
<p>The H/Cr ratios observed for the current catalysts are summarized in Table 1.</p>
<p>Comparison of pore size distributions for CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 and CrOx/PE-MCM-41 shown in Fig. 3 reveals their close similarity.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromiasilica catalysts was studied in considerable detail earlier [3, 11, 12].</p>
<p>The UVVis spectrum of the spent CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 catalyst recorded under ambient conditions is in line with the literature data as conversion of Cr6+ into Cr3+ species is obvious due to the appearance of a broad band at ca. 600 nm.</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have gained significance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of propylene from propane, driven by the growing demand for propylene and the economic advantage of producing it through this method. Research has focused on improving dispersion of chromia species, which is crucial for enhancing catalyst performance. Various preparation methods, such as impregnation, coprecipitation, and atomic layer epitaxy, have been explored to optimize the catalysts' properties. The oxidation state of active chromium species in these catalysts remains a subject of debate, with studies suggesting roles for Cr2+, Cr3+, or both. The structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites, and the mechanisms of catalytic reactions continue to be areas of active investigation. The solgel-assisted preparation of chromia/silica catalysts has emerged as a versatile synthetic route, allowing for the formation of catalysts with desired pore structures and highly dispersed chromia species. The activity of these catalysts is found to be surface area-dependent, and for the best samples, it significantly surpasses that of catalysts prepared through impregnation. The catalytic activity is proportional to the catalyst surface area, and among all tested samples, an increase in surface generally entails higher catalyst stability.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制等多方面的进步。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中变得重要，特别是从丙烷生产丙烯，这是由对丙烯不断增长的需求和丙烷与丙烯价格差异推动的。研究集中在提高铬氧化物种分散性的方法上，这对于增强催化剂性能至关重要。探索了多种制备方法，如浸渍、共沉淀和原子层外延，以优化催化剂的性质。支持铬氧化物的结构、活性位点以及催化反应机制继续是研究的重点领域。支持铬氧化物中活性铬物种的氧化状态仍存在争议，研究表明可能涉及Cr2+、Cr3+或两者。支持铬氧化物的结构、活性位点以及催化反应机制继续是研究的重点领域。溶胶-凝胶辅助制备的铬/硅酸盐催化剂已成为一种灵活的合成途径，允许形成具有所需孔结构和高度分散铬氧化物的催化剂。这些催化剂的活性与其表面积成正比，最好的样品显著超过通过浸渍制备的催化剂。催化剂活性与催化剂表面积成正比，在所有测试样品中，表面的增加通常意味着更高的催化剂稳定性。
