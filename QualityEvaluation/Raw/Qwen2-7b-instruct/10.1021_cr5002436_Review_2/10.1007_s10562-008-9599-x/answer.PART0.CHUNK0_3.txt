The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in industrial applications and research focus areas. These advancements encompass a variety of aspects including catalyst structure, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications have included catalytic oxidation of organic compounds, large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene, processes for chlorinated carbon removal, and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. Research has increasingly concentrated on understanding the structure of supported chromium oxides, nature of active sites, and mechanisms underlying catalytic reactions. 

Since the initial discovery, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been optimized for various applications, with notable developments in the preparation methods. For instance, solgel-assisted deposition of chromium species on preformed silica supports offers versatility in creating catalysts with tailored pore structures and highly dispersed chromium species. This approach has proven advantageous in enhancing catalyst activity, particularly in dehydrogenation processes, by showing a direct correlation between surface area and catalytic efficiency. Studies have highlighted the importance of pore structure and the role of different support materials, like MCM-41 and CabOSil, in influencing catalytic performance. The activity of these catalysts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been found to correlate with the surface area, indicating the critical role of surface area in catalytic activity. Furthermore, research has also delved into understanding the nature of active sites, with discussions around the role of chromium species in different oxidation states (Cr3+ and Cr6+) and the impact of these species on catalytic performance.

In terms of dehydrogenation processes, the evolving landscape has seen a growing interest in the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites, and the mechanisms of catalytic reactions. The field has also witnessed advancements in the synthesis of catalysts with specific pore structures and the optimization of chromium dispersion on support materials. These developments have been driven by the need to enhance catalyst performance and efficiency in various chemical processes, including the production of olefins via non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes. The research focus continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to understand the intricate relationship between catalyst structure, activity, and stability, aiming to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of these catalytic processes.

自1933年发现以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂经历了显著的发展，这在工业应用和研究重点领域中表现得尤为突出。这些发展涵盖了催化剂结构、活性位点识别、支撑材料选择、促动剂融入以及反应机制阐明等多个方面。关键的工业应用包括有机化合物的催化氧化、乙烯大规模聚合为聚乙烯、氯化碳去除过程以及丙烷非氧化脱氢生成丙烯等。研究的重点已经转向理解支持铬氧化物的结构、活性位点的性质以及催化反应的机制。

自从最初的发现以来，基于铬氧化物的催化剂通过各种应用得到了优化，其中值得注意的是合成方法的发展。例如，通过溶胶-凝胶辅助在预成型硅酸盐支持物上沉积铬物种可以提供创造具有特定孔结构和高度分散铬物种的催化剂的灵活性。这种方法已被证明对于提高脱氢过程中的催化剂活性特别有利，特别是通过显示表面面积与催化效率之间的直接相关性。研究表明，在非氧化脱氢丙烷产生丙烯的过程中，活性与表面面积成正比，这表明表面面积对催化活性至关重要。

此外，研究还探讨了不同氧化状态（Cr3+和Cr6+）的铬物种的作用及其对催化性能的影响，并深入分析了活性位点的性质。这些发展反映了对催化剂结构、活性和稳定性的复杂关系的理解不断深化，旨在提高这些催化过程的整体效率和可持续性。

当前的研究重点继续发展，持续努力理解催化剂结构、活性和稳定性之间的内在联系，以改进这些催化过程的整体效率和可持续性。
