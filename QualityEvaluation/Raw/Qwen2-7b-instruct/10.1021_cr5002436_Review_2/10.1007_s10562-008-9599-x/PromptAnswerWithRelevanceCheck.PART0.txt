The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in industrial applications and research focus areas. These advancements encompass a variety of aspects including catalyst structure, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications have included catalytic oxidation of organic compounds, large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene, processes for chlorinated carbon removal, and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. Research has increasingly concentrated on understanding the structure of supported chromium oxides, nature of active sites, and mechanisms underlying catalytic reactions. 

Since the initial discovery, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been optimized for various applications, with notable developments in the preparation methods. For instance, solgel-assisted deposition of chromium species on preformed silica supports offers versatility in creating catalysts with tailored pore structures and highly dispersed chromium species. This approach has proven advantageous in enhancing catalyst activity, particularly in dehydrogenation processes, by showing a direct correlation between surface area and catalytic efficiency. Studies have highlighted the importance of pore structure and the role of different support materials, like MCM-41 and CabOSil, in influencing catalytic performance. The activity of these catalysts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been found to correlate with the surface area, indicating the critical role of surface area in catalytic activity. Furthermore, research has also delved into understanding the nature of active sites, with discussions around the role of chromium species in different oxidation states (Cr3+ and Cr6+) and the impact of these species on catalytic performance.

In terms of dehydrogenation processes, the evolving landscape has seen a growing interest in the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites, and the mechanisms of catalytic reactions. The field has also witnessed advancements in the synthesis of catalysts with specific pore structures and the optimization of chromium dispersion on support materials. These developments have been driven by the need to enhance catalyst performance and efficiency in various chemical processes, including the production of olefins via non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes. The research focus continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to understand the intricate relationship between catalyst structure, activity, and stability, aiming to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of these catalytic processes.

<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane.</p>
<p>Despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17].</p>
<p>The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support. In the most thoroughly studied method, i.e., incipient wetness impregnation with aqueous solution of chromium(VI) oxide, the anchoring occurs upon heating through esterification-like reaction of chromates with surface hydroxyl groups [9].</p>
<p>There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy.</p>
<p>As demand for propylene and the price difference between propane and propylene are rising [8], it is expected that more propylene would be produced this way.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 was prepared as follows. First a solution of the required amount of Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O in TEOS/H2O/iPrOH = 40/28/135 mL/mL/mL was prepared. About 15 mL of this solution was gradually added while mixing with a spatula to 2.7 g of pre-calcined PE-MCM-41.</p>
<p>CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil was prepared through addition of 20 mL of Cr(NO3)3 · H2O in H2O/iPrOH = 28/175 mL/mL to 3.48 g of CabOSil M-5.</p>
<p>In the preparation of CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 and CrOx/SiO2xr/CabOSil samples, TEOS was substituted by a similar volume of isopropanol with amounts of chromium salt adjusted to yield Cr/Si = 0.45 mol% ratios.</p>
<p>Raman spectra of calcined catalysts before their use in the catalytic reaction are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>UVVis spectroscopy provided valuable additional information in regard to the degree of dispersion of supported chromia species.</p>
<p>The degree of catalyst hydration is among the main parameters that govern the nature of supported chromia species.</p>
<p>Based on the results Cavani et al. [15], Liu et al. [34] alternatively suggested that the variation in the position of TPR peak might originate from chromia species with different chromiasupport interactions.</p>
<p>The H/Cr ratios observed for the current catalysts are summarized in Table 1.</p>
<p>Comparison of pore size distributions for CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 and CrOx/PE-MCM-41 shown in Fig. 3 reveals their close similarity.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromiasilica catalysts was studied in considerable detail earlier [3, 11, 12].</p>
<p>The UVVis spectrum of the spent CrOx/SiO2xr/PE-MCM-41 catalyst recorded under ambient conditions is in line with the literature data as conversion of Cr6+ into Cr3+ species is obvious due to the appearance of a broad band at ca. 600 nm.</p>
