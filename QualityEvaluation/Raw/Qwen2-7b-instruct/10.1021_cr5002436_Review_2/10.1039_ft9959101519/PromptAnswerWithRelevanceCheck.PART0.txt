[1] "The transition from y- to a-Al,O, dramatically reduces the surface area and, accordingly, the catalytic potency."
[2] "Iron accelerates the transition from y- to a-Al,O,, whereas chromium hampered not only this transition, but also the formation of y-Al,O, ."
[3] "Furthermore, Fe3 + ions were mainly situated within the alumina granules whilst Cr3+ ions were prefer- entially located on the surface of the granules."

The document discusses how the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been significant in dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include refining, petrochemical processing, and environmental technologies. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst performance, improving selectivity, and enhancing stability under various operating conditions. The document highlights that chromium affects the transition from the monoclinic (y-) to cubic (a-) phase of aluminum oxide, impacting catalytic potency. Iron, on the contrary, accelerates this transition, while chromium hinders it, suggesting different roles in catalyst activity based on location within the alumina granules.

The literature discusses how the properties of porous alumina doped with iron and chromium have been investigated through combined magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies. It was found that iron ions facilitate the transformation from the monoclinic (y-) to the cubic (a-) phase of aluminum oxide, while chromium ions inhibit this transition and also hinder the formation of the monoclinic phase. Iron ions are predominantly located within the alumina granules, whereas chromium ions tend to be situated on the surfaces of the granules.

Porous amorphous alumina with a high fraction of penta-coordinated aluminum can be prepared through the decomposition of aluminum nitrate solutions in association with glycerol oxidation. In alumina samples doped with iron (Fe3+) or chromium (Cr3+), low-coordinated aluminum species were also formed. Iron accelerates the transition from the γ-form (γ-Al2O3) to the α-form (α-Al2O3) of alumina, whereas chromium not only impedes this transition but also hinders the formation of the γ-form. Moreover, iron ions are predominantly situated within the alumina granules, while chromium ions are preferentially located on the surface of the granules.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen significant advancements in their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the processing of hydrocarbons in petrochemical industries, particularly in dehydrogenation processes, which convert lighter hydrocarbons into heavier ones, often for the production of aromatics. Research focuses on optimizing the structure of these catalysts to enhance their efficiency, stability, and selectivity. Active sites play a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance, and studies aim to understand how these sites are created and maintained under reaction conditions. Support materials are chosen for their ability to stabilize the catalyst, improve thermal and mechanical properties, and facilitate mass transfer. Promoters are introduced to modify the catalyst's properties, such as enhancing activity or stability. Reaction mechanisms are also a critical area of focus, aiming to understand the pathways of reactions to optimize conditions and improve yield and selectivity. Chromium oxide catalysts, in particular, have been studied for their ability to inhibit unwanted side reactions while promoting desired conversions, making them valuable tools in refining processes.
