The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen significant advancements in their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the processing of hydrocarbons in petrochemical industries, particularly in dehydrogenation processes, which convert lighter hydrocarbons into heavier ones, often for the production of aromatics. Research focuses on optimizing the structure of these catalysts to enhance their efficiency, stability, and selectivity. Active sites play a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance, and studies aim to understand how these sites are created and maintained under reaction conditions. Support materials are chosen for their ability to stabilize the catalyst, improve thermal and mechanical properties, and facilitate mass transfer. Promoters are introduced to modify the catalyst's properties, such as enhancing activity or stability. Reaction mechanisms are also a critical area of focus, aiming to understand the pathways of reactions to optimize conditions and improve yield and selectivity. Chromium oxide catalysts, in particular, have been studied for their ability to inhibit unwanted side reactions while promoting desired conversions, making them valuable tools in refining processes.
