[1] "A fraction of the low-coordinated A1 species were found on the surfaces of the xerogels."
[2] "Iron accelerated the transition from y- to a-Al,O,, whereas chromium hampered not only this transition, but also the formation of y-Al,O, ."
[3] "Furthermore, Fe3 + ions were mainly situated within the alumina granules whilst Cr3+ ions were prefer- entially located on the surface of the granules."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have undergone significant evolution in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry. Research focuses on optimizing the structure of the catalysts to enhance their efficiency, identifying the precise location of active sites, selecting suitable support materials that improve stability and activity, and developing effective promoters to enhance the catalyst's performance. Additionally, understanding the reaction mechanisms in detail helps in tailoring the catalyst design for better selectivity and product yield.
