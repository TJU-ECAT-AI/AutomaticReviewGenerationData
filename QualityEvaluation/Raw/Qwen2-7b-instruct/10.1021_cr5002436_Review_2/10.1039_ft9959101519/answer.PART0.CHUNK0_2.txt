[1] "A fraction of the low-coordinated A1 species were found on the surfaces of the xerogels."
[2] "Iron accelerated the transition from y- to a-Al,O,, whereas chromium hampered not only this transition, but also the formation of y-Al,O, ."
[3] "Furthermore, Fe3 + ions were mainly situated within the alumina granules whilst Cr3+ ions were prefer- entially located on the surface of the granules."

Porous amorphous alumina with a high fraction of penta-coordinated aluminum can be prepared through the decomposition of aluminum nitrate solutions in association with glycerol oxidation. In alumina samples doped with iron (Fe3+) or chromium (Cr3+), low-coordinated aluminum species were also formed. Iron accelerates the transition from the γ-form (γ-Al2O3) to the α-form (α-Al2O3) of alumina, whereas chromium not only impedes this transition but also hinders the formation of the γ-form. Moreover, iron ions are predominantly situated within the alumina granules, while chromium ions are preferentially located on the surface of the granules.

通过甘油氧化分解铝硝酸盐溶液，可以制备具有高五配位铝比例的多孔非晶氧化铝。在掺杂有铁（Fe3+）或铬（Cr3+）的氧化铝样品中，也形成了低配位的铝物种。铁加速了γ-Al2O3到α-Al2O3的转变，而铬不仅阻碍了这一转变，还抑制了γ-Al2O3的形成。此外，铁离子主要位于铝粒内部，而铬离子则优先位于颗粒表面。
