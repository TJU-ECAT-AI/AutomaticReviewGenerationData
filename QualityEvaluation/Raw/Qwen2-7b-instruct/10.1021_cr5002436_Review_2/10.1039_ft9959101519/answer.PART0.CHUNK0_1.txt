[1] "A fraction of the low-coordinated A1 species were found on the surfaces of the xerogels."
[2] "Iron accelerated the transition from y- to a-Al,O,, whereas chromium hampered not only this transition, but also the formation of y-Al,O, ."
[3] "Furthermore, Fe3 + ions were mainly situated within the alumina granules whilst Cr3+ ions were prefer- entially located on the surface of the granules."

The literature discusses how the properties of porous alumina doped with iron and chromium have been investigated through combined magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies. It was found that iron ions facilitate the transformation from the monoclinic (y-) to the cubic (a-) phase of aluminum oxide, while chromium ions inhibit this transition and also hinder the formation of the monoclinic phase. Iron ions are predominantly located within the alumina granules, whereas chromium ions tend to be situated on the surfaces of the granules.

文献讨论了对含铁和铬掺杂的多孔铝氧 化物进行了结合魔角自旋（MAS）核磁共振（NMR）和电子自旋共振（EPR）的研究。研究发现，铁离子促进了从单斜相（y-）到立方相（a-）的氧化铝的转变，而铬离子则阻碍了这一转变以及y-相的形成。铁离子主要位于铝氧 化物颗粒内部，而铬离子倾向于位于颗粒表面。
