[1] "The transition from y- to a-Al,O, dramatically reduces the surface area and, accordingly, the catalytic potency."
[2] "Iron accelerates the transition from y- to a-Al,O,, whereas chromium hampered not only this transition, but also the formation of y-Al,O, ."
[3] "Furthermore, Fe3 + ions were mainly situated within the alumina granules whilst Cr3+ ions were prefer- entially located on the surface of the granules."

The document discusses how the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been significant in dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include refining, petrochemical processing, and environmental technologies. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst performance, improving selectivity, and enhancing stability under various operating conditions. The document highlights that chromium affects the transition from the monoclinic (y-) to cubic (a-) phase of aluminum oxide, impacting catalytic potency. Iron, on the contrary, accelerates this transition, while chromium hinders it, suggesting different roles in catalyst activity based on location within the alumina granules.

该文献讨论了自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的演变。铬氧化物催化剂的发展主要通过对其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解而实现。关键的工业应用包括精炼、石油化工处理和环境技术。研究重点在于优化催化剂性能、提高选择性以及在各种操作条件下增强稳定性。文献指出，铬影响铝氧化物从单斜（y-）到立方（a-）相的过渡，从而影响催化效率。相比之下，铁加速了这一过渡，而铬则阻碍了它，表明根据颗粒内的位置，铬在催化剂活性方面具有不同的作用。
