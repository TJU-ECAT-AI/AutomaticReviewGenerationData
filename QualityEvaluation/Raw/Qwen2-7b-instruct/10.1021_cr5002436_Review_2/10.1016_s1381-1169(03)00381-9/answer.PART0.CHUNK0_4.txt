1. Chromium catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with applications expanding from ethylene polymerization to dehydrogenation processes. They are now widely used in industrial applications involving ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane dehydrogenation to produce olefins, with high selectivity for alkenes.

2. In ethylene polymerization, the active sites are Cr2+ species, while for dehydrogenation reactions, the active sites are Cr3+ species. The preparation of catalysts for ethylene polymerization involves impregnation of an inorganic precursor on silica with high surface area and pore volume, typically resulting in a chromium content of 1 wt.% or less.

3. Research focuses on understanding the structure of chromium catalysts, identifying the active sites (Cr2+ and Cr3+) involved in dehydrogenation and polymerization, and characterizing the properties of different support materials and chromium precursors. Promoters, such as potassium, are sometimes added to reduce cracking reactions in dehydrogenation processes.

4. Chromium catalysts are effective in ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane dehydrogenation to produce olefins, operating within a temperature range of 623-773 K and atmospheric pressure. They exhibit high selectivity towards alkenes.

5. In dehydrogenation reactions, the active sites are Cr3+ species that coordinate with hydroxyls on the surface, exhibiting unsaturation. For ethylene polymerization, the active sites are identified as Cr2+ species, which can be further divided into Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B, and Cr2+ C species.

6. Spectroscopic techniques such as XPS, DRS, and FT-IR are employed to characterize the chromium sites in the calcined and reduced states. The chemisorption of O2 at low temperatures is used to quantify Cr3+ sites, while CO chemisorption is utilized to identify Cr2+ sites.

7. The selectivity of chemisorption of O2 to amorphous Cr3+ sites requires further investigation, indicating the complexity in identifying and quantifying active sites. The Cr2+ species can be further classified into Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B, and Cr2+ C, with Cr2+ C species not adsorbing CO.

8. The main challenge in identifying Cr2+ sites lies in their oxidation under low concentrations of oxygen and water. However, both Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B sites have been shown to have activity in ethylene polymerization.

9. The objective of this study was to investigate the chemisorption of O2 and CO to quantify the active sites of chromium catalysts, evaluating their activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation and ethylene polymerization based on chromium species characterization.

10. The study involved preparing catalysts on silica and alumina with varying chromium content for dehydrogenation reactions. For ethylene polymerization, catalysts with 1 wt.% Cr were prepared on silica using different chromium precursors.

11. The catalysts were characterized using various analytical techniques including XRD, FT-IR, DRIFTS, TPR, and DRS. Active sites for dehydrogenation and polymerization were quantified through O2 and CO chemisorption, respectively, after reduction with H2 or CO.
