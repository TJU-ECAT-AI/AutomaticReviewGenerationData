<p>The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of aqueous solutions (15 ml/g support) with different chromium contents and precursors added to the -Al2O3 (Engelhard HARSHAW AL3916P, surface area = 191 m2/g and pore volume = 0.46 cm3/g) and SiO2 supports (Davison GRACE 955, surface area = 299 m2/g and pore volume = 1.6 cm3/g).</p>
<p>In the preparation of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts, chromium acetate(II), chromium chloride(II), chromium oxide(VI), all obtained from Aldrich (99.9% purity),and bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate, prepared according to Baker and Carrick [37], were used, resulting samples with 1 wt.% Cr.</p>
<p>The objective of this work was to study the chemisorption of O2 and CO to quantify the active sites of chromium catalysts and to evaluate the cat- alytic activity in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation and in the ethylene polymerization in the light of the chromium species characterization.</p>
<p>The selectivity of the O2 and CO chemisorption to characterize the Cr2+ and amorphous Cr3+ sites, re- spectively, was verified. It was observed correlation between the O2 and CO chemisorptions and the activ- ities for the dehydrogenation and polymerization re- actions, respectively.</p>
<p>Alumina disperses chromium particles in its sur- face better than silica. This phenomena is driven by the surface hydroxyls distribution and, probably, by the affinity between the crystallographic orientation of -Cr2O3 and of the support. Physical mixtures of CrO3 with alumina present activity in the dehydro- genation in the same extent to the obtained with the catalysts, ascribed to a spontaneous spreading process of the chromium oxide(VI).</p>
<p>The cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction showed to be structure-sensitive for chromium catalysts. The activity was favored by the chromium particles ag- glomeration. The activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts to the ethylene polymerization is associated to the amount of Cr2+A + Cr2+B species. These chromium species present similar activities in the polymeri- zation.</p>

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of chromium catalysts used for dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions. The catalysts were prepared using various chromium precursors and supports, including aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2). Different chromium contents were used to study their effects on the catalysts' properties and activities. The catalysts were characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The active sites for dehydrogenation and polymerization were quantified by chemisorption of oxygen and carbon monoxide, respectively. The results indicate that alumina disperses chromium particles better than silica, and that the activity of the catalysts is influenced by the aggregation of chromium particles. The polymerization activity is associated with the amount of chromium species Cr2+A and Cr2+B, which exhibit similar activities in the polymerization process. The study verifies the selectivity of chemisorption techniques for identifying active sites in chromium catalysts and demonstrates correlations between the chemisorption data and catalytic activities for both dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions.

文档讨论了用于脱氢和聚合反应的铬催化剂的制备与表征。催化剂使用了各种铬前体和支持物，包括氧化铝（Al2O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）。使用不同铬含量来研究催化剂性质和活性的影响。催化剂通过X射线衍射（XRD）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）、散射傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFTS）、温度程序化还原（TPR）和散射反射光谱（DRS）进行了表征。脱氢和聚合反应的活性位点通过氧气和一氧化碳的化学吸附进行量化。结果表明，氧化铝比二氧化硅更好地分散铬颗粒，并且催化剂的活性受铬颗粒聚集的影响。聚合活性与铬物种Cr2+A和Cr2+B的数量相关联，这些物种在聚合过程中的活性相似。研究验证了化学吸附技术识别催化剂中活性位点的选择性，并显示了脱氢和聚合反应中化学吸附数据与催化活性之间的相关性。
