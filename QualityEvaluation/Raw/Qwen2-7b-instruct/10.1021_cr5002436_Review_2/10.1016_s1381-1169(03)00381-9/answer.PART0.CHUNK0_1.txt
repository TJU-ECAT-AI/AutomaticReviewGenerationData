[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."
[2] "The literature reports that the active site in the dehydrogenation is the Cr3+ species coordinated to the hydroxyls, coordinativelly un- saturated [1012]."
[3] "The active site of chromium for ethylene polymerization was reported to be the Cr2+ [2,69,27]."
[4] "The selectivity of the O2 and CO chemisorption to characterize the Cr2+ and amorphous Cr3+ sites, re- spectively, was verified."
[5] "Alumina disperses chromium particles in its surface better than silica."
[6] "The activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts to the ethylene polymerization is associated to the amount of Cr2+ A + Cr2+ B species."

1. Chromium catalysts are widely used in industrial applications such as ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions.
2. In dehydrogenation processes, chromium(III) species coordinated to hydroxyls are identified as the active sites.
3. Chromium(II) species are reported as the active sites for ethylene polymerization.
4. The selectivity of chemisorption techniques was confirmed for identifying Cr2+ and amorphous Cr3+ sites.
5. Alumina is found to disperse chromium particles more effectively than silica.
6. The ethylene polymerization activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts correlates with the amount of Cr2+ A + Cr2+ B species.
