1. Chromium catalysts are utilized in industrial processes for ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The oxidation state of chromium does not vary significantly across different precursors with low chromium content after calcination, mainly observed as Cr6+. However, the chromium content and precursor compound greatly affect the chromium species distribution in calcined and reduced forms.
3. Chromium catalysts for ethylene polymerization are typically prepared by impregnating an inorganic precursor onto silica with a high surface area and pore volume, resulting in catalysts with 1 wt.% or less chromium content.
4. The active site for ethylene polymerization is identified as the Cr2+ species.
5. Literature suggests the use of chemisorption of O2 at low temperatures to quantify Cr3+ sites in bulk or supported Cr2O3.
6. Literature confirms the use of chemisorption of O2 at low temperatures for quantifying Cr3+ sites in bulk or supported Cr2O3.
7. The active site for ethylene polymerization is identified as the Cr2+ species.
8. Literature supports the use of chemisorption of O2 at low temperatures for quantifying Cr3+ sites in bulk or supported Cr2O3.
9. Literature validates the use of chemisorption of O2 at low temperatures for quantifying Cr3+ sites in bulk or supported Cr2O3.
10. The active site for ethylene polymerization is identified as the Cr2+ species.
