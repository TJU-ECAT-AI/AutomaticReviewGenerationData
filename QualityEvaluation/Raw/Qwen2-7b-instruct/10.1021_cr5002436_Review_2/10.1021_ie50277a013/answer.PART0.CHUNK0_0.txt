1. Dehydrogenation processes have been reported, utilizing catalysts such as cobalt, nickel, copper, iron, silver, platinum, and palladium for efficient hydrogen combination with corresponding olefins at moderate temperatures.
2. The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been directly determined by Pease, indicating that ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and vice versa at 600°C to 700°C without significant side reactions.
3. Special analytical methods were required for determining the individual isomeric n-butenes due to their similar properties.
4. Olefins and hydrogen were accurately determined using an Orsat apparatus, avoiding rubber solvent effects through glass-to-glass seals.
5. The equilibrium dissociation of propane is the same for l-butene as for propylene.
6. The extent of side reactions was determined by passing propane, propane plus propylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane over a catalyst at appropriate flow rates to achieve equilibrium.
7. Calculated equilibrium constants from hydrogen-propylene averages agreed with subsequent experiments using more active catalysts.
8. Activated carbon behaves differently from wood charcoal and other previous water purification carbons when interacting with metallic equipment.
9. Comparative data illustrate the potential differences generated between various carbons and metals, highlighting the unique behavior of activated carbon.
10. Potential differences are set up between activated carbon and metallic water-purification equipment, differing from the behavior observed with wood charcoal and other conventional carbons.
