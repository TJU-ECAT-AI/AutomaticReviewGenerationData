[1] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350" to 500" C. Side reactions were not marked under proper conditions, and hydrogenation as well as dehydrogenation took place without serious complications."
[2] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined directly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without excessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are obtained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."
[3] "In order to determine the extent of side reactions and secondary reactions in addition to the predominating hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, propane, propane plus propylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane were passed over the catalyst at flow rates low enough to allow equilibrium to be established, and the products were analyzed by fractionation."
[4] "Ethane, propane, and the butanes have been dehydrogenated to the corresponding olefins and hydrogen at 350" to 500" C. and 760 mm. pressure by means of a catalyst prepared from air-dried chromic oxide gel."
[5] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined directly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without excessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are obtained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."
[6] "Since the dehydrogenation of n - butane produced three isomeric n- butenes, special analytical means were necessary for determining each individually."

1. Chromic oxide-based catalysts were used for dehydrogenating simple paraffins into olefins at temperatures ranging from 350°C to 500°C. These catalysts allowed for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation to occur simultaneously without significant complications.
2. The direct determination of the ethane-ethylene equilibrium was conducted by Pease, indicating that ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at temperatures between 600°C and 700°C without excessive side reactions.
3. To assess the extent of side reactions and secondary reactions beyond hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, propane, propane plus propylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane were passed over the catalyst at flow rates sufficient to establish equilibrium, and the products were analyzed by fractionation.
4. Ethane, propane, and butanes were successfully dehydrogenated into their corresponding olefins and hydrogen at temperatures between 350°C and 500°C and a pressure of 760 mmHg using a chromic oxide gel catalyst.
5. The direct determination of the ethane-ethylene equilibrium was performed by Pease, confirming that ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen combine to form ethane at temperatures between 600°C and 700°C without excessive side reactions, with equilibrium values obtained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures.
6. The dehydrogenation of n-butane produced three isomeric n-butenes, necessitating special analytical methods for the determination of each isomer individually.
