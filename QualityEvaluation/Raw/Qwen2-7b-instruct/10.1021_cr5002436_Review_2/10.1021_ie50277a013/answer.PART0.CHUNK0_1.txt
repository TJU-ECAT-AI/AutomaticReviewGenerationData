1. Dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butanes has been reported in the literature.
2. At higher temperatures, copper becomes inactive in dehydrogenation processes, while nickel, platinum, and palladium cause complex decomposition.
3. The direct determination of the ethane-ethylene equilibrium was carried out by Pease.
4. Without a catalyst, ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen combine to form ethane at 600 to 700°C, without significant side reactions.
5. The equilibrium dissociation for the formation of l-butene mirrors that for propylene.
6. The direct measurement of the ethane-ethylene equilibrium was done by Pease.
7. A catalyst made from chromic oxide gel was prepared for the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into olefins at 350 to 500°C.
