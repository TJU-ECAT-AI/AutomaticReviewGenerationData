[1] "Since the dehydrogenation of n-butane produced three isomeric n-butenes, special analytical means were necessary for determining each individually."
[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of n-butane produced three isomeric n-butenes, special analytical means were necessary for determining each individually."
[3] "In order to determine the extent of side reactions and secondary reactions in addition to the predominating hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, propane, propane plus propylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane were passed over the catalyst at flow rates low enough to allow equilibrium to be established, and the products were analyzed by fractionation."
[4] "The potential differences observed between various types of carbons and a number of different metals and alloys are shown in Table I."

1. Special analytical methods were required to determine the three isomeric n-butenes resulting from the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
2. Fractionation analysis was used to determine the extent of side reactions and secondary reactions in addition to hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes.
3. The extent of side reactions and secondary reactions was determined by passing propane, propane plus propylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane over the catalyst at controlled flow rates and analyzing the products through fractionation.
4. Comparative data on potential differences between various types of carbons and metals are provided in Table I.
