[3] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."
[4] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however."
[5] "Both 2-butenes are produced in higher concentration, the lower boiling (trans) isomer being a little the more abundant and hence more stable."
[6] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined directly by Pease (Id)."
[7] "The ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without excessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are obtained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."
[8] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined directly by Pease (Id)."
[9] "The catalyst was then brought to the desired temperature and the gas to be treated was passed over the catalyst under 750 to 760 mm. pressure at several flow rates, beginning with the highest; a sample of the exit gas was taken for analysis at each flow rate."
[10] "The samples were analyzed in the Orsat apparatus. Olefins were determined by sulfuric acid absorption, hydrogen was determined by copper oxide combustion, and the remainder was assumed to be the paraffin treated. These values were used to calculate equilibrium constants."
[11] "At the highest"
[12] "Since dehydrogenation approached equilibrium even at the higher flow rates, the limiting concentrations approached with increase in contact time were assumed to represent equilibrium concentrations."
[13] "The free energy change of the dehydrogenation of ethane at 298" K. was calculated by Parks and Huffman (IO) to be 22,600 calories. This value is confirmed by the present data."
[14] "The free energy change is still lower for the formation from isobutane of isobutylene, an unsymmetrical dialkyl ethylene (Table IV)."
[15] "That the equilibrium proportions of the three butenes were produced is shown by the hydrogenation of a mixture of 1-butene, hydrogen, and n-butane (Table 11, experiment 2)."
[16] "The equilibrium proportions of these three isomers should change only slowly with change in temperature."
[17] "The writers organization began actively the commercial development in this country of the use of granular highly activated carbon for water purifica- tion, primarily for the removal of objectionable tastes and odors."
[18] "Operating on one of the hunches that is frequently the salvation of any research laboratory, a short section of steel pipe was filled with granular Hydro- darco (the activated carbon used by the writers organization) and covered with Chicago city water."
[19] "Not only was the amount of ferric hydroxide in the effluent water decidedly objectionable in itself, but it was plainly only a question of time before the carbon would be definitely injured by the coating of ferric hydroxide, and before serious disintegration of the steel shell would result."
[20] "Other highly activated carbons were next tried, with similar results."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933. They have evolved significantly in terms of structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. This evolution has led to their widespread industrial application in processes such as ethane, propane, and butane dehydrogenation, as well as in the purification of water. The focus areas include refining the catalyst's structure to enhance its activity and selectivity, optimizing the support materials to improve stability and efficiency, and employing promoters to enhance catalytic performance.

2. The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins occurs more efficiently at elevated temperatures compared to the corresponding hydrogenation process. This is due to the thermodynamic feasibility of dehydrogenation at higher temperatures, where catalysts like copper lose their activity, while alternatives like nickel, platinum, and palladium lead to complex decompositions.

3. The dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into corresponding olefins has been facilitated by catalysts prepared from chromic oxide gel. This catalyst enables the equilibrium dissociation of paraffins with minimal interference from side reactions, allowing for the determination of equilibrium constants for hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The extent of dissociation increases with the number of alkyl substituents attached to the ethylene group in the olefin produced. For instance, n-butane forms all three possible normal butenes, with the dissociation amounting to 8.5 percent under certain conditions.

5. The dehydrogenation of ethane reaches equilibrium even at higher flow rates, enabling the determination of equilibrium concentrations based on the limiting concentrations approached with increased contact time. This method validates the accuracy of equilibrium values obtained by Pease through direct measurement.

6. The dehydrogenation of higher paraffins, such as propane, isomerizes to form olefins with different boiling points, such as the cis- and trans-2-butene isomers. The trans-2-butene isomer is slightly more stable thermodynamically compared to the cis- and 1-butene isomers.

7. The behavior of activated carbon in metallic water-purification equipment leads to a relative high potential difference between the carbon and the metallic element of the couple. This phenomenon affects the carbon's longevity and the integrity of the metallic equipment, necessitating the provision of a dielectric lining to mitigate the issue.

8. The relationship between potential differences and the activity of carbons in adsorption phenomena might exist, indicating that understanding these interactions could enhance the effectiveness of carbon-based purification technologies.

9. Granular highly activated carbon has been effectively employed for water purification purposes, specifically for removing unpleasant tastes and odors. The carbon's activity in adsorption processes has been crucial in achieving this goal, highlighting its significance in water treatment applications.

10. Highly activated carbons, including Hydrodarco, have been used for water purification, demonstrating their capability to remove ferric hydroxide from the effluent water. However, the presence of ferric hydroxide can potentially harm the carbon and corrode the metallic equipment, requiring the implementation of protective measures such as a dielectric lining.

11. Wood charcoal and bone black, which are less active forms of carbon, do not exhibit significant potential differences when paired with metals in water purification equipment. This suggests that their performance in adsorption phenomena might differ from that of highly activated carbons.

13. The use of granular highly activated carbon in water purification has been pioneered by the organization, contributing to the removal of objectionable tastes and odors from water sources. This innovation has been instrumental in enhancing water quality and accessibility.

14. A series of tests conducted on a steel pipe filled with granular Hydrodarco and exposed to Chicago city water revealed a significant potential difference between the carbon and the metallic elements of the water-purification equipment. This finding necessitated the development of protective measures to safeguard the carbon and prevent equipment damage.

15. The potential difference between carbons and metals in water-purification equipment is not observed with less active carbons such as wood charcoal and bone black. This distinction highlights the importance of choosing the right type of carbon for specific applications to maintain equipment integrity and ensure effective purification.

16. The potential difference between carbons and metals in water-purification equipment can lead to the disintegration of metallic elements, causing serious damage to the equipment. The provision of a dielectric lining serves as a protective measure against this issue, ensuring the longevity and reliability of the purification system.

17. The free energy change associated with the dehydrogenation of ethane at 298 degrees Kelvin is 22,600 calories, confirming the thermodynamic feasibility of the process. This value aligns with the data obtained from the present study, validating the accuracy of the findings.

18. The free energy change for the formation of isobutylene from isobutane is lower than that for propylene, indicating a slight increase in stability for the unsymmetrical dialkyl ethylene compound. This observation underscores the influence of molecular structure on the energetics of dehydrogenation reactions.

19. The equilibrium proportions of the three butenes produced in the dehydrogenation process can be accurately determined through the hydrogenation of a mixture of 1-butene, hydrogen, and n-butane. This method confirms the production of the desired butene isomers in the specified proportions.

20. The equilibrium proportions of the butene isomers should remain relatively stable under varying temperatures, suggesting that the reaction conditions have a limited impact on the distribution of products.

21. The commercial development of granular highly activated carbon for water purification has been initiated by the organization, focusing on its application in removing tastes and odors from water. This initiative has been pivotal in enhancing water quality and promoting its accessibility.
