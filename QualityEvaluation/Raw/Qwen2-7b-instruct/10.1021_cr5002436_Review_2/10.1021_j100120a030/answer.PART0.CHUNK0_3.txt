Answer: Chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved since their discovery in 1933. They have become indispensable in various industries due to their catalytic properties. Key industrial applications include the polymerization of ethylene, production of high-density and linear low-density polyethylene, copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1, polymerization of propylene, dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. Research focus areas encompass understanding the structure of catalysts, the identification of active sites, selection of support materials, optimization of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. These advancements have led to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, enhancing product quality and process economics.
