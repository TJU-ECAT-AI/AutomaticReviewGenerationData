1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts are primarily utilized in the polymerization of ethylene, leading to the development of high-density and linear low-density polyethylene, as well as the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1. Additionally, they play crucial roles in dehydrogenation processes of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. Research efforts have concentrated on understanding the formation and nature of chromium species on the catalyst surface, along with identifying the valence states of the responsible species. Techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance have been employed in these studies.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit distinct behaviors on various support materials. For instance, chromium on silica (Cr/SiOz) is effective in ethylene polymerization, while chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2*A1203) is suitable for propylene polymerization. Chromium on alumina (Cr/A1203) is known for its activity in dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. The relative proportions of chromium species, including Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, vary depending on factors such as reduction temperature and the specific support material used.

3. Chromium species on the catalyst surface are characterized by various coordination geometries. Cr3+ is predominantly considered octahedral, although a smaller portion may exhibit lower symmetry, as suggested by Myers and Lunsford. Cr2+ can adopt unsaturated, tetrahedral, and square-planar coordination. The precise molecular structure of chromium species on silica, silica-alumina, and alumina surfaces remains an area of ongoing investigation.

4. Quantitative methods for determining the concentrations of Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+ have been developed. After calcination at 550°C, the ratio of chromate to dichromate is approximately 0.56 on alumina, 2.18 on silica, and the regeneration is complete only on silica upon recalcination.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在工业应用和研究重点领域。这些催化剂主要用于乙烯聚合，导致高密度聚乙烯和线性低密度聚乙烯的生产，以及乙烯和丁烯-1的共聚。它们在烷烃脱氢、脱氢环化和催化重整过程中也发挥着关键作用。研究工作集中在理解催化剂表面的铬物种形成及其相关物种的电荷状态。红外光谱、漫反射光谱、X射线光电子光谱、拉曼光谱和电子自旋共振等技术被用于这些研究。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂在不同支持材料上的行为存在差异。例如，硅基催化剂（Cr/SiOz）适用于乙烯聚合，而硅铝基催化剂（Cr/SiO2*A1203）则适合丙烯聚合。铝基催化剂（Cr/A1203）在烷烃脱氢、脱氢环化和催化重整中表现出活性。铬物种的相对比例，包括Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+，取决于因素如还原温度和支持材料的类型。

3. 催化剂表面的铬物种具有不同的配位几何结构。Cr3+主要被认为是八面体配位，尽管Myers和Lunsford提出了一部分可能具有较低对称性。Cr2+可以采用不饱和、四面体和方形平面配位。在硅、硅铝和铝基表面上的铬物种的确切分子结构仍然是一个正在进行的研究领域。

4. 已开发出定量方法来确定Cr2+、Cr3+和Cr6+的浓度。在550°C煅烧后，铬酸盐与二铬酸盐的比例约为0.56在氧化铝上，2.18在硅上，而仅在硅上进行再煅烧时完全再生。
