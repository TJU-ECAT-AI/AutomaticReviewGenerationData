          [1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiOz) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."
          [2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."
          [3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2*A1203) catalyses the polymerization of propylene."
          [4] "Chromium on alumina (Cr/A1203) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocycliza- tion, and in catalytic reforming."
          [5] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."
          [6] "The redox behavior of Cr on Al203, SO2, and Si02.A1203 will be discussed."

          Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in the context of ethylene polymerization, where they play a crucial role in the Phillips particle-form process for producing high-density polyethylene. They have also been adapted for the production of linear low-density polyethylene and for the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1. Additionally, these catalysts are utilized in the polymerization of propylene and in processes such as dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. Research focus areas include understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. The redox behavior of chromium on alumina, sulfur dioxide, and silica-alumina is a significant focus in research.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在乙烯聚合领域发挥了关键作用，这是菲利普斯粒子形过程的基础，用于生产高密度聚乙烯。它们也被扩展用于生产线性低密度聚乙烯以及乙烯和丁烯-1的共聚。此外，这些催化剂还用于丙烯聚合以及烷烃脱氢、环化反应和催化重整等过程。研究重点包括理解催化剂的结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制。铬在氧化铝、二氧化硫和二氧化硅-氧化铝上的还原行为是研究的一个重要焦点。
