1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in terms of their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts are primarily utilized in the polymerization of ethylene, leading to the development of high-density and linear low-density polyethylene, as well as the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1. Additionally, they play crucial roles in dehydrogenation processes of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. Research efforts have concentrated on understanding the formation and nature of chromium species on the catalyst surface, along with identifying the valence states of the responsible species. Techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance have been employed in these studies.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit distinct behaviors on various support materials. For instance, chromium on silica (Cr/SiOz) is effective in ethylene polymerization, while chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2*A1203) is suitable for propylene polymerization. Chromium on alumina (Cr/A1203) is known for its activity in dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. The relative proportions of chromium species, including Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, vary depending on factors such as reduction temperature and the specific support material used.

3. Chromium species on the catalyst surface are characterized by various coordination geometries. Cr3+ is predominantly considered octahedral, although a smaller portion may exhibit lower symmetry, as suggested by Myers and Lunsford. Cr2+ can adopt unsaturated, tetrahedral, and square-planar coordination. The precise molecular structure of chromium species on silica, silica-alumina, and alumina surfaces remains an area of ongoing investigation.

4. Quantitative methods for determining the concentrations of Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr6+ have been developed. After calcination at 550°C, the ratio of chromate to dichromate is approximately 0.56 on alumina, 2.18 on silica, and the regeneration is complete only on silica upon recalcination.
