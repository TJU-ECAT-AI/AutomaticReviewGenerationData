1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved in various industrial applications. They are primarily utilized in the polymerization of ethylene under low pressures, forming the basis of the Phillips particle-form process for high-density polyethylene production. The scope has been broadened to include linear low-density polyethylene and copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1. Additionally, these catalysts play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming.

2. Research focus areas concerning these catalysts include understanding their structure, identifying active sites, exploring the properties of different support materials, studying promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electronspin resonance have been employed to gain insights into these aspects.

3. The consensus among researchers indicates that the detectable oxidation states of chromium species are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. Upon reduction, the catalysts yield traces of these species, whose proportions vary depending on the reduction temperature and other factors.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在各种工业应用中经历了显著的发展。它们主要用于在较低压力下聚合乙烯，形成用于生产高密度聚乙烯的基础——菲尔斯颗粒形式过程。这些催化剂的应用范围已扩展到线性低密度聚乙烯和乙烯与丁烯-1的共聚。此外，它们在烷烃脱氢、脱氢环化和催化重整等过程中也起着关键作用。

2. 关于这些催化剂的研究重点包括理解其结构、识别活性位点、探索不同支撑材料的性质、研究促进剂以及阐明反应机制。红外光谱法、漫反射光谱法、X射线光电子能谱法、拉曼光谱法和电子自旋共振等技术被广泛使用，以深入了解这些方面。

3. 研究人员普遍认为，可检测的铬物种氧化状态为Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+。在还原后，催化剂会产生这些物种的痕迹，这些物种的比例取决于还原温度和其他因素。
