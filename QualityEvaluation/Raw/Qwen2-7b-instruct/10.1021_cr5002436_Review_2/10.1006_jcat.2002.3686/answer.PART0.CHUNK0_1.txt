[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (1–4)."
[2] "Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."
[3] "The main interest in the present work is the physico-chemical processes leading to irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina catalysts."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These developments have significantly contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. The focus of research has primarily centered on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts, identifying the origin of their catalytic activity, and exploring deactivation mechanisms. The current study specifically investigates the physico-chemical processes that lead to irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina catalysts.
