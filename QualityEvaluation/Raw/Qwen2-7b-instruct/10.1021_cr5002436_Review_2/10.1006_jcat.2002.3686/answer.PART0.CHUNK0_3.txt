The study focuses on understanding the physical and chemical processes causing irreversible deactivation in chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts. The researchers supported chromium oxide on alumina with different amounts of γ-, θ-, or α-alumina. They subjected the catalysts to calcinations at varying temperatures (600, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1200°C) to create inactive chromium(III) species. A model was developed explaining the deactivation through catalyst-support sintering and chromium migration. The influence of the alumina support on deactivation and the activity of various chromium(III) species was also discussed.

本研究主要关注理解导致铬氧化物/氧化铝脱氢催化剂不可逆失活的物理和化学过程。研究人员在γ-, θ-或α-氧化铝中支持铬氧化物。他们将催化剂在不同的温度（600、900、1000、1100和1200°C）下进行煅烧，以产生非活性铬（III）物种。提出了一个模型来解释通过催化剂-支持烧结和铬迁移导致的失活过程。还讨论了氧化铝支持对失活以及各种铬（III）物种活性的影响。
