The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen significant advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are widely used in dehydrogenation processes for the production of propene and other light alkenes. Researchers have dedicated substantial effort to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts. It remains unclear whether the catalytic activity and deactivation rates vary among different Cr3+ sites. Chromium(II) ions (Cr2+) may be present in these catalysts, though this is uncertain. The phase of the alumina support impacts the catalytic activity of chromia, and high chromium loadings, around 15 atCr/nm2, are typically found in industrial catalysts. Studying catalysts with lower chromium loadings can provide insights into active sites. When subjected to cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions over long periods, industrial catalysts lose activity due to the formation of chromia-alumina solid solutions.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在理解其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制方面取得了显著进展。这些催化剂广泛用于丙烯和其他轻烯烃的脱氢过程。研究人员已致力于澄清铝氧化的铬氧化物催化剂的结构。目前尚不清楚不同Cr3+位点的催化活性和失活速率是否有所不同。铬(II)离子（Cr2+）可能存在于这些催化剂中，但这一问题尚不明确。铝氧化的相态影响了铬的催化活性，工业催化剂通常含有约15 atCr/nm2的高铬负载。研究低铬负载的催化剂可以提供关于活性位点的信息。当在长期循环氧化和还原条件下使用时，工业催化剂由于形成铬铝固体溶液而失去活性。
