1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with research focusing on their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These advancements have contributed greatly to their significance in dehydrogenation processes.
2. The catalytic activity and rate of deactivation do differ among the various Cr3+ sites.
3. The presence of Cr2+ in chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts is not explicitly discussed in the document.
4. The phase of the alumina support affects the catalytic activity of chromium, as indicated by the study on the influence of γ-, θ-, and α-alumina phases.
5. Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts typically have a high chromium loading of around 15 atCr/nm2.
6. Under repeated exposure to extreme oxidizing and reducing conditions, chromia/alumina catalysts undergo irreversible deactivation through the formation of chromia-alumina solid solutions.
