[1] "Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."
[2] "Several questions need to be addressed in regard to the chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts. Do the catalytic activity and rate of deactivation of the various Cr3+ sites differ (7, 10, 12, 25)?"
[3] "Is Cr2+ present in chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts (13)?"
[4] "Does the phase of the alumina support affect the catalytic activity of chro- mia (19)?"
[5] "Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1). Can relevant information on the active sites be gained by studying catalysts with low chromium loadings (6, 12, 13)?"
[6] "When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3). How does the irreversible deactivation occur?"

1. The understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Their industrial applications and research focus areas include the study of their structure, identification of active sites, optimization of support materials, exploration of promoters, and understanding of reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into lighter alkenes.

2. The catalytic activity and rate of deactivation vary among different Cr3+ sites. The study of these differences could lead to improvements in catalyst design and performance.

3. The presence of Cr2+ in chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts is a topic of investigation, potentially impacting the catalyst's overall stability and activity.

4. The phase of the alumina support does influence the catalytic activity of chromium oxide. Different phases may have varying impacts on the distribution and reactivity of Cr3+ species.

5. High chromium loadings, around 15 atCr/nm2 in industrial catalysts, can be studied through lower loading catalysts to gain insights into the active sites and mechanisms, although this may require careful examination due to potential differences in behavior.

6. Chromia/alumina catalysts experience irreversible deactivation when subjected to cycles of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over time. This process involves the formation of solid solutions of chromia and alumina, leading to the loss of catalytic activity.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展取得了显著进步。它们在工业应用和研究重点领域的应用包括结构研究、活性位点识别、支持材料优化、促进剂探索以及反应机制理解。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中因其能够高效地将烷烃转化为轻烯烃而至关重要。

2. 不同Cr3+位点的催化活性和失活速率存在差异。研究这些差异可能有助于改进催化剂设计和性能。

3. 铬氧化物脱氢催化剂中Cr2+的存在是一个研究课题，这可能影响催化剂的整体稳定性和活性。

4. 铝酸盐支持的相态确实影响了铬氧化物的催化活性。不同的相态可能对Cr3+物种的分布和反应性产生不同影响。

5. 工业催化剂中的高铬负载（约每平方纳米15原子）可以通过研究低负载催化剂来获得有关活性位点和机制的见解，尽管这可能需要仔细观察，因为行为可能存在差异。

6. 当在长时间内经历严重氧化和还原条件的周期时，铬氧化物/铝酸盐催化剂会经历不可逆失活。这个过程涉及铬氧化物和铝酸盐形成固溶体，导致催化活性的丧失。
