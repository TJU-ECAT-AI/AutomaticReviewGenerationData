1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly. Initially, they were characterized by Poole and Mclver in the late 1960s and further studied by Kearby. Research has since expanded to include catalysts based on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and CrOx/ZrO2. A critical overview of the current knowledge on chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly focusing on industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, is provided. In situ capabilities have enabled more recent studies that have revealed a quantifiable link between the amount of reduced Cr3 species and catalyst activity during dehydrogenation processes.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展。最初，Poole和Mclver在20世纪60年代末对此进行了详细描述，而Kearby则进一步研究了它们。随后的研究涵盖了基于CrOx/SiO2、CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2的催化剂。本文提供了一个关于铬基脱氢化催化剂的当前知识的关键概述，特别关注工业上使用的Cr/Al2O3催化剂。最近的技术使原位研究成为可能，揭示了减少Cr3物种的数量与催化剂在脱氢过程中活性之间的定量关系。
