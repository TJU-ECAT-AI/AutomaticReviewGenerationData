[1] "Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process."
[2] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."
[3] "The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr."
[4] "Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."
[5] "Alumina possess the undesired feature of catalyzing degradation reactions, i.e. cracking and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."
[6] "As a consequence, different surface species are observed on the surface of freshly prepared catalysts, their relative concentration mainly depending on the overall Cr loading, the alumina surface area, and the calcination treatment."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly impacted dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:

1. **Composition**: Catalysts are composed of chromium oxides dispersed on porous supports, often alumina, with dopants added to regulate deactivation and enhance selectivity. The preferred Cr loading ranges from 0 to 20 wt%, with a common loading of around 13 wt% Cr.

2. **Support Materials**: While alumina is the most commonly used support due to its surface area, other materials such as zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been studied.

3. **Regulation of Deactivation**: Alumina's tendency to catalyze degradation reactions, leading to catalyst deactivation, is mitigated by poisoning responsible acid sites with alkali ions, typically potassium, at up to 2 wt% concentration.

4. **Surface Composition**: Freshly prepared catalysts exhibit various surface species that depend on the overall chromium loading, alumina surface area, and calcination treatment. These species include Cr6, Cr5, and Cr3.

5. **Active Sites**: Under reaction conditions, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species, which are crucial for dehydrogenation activity.

6. **Catalyst Deactivation**: Industrial cycling of catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions affects their physicochemical structure, leading to deactivation over time. This is evidenced by a decrease in specific surface area, amount of Cr6, and other structural changes.

These advancements have led to significant improvements in dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity, contributing to the industrial production of valuable chemicals like propene and isobutene.

自1933年发现铬氧化物催化剂以来，这类催化剂的发展对脱氢过程产生了重大影响。关键的工业应用和研究重点包括：

1. **组成**：催化剂由铬氧化物分散在多孔支撑材料上组成，通常是氧化铝，其中添加掺杂剂以调节失活并提高选择性。常用的Cr负载范围从0到20%，常见负载约为13%Cr。

2. **支撑材料**：虽然氧化铝因其表面积而成为首选支撑材料，但其他材料如锆石、硅酸盐和镁氧化物也已进行了详细的研究。

3. **调节失活**：由于氧化铝催化降解反应导致催化剂失活的特性，通过在2%浓度的碱性离子（通常是钾）中中毒负责酸位点来缓解这些问题。

4. **表面组成**：新制备的催化剂表面表现出各种表面物种，其取决于总体铬负载、氧化铝表面积以及煅烧处理。这些物种包括Cr6、Cr5和Cr3。

5. **活性位点**：在反应条件下，Cr/Al2O3催化剂含有未配位的Cr3物种，这对于脱氢活性至关重要。

6. **催化剂失活**：工业循环催化剂在氧化和还原条件下会影响其物理化学结构，最终导致催化剂失活。这表现为特定表面积的减少、Cr6含量的降低以及其他结构变化。

这些进展导致脱氢效率和选择性的显著提高，从而促进了丙烯和异丁烯等重要化学品的工业生产。
