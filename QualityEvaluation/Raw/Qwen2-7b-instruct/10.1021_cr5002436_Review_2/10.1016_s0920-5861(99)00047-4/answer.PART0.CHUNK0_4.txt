[2] "In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge nowadays available about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."
[5] "The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modified preparation procedures have since been developed."
[6] "The surface composition of calcined Cr/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of Cr oxide loading is summarized in Table 2."
[7] "At much higher Cr oxide loadings, i.e. above monolayer coverage loading, Cr3 is the dominant species, and the fraction of Cr6 is rather low."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 includes advancements in preparation methods, the identification of active sites, the optimization of support materials, the incorporation of promoters, and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications and research focus areas are centered around improving dehydrogenation processes for the production of alkenes from low-cost hydrocarbons, specifically propene and isobutene. These catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on porous supports with dopants for deactivation regulation and selectivity enhancement. Preparation methods have evolved from coprecipitation to impregnation and atomic layer epitaxy. Research has identified that chromium oxide surfaces contain a variety of species, including Cr6, Cr5, and Cr3, which play roles in catalytic activity and selectivity. In situ spectroscopic techniques like Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have provided insights into the dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the reduction of Cr6 species to Cr3. The structure and properties of these catalysts are continuously studied to optimize their performance in dehydrogenation processes.
