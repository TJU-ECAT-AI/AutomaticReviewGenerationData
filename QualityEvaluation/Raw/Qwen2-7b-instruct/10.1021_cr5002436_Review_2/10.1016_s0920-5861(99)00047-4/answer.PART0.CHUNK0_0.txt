[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
[2] "In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[4] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation being well-established. The Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is the commonly used commercial choice. Research focuses on identifying active sites, understanding the effects of preparation and treatment conditions on the catalyst's properties, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

[1] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."
[2] "The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modified preparation procedures have since been developed."
[3] "Generally speaking, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be prepared by three techniques:"
[4] "In situ capabilities have only recently become commercially available, allowing for a limited number of in situ characterization studies."

2. Industrial chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts usually consist of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support, with dopants added to control deactivation and enhance selectivity. The initial catalyst formulation by Frey and Huppke involved coprecipitation of aluminum and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide. Several modified preparation methods have been developed since. Preparation of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can typically be achieved through three methods. In situ characterization techniques have recently become available commercially, enabling fewer in situ studies.

2. 商业化的铬基脱氢催化剂通常由分散在多孔支撑物上的铬氧化物组成，添加掺杂剂以调节失活并提高选择性。弗莱和胡普克最初采用氨化铝和铬硝酸盐共沉淀的方法制备催化剂。自那以后，开发了许多修改后的制备程序。Cr/Al2O3催化剂的制备通常可以通过三种技术实现。最近，商业上可获得原位表征能力，允许进行少数原位表征研究。

[1] "Up to now, most reported characterization studies were done under conditions often far away from real catalytic conditions."
[2] "Surface Cr-species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6."
[3] "The extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles."

3. Until now, most characterization studies were conducted under conditions significantly different from actual catalytic conditions. Under reaction conditions, Cr species are formed at the cost of Cr6. The degree of reduction, as measured by the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, decreases with the number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles.

3. 直到目前为止，大多数表征研究是在与实际催化条件相距甚远的情况下进行的。在反应条件下，Cr物种形成于Cr6的成本。通过其Cr/Al2O3催化剂消耗的H2或CO量测量的减少程度，在减少-脱氢-再还原循环周期数增加时减少。
