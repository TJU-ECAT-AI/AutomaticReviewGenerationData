The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly impacted dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:

1. **Composition**: Catalysts are composed of chromium oxides dispersed on porous supports, often alumina, with dopants added to regulate deactivation and enhance selectivity. The preferred Cr loading ranges from 0 to 20 wt%, with a common loading of around 13 wt% Cr.

2. **Support Materials**: While alumina is the most commonly used support due to its surface area, other materials such as zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been studied.

3. **Regulation of Deactivation**: Alumina's tendency to catalyze degradation reactions, leading to catalyst deactivation, is mitigated by poisoning responsible acid sites with alkali ions, typically potassium, at up to 2 wt% concentration.

4. **Surface Composition**: Freshly prepared catalysts exhibit various surface species that depend on the overall chromium loading, alumina surface area, and calcination treatment. These species include Cr6, Cr5, and Cr3.

5. **Active Sites**: Under reaction conditions, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species, which are crucial for dehydrogenation activity.

6. **Catalyst Deactivation**: Industrial cycling of catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions affects their physicochemical structure, leading to deactivation over time. This is evidenced by a decrease in specific surface area, amount of Cr6, and other structural changes.

These advancements have led to significant improvements in dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity, contributing to the industrial production of valuable chemicals like propene and isobutene.
