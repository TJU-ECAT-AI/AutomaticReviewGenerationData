[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge nowadays available about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[4] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and McLver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[5] "In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[6] "Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2,are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium."
[7] "The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modified preparation procedures have since been developed."
[8] "The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physical and chemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation."
[9] "In situ capabilities have only recently become commercially available, allowing a limited number of in situ characterization studies."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with a primary focus on dehydrogenation processes for alkanes to produce alkenes. These catalysts are used industrially for the production of propene and isobutene, which are essential components in the polymer and gasoline industries. Research efforts have concentrated on identifying active sites, understanding the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and elucidating dehydrogenation mechanisms.

2. The evolution of chromium oxide catalysts includes advancements in preparation techniques, such as impregnation, coprecipitation, and atomic layer epitaxy. The structure of freshly prepared catalysts varies based on chromium oxide loading, showing different surface compositions of chromium species like Cr6, Cr5, and Cr3.

3. Active catalysts exhibit transformation of surface Cr6 species to Cr3 species under reaction conditions, which correlates with increased dehydrogenation activity. The nature of these Cr3 species is characterized by isolated Cr3 sites with two coordinative vacancies.

4. The structure of deactivated catalysts changes over time due to industrial cycling, leading to deactivation. This includes a decrease in specific surface area and a reduction in the amount of surface Cr6 species.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢化烷烃以生产烯烃方面经历了显著的演变。这些催化剂主要用于丙烯和异丁烯的工业生产，这是聚合物和汽油行业的关键成分。研究重点集中在确定活性位点、理解制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种的影响以及阐明脱氢化机制上。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的发展包括准备技术的进步，如浸渍、共沉淀和原子层外延。新鲜催化剂表面的组成根据铬氧化物负载量的不同，显示出Cr6、Cr5和Cr3等不同铬物种的表面组成。

3. 活性催化剂在反应条件下将表面Cr6物种转化为Cr3物种，这与脱氢化活性增加有关。这些Cr3物种的性质表现为孤立的Cr3位点，具有两个配位空位。

4. 催化剂失活的结构随时间变化，主要由于工业周期的影响。这包括特定表面积的减少和表面Cr6物种含量的降低。
