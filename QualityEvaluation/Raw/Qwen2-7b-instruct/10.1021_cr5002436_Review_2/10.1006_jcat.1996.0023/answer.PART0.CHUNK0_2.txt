[1] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization."
[2] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."
[3] "An approximate estimate of the experimental error of this technique has been evaluated by repeated analysis, and has been found to correspond to approximately 10% of the average value."
[4] "The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and of undetected Cr31 oxide (determined by difference between the overall amount of Cr31 oxide, determined by titration, and the amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3, determined by X-ray diffractive spectroscopy) is also reported in Fig. 1."
[5] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have found significant industrial applications in processes such as polymerization. The research focus areas have primarily centered around optimizing the nature of the chromium species, influenced by factors like the type of support and preparation parameters such as calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading. The precision of analytical techniques used for characterizing these catalysts has improved, with an estimated error rate of 10% found through repeated analysis. The presence of various chromium species, including Cr61 and Cr31, and their distribution across the catalyst surface, have been critical points of investigation. The amount of grafted Cr61 has been found to correlate with the surface area, suggesting efficient utilization of the catalyst surface. The catalysts' ability to support reactions like dehydrogenation of isobutane to produce isobutene highlights their importance in chemical synthesis industries.
