1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in their industrial applications. They have been widely utilized for processes such as polymerization, oxidation of alcohols, and dehydrogenation of paraffins. Their significance in dehydrogenation processes is attributed to their ability to efficiently convert isobutane into isobutene.

2. Key research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include understanding their structure, identifying active sites, selecting suitable support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The choice of support material, such as alumina or zirconia, has been crucial due to their properties of thermal stability and surface acidity. The study of chromium species and their interactions with the support is also pivotal.

3. In the context of dehydrogenation of isobutane, the research aimed to characterize catalysts prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina. Techniques like XRD, UVVisNIR DR, XPS, and chemical analysis were employed to understand the nature of chromium species in calcined catalysts.

4. The nature of chromium species varies across different samples, with the presence of both Cr31 and Cr61 species being identified. The amount of grafted Cr61 species increases proportionally with the surface area of the support. This indicates the importance of surface area in the effective utilization of chromium oxide for catalytic purposes.

5. For overall chromium oxide loadings higher than 4 wt%, the study revealed the presence of Cr31 species, which increases linearly with the chromium oxide loading. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the catalyst might be optimized by controlling the loading of chromium oxide.

6. The study also highlighted that the deposition of chromium oxide did not cause any plugging of the aluminum pores, indicating the compatibility of chromium oxide with alumina support and the potential for efficient catalytic activity.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在工业应用方面。它们广泛应用于聚合反应、醇的氧化和异丁烷脱氢等过程。它们在脱氢过程中的重要性归因于它们能够高效地将异丁烷转化为异丁烯的能力。

2. 研究的重点领域包括理解其结构、识别活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。选择如氧化铝或氧化锆这样的支撑材料至关重要，因为它们具有热稳定性和表面酸度特性。对铬物种及其与支撑材料的相互作用的研究也是关键。

3. 在异丁烷脱氢的背景下，研究旨在通过在商用氧化铝上支持增加的铬氧化物量来表征催化剂。使用XRD、UVVisNIR DR、XPS和化学分析技术来了解烧结催化剂中铬物种的性质。

4. 铬物种的性质在不同样本中有所不同，发现了Cr31和Cr61物种的存在。覆盖在表面上的Cr61物种的数量与支持材料的表面积成正比。这表明表面面积对于有效利用铬氧化物作为催化剂的重要性。

5. 对于总体铬氧化物负载高于4 wt%的情况，研究揭示了Cr31物种的存在，并且其含量随着铬氧化物负载线性增加。这一发现表明，可以通过控制铬氧化物负载来优化催化剂效率。

6. 研究还指出，铬氧化物的沉积没有导致铝孔堵塞，表明铬氧化物与氧化铝支撑材料之间的兼容性，以及潜在的有效催化活性的可能性。
