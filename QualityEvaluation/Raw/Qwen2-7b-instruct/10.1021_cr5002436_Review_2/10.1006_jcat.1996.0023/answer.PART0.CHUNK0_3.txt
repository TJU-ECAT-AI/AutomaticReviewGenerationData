Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, finding widespread industrial application across various reactions including polymerization, dehydrogenation of paraffins, and oxidation of alcohols. The choice of support material, particularly alumina and zirconia, has influenced catalyst performance due to their distinct properties such as thermal stability and surface acidity. Research efforts have focused on understanding how factors like calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading, and support type affect the nature of chromium species present on the catalyst surface. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have been employed for catalyst characterization. In dehydrogenation of isobutane, the chemical-physical properties of catalysts prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on alumina have been extensively studied. As chromium oxide loading increases, the formation of Cr31 species becomes more pronounced, indicating a shift in the distribution of chromium species on the catalyst surface.

自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，在包括聚合反应、异丁烷脱氢和醇氧化在内的各种反应中找到了广泛的应用。支持材料的选择，尤其是氧化铝和氧化锆，对催化剂性能的影响很大，因为它们具有不同的特性，如热稳定性和表面酸度。研究工作集中在理解温度、铬氧化物负载量和支持类型等因素如何影响催化剂表面的铬物种性质。使用X射线衍射（XRD）和紫外可见近红外漫反射光谱等技术对催化剂进行了表征。在异丁烷脱氢过程中，通过在商业氧化铝上支持不断增加的铬氧化物量来研究催化剂的化学物理性质已经进行了深入的研究。随着铬氧化物负载量的增加，形成Cr31物种的趋势变得更加明显，这表明催化剂表面上铬物种分布的变化。
