Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms contributing to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include polymerization, selective alcohol oxidation, and dehydrogenation of paraffins. Research focuses on improving catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, enhancing promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Despite these advancements, a detailed characterization of industrial-like catalysts has not yet been reported. Comparisons with literature data help visualize the system's dynamics. Techniques such as XRD, UVVisNIR DR spectra, XPS, and BET surface area measurements contribute to understanding catalyst properties. The nature of chromium species varies with increasing chromium oxide content, showing distinct forms like Cr61 and Cr31, with implications for catalytic activity. The presence of grafted Cr61 species indicates their interaction with the alumina support, affecting reaction efficiency and selectivity.
