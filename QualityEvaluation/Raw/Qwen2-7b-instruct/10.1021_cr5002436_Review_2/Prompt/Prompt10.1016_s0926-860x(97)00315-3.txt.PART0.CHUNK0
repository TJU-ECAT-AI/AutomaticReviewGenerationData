Chromia/zirconia catalysts with Cr content exceeding the monolayer.

The samples were characterized by chemical analysis,including carbon monoxide reduction and CrVI extraction with sodium hydroxide or water, and by XRPD, UV-Vis DRS and
ESR. Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters
(ESR b-signal) and a-chromia. The relative abundance of these Cr species was found to be mainly controlled by the specic support employed and the Cr concentration. The catalytic activity in the isobutane dehydrogenation was studied at 723 and 773 K in a ow microreactor. It was found that the activity per total Cr atom was markedly higher for the zirconia-based catalysts compared with the other two systems in all the explored Cr concentration range. That is, the CrOx/ZrO2 interaction maintains its positive effect well beyond the monolayer capacity of this support. Moreover, the catalytic activity correlated with the amount of high-oxidation state chromium (CrVI and CrV), evaluated by the quantity of extractable Cr or by the consumption of carbon monoxide in the catalyst reduction. The larger concentration of mononuclear CrV species on zirconia,conrmed here, is thought to be responsible for the higher activity of the zirconia-based catalysts, through reduction to active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydro- genation, namely propane and isobutane. In these studies the range of chromium concentration was low enough that the active ions were completely dispersed and fully accessible to the reactant, as demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of NO and CO chemisorption [4]. These systems assured good active speciessupport inter- action and allowed the investigation of the inuence Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 257270 *Corresponding author.

P I I S 0 9 2 6 - 8 6 0 X ( 9 7 ) 0 0 3 1 5 - 3 of the support on the activity of chromium. The good dispersion of Cr was obtained through the equilibrium adsorption procedure of preparation, as previously described in Ref. [5]. In particular for the chromia/ zirconia catalysts, the monolayer capacity of zirconia calcined at 6731173 K was experimentally deter- mined to be ca. 2 atoms Cr nm2 of support [6].
In contrast with these low Cr surface concentration systems,chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymeriza- tion; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene.
The latter nds increasingly wide application for the production of methyl- (or ethyl-) tert-butyl ether through reaction with methanol (or ethanol). The demand for these ethers as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline is continuously increasing.
As given above, it was considered worthwhile to extend the studies giving attention to systems with higher loading of chromium, thereby moving towards systems whose surface chemistry approaches that of industrial catalysts. Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading. The present paper reports on the results of this investigation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
2.1.1. Supports
The zirconia support was prepared through preci- pitation by bubbling an ammonia-saturated nitrogen stream into a zirconium oxychloride solution, under vigorous stirring over 20 h at RT (nal pH ca. 10). The precipitate was thoroughly washed until no Cl was found in the solid (no opalescence after addition of a few drops of a silver nitrate solution to the solid dissolved in hot and concentrated HNO3). The soaked paste was dried overnight at 383 K, ground in an agate mortar and then calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h. More details of the zirconia preparation can be found else- where [8].
The g-alumina support was prepared by thermal decomposition at 773 K of bohemite, according to the method of Mc Iver et al. [9]. After grinding,the resulting powder was calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h.
The silica support was obtained starting from a batch of Degussa Aerosil 300. A portion of 75 g of this material was, rstly, contacted with deionized water, thus obtaining a paste of considerably lower volume than the original powder. This paste was then submitted to the following successive steps of thermal treatments in air: 393 K for 2 h; 523 K for 1 h; 573 K for 0.5 h; 773 K overnight. The sample was ground and nally calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h.
2.1.2. Catalysts
The chromium containing samples were prepared by wet impregnation of the support with aliquots of titrated CrO3 solutions. The volume of the impregnat- ing solution was only a little higher than that of the support powder. After impregnation, the thick slurry was slowly dried at 383 K in air, while stirring from time to time, until a solid cake was obtained. After overnight drying at 383 K, the solid was ground and nally calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h.
The catalysts are designated as ZC x, AC x and SC x for chromia/zirconia, chromia/alumina and chromia/ silica, respectively, where x represents the analytical Cr content as wt% of the sample.
A sample of a-Cr2O3 was prepared by adding 150 ml of a 1.0 M ammonia solution to 700 ml of a
0.071 M chromium nitrate solution for 0.5 h [10]. The
resulting gel was washed with deionized water, dried at 333 K for 24 h and heated in hydrogen at 653 K for 3 h. The ground sample was then calcined in air at 773 K for 15 h.
All chemicals used were of reagent grade.
2.2. Surface area and pore size distribution
BET surface area measurement and pore size distribution (BrunauerMikhailBodor method) [11] were determined by static adsorption of N2 at 77 K. 258

2.3. Chemical analysis
The chemical analysis was carried out by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a Varian Spec- tra-A 30 spectrophotometer.
The ZC samples were dissolved with 2 ml of 50 wt% HF solution, except the most concentrated ones which required fusion with KHSO4. Also the AC catalysts were dissolved with 2 ml of 50 wt% HF solution, except the most concentrated ones for which fusion with alkali mixture (KNO3Na2CO3 1 : 1 by weight) was employed. All the SC samples were dissolved using the alkali mixture. For each sample a nominal concentration solution of 46 ppm of Cr was nally obtained through subsequent dilutions.
Standard solutions, in the range 28 ppm of Cr,were prepared by dilution of a 200 ppm solution obtained by dissolving K2Cr2O7 in deionized water.
An amount of dissolved support comparable with that present in the sample solutions was added to the standard solutions.
2.4. CrVI determination
The amount of CrVI present on the surface of the sample after calcination at 973 K was estimated by extraction with 10 ml of a 10 M sodium hydroxide solution (deionized water for SC samples to avoid the dissolution of support) at about 333 K. The amount extracted was determined by either AAS or UV spec- troscopy (absorbance at 350 nm). The two methods gave comparable results. The residual Cr was deter- mined by AAS analysis of the solid after extraction,dissolved as indicated above (see under chemical analysis). The sum of the residual and extracted Cr was generally within 5% of the analytical Cr content of the sample.
2.5. Phase analysis
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra for phase analysis were recorded by means of a computer-con- trolled Philips PW 1729 diffractometer, using Ni- ltered CuK radiation.
2.6. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)
Spectra were recorded at room temperature in the range 200<<2500 nm with a UV-Vis-NIR Varian Cary 5E spectrophotometer using HALON1 as refer- ence.
2.7. Electron spin resonance (ESR)
The samples were introduced into small silica tubes (O.D.4 mm) and placed in the resonant cavity of a Varian E-9 spectrometer working at X band. ESR spectra were recorded at both room temperature and 353 K, using the B-ST 100/700 Bruker variable tem- perature control unit. Varian strong pitch (spin linear density 31015 spin cm1) and a sample of pure a- Cr2O3 were used as standards for a semiquantitative estimate of CrV and CrIII, respectively.
2.8. Catalytic activity measurements
2.8.1. Catalysis line
The apparatus designed for activity measurements in ow and for catalyst conditioning (ow, circulation or static) has already been described in Ref. [12].
Catalytic tests were carried out in a laboratory, tub- ular-ow silica reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typi- cal tests were run with 0.5 g of catalyst as a powder at reaction temperatures 723 and 773 K, a feed composi- tion of 5 mol% isobutane/N2 and a total ow-rate of 100 cm3 min1 at STP. The analysis of reactants and products was carried out by gas chromatography (C.Erba GC 6000 Vega Series 2 gas-chromatograph,coupled with an integrator C. Erba Mega Series).
C1C4 parafns and olens were analyzed with a Chrompack Plot column (internal diameter
0.53 mm, length 50 m, coating 10 mm Na2SO4-doped
Al2O3) held at 403 K, and a ame ionization detector (FID). H2 was analyzed with a column (internal diameter 4 mm, length 2 m) packed with silica gel (6080 mesh) operating at room temperature, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.8.2. Procedure for activity measurements
The fresh catalyst was submitted to a dry oxygen ow at 773 K for 0.5 h (standard oxidation, s.o.). The sample was then cooled at 373 K and outgassed for
0.5 h at this temperature. After heating at 623 K, a
known amount of CO was circulated over the catalyst at about 65 mbar. A pressure decrease was observed since the produced CO2 was condensed in a cold trap (T77 K) placed at the exit of the reactor. The pres-
S. De Rossi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 257270
259 sure decrease was followed (MKS Baratron transdu- cer, sensitivity 1 Pa) until no appreciable difference was found between readings at 10 min intervals. Gen- erally this did not take more than 45 min. From the nal pressure, the amount of the unreacted CO was evaluated by means of calibration factors, and even- tually the amount of CO consumed in the catalyst reduction was determined. The reduced catalyst was thereafter outgassed at 723 K through the cold trap for
0.5 h. The total amount of CO2 released was then
evaluated by measuring its pressure after expansion in a calibrated volume. This quantity was generally found to be 1015 mol% lower than the amount of CO consumed in the reduction. This discrepancy,already observed in previous studies of chromia-sup- ported systems [5], was explained as due to a fraction of adsorbed CO during reduction and/or strongly held carbonate species which do not desorb under evacua- tion at 723 K. We chose to base the following calcula- tions on the amount of CO2 released, because previous work suggested that this quantity allows more reliable estimates of the reducibility term e/Cr, representing the number of electrons exchanged in the reduction per Cr atom.
After passing a nitrogen ow for 5 min, a stream of 5 mol% isobutane in nitrogen was allowed to ow at 100 cm3 min1 at STP and 1 bar over the catalyst at 723 K, thereby starting a catalysis run. The activity was generally measured at time intervals of 10 min for ca. 1 h. After that, the catalyst was purged with owing nitrogen, while raising the temperature to 773 K, and an s.o. treatment was carried out again.
Finally, after 10 min purging with nitrogen, a catalysis run at 773 K was performed without catalyst pre- reduction. In fact, previous studies on similar chro- mium-based catalysts [13] and preliminary tests on the samples examined in the present investigation showed that the reactant mixture at T773 K was so effective in catalyst reduction as to make any CO pretreatment unnecessary.
The mass balance for carbon and hydrogen, con- version and selectivity to isobutene were calculated as already specied [2]. Taking into account the coke- formation rate, we evaluated a value of 98100% for the mass balance for carbon.
The dehydrogenation rates, r, were calculated as molecules of isobutene produced per second assuming differential conditions since 20% of the equilibrium conversion was generally not exceeded. In fact, fairly good proportionality was found in our conditions between conversion and reciprocal ow in the range 50200 cm3 min1 at STP.
An activity decay with time-on-stream was observed, as in the previous studies. Therefore, an identical way to express the catalyst activity was adopted. For all catalysts, in fact, the relation: ln r ln r0t, where  is a deactivation coefcient and t the time-on-stream, satisfactorily tted the experi- mental points. By extrapolation to t0, the adopted representative value of the activity of a given catalyst,r0, could be calculated. We would underline that the dehydrogenation rate, indicated as r in the following for ease, actually refers to the extrapolated value r0.
3. Results
3.1. Textural analysis of the supports
The nitrogen physisorption isotherms at 77 K of either zirconia or g-alumina or silica (all calcined at 973 K) are of type IV according to the BDDT classi- cation [13], as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, they all display type A hysteresis, according to De Boer [14],indicating the presence of prevailingly cylindrical mesopores. Analysis of the desorption branch of the hysteresis loop following the BrunauerMikhail Bodor method [11] leads to the textural features Fig. 1.

reported in Table 1. In this table, the surface area values determined using the t-plot method according to Lippens and De Boer [15] are also reported. It is apparent that there is some contribution of micropores to both pore volume and surface area for silica, but not for zirconia and g-alumina.
3.2. Catalyst characterization
Table 2 lists the catalysts investigated with some of their features. It is stressed that the apparent surface density (ASD) of Cr, given by the (total number of Cr atoms of the sample)/(surface area of the sample) ratio, represents the true surface density of Cr only in the dilute catalysts (i.e. Cr loading below the saturation value). However, it remains an useful para- meter to express the Cr loading on the surface area of the sample.
3.2.1. X-ray powder diffraction
The diffraction spectra of the pure supports and selected ZC, AC and SC catalysts are shown in the Figs. 24, respectively.
Concerning the ZC samples, XRPD only shows the diffraction pattern of monoclinic zirconia with the exception of the most concentrated sample ZC 6.34 where the diffraction lines of a-Cr2O3 (marked with an asterisk) are also visible.
For the AC samples, segregation of a-Cr2O3 is apparent only on the most concentrated sample AC
11.1, whereas for SC samples a-chromia segregation
can be observed starting already from sample SC 0.88 and increasingly as the Cr loading increases.
3.2.2. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
The UVVIS region for the ZC, AC and SC samples is shown in Figs. 57, respectively, where the spec- trum of a-chromia is also reported for reference.

261 region is diagnostic for the presence of CrVI as chro- mate (tetrahedral coordination) and CrIII in octahedral symmetry [1618]. In fact, in the charge transfer region, two bands at 260280 nm and 370 380 nm are characteristic of the presence of CrVI. A third, but weak, band at 450470 nm also origi- nates from chromate ions. It is symmetry forbidden in the Td coordination and its detectability depends upon the distortion of the chromate anchored to the surface.
Two bands at 450465 nm and 580600 nm, due to the A2g!T1g and A2g!T2g transitions of CrIII in octahedral symmetry, respectively, are diagnostic of Fig. 2.

the presence of the latter species. It is apparent that on both zirconia (with the exception of the most con- centrated ZC 6.34 sample) and g-alumina, CrVI is the prevailing Cr species, whereas the bands attributable to CrIII in octahedral symmetry dominate the spectrum of the SC samples starting from SC 0.88, in agreement with the XRPD results presented above.
3.2.3. Electron spin resonance (ESR)
Previous studies have shown that the following oxidation states of Cr can be revealed by ESR on the supports under investigation: CrV, 3d1 congura- tion, S1/2 and CrIII, 3d3 conguration, S3/2. Crys- talline a-Cr2O3 gives rise to a characteristic signal only at T>307 K (Ne el temperature). Therefore, a feature which is absent in the spectrum below (actually RT) and present above (we adopted 353 K) the Ne el temperature clearly indicates the presence of a-chro- mia crystals.
3.2.3.1. ZC system. In all the samples a strong axial
signal (gk1.960, g?1.979) due to magnetically isolated CrV species is detected (g-signal). The features of this signal have already been described in detail [1921]. It has been shown that it arises from surface mononuclear magnetically isolated CrV species in square pyramidal symmetry. The g-signal intensity is proportional to CrV ions only in very dilute samples. In fact, as the concentration increases, the number of magnetically interacting CrV species,which do not contribute to the g-signal intensity,increases.
In the more dilute samples,when quantitative analysis is possible, CrV amounts to ca. 50% of the total chromium, in agreement with previous findings [1921]. As the Cr concentration increases, a broad and symmetric band (g1.98, Hpp15001800 G) develops, due to CrIII oxide clusters of small dimensions, which have Ne el temperature below room temperature. The spectra of most concentrated samples recorded at 353 K show a lorentzian line (g1.98, Hpp480500 G) characteristic of crystalline a-chromia, which is absent in the spectrum recorded at room temperature.
3.2.3.2. AC system. The features of the signal due to
CrV on alumina, arising from mononuclear species in square pyramidal configuration, has been discussed previously [20,21]. The intensity of the signal is always weak and represents 12% of the total chromium. As the Cr concentration increases, two broad signals related to CrIII species are observed:the d-signal with a broad maximum centered at g'2.2,due to isolated CrIII species and the b-signal, due to CrIII oxide clusters of small dimensions. Exposure of the sample to oxygen at 773 K does not substantially influence the d-signal [3]. The apparent g value and the shape of the d-signal is very similar to that arising from CrIII species in solid solution with #-alumina [22]. This suggests the assignment of d-signal to isolated CrIII species diffusing for some layers into the support during the high temperature calcination.On increasing the Cr concentration, the signal of the crystalline a-chromia appears on the spectra recorded at 353 K.
3.2.3.3. SC system. Only a weak signal due to CrV is
observed, close to the detectability limit, due to very small amount of CrV species in octahedral symmetry.
Most of CrV, however not exceeding a few percent of total chromium, is in tetrahedral symmetry and not visible at room temperature, whereas it is at 77 K on dry samples [20,23]. The a-chromia signal at 353 K is already detected on sample SC 0.88, in agreement with XRPD and DRS data.
A summary of the results from XRPD, DRS and ESR is reported in Table 3.
3.2.4. Chemical analysis of CrVI
While CrVI is totally extracted with sodium hydro- xide (water in the case of SC) [5,16], the chromium chemistry suggests that CrV, not stable in aqueous Fig. 7. DRS spectra of representative SC samples. Some spectra have been vertically shifted for clarity. (a) SC 0.09; (b) SC 0.33; (c) SC 0.88; (d) SC 1.80; (e) SC 10.8; (f) a-Cr2O3 as reference.

263 solution, disproportionates during extraction accord- ing to the reaction: 3 CrV!2 CrVICrIII. The amount of CrVI extracted should, therefore, include 2/3 of the CrV originally present on the surface. This should be taken into account especially for the dilute ZC cata- lysts, for which the present ESR results, in agreement with previous data [19], indicates that about one half of the chromium is present as CrV and the remaining half as CrVI. According to this view, the amount of extracted chromium on ZC samples underestimates the sum CrVI plus CrV originally present, 1/3 of CrV probably being retained on the surface as nely dis- persed CrIII hydroxide.
Fig. 8 illustrates the results of the CrVI extraction from all the examined catalysts, except sample ZC
6.34 (Crextr/Crtot0.034) which is out of the X scale. It
is noted that, on dilute specimens, Cr is almost totally extractable on all supports. Nevertheless, as the appar- ent Cr surface density increases, the Cr extractable fraction decreases in a different way for the three different systems. Specically, the drop is steeper for SC than AC and ZC.
3.2.5. Catalyst reducibility
The (number of electrons)/(total number of Cr atoms) ratio, e/Cr, evaluated from the CO2 released after the sample reduction with CO (see under Experi- mental), gives a measure of the reducibility of chro- mium on a given catalyst. This parameter, in its turn,gives an estimate of the fraction of total chromium which can be reduced, that is the fraction of Cr in a high-oxidation state, namely CrVI and CrV.
The trend of the reducibility for ZC, AC and SC as a function of the apparent surface density of Cr is shown in Fig. 9. The e/Cr value for the sample ZC 6.34 (not shown) is 0.17. The similarity with trends for the extractable Cr fraction (compare Figs. 8 and 9) is noteworthy. Again, the steepness of the curves decreases in the order: SCAC>ZC.
3.3. Isobutane dehydrogenation
The initial activity per gram of chromium (or per total Cr atom) decreases as the Cr loading increases, Table 3 Summary of the results of the characterization by X-ray powder diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electron spin resonance Sample

as expected. The way in which this occurs for the three systems examined is shown for the reaction temperatures

(Fig. 10a) and 773 K (Fig. 10b). It can be noted that: (i) the activity of the ZC system is considerably higher than those of both AC and SC systems; (ii) in the whole range investigated the activity decreases by a factor of about four for the ZC and AC systems;(iii) the activity of the SC system is similar to that of AC, at very low Cr loading, but it steeply decreases as the apparent surface density of Cr increases.
4. Discussion
The decrease of the dehydrogenation rate per gram of Cr could be due to the decrease of the fraction of the accessible chromium and/or to the different activity of various accessible Cr species. The catalyst character- ization, presented above, has shown that: (i) different Cr species are present on the calcined catalysts and (ii) their relative amount is a function of the loading and of the nature of the support.
This study has found evidence for the following Cr species:(i) dispersed Cr species maintained in a high- oxidation state by the interaction with the support.
These are essentially CrVI with minor amounts of CrV on g-alumina and silica; CrVI and CrV in comparable amounts on zirconia. These high oxidation Cr species dominate at low Cr loading.
(ii) isolated CrIII species responsible for the ESR d-signal. Among the calcined samples, these species were detected only on g-alumina. They are most probably CrIII ions which have diffused in subsurface layers and, therefore,should not be involved in the catalytic action.
(iii) small CrIII clusters responsible for the ESR b- signal. These CrIII species are detected at medium-high Cr concentrations on zirconia and g-alumina.

265 (iv) crystalline a-chromia present in the most concentrated samples. The Cr loading at which a-chromia starts to appear greatly depends on the support, silica being the one on which this loading is the lowest.
A plausible picture of the calcined sample can be attempted by tentatively hypothesizing what takes place during the heating process.
It is known that CrO3 decomposes at relatively low temperatures to give the more stable a-Cr2O3 oxide.
Therefore, at increasing temperature, only a fraction of initial Cr, strongly interacting with the support,retains the VI oxidation state (actually VI and V,especially in the case of the zirconia support) and forms a surface chromate. If the initial CrVI exceeds this amount, one would expect that the excess decom- poses to give the more stable a-chromia, which is known to undergo extreme sintering at our calcination temperature (973 K). The fact that CrIII species, other than a-chromia, are found points again to an inter- vention of the support. CrIII species giving rise to the ESR d-signal are linked to the ability of the alumina support to dissolve some CrIII. As for CrIII species detected as the ESR b-signal, one can speculate their origin from Cr less strongly interacting with the support than the Cr leading to surface chromate.
The interaction of this fraction of chromium would be strong enough to prevent segregation of large a- chromia crystallites, but not so strong to hinder aggre- gation into small CrIII oxide clusters on the surface of the support.
The above picture is rendered more complex if one considers the dynamic evolution that takes place upon high temperature treatment. Whereas a-Cr2O3 is not likely to spread over the surface, it is nevertheless possible that, at some stage of the calcination in air,chromia particles not sufciently grown and still in contact with the support undergo oxidation to CrO3, and subsequently spread because of the much lower surface tension. Cr dispersed species are thus formed.
Interestingly, silica has a particular behaviour in this respect. Our results show that this support is able to strongly retain an amount (small, if compared to its large surface area) of Cr as CrVI but if this amount is exceeded, the excess gives rise to large a-chromia particles, in agreement with published results [16].Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [1 3] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content;(ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC; (iii) the turnover frequency per Cr atom for AC and SC was comparable to that of a-chromia, provided that in this latter case only the surface Cr atoms were taken into account (specically, the value 10.84 atoms nm2, from crys- tallographic data [24], was used for a-chromia).

In the present case, where higher Cr loadings are considered, condition (i) is no longer valid, whereas result (ii) still holds.
Fig. 11 illustrates point (i) in the case of the ZC system, including data for both present concentrated samples (represented as circles) and the previous diluted samples (as squares), so as to show the trend in all the range of Cr loading investigated. It is noted that the proportionality range extends to about 2 3 atoms Cr nm2, then a downward bending of the curve is observed, which nevertheless remains above the points representing the activity of a-chromia.
The search for the species mainly responsible for the activity of the ZC catalysts, in the whole range investigated, should take into consideration the fact that the higher activity of Cr on zirconia compared with the other supports and a-chromia is necessarily related to an interaction with the support. Attention should, therefore, be focused on the Cr species strongly interacting with the support and, above all,on the high-oxidation state Cr species.
It ought to be stressed that these species cannot be the active species, because they denitely undergo reduction in the working condition. These species could nevertheless be the precursors of the species active during the catalyst functioning.
4.1. Quantification of the high-oxidation state Cr
species A quantitative estimate of the amount of these species, dispersed on the surface of the support and strongly interacting with it, has been carried out by using either the NaOH extraction method or a method based on the CO reduction at 623 K. It is important to check the correlation between the estimates obtained with the two methods.
Before carrying out this check, it would be useful to introduce the term XCr(hos), representing the fraction of Cr in a high-oxidation state and dened as the (sum of CrVI and CrV)/(total Cr) ratio. This quantity does not coincide with the fraction of extractable Cr, because only 2/3 of the CrV are supposedly extracted as CrVI (see above). Allowance for this fact is particularly important in the ZC case, where half of the high- oxidation state Cr is CrVI and the remaining half is CrV. For AC and SC samples allowance for the fraction of CrV is less important, because it represents about 8 and 2% of the high-oxidation state Cr, respectively [3,1921,23,25].
The hypothesis regarding the dissolution step leads to: XCrextr  Crextr Crtot CrVI  2=3CrV Crtot Indicating with Cr(hos)CrVICrV the total amount of Cr in a high-oxidation state, and with
X0
CrV and X0 CrVI the fractions of Cr in a high-oxidation state present as CrV and CrVI, respectively, that is
X0
CrV  CrV=CrVI  CrV and
X0
CrVI  CrVI=CrVI CrV  1  X0 CrV,we can write: CrVI  Crhos
1  X0
CrV and CrV  CrhosX0 CrV. Therefore: XCrextr  Crextr Crtot Crhos1  X0 CrV  2=3X0 CrV Crtot Crhos1  1=3X0 CrV Crtot Recalling that Cr(hos)/CrtotXCr(hos) we nally obtain: XCrextr  XCrhos1  1=3X0 CrV or XCrhos XCrextr=1  1=3X0 CrV It is then possible to calculate the fraction of the total Cr which is in a high-oxidation state by knowing the fraction extractable of the total Cr and the fraction of the high-oxidation state Cr which is present as CrV.
For X0 CrV we adopted the values 0.50, 0.08 and 0.02 for ZC, AC and SC, respectively.
The correlation between catalyst reducibility and Cr in a high-oxidation state is shown in Fig. 12, where the (number of electron exchanged)/(total number of Cr atoms) ratio is plotted vs. the (number of Cr atoms in a high oxidation state)/(total number of Cr atoms) ratio, XCr(hos). This plot is equivalent to a plot reporting the number of electron exchanged vs. the number of high- oxidation state Cr atoms. Fig. 12 has the advantage of employing a normalized abscissa (eld: 01).
A correlation of direct proportionality is repre- sented by the straight line passing through the origin which best ts (least square method) the experimental points. It is apparent that this correlation is very good for the ZC system, while it is still acceptable for the AC and SC systems.
The slope of the lines in Fig. 12(ac) represents the number of electrons exchanged per high-oxidation state Cr atom. Therefore, the values of the slope can be compared with reasonable reduction processes

267 of the high-oxidation state Cr on the various supports.
The simplest case is that of the SC samples. It is well established that silica essentially stabilizes CrVI spe- cies (ca. 98%) which transforms to CrII species when submitted to CO reduction at 623 K. The slope of the line in Fig. 12(c) is about 4 electrons per high-oxida- tion state Cr atom, a value practically coincident with that expected for the reduction processes: 0.98 CrVI3.92 e!0.98 CrII and
0.02
CrV0.06 e!
0.02 CrII.
With regard to the AC system, about 92% of the high-oxidation state Cr is present as CrVI and the remaining as CrV. Moreover, a previous study [3] has suggested that the reduction with CO at 623 K substantially stops at the stage of CrIII. The value of the slope of the line in Fig. 12(b) is 3.1 electrons per high-oxidation state Cr atom, not far from the value expected for the reduction processes: 0.92 CrVI
2.76 e!0.92 CrIII and 0.08 CrV0.16 e!0.08 CrIII.
Regarding the ZC systems previous work [19],essentially by ESR and gas volumetric redox cycles,has shown that CrVI and CrV in comparable amounts are stabilized on the zirconia surface when treated at high temperatures in an oxidizing atmosphere. These chromium species transform to CrII and CrIII again in comparable amount upon reduction with CO at 623 K (the presence of two redox couples CrVI/CrII and CrV/ CrIII was suggested on zirconia) [5,19]. In other words,the reduction leads from an average initial oxidation state of 5.5 to an average nal oxidation state of 2.5,therefore involving 3 electron per Cr atom. The slope of the line reported in Fig. 12(a) is 3.4 electrons. This value is higher than expected, but the agreement can still be considered fair by taking into account both experimental errors and higher amounts of CrII in the nal state.
The substantial agreement between the values of the slopes in Fig. 12 and the expected number of electrons exchanged in the reduction processes adds further condence to our view that either method gives a reliable estimate of the high-oxidation state Cr strongly interacting with the support.
4.2. Catalytic activity and high-oxidation state Cr
species We have shown that CO reduction and NaOH (water in case of SC samples) extraction are equally capable of measuring the amount of high-oxidation state Cr.
One can therefore use either method to give an esti- mate of this amount. Nevertheless, we chose to employ the method based on extraction, because the nal state in this method is supposedly the same for all investigated systems.
Fig. 13 shows the correlation between activity at 773 K and XCr(hos). The gure reports the (dehydro- genation rate)/(total number Cr atoms) ratio vs. (num- ber of Cr atoms in a high oxidation state)/(total number of Cr atoms) ratio. This representation is equivalent to a plot showing the dehydrogenation rate vs. total number of Cr atoms in a high-oxidation state.
Fig. 13 parallels Fig. 12 and again employs a plot with a normalized abscissa (eld: 01).
It is apparent that fairly good direct proportionality correlations are found, not only for the ZC, but also for the AC and SC systems (R0.96, 0.97 and 0.97,respectively). The slope of the straight lines, repre- senting the best t of the experimental points with the constraint of crossing the axis origin, gives the average Fig. 12. Catalyst reducibility, e/Cr, as a function of the fraction of the high oxidation state chromium. (a) ZC; (b) AC; and (c) SC. 268

(dehydrogenation rate)/(number of Cr atoms in a high- oxidation state) ratio, that is the average turnover frequency per high-oxidation state Cr atom.
The turnover frequency values for ZC, AC and SC are 0.030, 0.0033 and 0.0024 molecules s1 (high- oxidation state Cr atom)1,respectively (see Fig. 13(ac)). The corresponding turnover frequency values for dilute samples were 0.020, 0.0022 and
0.0020 molecules s1 (total Cr atom)1 for ZC, AC
and SC, respectively [2].
One can observe that the reported differences are not particularly large (50%) and might simply be explained in terms of experimental errors. It is noted,however, that the discrepancies are always in the same direction. In fact, the turnover frequency estimate of the concentrated samples is always higher than that of the dilute catalysts.
This could suggest some underestimation of the amount of active chromium in the case of concentrated samples. One could then hypothesize some minor contribution to the activity of the exposed CrIII of the small clusters giving rise to the ESR b-signal. The similarity of the turnover frequency values for diluted and concentrated SC samples, where there is no evidence of CrIII in small clusters but only of large a-chromia particles starting from
0.8
Cr wt% onwards, could be indicative in this respect. Recently,in a study of isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/ alumina catalysts, Cavani et al. [17] suggested that amorphous CrIII species present in the fresh catalyst display higher activity compared to CrIII coming from reduction of different CrVI species.
The correlation shown in Fig. 13 indicates that the high-oxidation state Cr species interacting with the support are involved as the precursor species respon- sible for the activity of the working catalyst. More- over, the much higher activity (about one order of magnitude) of the ZC compared with AC, SC and a- chromia systems strongly suggests that the Cr species dispersed on the zirconia support and interacting with its surface are of greater importance than the segre- gated a-chromia particles. As we did when discussing the activity of the dilute ZC catalysts [2], we would like to draw attention to the mononuclear CrV species,giving rise to the ESR g-signal, the abundance of which is characteristic of the zirconia support. We suggest that the high activity of the ZC system is related to the high amount of these CrV species,precursors of the mononuclear CrIII species respon- sible for the activity of the working catalyst.
5. Conclusions
The present investigation has examined structural and catalytic properties of numerous chromia/zirco- nia, chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica catalysts,covering a wide range of Cr concentration. This study allows some nal conclusion to be drawn:(i) several Cr species are present on the surface of the investigated catalysts in amounts depending on the specific support and Cr concentration.
(ii) the dehydrogenation activity per total Cr atom is substantially higher for zirconia-based catalysts than for g-alumina- and silica-based ones.
(iii) a proportionality is found between activity and high-oxidation state Cr, thus indicating the in- Fig. 13. Dehydrogenation rate per total Cr atom at 773 K as a function of the fraction of the high oxidation state chromium.

269 volvement of high-oxidation state Cr species in generating the catalytic activity.
(iv) the higher activity per high-oxidation state Cr atom of the zirconia-based system is thought to be related to the higher concentration on zirconia of mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to the active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.
(v) the practical application of the chromia/ zirconia system, as dehydrogenation catalyst, relies upon the stabilization of high surface area ZrO2 at the working temperature. This stabilization would necessarily involve some changes in the surface properties of zirconia. The goal would be to obtain this stabilization without altering the positive Cr support interaction, which is beneficial for the catalytic activity.
