I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

SOLVING STRUCTURES
WITHOUT CRYSTALS
Method provides structural solutions to materials lacking long-range order
S
YNTHESIZE A NEW SOLID-
state compound, and mod- ern crystallography methods usually can help solve the material's atomic structure, provided that samples of the material are available in the form of bulk crystals, even small ones. But for nanoparticles and other materials that lack long- range order, detenniningstnictures is challenging because crystallogra- phy methods aren't applicable.UNDER CONSTRUCTION A new method builds up structures of crystallographically inaccessible clusters (C60 in this example) through an iterative process that's based on ranking the agreement between experimental and theoretical structure data.Light-colored atoms indicate large error.A new computational method,though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have devel- oped a numerical procedure for de- termining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neu- tron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples.According to the researchers, the method may enable structures to be solved with subangstrom reso- lution even when crystallographic methods fail.
"Knowing the structure of a material is a prerequisite to under- standing its properties,,, says Simon
J. L. Billinge, a professor of
physics at Michigan State University, East Lansing. Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography.

Drug Companies Push Into Central Europe
S
anof i-Aventis and Ranbaxy Laboratories are the latest pharmaceutical companies to make acquisitions in the fast-growing Cen- tral European generic drugs business.
Paris-based Sanofi has spent about $516 mil- lion to acquire a 24.9% interest in the Czech ge- nerics company Zentiva. Sanofi bought most of the stake from Warburg Pincus, which invested in one of Zentiva's predecessor firms in 1998, and the rest from current and former Zentiva employees.Sanofi, which is now Zentiva's largest share- holder, calls the purchase "a strategic move in the development of Sanof i-Aventis in Central and Eastern Europe." Zentiva was formed in August 2003 by the merger of Lciva and Slovakofarma,the largest drug companies in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, respectively. Zentiva had sales last year of close to $500 million, up 11% over 2004.Meanwhile, India's Ranbaxy will pay Advent International $324 million for a 97% stake in Terapia, Romania's largest manufacturer and dis- tributor of generic pharmaceuticals. With annu- al sales of about $80 million, Terapia markets almost 160 products and operates two finished- dosage manufacturing sites in Romania.Advent, a Boston-based private equity firm,bought a 91% stake in Terapia in August 2003 for $44 million. Ranbaxy says Terapia has the know- how to prepare generics marketing requests to European Union standards. This capability will promote Ranbaxy's business throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union, the firm adds.The two deals follow an unsolicited $1.6 billion bid by Iceland's Actavis for the Croatian generics maker Pliva (C&EN, March 27, page 9). Pliva had sales last year of $1.2 billion.-MICHAEL M

AND JEAN-FRANOIS TREMBLAY
State developed a computational technique for building up cluster structures one atom at a time using readily available high-resolution dif- fraction data. The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histo- gram that indicates howmany atom pairs share a particular spacing.
To build up structures, the algo- rithm "positions" a small number of atoms in a cluster and then com- pares the distance list derived from the computer-generated cluster with an experimentally measured list. Distance values obtained from other computer-generated clusters of the same size are also compared with the experimental data. The theoretical cluster that matches the experimental data most closely "wins" that round and is promoted to the next level, where structures of clusters with one additional at- om are once again ranked accord- ing to the closeness of the match with experimental data {Nature 2006,440,655).Billinge explains that the pro- cedure was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation (down- grading) that are used to rank teams in European soccer leagues,such as La Liga in Spain.Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs. The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations.In a commentary in the same issue of Nature, John J. Rehr, a physics professor at the Univer- sity of Washington, remarks that "aperiodic materials are among the technologically most interest- ing nanoscale materials currently under study. The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."MITCH

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
