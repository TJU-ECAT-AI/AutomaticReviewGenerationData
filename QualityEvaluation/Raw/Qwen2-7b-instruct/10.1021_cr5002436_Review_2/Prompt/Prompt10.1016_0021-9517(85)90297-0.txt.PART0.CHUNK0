HELI J. LUGOANDJACK

Department of Chemistv, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843 Received May 31, 1984; revised September 1, 1984 The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium supported on silica gel has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements. Low nuclear&y A- type chromium(I1) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. Higher dehydration temperatures increased the concentration of active A-type chro- mium(H) ions. The apparent activation energy was the same for different dehydration tempera- tures, which indicates that the number but not the type of site changed upon dehydration at elevated temperatures. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites were selectively poisoned by carbo- naceous deposits during the dehydrogenation of ethane. Turnover frequencies, based on the calcu- lated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiOZ, Cr/A1201, and o-CrZOs, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state. o 1985 Academic Press, Inc
INTRODUCTION
Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the de- hydrogenation of alkanes.
Numerous at- tempts have been made to identify the ac- tive site. Chromium(I1) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investi- gators (l-3),although Cr(II1) has also been proposed (2, 4-6). Ashmawy (2) evaluated ethane dehydrogenation over chromium- alumina catalysts,and proposed that both Cr(I1) and Cr(II1) are active for the reac- tion, although Cr(I1) is the more active ion.
Konig and Tetenyi (4) have studied the de- hydrogenation of ethane on a-Cr203,and have identified coordinatively unsaturated Cr(II1) ions as the active sites.
The nuclearity of the active sites has also been investigated.
From an infrared study of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide ad- sorbed on chromia/alumina, Peri (7) has provided evidence for isolated and paired Cr(I1) ions. He suggested that paired Cr(I1) ions may be needed for hydrocarbon dehy- drogenation and dehydrocyclization.
Zec- china et al. (8) claim that dichromate groups are mainly formed on the surface of Cr03/Si02 catalysts after calcination in flowing Oz. These dichromate species pro- duce pairs of Cr(I1) ions after reduction in
CO. McDaniel
(9), however,argues that the data can equally well be interpreted as evidence for the formation of surface chro- mate ions.
Probe molecules such as carbon monox- ide and nitric oxide provide insight into the oxidation state and available coordmation sites of supported metal ions. Of particular interest in the present study were carbonyl complexes which form when CO is ad- sorbed on a fully reduced surface of chro- mium on silica gel. Recently, Garrone and co-workers (10-12) have proposed that car- bony1 bands at 2182 and 2192 cm-l are due to Cr(I1) ions coordinated to 2 and 3 oxygen atoms of the surface, respectively.
These divalent chromium ions are labelled A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions,respec- tively. The evidence from the present study suggests that the coordinatively unsatu- rated A-type chromium(I1) ions,which result in the carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l,are responsible for ethane dehydrogena- tion. Emphasis in this study was placed on silica as a support because of its favorable 155 0021-951760 $3.00 Copyright 0 1985 hy Academic Press, Inc.

transmission in the infrared region, and be- cause the various forms of Cr(I1) on silica are reasonably well understood.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials.
The Cr03 employed in this study was MCB guaranteed grade and the a-Cr20j and CrC& * 6H20 were Fisher Sci- entific certified grade. Davison grade 57 sil- ica gel and Conoco Catapal SB grade alu- mina were used as supports.
The NaY zeolite was supplied by Union Carbide.
All of the gases used in this study, with the exception of the He (AIRCO),were purchased from Matheson.
Carbon monox- ide (ultra-high purity grade) and helium (high purity grade) were further purified by passing through an oxygen scavenger prior to use. Oxygen was extra dry grade and was used as received.
Nitric oxide and eth- ane (C.P. grade) were purified by repeated vacuum distillation at the freezing point of n-pentane (- 135C). Water impurities in the gases were removed by passing them through a silica-gel trap. Liquid water was purified by using the freeze-pump-thaw technique.
Sample preparation.
Silica-supported chromium(V1) catalysts were prepared by impregnating the silica gel with chromic acid solutions.
The silica gel was washed in HCl,dried in air at 140C and calcined in flowing O2 at 500C. Typically 10 g of SiOz was mixed with 25 ml of Hz0 which con- tained the appropriate amount of Cr. The resulting concentrations were 0.1, 0.26,
0.52, 1
.O, and 2.1 wt% Cr, as determined by standard chemical methods.
Similarly,an alumina-supported chromium(V1) catalyst was prepared by impregnating alumina with chromic acid solution.
The resulting con- centration was 0.50 wt% Cr.
A sample of CrY was prepared from a NaY zeolite by aqueous ion exchange with a solution of CtQ.
The solution was stirred at 25C for 12 h. The zeolite was then separated from the solution by filter- ing, repeatedly rinsed with deionized
HZO,
and finally dried at 100C. The zeolite cata- lyst was stored in a hygrostat over a satu- rated ammonium nitrate solution.
The re- sulting chromium concentration was 0.50 wt%.
Spectroscopic methods.
Infrared (ir) spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer Model 580 spectrophotometer.
The spectra were recorded with the sample at room temperature.
Samples were prepared by grinding the catalyst to a powder and press- ing it into wafers, typically 10 mg cmm2.
Samples were pretreated in a Vycor cell fit- ted with KC1 windows.
Catalytic studies. Initial rates for ethane dehydrogenation were determined in a re- circulation reactor. The gases were recircu- lated using a Pyrex pump which had a maxi- mum pumping speed of 300 cm3/min.
The total volume of the recirculation system was 315 cm3. Gas samples from the kinetic studies were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph.
The sampling volume was l/l25 of the total volume of the system. The temperature in the reactor was monitored using a subminiature chromel-alumel ther- mocouple placed outside,but touching the middle section of the reactor.
These tem- peratures were corrected to those of the catalyst bed.
A 50 mg sample of catalysts (20-42 mesh) was placed in a U-tube reactor.
The cata- lysts were dehydrated in vacua, oxidized in O2 (200 Tort) and reduced in CO (50 Tot-r).
The oxidation step was omitted with the CrY zeolite.
After this pretreatment,the dehydrogenation of ethane was carried out.
The partial pressure of ethylene were moni- tored as a function of time, and the initial rate of reaction was determined by a nu- merical method.
The experimental data were fitted to a function with a maximum degree of smoothness by using a natural cu- bic spline interpolation method.
The initial rate of reaction was determined from the first derivative of the spline function in the first data interval.
The deactivation and reactivation studies of the catalysts were conducted using a flow system. Gas samples taken during the

flow experiments were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph.
The chromium catalysts (ca. 0.5 g, 0.5 wt% Cr) were dehy- drated in uucuo at the appropriate tempera- ture, oxidized in flowing O2 (760 Torr) and reduced in flowing CO (760 Tort-) at 495C.
After this pretreatment,a mixture of He and CZHG was passed through the reactor,and the CzHs conversion was monitored as a function of time on stream. Reactivation was achieved by passing O2 through the cat- alyst at 495C for 3 h.
H2 evolution studies.
In this study, the amount of Cr(I1) in the reduced catalysts was determined by analyzing the amount of HZ evolved after oxidation of the reduced catalysts with water at 595C. The vapor pressure of water was 25 Tort-. The gas phase was sampled and analyzed for HZ by GC every 20 min until the HZ pressure was constant.
RESULTS
Catalytic studies.
Figure 1 shows the results obtained when C2H6 at a pressure of 100 Torr was recirculated over a reduced Cr/SiOZ catalyst at 495C.
No induction period was observed,even when an oxi- dized Cr/SiOZ catalyst was used.
The amount of each product increased continu- ously with reaction time.
All of the cata- lysts were deactivated before the gas phase reached the equilibrium conversion of 12 Tot-r of C2H4 at 495C. In general very good selectivities (>94%) were observed for the formation of ethylene.
No CH4 was ob- served when Cr/A1203 catalysts were used,but small amounts of CO and CH4 were ob- served when a-Cr,O,was the catalyst. Af- ter subtracting the amount of gases lost dur- ing the sampling,mass balances were found to be 100% for both hydrogen and carbon,including coke. The carbonaceous deposit on the surface was oxidized in O2 at 595C,forming CO2 in the gas phase.
Table 1 shows the effect of the support on the catalytic activity of chromium cata- lysts for ethane dehydrogenation,along with the BET surface areas and the amount of coke on a deactivated catalyst. The tum- over frequencies decreased in the order Cr/ A1203 (585C) > Cr/Si02 (885C) > a-Cr203 ;however,if one considers the errors in- volved in determining the number of sur- face chromium ions, it is probably not pos- sible to make a distinction between the activities of the three catalysts. No reaction was observed when a CrY zeolite was used.
The marked decrease in activity for the Cr/ A1203 sample between vacuum treatment at 585 and 885C may be the result of a trans- formation of the alumina from the -y-phase,which occurs at 850C.
The color of the deactivated catalysts re- mained light blue, and the amount of coke found was quite small.
For the Cr/SiOZ samples the coke required to poison the catalyst was only ca. one carbon atom per chromium atom. The infrared evidence (see below) indicates that this coke is selectively deposited on the active site. In order to de- termine whether the deactivation was in- deed a result of coke poisoning rather than thermal instability of a reduced form of Cr,two catalysts were heated under vacuum at 885C and reduced in CO at 345C for 1.5 h.
One of these catalysts was exposed to CzH6 at 495C and an initial rate of 76 pmole CzH4 min- g cat-i was observed. The other 158

Thus, a 25% decrease in ac- tivity resulted from the thermal treatment,which is much less than the decline in activ- ity observed during the catalytic reaction over the same period.
The effect of the dehydration tempera- ture on the catalytic activity is further de- scribed in Fig. 2 for a 0.5 wt% Cr/Si02 cata- lyst, reduced at 495C. A maximum in the initial rate was observed when the catalyst was heated in uucuo at 815C. The maxi- mum rate was 77.3 pmole C2H4 min- g cat-r.
Within experimental error the BET surface area was constant over this temper- ature range.
In order to determine the relationship be- tween catalytic activity and the oxidation state of the chromium ions on the surface,separate samples of 0.52 wt% Cr/SiOz were reduced in CO at 345C for different lengths of time. Then,100 Torr of C2Hs was recir- culated over the catalysts at 495C. The cat- alytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation increased with reduction times up to 30 min. For a sample reduced less than 1.5 h in CO small amounts of CO and CO* were ob- served during the reaction with CzH6,

The amount of CO and CO2 decreased with reduction time. In ad- dition, separate samples of 0.5 wt% Cr/Si02 were reduced in CO for 1.5 h at different temperatures.
Following reduction the tem- perature was raised to 495C and 100 Torr of C2H6 was recirculated over the reduced catalysts.
The catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation did not change apprecia- bly with reduction temperature over the range 350-500C.
The nuclear&y of chromium in the active site was evaluated by studying several Cr/ SiOz catalysts having different loadings of Cr. These catalysts were pretreated in the same manner before exposure to 100 Torr of C2H6 at 495C in the recirculation reac- tor. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which the initial rate is reported as a func- tion of Cr loading.
The activity increased linearly with respect to Cr loading up to 0.5 wt%, but at higher loadings the increase was nonlinear.
A similarly activated silica gel blank was also exposed to 100 Torr of C2H6 at 495C and no reaction was ob- served.
The rate of catalyst deactivation,the limit of deactivation,and the ability of the catalyst to recover the initial activity were studied in the flow reactor.
Ethane (100 Torr) diluted in He was passed over the cat- alysts at 495C and the activity was moni- tored for several hours. After this time, the catalyst was regenerated in flowing O2 and reduced in flowing
CO. Again,
CzH6 was passed over the catalysts at 495C. The results appear in Fig. 4, in which the per- centage conversion of C2Hs is reported for fresh and regenerated Cr/Si02 and Cr/A1203 catalysts.

did not experi- ence as rapid an initial decline in activity;however,after 12 h the activities of the three catalysts were approximately equal.
In an attempt to avoid the rapid deactiva- tion of the Cr/Si02 catalysts dehydrated at 885C, Hz0 or CO2 was added to the C2H6 feed. Water produced an even faster deacti- vation of the catalyst,while CO2 had no effect.
Using the Weisz-Prater criteria (13) it was shown that diffusion was not a limiting factor in the reaction rate. As an indication of the quality of the kinetic data it is also significant that the initial rates obtained from the recirculating reactor and from the flow reactor, obtained by extrapolating the curves in Fig. 4 to zero time,were very similar.
Rate law. The rate law for ethane dehy- drogenation on Cr/Si02 catalysts was eval- uated using the recirculation reactor and the initial rate method.
The pressure depen- dency,as well as apparent activation en- ergies, were determined using the following rate equation: Rate = kPE2H,.
(1) Here,k = A exp( -E,/RT) and E, is the apparent activation energy.
The kinetic parameters for ethane dehy- drogenation over the CrLSiO2 catalysts are summarized in Table
2. An average reac-
tion order of 0.69 + 0.05 was the same,within the experimental error, for both de- hydration temperatures.
The apparent acti- vation energy was also the same within ex- perimental error, with an average value of
27.5 kcal mole-.
Infrared studies.
Infrared spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the effect of the dehydration temperature on the surface state of the 0.52 wt% Cr/Si02 catalyst.
Samples were heated in UQCUO at 585 or at
885C. The samples were then oxidized
in 02 at 495C for 1 .O h, and reduced in CO for
1.5 h at the same temperature.
An infrared band present at 3745 cm-l due to surface silanol groups was considerably less in- tense for samples dehydrated at 885C than for those dehydrated at 585C.
Upon exposure to 40 Torr of CO at 25C for 0.5 h, both samples exhibited bands in the carbonyl stretching region.
For the sample dehydrated at 585C, only one band at 2190 cm- appeared as depicted in Fig. 5b, while for the sample dehydrated at

a triplet was easily observed at wavenumbers of 2192,2185,and 2182 cm-l as depicted in Fig. 5e. After evacuation for 3 min, the intensity of the 2192 and 2182 cm-i bands decreased by ca. half. For the sample dehydrated at 585C a clear shoul- der appeared beside the 2190 cm-i band as depicted in Fig. 5c, while for the sample dehydrated at 885C the band at 2185 cm- disappeared as depicted in Fig. 5e. All of the CO bands were removed by evacuation at 25C for periods of 1 to 5 h. For compari- son, the relative amplitude of the band at 2182 cm-l for the samples activated at 885 versus 585C was 3, whereas the ratio of activities (Table 1) for the same two sam- ples was 2.3.

The background infrared spectrum of the activated catalysts in the region 1600-2000 cm-i revealed two broad bands, at 1870 and 1645 cm-.
These absorptions,detected in previous studies,have been assigned to overtones and harmonics of the SiO stretching mode (24-16).
Exposure of a similarly activated silica gel blank to CO or
NO
at 25C resulted in an unperturbed background spectrum.
In an attempt to relate the infrared bands to the oxidation state of the chromium ions on the surface of the catalyst, a sample was dehydrated at 885C oxidized in 02 at 495C for 1.0 h, and reduced in CO at 345C rather than at 495C, for 1.5 h. Upon exposure to 40 Torr of CO, the infrared bands were the same as those shown in Fig. 5e, although less intense.
The effect of C2Hs and reaction products on the surface of Cr/SiOZ catalysts was de- termined by reducing in CO at 345C and then contacting with C2H6 at 495C for 5 min. Upon exposure to CO or NO, the in- frared bands increased in intensity with re- spect to the sample which was not con- tacted with C2H6, thus it is evident that ethane rapidly reduced any oxidized chro- mium to Cr(I1).
The infrared spectra of adsorbed CO also showed that the species responsible for the band at 2182 cm- was selectively poisoned during the deactivation of the catalyst.
A
Cr/SiOz catalyst, dehydrated at 885C was reduced in CO at 495C for 90 min and then exposed to C&H6 at 495C for 5 min. After exposure to 40 Tot-r of CO at 25C the bands at 2192, 2185, and 2182 cm-l were observed.
However,after the sample was exposed to C2H6 at 495C for 3 h to simulate a deactivated catalyst,and then exposed to CO, the intensity of the band at 2192 cm-i did not change, while the band at 2182 cm-l almost disappeared.
The nuclearity of chromium on the sur- face was studied by observing the effect of loading on the infrared spectra. A sample of

at 885C oxidized in O2 at 495C for 1.0 h,and reduced in CO at 495C for 1.5 h. Upon exposure to CO or NO, the infrared bands increased in intensity with increased load- ing, but the increase was not proportional to the amount of chromium for the 2.1 wt% sample.
The intensity of the band at 2182 cm-l is plotted as a function of loading in Fig. 3.
A sample of CrY zeolite was heated in uaco at 485C and exposed to CO at 495C for 1.5 h. No bands were observed in the hydroxyl stretching region. Upon exposure to CO, two weak bands appeared at 2169 and 2122 cm-.
Upon exposure to NO, two bands appeared at 1898 and 1722 cm-,each possessing shoulders at 1883 and 1747 cm-r,respectively.
These bands agreed well with those reported in a similar study by Pearce et al. (17). An attempt to obtain ir spectra of CO and NO on Cr/Al203 was not successful as the sample had very low transmittance in the region 4000-1600 cm-l.
H2 evolution.
Quantitative determina- tions of the amount of Cr(I1) formed during the reduction of a Cr/A1203 catalyst has been obtained by Slovetskaya et al. (18) us- ing the reaction 2CrO + HZ0 c Cr203 + HZ (2) for which the amount of Hz formed at 600C was measured.
We believe that this is a more accurate means of determining the amount of Cr(I1) than the usual technique whereby the amount of CO2 formed during the reduction of the catalyst with CO is measured.
Several samples of Cr/SiOz were reduced using different pretreatments and then ex- posed to water vapor at high temperatures.
The amount of H2 evolved during the oxida- tion step was measured.
The results appear in Table 3, in which the mole ratio (H&r) is reported for the several pretreatment conditions.
The ideal value for this mole ratio, assuming all the chromium in the cat- alyst is reduced to Cr(II),is 0.5 according to reaction (1). Based upon this stoichiome-

All of the 0.52 wt% sam- ples underwent considerable reduction,even with CO at 345C; however,the per- centage of Cr(II) in the 2.1 wt% sample was much less. Presumably this is a result of clustering of the chromium on the latter sample to a less reducible form such as Cr203.
DISCUSSION
Spectroscopic identification of species on CrlSiO;?. The characterization of the Cr/ SiOZ catalysts was accomplished primarily using infrared spectroscopy with carbon monoxide and nitric oxide as probe mole- cules. After adsorption of CO on a fully re- duced Cr/Si02 catalyst,three carbonyl bands at 2192, 2185, and 2182 cm-l were present in the infrared spectrum (Fig. 5) in agreement with the results of Garrone and co-workers (10-12).
The 2185 cm-i band was strongly pressure dependent,while both the higher and the lower frequency

163 components were more resistant to re- moval of adsorbed CO. In a previous study of chromium on silica, Zecchina ef al. (19) observed carbonyl bands at about the same wavenumbers as reported here. They as- signed these bands to the CO stretching mode of 1: 1 Cr-CO linear complexes.
Gar- rone and co-workers (20-12) have sug- gested that the frequency difference be- tween the Cr-CO complexes is the result of Cr in different coordination states: CrA, co- ordinated to 2 oxygen atoms, is responsible for the band at 2182 cm- and Cra, coordi- nated to 3 oxygen atoms, is responsible for the band at 2192 cm-i.
The band at 2185 cm- was attributed to CrA ions perturbed by a second CO molecule which is weakly adsorbed.
The dehydration temperature has a dra- matic effect on the types of species which are formed.
At a dehydration temperature of 885C both CrA and Cra were present, as indicated by the spectra in Fig. 5. At 585C Cr,was present in lower concentrations while the concentration of Cra remained es- sentially constant.
These results suggest that the hydroxyl population has a signifi- cant effect on the distribution of the Cr(I1) species.
An advantage of using NO rather than CO as a probe molecule is derived from the fact that at certain sites dinitrosyl species are formed (20) which give rise to pairs of infrared bands (1856 and 1745 cm-l for the sample degassed at 885C and 1865 and 1744 cm-i for the sample degassed at 585C). The presence of a dinitrosyl species leads one to conclude that at least two co- ordination sites are available on this type of chromium.
In addition,the single band at ca. 1807 cm-l is due to a mononitrosyl,which suggests one available coordination site. Ghiotti et al. (20), however, have pro- posed that even this Cr is capable of coordi- nating a second NO ligand at a sufficiently high pressure.
Nature of the active site. The catalytic activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalyst clearly was favored by more extensive reduction with
CO. Even when the catalyst was not com-
pletely reduced by CO, the C2H6 or the re- action products further reduced the sur- face. The results of Table 3 indicate that a very large fraction of the chromium on the
0.52 wt% sample may be reduced to Cr(II),
for example at 495C. Thus, the active oxi- dation state for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 is believed to be Cr(I1).
Several pieces of evidence suggest the need for a high degree of coordinative un- saturation in the active site. An increase in the initial rate of reaction was observed as the dehydration temperature of the Cr/Si02 catalysts was increased from 485 to 815C.
Temperatures greater than 815C produced a decrease in the initial rate, probably due to a gross change in the surface structure of the catalyst.
Over the temperature range from 585 to 885C the activation energy re- mained the same, which indicates that the number,but not the type, of sites changed.
With a similar Cr/SiOz catalyst a maximum activity following dehydroxylation at ca. 900C has previously been noted for ethyl- ene polymerization (9), which is a reaction requiring two or more coordination sites.
The infrared evidence demonstrated that upon increasing the dehydration tempera- ture (a) the number of hydroxyl groups on the silica decreased,(b) the concentration of CrA(II) species increased,and (c) the concentration of Cra(11) species remained constant.
From the infrared spectra of NO presented here and elsewhere (20) it is evi- dent that Cr(I1) has at least two and perhaps more available coordination sites. The ef- fect of increasing the dehydroxylation tem- perature may be to increase the number of open coordination sites by removing hy- droxyl groups,thereby producing more Cr*(II),which has at least three available coordination sites (20).
The nuclearity of chromium in the active site is also of interest.
The data of Fig. 3 show that the catalytic activity increased linearly up to a loading of 0.5 wt% Cr, but at higher loadings the increase was no longer linear.

interpreted in light of recent work on the state of the surface chromium and the large specific activity of a-chromia.
McDaniel (9) has recently shown that on Davison 952 sil- ica (280 m*/g) stabilized Cr(V1) reached a saturation coverage which was an inverse function of the calcination temperature.
In McDaniels experiments the silica was im- pregnated with CrOs to various loadings and then calcined in oxygen,which is a somewhat different treatment than was used for the catalysts reported here. Never- theless,at a calcination temperature of 870C he observed that Cr(V1) was stabi- lized up to an equivalent of 1 wt% Cr, and at higher loadings the Cr03 was converted to a-Cr203 as determined by X-ray diffrac- tion.
Based on these results and the data of Fig. 3 we conclude that up to a loading of
0.5% Cr(I1) ions of low nuclearity
are re- sponsible for the dehydrogenation activity,but at higher loadings both Cr*(II) ions and reduced chromium ions in an a-Cr203 phase contribute to the activity.
The a-Cr203 par- ticles tend to become rather large (several hundred Angstroms) (9);therefore,the fraction of surface chromium in this form would be small. a-Cr203 cr-Chromia has a corundum structure where the open circles represent oxygen at- oms and the closed circles represent chro- mium atoms. One may view the surface as being constructed of ordered pairs of chro- mium atoms which upon reduction to Cr(II) are responsible for the dehydrogenation ac- tivity.
It may be stretching the point,how- ever, to conclude that these are sites of low nuclearity.
Rather,it seems that the oxida- tion state and degree of coordinative unsat- uration are more important factors than nu- clearity in determining catalytic activity for this reaction.
As mentioned earlier, Konig and Tetenyi (4) have studied the dehydrogenation of ethane on o-Cr203, and have proposed co- ordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) ions as the active sites. They reported initial activities that are an order of magnitude smaller than those observed in this study for a-chromia with the same surface area and at the same reaction conditions.
This discrepancy may result from differences in the reducing gas: Konig and Tetenyi used H2 at 480C whereas CO at 495C was employed in this study. Burwell et al. (21) have noted that the reduction of bulk a-CT203 to G-0 is diffi- cult at temperatures below 5OOC, and it may well be that the low activity of Konig and Tetenyis sample may have resulted from a lower degree of reduction.
Effect of the support. As can be observed from Table 1, the catalytic activity for eth- ane dehydrogenation decreased in the order Cr/A1203 > Cr/SiO;? > a-Cr20,+ Cry. The activities of the Cr/A1203 and Cr/SiOz cata- lysts were surprisingly similar,which sug- gests that the active sites are essentially the same. Therefore,the support must not have a significant electronic effect on the chro- mium.
Ashmawy (2) has studied the dehydro- genation of ethane on Cr/A1203 and con- cluded that both Cr(I1) and Cr(II1) are ac- tive, although Cr(I1) seemed to be the most active ion. Again, Cr(II1) initially present on the catalyst may have been reduced to Cr(I1) by contact with ethane at 500C.
Van Reijen et al. (I) have explored the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane over Cr/ Si02 and Cr/A1203 catalysts and have re- ported an activation energy of 26 kcal/mole.
The reaction was first order in cyclohex- ane. These authors also noted poisoning ef- fects of H20 which they attributed to the oxidation of Cr(I1) to Cr(II1) according to reaction (1). The activity was attributed to Cr(I1) in a state of low coordination.

Wittgen et al. (22) concluded that the hy- drogenation of propylene over Cr/SiO2 oc- curred on Cr(II1) ions in a state of low coor- dination.
Their conclusion,however,was based largely on the effect of HZ in deacti- vating the catalyst, presumably by reducing chromium to Cr(I1).
This interpretation is not straightforward since reduction by Hz results in the formation of H20, which pro- motes the formation of Cr,O,.
Because of this complicating role of H20 most in- vestigators employ CO, rather than Hz,as a reducing gas when working with chro- mium.
When Cr(III)Y zeolite was used as the catalyst,negligible activity (Table 1) was observed for the dehydrogenation of ethane at 495C in the recirculating reactor. Based upon our model for the active site the inac- tivity of Cr(III)Y could result from a failure to reduce the Cr(II1) to Cr(I1) or from in- accessible Cr ions. Only [Crn1(N0)2]3+ com- plexes were observed by infrared spectros- copy, which is consistent with the fact that Cr(II1) in zeolite-Y is very difficult to re- duce to Cr(I1) (17). From X-ray diffraction experiments, Pearce and Mot-tier (23) have shown that the Cr(II1) cations in the dehy- drated CrY reside primarily at site I; how- ever, in order to form stable nitrosyl com- plexes upon NO addition,these cations migrate to accessible sites in the large cages (site II). Because of thermal disorder it is expected that at least part of the Cr ions would be available to interact with ethane at 495C. In a separate experiment La3+ ions were exchanged into a Y-zeolite before ion-exchange with Cr ions, in order to force the Cr(II1) ions to occupy sites near the su- percage. This sample, likewise,did not ex- hibit any activity for ethane dehydrogena- tion.
The accessibility of Cr ions is also demonstrated by the activity which these zeolites exhibit for the polymerization of ethylene at 50C (24). The evidence sug- gests, therefore, that the difficulty in reduc- ing Cr(II1) to Cr(II),rather than the lack of accessibility of Cr ions, is responsible for the inactivity of the CrY zeolites.
CONCLUSIONS
Reduced chromium ions on a well dehy- droxylated silica are active for the selective dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene,al- though the catalyst is rapidly poisoned by coking.
At low loadings the active site is believed to be a coordinatively unsaturated Cr(I1) ion, which is in a state of low nu- clearity.
The nuclearity may not be an im- portant factor, however, as indicated by the observation that the specific activity of (Y- CrZ03 was about the same as that of Cr/SiOz and Cr/AlZ03.
