[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "In particular, isobutane dehydrogenation is important because the traditional sources of isobutane; i.e., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are already heavily used, and the availability of isobutane has become a bottleneck in the expansion of the MTBE and ETBE market."
[3] "This paper is the first example of the use of experimental design for deriving quantitative structure-activity relationships in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
[4] "It will be shown that: 1 the dehydrogenation activity is proportional with the amount of in situ measured surface Cr, and . 3q maximum for a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O catalyst operating at 5008C in 2% isobutane in N; and 2 Cr-sites are more active in alkane dehydrogenation than Cr2q-sites."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in the realm of dehydrogenation processes. Their importance lies in converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes, a crucial step in the production of various chemicals and fuels. Isobutane dehydrogenation, in particular, is vital due to the saturation of traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, leading to a bottleneck in the expansion of markets for MTBE and ETBE.

2. The research focuses on understanding and characterizing the structure of chromium oxide catalysts, identifying the active sites involved in dehydrogenation reactions, and optimizing the properties of the support materials and promoters. The aim is to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts, thereby improving the yield and purity of the products.

3. The application of experimental design has opened new avenues in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This method enables researchers to systematically investigate the relationship between the structure of catalysts and their activity, providing insights into how specific conditions affect the performance of the catalysts.

4. The study reveals that the dehydrogenation activity is directly proportional to the amount of surface Cr measured in situ. The highest activity is achieved with a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O catalyst operating at 500°C in 2% isobutane in N. Additionally, Cr-sites are found to be more active in alkane dehydrogenation than Cr2q-sites.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的发展取得了显著进步，尤其是对于将低成本饱和烃转化为烯烃这一领域。异丁烷脱氢尤为重要，因为传统的异丁烷来源（如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解）已经大量使用，异丁烷的可用性已成为MTBE和ETBE市场扩张的瓶颈。

2. 研究重点在于理解并表征铬氧化物催化剂的结构、识别参与脱氢反应的活性位点，并优化支撑材料和促进剂的性能。目标是提高催化剂的效率和选择性，从而提升产品的产量和纯度。

3. 实验设计的应用为异质催化领域开辟了新途径。这种方法允许研究者系统地探究催化剂结构与活性之间的关系，提供有关特定条件如何影响催化剂性能的见解。

4. 研究表明，脱氢活性与原位测量的表面Cr量成正比。在7.5 wt.% CrrAl O催化剂下，以500°C和2%异丁烷在N中的条件下运行时，达到最高活性。此外，研究表明Cr位点在烷烃脱氢中的活性高于Cr2q位点。
