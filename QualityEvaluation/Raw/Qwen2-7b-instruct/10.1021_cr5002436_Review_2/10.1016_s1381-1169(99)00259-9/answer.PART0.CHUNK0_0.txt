[1] "Most characterization studies on supported chromium oxide catalysts describe the catalyst structure under conditions often far away from real catalytic ones."
[2] "The dehydrogenation activity is proportional with the amount of in situ measured surface Cr, and maximum for a 7.5 wt.% CrAl2O3 catalyst operating at 500°C in 2% isobutane in N2."
[3] "Cr-sites are more active in alkane dehydrogenation than Cr2q-sites."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were primarily used in industrial applications for dehydrogenation processes, such as converting saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes. Key areas of research focus have included understanding the catalyst structure, identifying the active sites responsible for the reactions, selecting appropriate support materials, and incorporating promoters to enhance performance. The reaction mechanisms have also been a critical focus, particularly in elucidating how the catalysts interact with reactants and products.

2. The dehydrogenation activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts is closely tied to the amount of surface chromium present in the material. Specifically, the highest activity is observed with a catalyst containing 7.5 wt.% chromium, aluminum oxide, and operated at 500°C with a 2% isobutane concentration in nitrogen. 

3. Chromium sites in the catalyst are more effective in alkane dehydrogenation reactions compared to chromium 2q-sites. This indicates that the type of chromium atom configuration significantly influences the catalytic efficiency.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。最初，它们主要应用于将饱和烃转化为烯烃的脱氢过程。研究的重点领域包括理解催化剂结构、确定催化反应的关键活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料以及引入促进剂以提高性能。反应机制的研究也非常重要，特别是要揭示催化剂与反应物和产物的相互作用方式。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性与其表面铬含量成正比。具体来说，在500°C条件下，使用含有7.5 wt.%铬、氧化铝的催化剂，并在氮气中以2%异丁烷浓度运行时，观察到最高活性。

3. 催化剂中的铬原子配置类型对烷烃脱氢反应的效率有显著影响。具体而言，铬位点比铬2q位点更有效。
