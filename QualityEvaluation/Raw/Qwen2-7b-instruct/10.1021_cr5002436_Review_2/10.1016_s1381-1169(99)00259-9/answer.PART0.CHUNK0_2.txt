[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "As a consequence, only a limited amount of information is known about the oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation site."
[3] "The used spectroscopic technique is UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which allows to monitor in situ Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr4+."
[4] "The developed method involves a three-pronged approach. In a first step, the number of required experiments was optimized by using an experimental design, and five factors were selected to describe the dehydrogenation process."
[5] "The results of such chemometrical analysis is shown in Table 3, and 11 model coefficients are obtained."
[6] "The IEP of the support seems to be a good measure to differentiate between the different support compositions."
[7] "Although in both experiments use has been made of two different supports; i.e., ZrO2 and TiO2, no significant differences were observed with a CrrSiO2PAl2O360 wt.% SiO2 catalyst,2 which has an identical IEP."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Despite progress, much remains unknown about the precise oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation sites.

2. The dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a notable industrial impact. The main focus is on elucidating the oxidation states and coordination environments of the active sites involved in the dehydrogenation process. Spectroscopic techniques, particularly UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, are employed to monitor these changes in situ.

3. A combination of in situ UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and on-line GC analysis was utilized to study the dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts. The experimental setup involved monitoring the surface Cr species in real-time.

4. A three-step experimental design was implemented to optimize the number of experiments required and to identify five key factors influencing the dehydrogenation process. These factors included reaction time and temperature, gas composition, support composition, and chromium loading.

5. Mathematical or statistical models were derived through a chemometric analysis to relate Cr-speciation and dehydrogenation activity with various parameters such as reaction conditions and catalyst properties. These models helped in predicting the optimal conditions for maximizing activity.

6. The isoelectric point (IEP) of the support material proved to be a reliable indicator for distinguishing between different support compositions. This finding suggests that the IEP could serve as a useful parameter for selecting appropriate support materials in chromium oxide catalysts.

7. Experiments utilizing two distinct support materials, ZrO2 and TiO2, showed no significant differences when compared to a CrrSiO2PAl2O3 catalyst with the same IEP. This indicates that the IEP is a consistent measure for characterizing support compositions, even when using different materials.
