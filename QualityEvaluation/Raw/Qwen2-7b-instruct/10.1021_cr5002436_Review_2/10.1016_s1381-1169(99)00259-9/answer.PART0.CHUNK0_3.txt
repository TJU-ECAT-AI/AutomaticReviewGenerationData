[1] "Most characterization studies on supported chromium oxide catalysts describe the catalyst structure under conditions often far away from real catalytic ones."
[2] "Therefore, research must be directed towards the catalytic characterization under in situ conditions."
[3] "It is important to stress that this technique has been successfully introduced in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design."
[4] "The goal of this paper is to explore its possibilities and limitations for studying heterogeneous catalysts."
[5] "In this work, a novel method has been developed for deriving quantitative structureactivity relationships by using the technique of experimental design."
[6] "The used spectroscopic technique is UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which allows to monitor in situ Cr, Cr and Cr."
[7] "In situ diffuse reflectance spectra were monitored between 200 and 800 nm as a function of time for each experiment of Table 2."
[8] "An example of a set of in situ diffuse reflectance spectra is given in Fig. 4 for experiment N01 and N06."
[9] "The first pure component spectrum is typical for Cr6q, whereas the second pure component spectrum is indicative for the presence of Cr."
[10] "The intensity profiles have been obtained by plotting the band intensities at 373 nm 1st pure component and 632 nm 2nd pure component as a function of time."
[11] "The Kubelka-Munk intensity of the band typical for reduced Cr3qr2q is located between 570 and 630 nm, its exact value depending on the support composition."
[12] "As a consequence, the KMCr values will deviate from linearity at higher Cr-loadings."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been evolving since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, identifying active sites, exploring suitable support materials, examining promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. This has significantly enhanced their utility in dehydrogenation processes.
2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts involve converting saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. They are vital in expanding the market for products like MTBE and ETBE, providing an alternative route to obtain alkenes when traditional methods are already heavily utilized.
