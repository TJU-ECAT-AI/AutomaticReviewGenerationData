          [1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals."
          [2] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."
          [3] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."
          [4] "In previous RS studies, chromium oxide catalysts were studied under hydrated and dehydrated conditions as a function of the support type and composition."
          [5] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."
          [6] "The extent of reduction of the surface chromium oxide species, reflected by the decrease in the Raman intensity of the CrO bonds, demonstrates that the polymeric surface chromium oxide species is more easily reducible than the monomeric chromium oxide species on the same support."

          Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, playing crucial roles in industrial processes such as the production of HDPE and LLDPE through the Phillips catalyst, and the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. These catalysts are pivotal in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. The molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, particularly under hydrated and dehydrated conditions, has attracted considerable interest in both industrial and academic research. In situ Raman spectroscopy has been utilized to study these catalysts under catalytic conditions, providing insights into their reactivity during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation. Studies have shown that the polymeric surface chromium oxide species is more easily reducible than the monomeric species on the same support, influencing the redox behavior of these catalysts. The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is significantly influenced by the specific support material, and can be assessed by monitoring the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著发展，在工业过程中发挥了关键作用，如通过菲利普斯催化剂生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），以及通过丁烷脱氢为丁烯。这些催化剂在化学工业中对于生产多种重要商品化学品至关重要。支持型铬氧化物的分子结构，特别是在水合和失水条件下，引起了工业界和学术界的广泛关注。原位拉曼光谱技术被用于在催化条件下研究这些催化剂，提供了关于它们在甲醇氧化和丁烷脱氢/氧化过程中的活性的信息。研究结果表明，同一支撑上的聚合表面铬氧化物种比单体物种更容易还原，影响这些催化剂的还原行为。支持铬氧化物的还原行为在很大程度上取决于特定支撑材料，并可通过监测反应温度下丁烷脱氢时Cr6+拉曼带的相对强度来进行评估。

          [1] "The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is strongly dependent on the specific support and can be evaluated by following the relative intensities of the Cr6+ RS bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "This subject has been recently reviewed by us and there is now a general consensus that different oxidation and coordination states of Cr (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can be present, which depend on the pretreatment, the Cr loading, and the support type and composition."
          [3] "We have demonstrated for the first time by Raman spectroscopy that two types of surface chromium oxide species are present on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species, which is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species, which is more easily reducible on the same support."
          [4] "The sequence in redox behavior of supported chromium oxide species is not directly related with the catalytic activity during methanol oxidation."

          The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is highly dependent on the specific support material and can be assessed by observing the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation. Recent reviews have established a common understanding that different oxidation and coordination states of chromium (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can exist, which are influenced by the pretreatment, chromium loading, and the type and composition of the support. Raman spectroscopy has enabled the identification of two distinct surface chromium oxide species on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species that is challenging to reduce and a polymeric species that is more readily reducible on the same support. It has been observed that the sequence of redox behavior among supported chromium oxide species does not directly correlate with their catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.

          支持型铬氧化物的还原行为高度依赖于特定的支撑材料，并可以通过观察反应温度下丁烷脱氢时Cr6+拉曼带的相对强度来进行评估。最近的综述已经建立了共识，即不同氧化和配合态的铬(Crn+，其中n=2, 3, 5, 和6)可以存在，这些状态受到预处理、铬负载以及支持类型和组成的控制。拉曼光谱技术允许识别在无机氧化物表面上存在的两种类型的铬氧化物种：一种是一次性物种，其还原难度大，另一种是更易在相同支持上还原的聚合物种。观察到支持铬氧化物物种的还原行为顺序与其在甲醇氧化期间的催化活性之间并没有直接关联。
