1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, playing crucial roles in industrial processes such as the production of HDPE and LLDPE via the Phillips catalyst and the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. Industrial and academic research has focused on understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, particularly under hydrated and dehydrated conditions. In situ Raman spectroscopy has been employed to study these catalysts under catalytic conditions, enabling insights into their reactivity during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation. It was found that the polymeric surface chromium oxide species is more easily reducible than the monomeric species on the same support, affecting the redox behavior of these catalysts.

2. The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides varies significantly based on the specific support material. This behavior can be assessed by monitoring the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation. The results indicate that the redox behavior is not directly correlated with the catalytic activity during methanol oxidation, highlighting the importance of considering both the support properties and the redox properties for effective catalysis.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，在工业过程中发挥了关键作用，如通过菲利普斯催化剂生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），以及通过丁烷脱氢为丁烯。工业界和学术界对支持型铬氧化物分子结构的研究兴趣浓厚，特别是在水合和失水条件下的研究。原位拉曼光谱技术被用于在催化条件下研究这些催化剂，提供了关于它们在甲醇氧化和丁烷脱氢/氧化过程中的活性的信息。研究结果表明，同一支撑上的聚合表面铬氧化物种比单体物种更容易还原，影响这些催化剂的还原行为。

2. 支持型铬氧化物的还原行为在很大程度上取决于特定支撑材料。可以通过监测反应温度下丁烷脱氢时Cr6+拉曼带相对强度的变化来评估这种行为。结果显示，还原行为与甲醇氧化期间的催化活性没有直接相关性，强调了考虑支撑特性和还原性质对于有效催化的重要性。
