Answer: Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly to play critical roles in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of commodity chemicals like HDPE, LLDPE, and in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the use of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for HDPE and LLDPE production and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for butane dehydrogenation. Research efforts have focused on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Notably, studies have shown that under hydrated conditions, the molecular structure of surface chromium oxide species is influenced by the support's isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC). However, when it comes to supported chromium oxide catalysts under reaction conditions, in situ Raman spectroscopy offers a valuable tool for studying the surface chemistry and redox behavior, revealing the presence of two types of surface chromium oxide species: a monomeric species that is harder to reduce and a polymeric species that is more easily reducible. The redox behavior of these species varies depending on the specific support, indicating that while it affects their reactivity, it does not necessarily correlate with catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在化学工业中发展显著，特别是在生产商品化学品如高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），以及丁烷脱氢化过程中的关键作用。这些催化剂的主要工业应用包括使用Cr/SiO2催化剂进行HDPE和LLDPE生产，以及使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂进行丁烷脱氢化。研究工作重点放在理解催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制上。值得注意的是，在水合条件下，表面铬氧化物物种的分子结构受到支持物等电点（IEP）或零电荷时的净pH值的影响。然而，对于反应条件下的支持铬氧化物催化剂，原位拉曼光谱技术提供了一种有价值的研究工具，揭示了表面铬氧化物物种的两种类型：一种是较难还原的单体物种，另一种是更容易还原的聚合物种。这些物种的还原行为依赖于特定的支持物，表明虽然它影响其反应性，但它与甲醇氧化期间的催化活性不一定相关。
