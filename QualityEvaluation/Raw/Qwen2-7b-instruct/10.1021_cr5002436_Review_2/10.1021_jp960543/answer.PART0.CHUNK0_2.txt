[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals."
[2] "These characterization studies revealed that under hydrated conditions the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is only determined by the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support."
[3] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."
[4] "The extent of reduction of surface chromium oxide species, reflected by the decrease in the Raman intensity of the CrO bonds, demonstrates that the polymeric surface chromium oxide species is more easily reducible than the monomeric chromium oxide species on the same support."
[5] "The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is strongly dependent on the specific support and can be evaluated by following the relative intensities of the Cr6+ RS bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, playing critical roles in the production of essential commodity chemicals in the chemical industry. Key industrial applications and research focus areas encompass the understanding of catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. This knowledge aids in optimizing catalyst performance for various processes.

2. The molecular structure of surface chromium oxide species on supported catalysts is influenced by factors such as the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support material. This highlights the importance of the support's properties in determining the catalyst's activity.

3. In situ Raman spectroscopy offers a valuable tool for characterizing supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions, providing insights into their reactivity during reactions like methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation.

4. The polymeric surface chromium oxide species is more easily reducible than the monomeric species on the same support, as indicated by the decrease in Raman intensity of CrO bonds. This finding underscores the influence of surface chemistry on catalyst reactivity.

5. The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is significantly influenced by the specific support material. Evaluating the relative intensities of Cr6+ Raman bands at different reaction temperatures helps in understanding the catalyst's reactivity and redox properties.
