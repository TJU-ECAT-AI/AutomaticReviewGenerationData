Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become pivotal in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) via the Phillips catalyst, and in the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. Key research focuses include elucidating the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, which can vary depending on the pretreatment, chromium loading, and support type and composition. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy provide insights into the molecular states of chromium oxide species, revealing the presence of different oxidation and coordination states of Cr, including Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6. Studies have also explored the extent of reduction of surface chromium oxides, which is found to be strongly dependent on the specific oxide support. For instance, the redox behavior sequence deduced from the reported Raman spectra indicates that the sequence is not directly related to the catalytic activity during methanol oxidation. This underscores the importance of the reduction and reoxidation properties of supported metal oxides in determining their effectiveness in gas phase catalysis.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，主要集中在理解其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制。它们在高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE）的生产过程中作为Phillips催化剂，以及在丁烷脱氢为丁烯中发挥了关键作用。研究重点包括对支持铬氧化物的分子结构进行阐明，这些结构依赖于预处理、铬负载、支持类型和组成。例如，Raman光谱技术提供了有关铬氧化物物种分子状态的见解，揭示了Cr的不同氧化和配合态，包括Crn+，其中n = 2, 3, 5, 和6。研究还探索了表面铬氧化物的还原程度，这被发现在很大程度上取决于特定的无机氧化物支持。例如，推导出的还原行为序列表明，该序列与甲醇氧化期间的催化活性无关。这强调了支持金属氧化物的还原和再氧化性质在决定其在气相催化中的有效性方面的重要性。
