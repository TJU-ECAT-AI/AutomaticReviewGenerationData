The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, with advancements focusing on their industrial applications and research areas. These include:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts are essential in the chemical industry for producing key commodity chemicals, notably as the Phillips catalyst for HDPE and LLDPE synthesis and for butane dehydrogenation to butene.
   
2. Research focus areas: Key areas of investigation involve the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) depending on pretreatment, chromium loading, and support composition. 

3. Redox behavior: The ability of supported chromium oxides to undergo redox reactions is largely determined by the specific support material. This can be assessed by monitoring the relative intensities of chromium(6+) Raman bands as the reaction temperature changes during processes like butane dehydrogenation.

4. Surface chemistry: Studies have revealed the presence of two types of surface chromium oxide species on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species that is hard to reduce and a polymeric species that is more easily reducible. These findings enrich our understanding of the surface chemistry and spectroscopy of chromium oxides.

5. Catalytic activity: The sequence of redox behavior among supported chromium oxide species does not directly correlate with their catalytic activity in methanol oxidation. This highlights the complexity of how these catalysts function in redox reactions.

These insights contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial processes involving gas-phase reactions.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展取得了显著进展，其工业应用和研究领域涵盖了以下几个关键方面：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂在化学工业中是生产重要商品化学品的关键，特别是在高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE）合成以及丁烷脱氢生成丁烯的过程中。

2. 研究重点区域：研究重点包括催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。铬可以以不同的氧化状态（Crn+，其中n=2, 3, 5和6）存在，这取决于预处理、铬负载以及支持类型和组成。

3. 还原行为：支持的铬氧化物进行还原反应的能力主要由特定的支持材料决定。可以通过监测反应温度变化时铬（6+）拉曼带相对强度来评估这一过程，尤其是在丁烷脱氢过程中。

4. 表面化学：研究表明，在无机氧化物上存在两种类型的表面铬氧化物种：一种是难以还原的单体物种，另一种是在同一支持材料上更易于还原的聚合物种。这些发现丰富了我们对铬氧化物表面化学和光谱学的理解。

5. 催化活性：支持的铬氧化物的还原行为序列与它们在甲醇氧化过程中的催化活性之间没有直接关系。这强调了这些催化剂在氧化还原反应中复杂的功能特性。

这些见解推动了对涉及气体反应的工业过程中更高效和选择性催化剂的发展。

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become pivotal in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) via the Phillips catalyst, and in the dehydrogenation of butane to butene. Key research focuses include elucidating the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, which can vary depending on the pretreatment, chromium loading, and support type and composition. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy provide insights into the molecular states of chromium oxide species, revealing the presence of different oxidation and coordination states of Cr, including Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6. Studies have also explored the extent of reduction of surface chromium oxides, which is found to be strongly dependent on the specific oxide support. For instance, the redox behavior sequence deduced from the reported Raman spectra indicates that the sequence is not directly related to the catalytic activity during methanol oxidation. This underscores the importance of the reduction and reoxidation properties of supported metal oxides in determining their effectiveness in gas phase catalysis.

Answer: Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly to play critical roles in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of commodity chemicals like HDPE, LLDPE, and in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the use of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for HDPE and LLDPE production and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for butane dehydrogenation. Research efforts have focused on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Notably, studies have shown that under hydrated conditions, the molecular structure of surface chromium oxide species is influenced by the support's isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC). However, when it comes to supported chromium oxide catalysts under reaction conditions, in situ Raman spectroscopy offers a valuable tool for studying the surface chemistry and redox behavior, revealing the presence of two types of surface chromium oxide species: a monomeric species that is harder to reduce and a polymeric species that is more easily reducible. The redox behavior of these species varies depending on the specific support, indicating that while it affects their reactivity, it does not necessarily correlate with catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.
