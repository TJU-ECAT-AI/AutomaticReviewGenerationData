[1] "Two series of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, prepared using two different methods of colloidization of the initial phase and with variable chromium contents (CrZrP-Xa and CrZrP-Xb) have been tested in the oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure."
[2] "In both series of catalysts, the initial activity increases with the chromium content, but generally CrZrP-Xb catalysts are more active than those of series CrZrP-Xa, which is in good agreement with their higher chromium contents and greater dispersions."
[3] "When the reactions were carried out under oxidative conditions at 673 K, the activities were enhanced and the observed deactivation was minimum."
[4] "The activities found vary between 0.47 and 1.31 μmol of propene g-1 s-1 and are maintained after 200 min of reaction."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes usually produces a considerable amount of carbon oxides because of the low selectivity of the catalysts employed."
[6] "In pillared solids, the metal oxides maintain the layers apart and enable the accessibility of reactants to the internal surface where they can react on the active sites to produce the catalytic reaction."
[7] "The goal of this work is to study the performance of two sets of catalysts based on chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, prepared by two colloidal methods, in the dehydrogenation of propane in inert and oxidative conditions."
[8] "The oxidation state of chromium after reaction was (III) in all cases. XPS spectra of spent chromia-pillared catalysts show a Cr 3p3/2 peak centered at 577.1 eV, close to the values reported for chromia (576.6-576.9 eV)."
[9] "The dependence of activity at steady state in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane reaction on the ICr/IZr intensity ratio (from XPS) for both series of catalysts."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their application to dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propene, butene, butadiene, isobutene, and isoprene from light alkanes. Research focuses on improving catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, and optimizing promoters. Mechanisms involve activation of reactive molecules and electron transfer processes for oxidative reactions.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts show increased activity in dehydrogenation processes with higher chromium content, as indicated by the enhanced initial activity of catalysts in series CrZrP-Xb compared to CrZrP-Xa. This is attributed to better dispersion of chromium and greater surface area, facilitating more active sites.

3. Under oxidative conditions, the activity of chromium oxide catalysts is enhanced, with minimal deactivation. This contrasts with nonoxidative conditions, where deactivation is more pronounced due to coke formation, affecting the catalyst's textural properties.

4. Activities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane range from 0.47 to 1.31 μmol of propene per gram per second, maintaining stability over 200 minutes of reaction.

5. Catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions typically struggle with low selectivity for desired products, leading to the formation of undesired byproducts like carbon oxides.

6. Pillared solid catalysts utilize metal oxides to maintain layer spacing, enabling reactants to access the internal surface and active sites for catalytic reactions.

7. The study aims to evaluate the performance of chromium oxide-pillared α-zirconium phosphate catalysts in dehydrogenating propane under both inert and oxidative conditions, correlating activity with chromium content, dispersion, acidity, and textural properties.

8. The oxidation state of chromium after reaction is consistently III, as confirmed by XPS analysis of spent catalysts. The Cr 3p3/2 peak's intensity correlates with the catalyst's ODH activity.

9. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the ICr/IZr intensity ratio, as determined by XPS, suggesting a critical role for the chromium-to-zirconium ratio in determining catalytic efficiency.

1. 自1933年发现以来，含铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的应用和研究取得了显著进展，尤其是在生产丙烯、丁烯、丁二烯、异丁烯和异戊烯等产品方面。研究重点包括催化剂结构改进、活性位点识别、支撑材料选择和促进剂优化。反应机制涉及活性分子激活和电子转移过程，特别是氧化性反应。

2. 随着铬含量的增加，含铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中表现出增强的初始活性，系列CrZrP-Xb催化剂的活性通常高于CrZrP-Xa系列，这与它们更高的铬含量和更大的分散度一致。这归因于更好的铬分散和更大的表面积，有利于更多活性位点的存在。
