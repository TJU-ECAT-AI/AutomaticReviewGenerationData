[1] "The presence of chromia in the interlayer region gives rise to the formation of porous materials with high surface areas in which the active phase is well dispersed as nanoparticles between the layers of α-zirconium phosphate."
[2] "That confers to this catalyst a very high activity in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane."
[3] "The initial activity in the DH of propane increases with the chromium content, but it decays due to the deposited carbon which covers the active sites of the catalysts which modify their textural parameters."
[4] "In oxidative conditions, the deactivation process is absent and the activities are comparable to that obtained in other catalytic systems but the performance temperature is very low, only 673 K."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved from their initial discovery in 1933 to become significant in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to form porous materials with high surface areas, allowing for the dispersion of active nanoparticles. These catalysts are particularly effective in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The key industrial applications and research focus areas contributing to their significance include the structure of the catalysts, the identification of active sites within the materials, the selection of suitable support materials, the incorporation of promoters to enhance performance, and the exploration of reaction mechanisms that optimize the dehydrogenation processes.
3. The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts plays a crucial role in their effectiveness, with the dispersion of active phase nanoparticles in the interlayer region of α-zirconium phosphate contributing to their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions. This dispersion allows for efficient contact between the active sites and reactants.
4. The inclusion of chromium content in the catalyst formulation impacts its activity, with higher chromium content generally correlating with increased initial activity. However, this activity is subject to deactivation due to carbon deposition, which modifies the textural parameters of the catalysts. In oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, the deactivation process is absent, maintaining the activity at comparable levels to other catalytic systems but at a lower performance temperature of 673 K.

1. 自1933年发现以来，含铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的作用已显著增强，得益于它们能够在α-锆磷酸盐层间形成具有高表面积的多孔材料，并将活性颗粒分散为纳米粒子。这些催化剂特别适用于丙烷的脱氢和氧化脱氢。
2. 该领域的关键工业应用和研究焦点包括催化剂结构、材料中活性位点的识别、适宜支撑材料的选择、促进剂的引入以提高性能以及探索优化脱氢过程的反应机制。
3. 催化剂的结构对其有效性至关重要，α-锆磷酸盐层间分散的活性相颗粒有助于其在脱氢反应中的高效性。这种分散允许活性位点与反应物之间有效接触。
4. 催化剂中铬含量的增加通常与更高的初始活性相关联。然而，活性会因碳沉积而减弱，这修改了催化剂的纹理参数。在氧化脱氢条件下，不会发生脱活过程，保持与其它催化系统的活动水平相当，但工作温度较低，仅为673 K。
