The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has led to significant advancements in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propene, butene, butadiene, isobutene, and isoprene. Research focuses on understanding the structure of catalysts, identifying the active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, optimizing promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts are used in both nonoxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. They are known for their ability to enhance the activity and selectivity in these processes. Chromium oxide systems offer an alternative to traditional supported chromia catalysts, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation, due to their lower operating temperatures and improved selectivity towards desired products. The presence of chromium in the interlayer region of these materials contributes to the formation of porous structures with high surface areas, which facilitates the dispersion of the active phase as nanoparticles between the layers of zirconium phosphate. This confers the catalysts with high activity in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane. However, the presence of coke modifies the textural parameters of the catalysts during deactivation in nonoxidative conditions. In contrast, oxidative conditions prevent deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their activity. The use of potassium-exchanged catalysts demonstrates that basic surfaces facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby increasing the selectivity to propene during oxidative dehydrogenation.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在脱氢过程方面取得了显著进展。关键的工业应用包括丙烯、丁烯、丁二烯、异丁烯和异戊二烯的生产。研究重点包括理解催化剂的结构，识别活性位点，选择合适的支撑材料，优化促进剂，以及阐明反应机制。铬氧化物催化剂被用于烷烃的非氧化性和氧化性脱氢。它们以其在这些过程中增强的活性和选择性而闻名。铬氧化物系统为传统支持铬氧化物催化剂提供了一个替代方案，尤其是在氧化性脱氢中，由于其较低的操作温度和对目标产物的改进选择性。这些材料中的铬的存在导致形成具有高比表面积的多孔结构，这促进了活性相在锆磷酸盐层间的纳米颗粒分散。这赋予了催化剂在丙烷的脱氢和氧化性脱氢反应中的高活性。然而，在非氧化条件下，沉积的焦炭会修改催化剂的纹理参数并导致失活。相比之下，在氧化条件下，失活不会发生，允许催化剂保持其活性。通过钾交换催化剂表明，基本表面促进烯烃的脱附，从而增加氧化性脱氢过程中丙烯的选择性。

[1] "The presence of chromia in the interlayer region gives rise to the formation of porous materials with high surface areas in which the active phase is well dispersed as nanoparticles between the layers of α-zirconium phosphate."
[2] "That confers to this catalyst a very high activity in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane."
[3] "The initial activity in the DH of propane increases with the chromium content, but it decays due to the deposited carbon which covers the active sites of the catalysts which modify their textural parameters."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved from their initial discovery in 1933 to become significant in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to form porous materials with high surface areas, allowing for the dispersion of active nanoparticles. These catalysts are particularly effective in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The key industrial applications and research focus areas contributing to their significance include the structure of the catalysts, the identification of active sites within the materials, the selection of suitable support materials, the incorporation of promoters to enhance performance, and the exploration of reaction mechanisms that optimize the dehydrogenation processes.
3. The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts plays a crucial role in their effectiveness, with the dispersion of active phase nanoparticles in the interlayer region of α-zirconium phosphate contributing to their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions. This dispersion allows for efficient contact between the active sites and reactants.
4. The inclusion of chromium content in the catalyst formulation impacts its activity, with higher chromium content generally correlating with increased initial activity. However, this activity is subject to deactivation due to carbon deposition, which modifies the textural parameters of the catalysts. In oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, the deactivation process is absent, maintaining the activity at comparable levels to other catalytic systems but at a lower performance temperature of 673 K.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their application to dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propene, butene, butadiene, isobutene, and isoprene from light alkanes. Research focuses on improving catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, and optimizing promoters. Mechanisms involve activation of reactive molecules and electron transfer processes for oxidative reactions.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts show increased activity in dehydrogenation processes with higher chromium content, as indicated by the enhanced initial activity of catalysts in series CrZrP-Xb compared to CrZrP-Xa. This is attributed to better dispersion of chromium and greater surface area, facilitating more active sites.

3. Under oxidative conditions, the activity of chromium oxide catalysts is enhanced, with minimal deactivation. This contrasts with nonoxidative conditions, where deactivation is more pronounced due to coke formation, affecting the catalyst's textural properties.

4. Activities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane range from 0.47 to 1.31 μmol of propene per gram per second, maintaining stability over 200 minutes of reaction.

5. Catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions typically struggle with low selectivity for desired products, leading to the formation of undesired byproducts like carbon oxides.

6. Pillared solid catalysts utilize metal oxides to maintain layer spacing, enabling reactants to access the internal surface and active sites for catalytic reactions.

7. The study aims to evaluate the performance of chromium oxide-pillared α-zirconium phosphate catalysts in dehydrogenating propane under both inert and oxidative conditions, correlating activity with chromium content, dispersion, acidity, and textural properties.

8. The oxidation state of chromium after reaction is consistently III, as confirmed by XPS analysis of spent catalysts. The Cr 3p3/2 peak's intensity correlates with the catalyst's ODH activity.

9. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the ICr/IZr intensity ratio, as determined by XPS, suggesting a critical role for the chromium-to-zirconium ratio in determining catalytic efficiency.
