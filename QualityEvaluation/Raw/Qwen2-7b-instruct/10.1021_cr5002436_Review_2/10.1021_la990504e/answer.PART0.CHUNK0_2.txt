[1] "Two series of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, prepared using two different methods of colloidization of the initial phase and with variable chromium contents (CrZrP-Xa and CrZrP-Xb) have been tested in the oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure."
[2] "In all cases, deactivation was detected due to coke formed from undesired reactions."
[3] "When the reactions were carried out under oxidative conditions at 673 K, the activities were enhanced and the observed deactivation was minimum."
[4] "The activities found vary between 0.47 and 1.31 μmol of propene g-1 s-1 and are maintained after 200 min of reaction."
[5] "These results suggest that the chemical ambient created by chromia pillars is appropriate to carry out this reaction."
[6] "Chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate materials show activity values for the ODH of propane similar to or higher than other catalysts reported in the literature, but working at lower temperatures."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has led to significant advancements in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of propene, butene, butadiene, isobutene, and isoprene. Research focuses on understanding the structure of catalysts, identifying the active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, optimizing promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts are used in both nonoxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. They are known for their ability to enhance the activity and selectivity in these processes. Chromium oxide systems offer an alternative to traditional supported chromia catalysts, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation, due to their lower operating temperatures and improved selectivity towards desired products. The presence of chromium in the interlayer region of these materials contributes to the formation of porous structures with high surface areas, which facilitates the dispersion of the active phase as nanoparticles between the layers of zirconium phosphate. This confers the catalysts with high activity in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane. However, the presence of coke modifies the textural parameters of the catalysts during deactivation in nonoxidative conditions. In contrast, oxidative conditions prevent deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their activity. The use of potassium-exchanged catalysts demonstrates that basic surfaces facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby increasing the selectivity to propene during oxidative dehydrogenation.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在脱氢过程方面取得了显著进展。关键的工业应用包括丙烯、丁烯、丁二烯、异丁烯和异戊二烯的生产。研究重点包括理解催化剂的结构，识别活性位点，选择合适的支撑材料，优化促进剂，以及阐明反应机制。铬氧化物催化剂被用于烷烃的非氧化性和氧化性脱氢。它们以其在这些过程中增强的活性和选择性而闻名。铬氧化物系统为传统支持铬氧化物催化剂提供了一个替代方案，尤其是在氧化性脱氢中，由于其较低的操作温度和对目标产物的改进选择性。这些材料中的铬的存在导致形成具有高比表面积的多孔结构，这促进了活性相在锆磷酸盐层间的纳米颗粒分散。这赋予了催化剂在丙烷的脱氢和氧化性脱氢反应中的高活性。然而，在非氧化条件下，沉积的焦炭会修改催化剂的纹理参数并导致失活。相比之下，在氧化条件下，失活不会发生，允许催化剂保持其活性。通过钾交换催化剂表明，基本表面促进烯烃的脱附，从而增加氧化性脱氢过程中丙烯的选择性。
