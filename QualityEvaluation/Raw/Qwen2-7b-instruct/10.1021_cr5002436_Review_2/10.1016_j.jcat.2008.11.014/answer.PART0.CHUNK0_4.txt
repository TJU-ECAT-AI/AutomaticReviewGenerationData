[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much atten- tion in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."
[2] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, considerable research has been done to gain a deep fundamental knowledge on the structurereactivity relationships of Cr catalysts in dehydrogenation of alkanes by various characteriza- tion techniques [918] and to improve catalytic performance."
[4] "In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."
[5] "Remarkably, γ -Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."
[6] "For instance, studies on Cr ZrO2 catalysts with a Cr content of 0.05 to 0.8 wt% showed that mononuclear Cr(III) species are the active sites [31]."
[7] "It was concluded that coordinatively unsaturated clustered Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites play an important role in the activation of alkanes while crys- talline α-Cr2O3 are rather inert [9,10,12]."
[8] "On the other hand, a study on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) with CO2 over Cr/H- ZSM-5 concludes that a redox cycle between Cr+6 and Cr+3 is important for a high dehydrogenation rate [22]."

1. Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is a technology that has gained significant interest due to its potential to compensate for the shortage of propylene supply. However, challenges like cracking and coking impact product selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the structure-reactivity relationships of chromium catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation processes and to enhance catalytic efficiency.

3. In Cr catalysts for DHP, oligomeric species are found to be more active and selective compared to isolated species.

4. γ-Al2O3 supports predominantly host oligomers with varying degrees of aggregation and a portion of isolated species, without any Cr2O3 particles.

5. Studies on Cr-ZrO2 catalysts with a Cr content ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 wt% indicated that mononuclear Cr(III) species are the active sites.

6. It was concluded that unsaturated clusters of Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites are crucial for alkane activation, while crystalline α-Cr2O3 tends to be less reactive.

7. A redox cycle between Cr+6 and Cr+3 is essential for achieving a high dehydrogenation rate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) using Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

1. 烷烃脱氢（DHP）技术因其能弥补丙烯供应短缺的潜力而受到了近年来的广泛关注。然而，裂解和结焦等挑战影响了产品的选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 对于烷烃脱氢反应中铬催化剂的结构活性关系以及提高催化性能的研究已经进行了大量研究。

3. 在DHP中，多聚态的铬物种比孤立物种更具有活性和选择性。

4. γ-Al2O3主要包含不同聚合度的多聚体以及一部分孤立物种，但不含Cr2O3颗粒。

5. 对于Cr-ZrO2催化剂，其Cr含量在0.05到0.8 wt%之间时，发现单核Cr(III)物种是活性位点。

6. 结构上未饱和的Cr(III)簇和/或Cr(II)簇对于烷烃激活至关重要，而结晶α-Cr2O3则相对不活跃。

7. 在使用Cr/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行乙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHE）时，Cr+6与Cr+3之间的还原氧化循环对于实现高脱氢速率至关重要。
