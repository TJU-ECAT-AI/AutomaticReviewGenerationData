• "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."

• "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad * of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene [6,7]."

• "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K [8]."

• "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the de-activated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

• "As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [2330]."

• "It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable [2330]."

• "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."

• "To this end, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports were employed. On high surface area mesoporous SBA-15, it was expected that highly dispersed and completely accessible isolated Cr species can be created."

• "The structure and catalytic properties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on γ-Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and is also known to contain well defined Cr site distribution depending on the Cr content [26,27,30]."

• "In situ XANES studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

• "Remarkably, among xCrSBA-15, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

• "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

• "For instance, studies on Cr ZrO2 catalysts with a Cr content of 0.05 to 0.8 wt% showed that mononuclear Cr(III) species are the active sites [31]."

• "In a different study, La doped CrAl2O3 and CrZrO2 catalysts monitored during DHP simultaneously by in situEPR andUV/vis coupled with online GC showed that in both the catalysts the oxidation state of Cr is not higher than (III) however, coordination state of Cr species was not discussed [11]."

• "On the other hand, a study on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) with CO2 over Cr/H- ZSM-5 concludes that a redox cycle between Cr+6 and Cr+3 is important for a high dehydrogenation rate [22]."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in their industrial applications and research focus areas. Key areas of interest include:

1. **Industrial Applications**: Chromium oxide catalysts are widely utilized in the production of propylene through dehydrogenation processes, notably in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus), which operates at 850 K in a cyclic mode of reaction and regeneration. They are crucial in petrochemical industries for producing polypropylene.

2. **Challenges and Opportunities**: Challenges like cracking and coking significantly affect the product selectivity and catalyst stability. The process requires frequent regeneration without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, making it complex and costly.

3. **Dependence on Support and Activation**: The distribution of chromium species in these catalysts is greatly influenced by the nature of the support material, chromium content, and the activation method. 

4. **Increasing Activity with Cr Loading**: As chromium loading increases, the activity of the catalysts generally increases, reflecting the importance of homogeneous distribution of chromium species in achieving optimal performance.

5. **Focused Research**: Studies aim to create well-defined chromium site distributions in catalysts, using materials like SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3, to enhance the catalytic function of each specific chromium species.

6. **Comparison Across Supports**: Comparisons are made between catalysts supported on SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 to understand how the molecular structure of the support affects the distribution and function of chromium species.

7. **In Situ Analysis**: In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) studies reveal that chromium species are generated on-site during the reaction, and their oxidation state typically shifts to (III).

8. **Activity and Selectivity**: Catalysts with exclusively isolated chromium species at 1 wt% show higher activity and selectivity compared to those dominated by crystalline chromium oxide particles at 5 wt%.

9. **Role of Oligomeric Species**: Oligomeric chromium species are found to be more active and selective than isolated chromium sites in catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3.

10. **Active Site Composition**: Mononuclear chromium(III) species are identified as active sites in some chromium oxide catalysts. The coordination state of chromium species is a critical factor influencing catalytic performance.

11. **Redox Cycles**: Studies on chromium catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes highlight the importance of redox cycles in achieving high rates of reaction, indicating dynamic changes in the oxidation state of chromium.

These advancements in understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms have significantly contributed to the significance of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes and related fields.
