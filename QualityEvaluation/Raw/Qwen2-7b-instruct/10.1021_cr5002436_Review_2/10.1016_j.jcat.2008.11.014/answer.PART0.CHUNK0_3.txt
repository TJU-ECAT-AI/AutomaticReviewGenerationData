• "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much atten- tion in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."
• "Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity,indicating the important role of the species in the reaction."
• "Remarkably, γ -Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."
• "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."
• "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."
• "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains merely isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination whereas γ -Al2O3 contains, besides isolated sites, a fraction of oligomers (including dimers)."
• "At 5 wt% Cr, besides a fraction of monomers, crystalline α- Cr2O3 particles are mainly formed on SBA-15 while, remark- ably such crystals are not formed rather oligomers with differ- ent degrees of nuclearity are mainly formed on γ -Al2O3."
• "In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS."
• "The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species (isolated or oligomers) depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized as evidenced by the catalytic results."
• "In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination num- ber greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."
• "In contrast,oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than iso- lated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in industrial applications, research focus areas, and improvements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include propylene production through dehydrogenation processes. Research efforts have focused on optimizing the structure of these catalysts, identifying and characterizing active sites, utilizing various support materials, incorporating promoters to enhance activity and stability, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The document highlights the importance of the nature of chromium species (isolated, oligomers, or crystalline Cr2O3 particles) in determining the catalytic activity, with findings suggesting that isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four in xCrSBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species in xCrAl2O3. The role of support materials in influencing the dispersion and stability of chromium species is also emphasized. The document further discusses the impact of regeneration processes on the structural changes of Cr species, with oligomeric species being more sensitive to such changes compared to crystalline Cr2O3 particles. Overall, the study provides insights into the structure-function relationship of chromium catalysts, guiding future developments in designing more efficient dehydrogenation catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展受到了工业应用、研究重点领域的推动，包括结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制的理解。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢过程生产丙烯。研究工作集中在优化催化剂结构、识别和表征活性位点、使用各种支撑材料、引入促进剂以提高活性和稳定性、以及阐明反应机制。文档强调了在xCrSBA-15中，与结晶Cr2O3表面的Cr位点相比，具有协调数大于四的孤立Cr(III)位点在脱氢过程中更为活跃、选择性和稳定。相反，在xCrAl2O3中，多聚铬物种比孤立铬物种更活跃、更具选择性。支撑材料对铬物种的分散性和稳定性的影响也得到了强调。文档进一步讨论了再生过程对Cr物种结构变化的影响，多聚物种对这些变化的敏感性高于结晶Cr2O3颗粒。总体而言，这项研究提供了有关铬催化剂结构功能关系的见解，指导未来设计更高效的脱氢催化剂。
