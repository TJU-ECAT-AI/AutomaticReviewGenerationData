[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much atten- tion in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."

[2] "The structure of Cr species in the catalysts is further inves- tigated by XAS which provides information not only on the oxida- tion and coordination state (XANES) of the Cr species but also on the degree of clustering (EXAFS) [36]."

[3] "XRD patterns of the catalysts are compared in Fig. 3. Catalysts 5CrSBA-15 and 10CrSBA-15 show XRD reflections at 2θ of 24.6,"
"33.2, 36.2, 41.6, 50.3, 54.9, 63.5, 65.15, 73.05and 76.87 which are characteristic for crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase [36,47,48]."

[4] "In general,conversion of C3H8 increased with Cr content from 0.5 to 5 wt%. In particular, 0.5CrSBA-15, which contains exclusively isolated Cr species in Td coordination as evidenced by the Raman spectrum (Fig. 5a), shows reasonable C3H8 conversion and it gradually decreases with time, indicating the involvement of the isolated Cr species in DHP."

[5] "In contrast, it was concluded that coordinatively unsaturated clustered Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites play an important role in the activation of alkanes while crys- talline α-Cr2O3 are rather inert [9,10,12]."

1. Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is a key technology for propylene production, addressing shortages in propylene supply compared to conventional cracking methods.

2. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, including XANES and EXAFS, provide insights into the oxidation state, coordination environment, and clustering of chromium species in the catalyst.

3. XRD patterns reveal that catalysts containing 5CrSBA-15 and 10CrSBA-15 display reflections characteristic of crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Chromium content affects the conversion of propane; specifically, catalysts with 0.5CrSBA-15, which have isolated chromium species in tetrahedral coordination, exhibit reasonable conversion that diminishes over time.

5. Clustered Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites are considered crucial for alkane activation, while crystalline α-Cr2O3 is less reactive.

1. 丙烷脱氢（DHP）是丙烯生产的关键技术，用于解决丙烯供应短缺的问题，与传统的裂解方法相比。

2. X射线吸收光谱（XAS）技术，包括XANES和EXAFS，提供了催化剂中铬物种的氧化状态、配位环境以及团簇的信息。

3. X射线衍射图案显示，含有5CrSBA-15和10CrSBA-15的催化剂显示出结晶α-Cr2O3特征性的θ角反射。

4. 铬含量影响丙烷的转化率；具体而言，含有0.5CrSBA-15的催化剂，其具有四面体配位的孤立铬物种，表现出合理的转化率，随着时间的推移逐渐降低。

5. 分散的Cr(III)和/或Cr(II)簇对于烷烃活化至关重要，而结晶α-Cr2O3则活性较低。
